What are some treatment goals for a patient with bipolar disorder experiencing moderate depression?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment goals for a patient with bipolar disorder experiencing moderate depression. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic confirmation and risk/setting decisions. Then, I should define acute symptomatic targets and safety thresholds. Next, I will select evidence-based pharmacologic strategies with dosing and monitoring specifics while avoiding affective switching. After that, I need to integrate psychoeducation and structured psychotherapy. Then, I will set functional and quality-of-life targets. Finally, I should outline maintenance and recurrence prevention with individualized adjustments and a feedback loop for treatment resistance, making sure I cross-check each step against current guidelines and key trials before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis carefully and not jump to conclusions, since up to roughly 60% of patients presenting with depression may initially be misdiagnosed as unipolar if a bipolar history is not elicited; I need to check for prior mania or hypomania, antidepressant-induced activation, family history of bipolar disorder, and atypical depressive features, and I should document a baseline severity with validated scales while assessing suicide risk and mixed features to determine the appropriate treatment setting and urgency of intervention [^112wqq9D] [^11538XJY] [^113Ehed7] [^112wqq9D].

> I will now specify acute treatment goals to anchor decisions: achieve at least a 50% reduction in depressive symptoms within 6–8 weeks and aim for syndromal remission by a threshold such as MADRS ≤ 12 while concurrently targeting core symptoms like anhedonia, sleep disruption, and cognitive inefficiency; I should also monitor for mixed features and mania emergence using YMRS alongside depressive scales and document suicidality resolution as a non-negotiable safety endpoint, because residual symptoms strongly predict earlier recurrence and poorer functioning [^113YzVTW] [^117JeSRQ] [^113VjmS9].

> Next, I should review first-line pharmacotherapy choices for moderate bipolar depression; wait, let me verify that I am aligning with the most current guidance: AAFP 2021 supports quetiapine or cariprazine monotherapy, and lurasidone in combination with lithium or valproate for acute bipolar depression, whereas VA/DoD 2023 finds insufficient evidence for or against antidepressant augmentation broadly and advises caution, so I should avoid antidepressant monotherapy and only consider adjunctive antidepressants after optimizing a mood stabilizer or second-generation antipsychotic in select cases with careful monitoring [^117HSYZq] [^117HSYZq] [^116t5KN3].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of lamotrigine in the acute phase; my first impulse is to list lamotrigine among acute first-line agents for bipolar depression, but the VA/DoD 2023 guideline indicates insufficient evidence to recommend for or against lamotrigine monotherapy acutely, so I will position lamotrigine as a reasonable option particularly in depression-predominant courses or for maintenance planning rather than as a default acute monotherapy choice, while still acknowledging that some algorithms include it as a consideration after ruling out contributors like substance use and thyroid dysfunction [^117V3BQe] [^1132hWd6].

> For dosing and titration, I need to ensure practical, evidence-based targets; lurasidone has randomized data demonstrating clinically meaningful effect sizes with dosing bands of 20–60 mg/day and 80–120 mg/day, often titrated to 80 mg by day 7 in trials, with superiority over placebo emerging by week 2 and response and remission proportions improving by week 6, so I should titrate as tolerated, optimize by week 2 if possible, and reassess efficacy and tolerability frequently during the acute phase [^113YzVTW] [^115SBwYP].

> Let me think about safety, monitoring, and adherence, because these can make or break outcomes; I should monitor weekly early on for efficacy and side effects including metabolic parameters, EPS/akathisia, sedation, and affective switch risk, and I should use structured tools for adherence since up to half of patients may be nonadherent and abrupt discontinuation of mood stabilizers, especially lithium, markedly increases recurrence risk, so nonjudgmental adherence troubleshooting is essential at each contact [^114gzNYy] [^114nPjRg] [^113K9kG9].

> But wait, I must also consider antidepressant exposure and screening; before any antidepressant is contemplated in a patient with depressive symptoms, I need to screen for bipolar disorder and mixed features because antidepressant monotherapy can precipitate switching in vulnerable individuals and current guidance is equivocal on augmentation benefits, so if used at all it should be adjunctive to an optimized mood-stabilizing backbone and with explicit switch monitoring and a discontinuation plan if activation occurs [^115yb38F] [^111o1c3H] [^116t5KN3].

> Next, I should review psychosocial treatments that support symptom reduction and prevention; psychoeducation for the patient and family, adherence enhancement, sleep–wake and social rhythm stabilization, and structured psychotherapies such as CBT, family-focused therapy, and interpersonal/social rhythm therapy have evidence for reducing depressive symptoms and relapse risk, and I should also consider caregiver support programs to lessen burden and indirectly improve patient outcomes, integrating these modalities early rather than as afterthoughts [^1138i4WV] [^115fTBje] [^116m4rXS] [^111eyK7C].

> I should double-check self-management goals: daily mood and sleep tracking, consistent routines, and relapse prevention plans with early warning signs and action steps, because these interventions are feasible, acceptable, and associated with better adherence and outcomes when personalized and sustained over time, and they complement rather than replace pharmacotherapy and formal psychotherapy [^116XN7a4] [^111YAcCH].

> Now, let me address functional and quality-of-life targets, since symptom relief without functional recovery is not sufficient; I will aim for measurable improvement in role functioning such as at least a 20% gain on a disability scale like the SDS, strive for return-to-work or school with accommodations, and track quality of life with tools like Q-LES-Q-SF, remembering that residual symptoms predict earlier depressive recurrence and that "recovery" should encompass symptoms, functioning, and life satisfaction rather than just scale thresholds [^117JeSRQ] [^113VjmS9] [^114NSftn].

> For maintenance and recurrence prevention, I need to ensure continuity of the effective acute regimen for at least 6–12 months after remission, with subsequent individualized maintenance that prioritizes preventing depressive episodes, given their predominance and burden, while acknowledging the VA/DoD's uncertainty about many monotherapies for preventing bipolar depressive recurrences and integrating longitudinal monitoring of mood, side effects, and medical health every 1–3 months with annual metabolic and cardiovascular assessment [^115Xvdsm] [^111YAcCH] [^114gzNYy].

> I should verify individualized adjustments for common comorbidities and populations: for alcohol use disorder, consider adding naltrexone or nalmefene within a behavioral program; for anxiety, emphasize CBT and careful pharmacologic choices; for reproductive-age women, plan proactively around perinatal periods and teratogenic risks; for adolescents and older adults, adapt dosing and combine psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy as appropriate, all within a shared decision-making framework that respects preferences and tolerability thresholds [^1156GKmF] [^112ZfRSm] [^1138i4WV] [^111k89Ti].

> Hold on, I should verify the feedback loop for treatment resistance so I do not miss timely adjustments; if there is inadequate improvement after 6–8 weeks at a therapeutic dose, I should either switch within first-line pharmacotherapies or augment (for example, adding lithium to a partially effective antipsychotic such as lurasidone), document rationale to avoid unnecessary polypharmacy, and remeasure outcomes every 2–4 weeks until response or remission is achieved, guided by comparative efficacy evidence and guideline hierarchies rather than inertia [^114nPjRg] [^1132hWd6] [^1171DHch].

> Final check and synthesis: for moderate bipolar depression, my integrated goals are to confirm diagnosis and risk, set explicit response and remission targets within 6–8 weeks, initiate evidence-based pharmacotherapy such as quetiapine or cariprazine monotherapy or lurasidone combined with lithium or valproate while avoiding antidepressant monotherapy, monitor closely for efficacy, adverse effects, adherence, and switches, embed psychoeducation and structured psychotherapy, pursue functional recovery and quality-of-life gains, and transition to maintenance with ongoing measurement-based care, iterating collaboratively based on comorbidities and patient preferences to sustain stability and prevent recurrence [^1171DHch] [^117HSYZq] [^116m4rXS] [^111YAcCH].

In moderate bipolar depression, treatment goals prioritize **symptom reduction and functional recovery** [^114NSftn] while preventing relapse [^115Xvdsm] and minimizing adverse effects [^1171DHch]. Recommended goals include:

- **Reduce depressive symptoms**: Aim for at least a 50% reduction in depressive symptoms [^114nPjRg] and achieve remission (MADRS ≤ 12) [^113YzVTW] [^1138i4WV].
- **Prevent mood switching**: Use mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics [^1171DHch] to minimize risk of mania/hypomania [^114nPjRg] [^116t5KN3] [^111hejmB].
- **Improve functioning**: Restore social, occupational, and daily functioning to pre-episode levels [^114NSftn] [^1171DHch].
- **Enhance adherence**: Address side effects [^114gzNYy] and use psychoeducation [^113K9kG9] to improve medication adherence [^111YAcCH].
- **Reduce suicide risk**: Monitor and manage suicidal ideation and behaviors [^1138i4WV] [^114Rws5a].
- **Promote self-management**: Encourage sleep hygiene, regular routines, and healthy lifestyle habits [^116XN7a4] [^114RKyM4].
- **Prevent relapse**: Implement maintenance therapy and regular monitoring to sustain remission [^115Xvdsm] [^114gzNYy] [^113VjmS9].

These goals should be **individualized and regularly reassessed** to sustain improvement and quality of life [^111YAcCH] [^1171DHch].

The guidelines also emphasize the importance of incorporating psychoeducation and other psychosocial treatment strategies into treatment.

Additional information on the presentation and hierarchical rankings of treatment options for acute mania and depression is provided. This includes descriptions of clinical features that may help direct treatment choices. The importance of long-term maintenance treatment and promotion of treatment adherence for mood stability, as well as hierarchical rankings of treatment options, are discussed.

An expert review of the available evidence for treatments of bipolar II disorder (BDII) and recommendations based on those findings are presented. Management issues related to specific populations, including women at various stages of the reproductive cycle, children and adolescents, older adults, and those with psychiatric or medical comorbidity, are each discussed. Finally, the principles of medical monitoring and an overview of safety and tolerability concerns for recommended treatments are provided.

### Efficacy of lurasidone in adults with bipolar depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis of its impact on depressive symptoms and disability [^111hejmB]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). High credibility.

Bipolar depression (BDD) is the predominant polarity in bipolar disorder type I and poses challenges for diagnosis, treatment, and associated disability. Over the last 20 years, the FDA has approved new drugs for BDD, including lurasidone. This study summarizes the literature on lurasidone's efficacy in treating BDD, focusing on depressive symptoms and disability.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) following PRISMA reporting guidelines. Our findings demonstrate that lurasidone reduces depressive symptoms in adults with bipolar depression, as assessed by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MD -3.05 [95% CI, -4.48 to -1.62]) and the Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Scale (MD -0.42 [-0.60 to -0.25]), and improves associated disability, as measured by the Sheehan Disability Scale (MD -1.92 [-3.29 to -0.55]).

While these results are promising, further RCTs are needed to confirm lurasidone's efficacy and assess its role in long-term therapeutic strategies.

### The efficacy of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar depression with mixed features: A systematic review [^113YzVTW]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). High credibility.

- **Lurasidone**: A post hoc analysis of a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study was conducted by McIntyre et al. to evaluate the efficacy of lurasidone treatment in 485 participants with BD-I, of which 272 had mixed features (defined as having a YMRS score ≥ 4). The lurasidone dosage groups were 20–60 mg/day (starting dose: 20 mg/day for 7 days) and 80–120 mg/day (20 mg/day on days 1–2, 40 mg/day on days 3–4, 60 mg/day on days 5–6, and 80 mg/day on day 7). After day 7, doses were adjusted to optimize efficacy and tolerability. The study assessments included MADRS, CGI‐BP‐S, YMRS, QIDS-SR, SDS, and Q-LES-Q-SF.

Lurasidone treatment was associated with a significantly greater LS mean change in MADRS total score from baseline to week 6 compared to placebo (–15.7 vs. –10.9; p = 0.001; effect size, 0.48). Superiority in MADRS score compared to placebo was observed in the lurasidone group from week 2 to endpoint. The differences between lurasidone dosage groups were nonsignificant (p = 0.127). There was a significantly greater percentage of responders (≥ 50% reduction from baseline in MADRS total at LOCF endpoint) in the lurasidone group compared to placebo (51.1% vs. 32.2%; p = 0.003; NNT = 6; LOCF endpoint). Additionally, the percentage of remitters (MADRS total ≤ 12 at LOCF endpoint) was significantly greater in the lurasidone group than in the placebo group (39.6% vs. 24.4%; p = 0.014; NNT = 7; LOCF endpoint).

### Evidence-based treatment targets, selection, and strategies for acute manic and mixed episodes of bipolar I disorder [^113LPAjt]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Too many patients receive incorrect treatment for bipolar disorder; prescribing seems to differ more by clinician than by patient characteristics. New treatment guidelines are available for the management of acute manic episodes and can help clinicians make treatment decisions tailored to their patients' individual symptom clusters and illness characteristics, leading to greater chances of lasting remission. However, many clinicians lack familiarity with these symptom-targeting best practices. Therefore, clinicians need education on how to manage bipolar I disorder symptoms with evidence-based treatment options. In addition, as new treatment targets are identified, clinicians need education on psychopharmacologic and pharmacokinetic advances.

The DoD/VA 2023 guidelines address nonpharmacologic interventions for bipolar disorder, specifically focusing on alternative and complementary therapies. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against augmenting treatment with nutritional supplements such as nutraceuticals, probiotics, and vitamins to reduce depressive or manic symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder.

### The clinical efficacy of psychological interventions for bipolar depression: A systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis [^116m4rXS]. Psychological Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Unlike conventional meta-analyses, individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis assesses moderator variables at the level of each participant, which generates more precise and unbiased estimates. The objective of this study was to investigate whether psychological therapy reduces depression symptoms in people with Bipolar I and II disorders and examine whether baseline depression has a moderating effect on treatment outcomes.

Through the use of several electronic databases, a systematic search was conducted. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials evaluating a psychological intervention for adults diagnosed with Bipolar I or II disorder. Titles and abstracts were screened, followed by full texts. The authors of the included studies were asked to provide IPD from their trials. A multilevel model approach was used to analyze the data.

From the 7,552 studies found by our searches, six studies with 668 study participants were eligible. The intervention significantly reduced depression scores. There was a significant association between baseline depression and post-treatment depression scores. There was no statistically significant interaction between condition allocation and baseline depression score. When IPD from the two most comparable studies were analyzed, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) showed reduced depression scores relative to the comparator condition.

The study included patient data from only six studies which were heterogeneous in terms of intervention type, outcome measure, and comparators. Overall, the psychological interventions tested significantly reduced bipolar depression scores.

### Acute and maintenance treatments for bipolar depression [^116y4x86]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with bipolar disorder are symptomatic about half of the time, experiencing depression more often than mania or hypomania. Because patients usually seek treatment during a depressive episode rather than a manic episode, bipolar depression is commonly misdiagnosed as unipolar depression. Providing an accurate and timely bipolar depression diagnosis is critical for the proper treatment of the patient. Some FDA-approved treatments are helpful during both the acute and maintenance phases of therapy, but there is a significant unmet need for effective bipolar depression treatments with favorable side-effect profiles. Newer agents offer the promise of improvements in tolerability; however, additional research is needed to actualize this promise into better treatments for patients struggling with bipolar depression.

### Unmet needs in the assessment and management of bipolar I depression [^117YEFkr]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Bipolar depression remains challenging for clinicians to assess and manage during routine office visits. When patients complete assessments before their office visits, clinicians can quickly review the results beforehand and spend more time engaging and assessing the patient. After completing the differential diagnosis, clinicians can focus on discussing treatment goals and expectations with patients, educate them about viable treatment options, and help them select a proven option that will best promote treatment adherence. Collaborating with patients and care partners enables patients to be active participants in the management process. Systematically using assessment tools provides clinicians with measurable data to gauge the effectiveness and tolerability of each treatment and then guide the next treatment decisions. Patients with bipolar depression value individualized care and rely on the expertise of clinicians to help them achieve remission.

Updated treatment guidelines are available for maintenance therapy for bipolar I disorder. Utilizing these guidelines can assist clinicians in making informed treatment decisions, including pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions tailored to the individual characteristics of their patients. This CME activity outlines the recommendations for first-line treatment and subsequent steps. Additionally, it provides reasons why clinicians might not initiate maintenance with the highest-ranked first-line options.

### A measure for assessing patient perception of provider support for self-management of bipolar disorder [^113KMpML]. Bipolar Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

Health care providers have an important role in acknowledging and supporting patients' self-management of chronic illnesses such as bipolar disorder. This report describes the development and evaluation of a brief measure for assessing patient perception of providers' support for self-management of bipolar disorder.

- **Methods**: A 10-item measure was developed by combining generic items from an existing measure of providers' autonomy-supportive versus controlling style with items specific to the self-management of bipolar disorder. The psychometric properties of the measure and its relation to clinical variables were evaluated in a sample of patients enrolled in an ongoing randomized intervention trial.

- **Results**: Data were obtained from 420 patients with a chart diagnosis of bipolar disorder (mean age = 44, 68% female, 88% Caucasian). The proportion of missing responses for items ranged from 0 to 3%. Reliability coefficient alpha for the full scale was 0.94. Corrected item-total correlations for individual items ranged from 0.70 to 0.83. Factor analysis identified a single factor accounting for 67% of total variance. Factor loadings for individual items were all at least 0.75. The measure showed moderate positive correlations with measures of self-efficacy for managing bipolar disorder (r = 0.34; p < 0.001) and treatment satisfaction (r = 0.63; p < 0.001), and small negative correlations with measures of mania symptoms (r = -0.11; p < 0.03) and depressive symptoms (r = -0.09; p < 0.10).

- **Conclusions**: This measure shows good psychometric properties and good evidence for convergent and discriminant validity.

### Activated depression: mixed bipolar disorder or agitated unipolar depression [^115btLmG]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

The combination of depression and activation presents clinical and diagnostic challenges. It can occur in either bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder as increased agitation, which is a dimension of depression. What is called agitation can consist of expressions of painful inner tension or disinhibited, goal-directed behavior and thought. In bipolar disorder, elements of depression can be combined with those of mania. In this case, the agitation, in addition to increased motor activity and painful inner tension, must include symptoms of mania related to goal-directed behavior or manic cognition. These diagnostic considerations are important, as activated depression potentially carries increased behavioral risk, especially for suicidal behavior, and optimal treatments for depressive episodes differ between bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder.

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^112TaqDX]. APA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for major depressive disorder, specifically in relation to initial therapy, the APA 2019 guidelines recommend considering the following options when selecting between treatments:

- **Behavioral therapy**: Consider this approach rather than relying solely on antidepressant medication.

- **Cognitive therapy plus antidepressant medication**: This combination is suggested to improve the likelihood of full recovery.

### Effective treatment of bipolar depression: monotherapy and combination strategies [^115dE17W]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Managing patients with bipolar disorder remains a challenge due to its chronic nature. Bipolar depression, in particular, is understudied even though patients spend more time in depressive episodes than in manic ones. Effective treatment requires an accurate and timely diagnosis, psychoeducation, psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and the implementation of elements of the chronic care model. Pharmacologic strategies for treating bipolar depression differ from those for bipolar mania, as well as from those for unipolar depression. These strategies require knowledge of the efficacy and safety of agents, including mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, and antidepressants, both as monotherapy and in combination.

### The efficacy of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar depression with mixed features: A systematic review [^113XLLmr]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). High credibility.

Mixed features specifier applies to either a hypomanic, manic, or major depressive episode (MDE) and is defined and operationalized in the Diagnostics and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition Text Revision (DSM‐5‐TR), as three or more non‐overlapping "opposite polarity" symptoms. In addition to the aforementioned DSM‐5‐TR definition of mixed features, other definitions of mixed features have been proposed that define them with different severities of depressive and hypomanic symptoms. The predominance of depressive symptoms and episodes in bipolar disorder (BD) and their defining feature in major depressive disorder (MDD) indicates that an MDE with mixed features is a common presentation in clinical practice. Convergent evidence indicates that mixed features proxy a more complex illness presentation (e.g. severity, suicidality, non‐recovery, chronicity, recurrence, and comorbidity). Furthermore, the presence of mixed features contributes to misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis in persons with BD.

Separately, it has been reported that conventional antidepressants are suboptimally effective in the treatment of MDEs with mixed features. Additionally, individuals living with MDEs and mixed features exhibit greater susceptibility to treatment-related affective destabilization. Taken together, there is an urgent need to identify safer and more effective treatment strategies for persons experiencing MDEs with mixed features as part of BD or MDD. Herein, we conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

### Managing bipolar disorder from urgent situations to maintenance therapy [^113PctYK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment for bipolar disorder consists of two primary goals: managing urgent situations and transitioning patients into maintenance therapy. Patients with bipolar disorder who present in urgent situations — including symptoms of suicidality, aggression, occupational impairment, legal involvement, and psychosis — require quick and efficient identification and resolution of symptoms. Once patients are stabilized, clinicians must implement maintenance therapy to manage behavioral symptoms, promote optimal functioning, and ultimately reach full functional recovery.

### Mood swing and mood stabilizer: how specific are these terms [^113MajyL]. Bipolar Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

In the DSM-IIIR in 1987, the category title for depressive and bipolar disorders was changed from affective disorders to mood disorders. Within a short period of time thereafter, mood swing and mood stabilizer became very commonly used terms in psychiatry with bipolar implications.

- **Methods**: Terms and definitions in recent texts, articles, and dictionaries pertaining to mood fluctuations have been reviewed.

- **Results**: The term mood was seldom part of psychiatric terminology until the late 1970s. Mood swing and mood stabilizer, as used in the psychiatric literature, are primarily nonspecific and often misleading concepts — particularly as a basis for treatment decisions. Affective fluctuations and shifts to irritability and/or anger in persons with personality and depressive disorders are being viewed by many in the mental health field as cyclically biphasic — between depressed to elated — which is clearly at variance with research findings.

- **Conclusions**: More data-based research on mood variations is needed to authoritatively remedy this situation.

### Long-term treatment of bipolar depression and other issues [^113jX93p]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a highly episodic illness, and many patients require long-term or lifelong treatment to maintain a stable mood. Because depression is the dominant pole of both bipolar I and bipolar II disorder, maintenance therapy must prevent depressive recurrence. Although numerous treatment options exist for bipolar disorder, few have data supporting both short-term and long-term efficacy for bipolar depression. When choosing among treatments, clinicians must consider the existing evidence for the long-term effectiveness of various pharmacologic and psychosocial interventions for controlling all types of mood events.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of pharmacological interventions for acute bipolar depression in adults: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114nPjRg]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Bipolar depression constitutes a major public health problem due to its substantial burden of disease. Although pharmacological interventions are available, guidelines require updated evidence synthesis to improve their recommendations. To inform evidence-based prescribing, we investigated the comparative efficacy and tolerability of pharmacological interventions for acute bipolar depression.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis. We searched for randomized controlled trials comparing pharmacological interventions with each other or placebo in adults with acute bipolar depression (type I, type II, or not otherwise specified), excluding those with substance misuse, unipolar depression, or schizophrenia, in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Web of Knowledge, CINAHL, and LILACS from database inception up to April 13, 2023. Criteria for eligibility were a duration of 2–16 weeks with masked outcome assessments. We included combination, add-on design, and monotherapy studies. The co-primary outcomes were depressive symptoms, examined with standardized mean differences (SMDs), and manic switch, examined with odds ratios (ORs). We also investigated dropouts due to any reason, inefficacy, adverse events, and important side effects as secondary outcomes. The confidence in the evidence was evaluated using Confidence-In-Network-Meta-Analysis (CINeMA). The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020171726.

- **Results**: We analyzed data from 101 randomized controlled trials covering 20,081 participants.

### Alternatives to antidepressants in treating acute bipolar depression [^114WRxfq]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Major depressive episodes and subsyndromal depressive symptoms are associated with significant psychosocial impairment for patients with bipolar disorder. However, insufficient evidence exists to support the efficacy of antidepressants for treating bipolar depression. Alternative pharmacotherapies have been approved for the treatment of bipolar depressive episodes, and adjunctive psychosocial interventions have proven efficacy when used with pharmacotherapy.

### Systemic challenges in bipolar disorder management: A patient-centered approach [^112dFC9i]. Bipolar Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

As part of a series of Patient‐Centered Outcomes Research Institute‐funded large‐scale retrospective observational studies on bipolar disorder treatments and outcomes, we sought the input of patients and their family members to develop research questions. We aimed to identify systemic root causes of patient‐reported challenges with management in order to guide subsequent studies and initiatives.

- **Methods**: Three focus groups were conducted where patients and their family members (total n = 34) formulated questions around the central theme, "What do you wish you had known in advance or over the course of treatment?" In an affinity mapping exercise, participants clustered their questions and ranked the resulting categories by importance. The research team and members of our patient partner advisory council further rated the questions by expected impact on patients. Using a Theory of Constraints systems thinking approach, several causal models of management challenges and their potential solutions were developed with patients using the focus group data.

- **Results**: A total of 369 research questions were mapped to 33 categories revealing 10 broad themes. The top priorities for patient stakeholders involved pharmacotherapy and treatment alternatives. Analysis of causal relationships underlying 47 patient concerns revealed two core conflicts: for patients, whether or not to take pharmacotherapy, and for mental health services, the dilemma of care quality vs. quantity.

### The clinical efficacy of psychological interventions for bipolar depression: A systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis [^117R5Yub]. Psychological Medicine (2025). High credibility.

In addressing these issues, researchers must carefully assess and account for heterogeneity through sensitivity analyses, subgroup analyses, or by considering alternative statistical approaches to ensure the robustness and reliability of their meta-analytic findings. Individual patient-level data meta-analysis is one means of addressing clinical and methodological diversity.

Here, we report the outcome of our IPD-MA of studies of psychological therapies, where bipolar depression level was measured at intake and post-treatment. We hypothesized that psychological therapies are effective in reducing depressive symptoms for people living with Bipolar I and II disorders. We also hypothesized that those with higher levels of depression at baseline stand to benefit the most from receiving the treatment.

### Bipolar disorder diagnosis: challenges and future directions [^115LpTXb]. Lancet (2013). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bipolar disorder:

- **Definition**: BD is a group of affective disorders characterized by depressive and manic or hypomanic episodes. The disorders include BD type I (depressive and manic episodes), BD type II (depressive and hypomanic episodes), cyclothymic disorder (hypomanic and depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for depressive episodes), and BD not otherwise specified (depressive and hypomanic-like symptoms that do not meet the diagnostic criteria for any of the aforementioned disorders).

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of BD is complex and not fully understood. It is believed to be multifactorial, resulting from the interplay of genetic and environmental factors. This leads to disturbances in neuronal-glial plasticity, monoaminergic signaling, inflammatory homeostasis, cellular metabolic pathways, and mitochondrial function.

- **Epidemiology**: The lifetime prevalence of BD globally is estimated at 0.6% for bipolar I disorder, 0.4% for bipolar II disorder, 1.4% for subthreshold BD, and 2.4% for the bipolar spectrum disorder. The weighted average prevalence of bipolar spectrum disorders in children and adolescents aged 7–21 years is estimated at 2.06%.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for BD include genetic predisposition, with a high heritability of approximately 70%, and a shared genetic risk with other mental and medical disorders. Bipolar I has a closer genetic association with schizophrenia, while bipolar II has a closer genetic association with major depressive disorder. Environmental risk factors such as…

### The presentation, recognition, and management of bipolar depression in primary care [^114Rws5a]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder characterized by episodes of major depression and mania or hypomania. Most patients experience chronic symptoms of bipolar disorder approximately half of the time, most commonly subsyndromal depressive symptoms or a full depressive episode with concurrent manic symptoms. Consequently, patients with bipolar depression are often misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder. Individual patient characteristics and population screening tools may be helpful in improving recognition of bipolar depression in primary care.

Health risk behaviors, including tobacco use, sedentary activity levels, and weight gain, are highly prevalent in patients with bipolar disorder, as are comorbid chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Patients with bipolar illness have about an eight-fold higher risk of suicide and a two-fold increased risk of death from chronic medical illnesses.

Recognition of bipolar depression and its associated health risk behaviors and chronic medical problems can lead to the use of appropriate interventions for patients with bipolar disorder, which differ in important ways from the treatments used for major depressive disorder. The above topics are reviewed in detail in this article.

### Family-focused treatment for caregivers of patients with bipolar disorder [^112Dr8PB]. Bipolar Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Family members of patients with bipolar disorder experience high rates of subjective and objective burden, placing them at risk for adverse physical and mental health outcomes. This study presents preliminary efficacy data from a novel variation of family-focused treatment that aims to reduce symptoms of bipolar disorder by working with caregivers to enhance illness management skills and self-care.

The primary family caregivers of 46 patients with bipolar I (n = 40) or II (n = 6) disorder, diagnosed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, were randomly assigned to receive either:

- **Family-focused, cognitive-behavioral intervention**: A 12–15 session program designed to provide caregivers with skills for managing the relative's illness, attaining self-care goals, and reducing strain, depression, and health risk behavior [Family-Focused Treatment-Health Promoting Intervention (FFT-HPI)].
- **Health education intervention**: An 8- to 12-session program delivered via videotapes.

We assessed patients pre- and post-treatment on levels of depression and mania and caregivers on levels of burden, health behavior, and coping.

Randomization to FFT-HPI was associated with significant decreases in caregiver depressive symptoms and health risk behavior. Greater reductions in depressive symptoms among patients were also observed in the FFT-HPI group. Reduction in patients' depression was partially mediated by reductions in caregivers' burden.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^113FLdth]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

- **Rapid cycling**: Rapid cycling, or a course of illness that includes four or more mood episodes a year, affects up to one-third of patients with BDI. Hypothyroidism, antidepressant use, and substance abuse are often associated with rapid cycling; thus assessing thyroid function and discontinuation of antidepressants, stimulants, and other psychotropic agents that contribute to cycling are imperative. Consideration should be given to gradually withdrawing substances to prevent withdrawal. However, this needs to be balanced against the severity of mood cycling and the need for rapid mood stabilization. As there is no evidence for the superiority of any first‐line treatment in addressing acute manic symptoms in patients with a rapid cycling course, appropriate pharmacotherapy should be selected primarily based on effectiveness in the maintenance phase, if known (see Section 5). It is likely that combinations of mood-stabilizing drugs may be more necessary than monotherapies when rapid cycling is present. However, triple mood stabilizer therapy has not demonstrated superiority to double mood stabilizer therapy in a single RCT, although methodological weaknesses probably limited the interpretability of the findings.

- **Seasonal pattern**: While some individual patients may show a seasonal pattern, Canadian data are mixed as to whether episodes of mania or depression in BD follow a consistent seasonal variation. There is no evidence for the superiority of any agent in patients with an observed seasonal pattern of manic episodes.

### The efficacy of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar depression with mixed features: A systematic review [^116hc7xZ]. Bipolar Disorders (2025).

The OFC treatment group had 16/37 (43.2%) responders, defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in total MADRS score and < 2 concurrent hypo/manic symptoms (measured by YMRS) after the treatment period. A total of 46/173 (26.6%) of the participants taking olanzapine responded, and 27/166 (16.3%) of the placebo group responded. When compared to placebo, both combined treatment (OR = 3.91; 95% CI, 1.80–8.49; p = 0.0006) and olanzapine monotherapy (OR = 1.95; 95% CI, 1.14–3.34; p = 0.014) showed significantly higher response rates. Additionally, there were significantly lower dropout rates in the combined treatment group (29.7%) compared to olanzapine monotherapy (53.8%) and placebo (59.6%) (olanzapine monotherapy vs. combined treatment: OR = 2.67; 95% CI, 1.23–5.75; p = 0.12; placebo vs. combined treatment: OR = 3.48; 95% CI, 1.61–7.54; p = 0.002). There was no significant difference in dropout rates between the olanzapine and placebo groups (OR = 1.30; 95% CI, 0.84–2.01; p = 0.227). The switch rates to mania/hypomania for each group were 8.5% (7/82) for combined treatment, 6.8% (24/351) for olanzapine, and 7.9% (28/355) for placebo (χ² = 0.426, df = 2, p = 0.808).

Two RCTs evaluating the effect of pharmacological treatment in persons with MDD and BD with mixed features were identified.

### Predictors of recurrence in bipolar disorder: Primary outcomes from the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) [^113VjmS9]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Little is known about clinical features associated with the risk of recurrence in patients with bipolar disorder receiving treatment according to contemporary practice guidelines. The authors looked for the features associated with the risk of recurrence.

The authors examined prospective data from a cohort of patients with bipolar disorder participating in the multicenter Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) study for up to 24 months. For those who were symptomatic at study entry but subsequently achieved recovery, time to recurrence of mania, hypomania, mixed state, or a depressive episode was examined using Cox regression.

Of 1,469 participants symptomatic at study entry, 858 (58.4%) subsequently achieved recovery. During up to 2 years of follow-up, 416 (48.5%) of these individuals experienced recurrences, with more than twice as many developing depressive episodes (298, 34.7%) as those who developed manic, hypomanic, or mixed episodes (118, 13.8%). The time until 25% of the individuals experienced a depressive episode was 21.4 weeks, and until 25% experienced a manic, hypomanic, or mixed episode was 85.0 weeks. Residual depressive or manic symptoms at recovery and the proportion of days depressed or anxious in the preceding year were significantly associated with shorter time to depressive recurrence. Residual manic symptoms at recovery and the proportion of days of elevated mood in the preceding year were significantly associated with shorter time to manic, hypomanic, or mixed episode recurrence.

### Systemic challenges in bipolar disorder management: A patient-centered approach [^117NKEEN]. Bipolar Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

In our study, the highest priority for bipolar disorder patients is better evidence on individualized pharmacotherapy and its alternatives, with an emphasis on managing suicidal thoughts and manic states. The challenges in managing bipolar disorder appear to be driven by two interacting systemic core conflicts: for the patient, seeking versus avoiding pharmacotherapy; for the provider, quantity versus quality of care.

The conflicts underlying patient decision-making should be investigated as a target for psychoeducational interventions, with a particular emphasis on mitigating the loss of bipolar disorder positives. Implementation of advanced operational excellence approaches for health system improvement should be more fully investigated in the domain of mental health care, with an emphasis on maximizing the benefits to patients with limited visit time and resources.

Bipolar disorder management requires a "system overhaul" that supports patients in accessing mental health services, obtaining sufficient provider visit time, having their condition diagnosed early and accurately by means of objective tools, and receiving personalized multidisciplinary care, including psychosocial support.

### Clinical indicators for the use of antidepressants in the treatment of bipolar I depression [^112eZKFW]. Bipolar Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

Guidelines provide little practical information on the clinical characteristics of bipolar I patients who are likely to benefit from the combination of a mood stabilizer and an antidepressant. Rather, guidelines simply state that an adjunctive antidepressant is recommended in cases of "severe" depression. Our objective was to evaluate the clinical and demographic differences between patients who remitted on a mood stabilizer alone and those who subsequently required an adjunctive antidepressant to achieve stabilization.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively compared the pharmacological treatment strategies of 39 patients with bipolar I disorder who were in a depressive episode. Patients who did not respond to mood stabilizer monotherapy were prescribed an adjunctive antidepressant. We evaluated the clinical differences at baseline and weeks 1, 2, and 3 of treatment between patients stabilizing on a mood stabilizer alone and those who did not remit until they received an adjunctive antidepressant.

- **Results**: Patients who required an adjunctive antidepressant had significantly higher total Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRS-D) scores at weeks 1, 2, and 3 of treatment, but not at baseline. Those who remitted on mood stabilizer monotherapy were more likely to be married, achieved stabilization in less time, presented with higher Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores, and experienced the previous episode of depression more recently than patients who required an antidepressant.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest that rapid improvement after achieving stabilization on a mood stabilizer alone is indicative of certain clinical and demographic characteristics in patients with bipolar I disorder.

### Practical strategies for assessing and stabilizing bipolar patients in urgent situations [^113ECBeH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

For patients with bipolar disorder in urgent situations, psychiatric and nonpsychiatric clinicians should employ practical approaches to achieve optimum outcomes and ensure safe and rapid reduction of symptoms. Factors to consider include the treatment setting, the clinician-patient relationship, and the severity of the patient's symptoms. Because biological, psychological, and social factors affect both the development and the treatment of acute bipolar states, treatment should address each factor to manage the illness effectively.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^1132hWd6]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

- **Pharmacological treatment for acute bipolar depression**: Lithium, anticonvulsants, atypical antipsychotics, and other agents such as antidepressants have been investigated for efficacy in managing bipolar depression. These treatments have been evaluated using criteria for strength of evidence for efficacy, as well as safety and tolerability. Recommendations are summarized in hierarchical rankings of first and second-line treatments recommended for management of acute bipolar I depression.

- **Step 1: Review general principles and assess medication status**: Examination of a patient presenting in a depressed state should include an assessment of the nature and severity of depression and associated symptoms, risk of suicide/self-harm behavior, ability to adhere to a treatment plan, availability of a psychosocial support network, and functional impairment. Laboratory investigations should also be completed. Results of the overall assessment should be used to establish the most appropriate treatment setting (e.g. ambulatory or inpatient), with consideration given to management of safety risks. Before initiating pharmacological treatment for a depressive episode, it is imperative to rule out symptoms secondary to alcohol/drug use, medications, or a general medical condition. Patients should be supported to discontinue stimulant use and limit nicotine, caffeine, drug, and alcohol use. The course of illness and treatments used in prior episodes should be assessed, including past experiences and outcomes.

### Response, remission, and recovery in bipolar disorders: What are the realistic treatment goals [^114MzTvR]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder presents particular challenges with regard to assessing response to therapy. Criteria for determining remission and recovery have been suggested for mood disorders, but the clinical usefulness of these terms in bipolar disorder is elusive. Formal psychological rating scales may be impractical in a routine medical practice setting. As an alternative, clinicians might probe for information about particular "signal events", such as sleep disturbances, that may herald mood fluctuations.

The ultimate goal of bipolar management should be complete and sustained remission, whenever possible, although most patients will not achieve this status for any significant length of time. Furthermore, overaggressive management might entail pushing medication doses to intolerable levels. Individual treatment goals should always take into account patient acceptance of side effect burden, allowing for trade-offs between treatment effect and quality of life.

Noncompliance with therapy, notoriously common among patients suffering from bipolar disorder, can stem from drug side effects, treatment ineffectiveness, or even treatment success if the patient misses the manic symptoms. Despite effective treatment, relapse is common. Realistic treatment goals should strive for sustained symptom abatement while maximizing patient quality of life from visit to visit.

### Outcomes to monitor when treating bipolar disorder or schizophrenia [^117JeSRQ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

The long-term goals of treating both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are to achieve remission, promote functional recovery, prevent relapse, and improve patients' subjective response. To meet these goals in patients with bipolar disorder, management of the acute episodes of mania, depression, and mixed symptomatology is necessary and may help to maintain favorable patient behavior and avoid hospitalization. In this review, the definitions of remission, recovery, and relapse are compared and contrasted between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia to highlight the similarities and, most notably, the differences in assessments between the two conditions. The implications for the treatment of bipolar disorder stem from the ideology that underlies many of the studies in schizophrenia.

### Beyond evidence-based treatment of bipolar disorder: Rational pragmatic approaches to management [^113REEJz]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The achievement and maintenance of remission is the major goal of therapeutics for bipolar disorder. Since guidance from the literature is limited on how to achieve this goal, careful longitudinal assessment of an individual patient's degree of response and tolerability to a drug is crucial. More medications with different mechanisms of action, along with multiple types of therapeutic approaches, including psychotherapeutic and lifestyle interventions, may be necessary to initially achieve remission. Additional treatment revisions will likely be required as symptoms emerge, with the hope that prompt attention to these will prevent the development of full-blown relapses. When this comprehensive approach is taken, recurrence of and sensitization to mood episodes, stressors, and bouts of substance abuse, along with their epigenetic underpinnings, may be mitigated or minimized.

Even patients with late-stage, apparently treatment-refractory illness can achieve considerable improvement, if not remission, if unconventional approaches are utilized. These approaches can involve multiple medications with different neurotransmitter targets, multiple off-label adjuncts, lifestyle modifications, psychosocial approaches, and nutraceuticals. It would be highly preferable to have a systematic treatment literature upon which to make clinical decisions rather than relying on indirect evidence and clinician's suppositions. However, in the absence of such literature, clinicians must work with patients and family members to construct and revise treatment regimens as necessary.

### Challenges in the management of bipolar depression [^111tLRp5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Bipolar depression has only recently begun to receive more attention in clinical trials, despite the fact that patients spend more time in the depressed phase than in the manic phase of bipolar disorder. The diagnosis and management of bipolar depression are challenging. Many patients are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to symptom similarities with unipolar depression, other illnesses, and comorbidities. Untreated or inappropriately treated bipolar depression adds to the burden of illness, increasing the risk of suicide.

Treatment options include lithium, lamotrigine, atypical antipsychotics, and traditional antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Traditional antidepressants are recommended with caution due to the potential risk of inducing mania. Some atypical antipsychotics have shown efficacy in treating bipolar depression; however, longer-term studies are warranted. The choice of treatment for different subgroups of patients with bipolar depression, including those with comorbid anxiety, may vary and requires further study.

Other important issues that need further investigation include the recognition of the core features of bipolar depression and the threshold symptoms for treatment. Additionally, research is needed to determine the optimal treatment choices for monotherapy or combination therapy, and for acute versus long-term management of bipolar depression.

### The efficacy of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of major depressive disorder and bipolar depression with mixed features: A systematic review [^115SBwYP]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). High credibility.

There is a need to provide up-to-date, clinically translatable data as it relates to the treatment of a major depressive episode (MDE) with mixed features.

- **Methods**: PubMed and OVID were searched from inception to July 22, 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy of pharmacological agents for adults with bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD) in an MDE with mixed features were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for Randomized Studies (RoB2).

- **Results**: A total of seven studies were included in this systematic review. The studies identified were all short-term acute studies ranging from 6 to 8 weeks. Treatment with lurasidone, olanzapine, cariprazine, lumateperone, quetiapine, and ziprasidone was associated with statistically significant reduction of depressive symptoms in MDEs with mixed features. Only lumateperone is studied in both BD subtypes [bipolar I disorder (BD-I), bipolar II disorder (BD-II)] and MDD, wherein efficacy in mixed features was the prespecified primary outcome. Lurasidone has a single study in MDD, while ziprasidone has data in a mixed sample of BD-II and MDD. Data for the other agents in mixed features is post hoc. Co-occurring hypomanic symptoms generally improved, and there was no significant difference between the above treatments and placebo with respect to hypomanic symptom severity intensification or treatment-emergent affective switching.

- **Conclusion**: Select atypical antipsychotics are effective in alleviating depressive symptoms in persons with mixed features.

### An evidence-based medicine strategy for achieving remission in bipolar disorder [^113CJjo8]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of several classes of drugs for achieving acute response in bipolar mania and depression. For many years, clinical response has been the primary outcome in the majority of short-term efficacy studies. However, there is a growing consensus that the optimal goal in the long-term management of bipolar disorder is remission. The purpose of this article is to briefly summarize the clinical importance of remission in bipolar disorder and to review data on the effectiveness of available treatments for achieving and sustaining remission.

Resolving acute bipolar mood episodes is only one part of an overall strategy for treating bipolar disorder. Successful prevention of mood episode relapse, particularly bipolar depressive episodes, through effective continuation and maintenance therapies, can greatly improve patient functioning and outcomes. Little evidence is available to guide decisions on the treatment of bipolar depression, especially in the maintenance phase, and additional research into effective options is urgently needed. General strategies for treating patients with bipolar disorder include continuing the acute pharmacotherapeutic regimen into the maintenance phase and considering tolerability.

### Pharmacological management of bipolar disorder: Japanese expert consensus [^111k89Ti]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Consensus on pharmacological strategy for depressive episodes:

None of the treatments were categorized as first-line options for depressive episodes in elderly patients. The second-line treatments included the following: quetiapine monotherapy (6.3 ± 2.3), lithium monotherapy (6.2 ± 2.5), lamotrigine monotherapy (5.9 ± 2.6), combination therapy of lithium and an atypical antipsychotic (5.5 ± 2.5), and combination therapy of lamotrigine and an atypical antipsychotic (5.5 ± 2.3).

Antidepressant use was categorized as a third-line treatment for depressive episodes in BP-I (3.8 ± 2.2) and as a second-line treatment in BP-II (4.4 ± 2.3). For persistent depressive episodes, when respondents were asked to rate the use of adjunctive antidepressants concomitantly with an ongoing mood stabilizer, no specific antidepressant was categorized as a first-line treatment for both BP-I and BP-II. The second-line treatments included mirtazapine (5.4 ± 2.6) and escitalopram (5.3 ± 2.7) for BP-I, and escitalopram (5.7 ± 2.7), sertraline (5.5 ± 2.6), and mirtazapine (5.5 ± 2.6) for BP-II.

### Canadian network for mood and anxiety treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^111YAcCH]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). High credibility.

Due to the chronic, relapsing, and remitting nature of bipolar disorder (BD), a long-term, multidisciplinary approach to management is needed. The Chronic Disease Management Model outlines several important principles to enhance long-term care for these individuals and their families. After basic clinical management, including attention to diagnosis, comorbidity, and medical health has been established, patient health education and pharmacotherapy should be the initial and foundational steps for all patients.

Ideally, the patient will be connected to a healthcare team that includes at least one other healthcare professional (typically a nurse), in addition to the psychiatrist, for psychoeducation, ongoing monitoring, psychosocial support, and referral to community resources. All patients should have access to a primary care provider to attend to mental and physical health needs. If the patient is stable and discharged to primary care, the mental health care system should provide support directly to the primary care provider with attention to continuity of care. Additional psychosocial treatments may also be selected to fit the specific needs and preferences of the patient.

- **Therapeutic alliance**: A strong therapeutic alliance is central to improving treatment adherence and outcomes. Providers should encourage individuals to actively participate in treatment planning, using a shared decision-making approach. Whenever possible, family members or key friends should be included as part of the care team to support the patient.

### Adjunctive antidepressants for the acute treatment of bipolar depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111o1c3H]. Psychiatry Research (2022). High credibility.

The depressive phase of bipolar disorder causes significant functional impairment and disease burden. The efficacy and safety of antidepressants in the treatment of bipolar depression has long been a subject of debate.

- **Aims**: To synthesize evidence of the effectiveness, risk of mood switching, and tolerability of adjunctive antidepressants in acute bipolar depression compared to using mood stabilizers or antipsychotics alone.

- **Method**: Multiple databases were searched for randomized controlled trials, including open label and double-blinded, for patients ages 18 or older with acute bipolar depression, comparing efficacy and adverse events in those who used adjunctive antidepressants versus without. Risk of bias and outcomes were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. This study has PROSPERO registration CRD42016037701.

- **Results**: Nineteen studies met inclusion criteria. Adjunctive antidepressants showed no significant effect on improving response rate (RR = 1.10, 95%CI: 0.98–1.23). Subgroup analysis showed that adjunctive antidepressants with antipsychotics had a small but significantly better response rate compared to antipsychotics alone, which was not seen with adjunctive antidepressants with mood stabilizers. However, that finding was limited by studies predominantly using olanzapine as the antipsychotic medication. Adjunctive antidepressants had no clinically significant impact (but a small statistically significant impact) on improving depressive symptoms (SMD = -0.13, 95%CI: -0.24 to -0.02). There was no association with increased mood switch (RR = 0.97).

**Treatment adherence**: Concordance between clinician and patient views of illness and treatment is a crucial determinant of adherence and reinforces the need for a collaborative approach to the treatment alliance. Asking about adherence behavior and attitudes in a non-judgmental manner, and exploring the reasoning behind poor adherence, are important parts of treatment, as up to half of patients do not take their medications as prescribed. Unrecognized treatment non-adherence can lead physicians to believe that the patient is non-responsive, resulting in unnecessary dose increases, especially problematic for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index, medication switches, or adjunctive medications. Treatment withdrawal may precipitate recurrence; 50%-90% of patients discontinuing lithium experience a recurrence within 3–5 months, with rapid lithium discontinuation associated with greater recurrence risk than gradual discontinuation. Withdrawal of other mood stabilizers also predicts recurrence. Risks for hospitalization, suicide, and lost productivity are also increased with non-adherence or discontinuation. Meta-analyses suggest that interventions aimed at engaging patients in treatment may more than double adherence compared to treatment as usual or other control groups.

### The clinical efficacy of psychological interventions for bipolar depression: a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis [^111iLyzW]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

By conducting a one-stage IPD-MA, all patient data from all studies were combined, with individuals nesting within studies. Multilevel linear mixed models were used and clustered at the study level to detect and control for unobserved heterogeneity between studies. Baseline depression score, age, and gender were included as covariates.

As part of the primary analysis, we examined how condition allocation affected depression outcomes. Afterward, we examined whether baseline depression moderated treatment outcomes. The outcome variable was the HAM-D posttreatment score, while condition allocation, baseline HAM-D depression score, age, and gender were included as predictors. An interaction between baseline depression scores and treatment outcomes was incorporated into the multilevel linear regression model to determine if baseline depression scores were a moderator of treatment outcomes.

Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 28.0.1.0. A multilevel modeling approach was used to address both hypothesis 1, which predicted that psychological therapies are effective in reducing depressive symptoms for people living with Bipolar I and II disorders, and hypothesis 2, which predicted that treatment will be most effective for individuals with higher levels of depression. Multilevel modeling was used because individuals (level 1) were nested within studies (level 2). HPS scores were included as a level 2 predictor. In terms of data preparation, it is essential that fixed effects in multilevel models be easily interpreted within the context of the research goals.

### Beyond evidence-based treatment of bipolar disorder: Rational pragmatic approaches to management [^111P5Vu8]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The evidence for the efficacy of many currently available treatments for bipolar disorder is largely based on studies of non-refractory patients with bipolar disorder. Therefore, it is not surprising that most treatment recommendations and guidelines heavily rely on data from placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials (RCTs). However, these RCTs provide little guidance for clinicians on optimal next steps for non- or partial-responders and those with ongoing medical and psychiatric comorbidities.

Given the scarcity of RCTs at later treatment stages, it is essential to discuss the quality of the data used by experts in the field when choosing and sequencing drugs and their combinations. While many clinical investigators may prefer different sequences, the suggestions offered here may be beneficial to some clinicians and encourage discussions of alternative options in the literature. They also provide a preliminary outline for a new round of clinical trials needed to better inform clinical practice. Due to the diverse quality of the data and clinical principles on which the suggestions are based, only minimal references are included. A comprehensive review of the supporting literature is beyond the scope of this manuscript.

### Diagnosis and pharmacotherapy of bipolar depression in adults [^112wqq9D]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Approximately 60% of patients with bipolar disorder (BD) who present with depression are misdiagnosed as having unipolar depression, which may lead to inappropriate treatment and potential worsening of symptoms. Several factors, such as substance use disorders, may interfere with a positive screen and an accurate BD diagnosis. By facilitating effective communication with patients and implementing diagnostic criteria and assessment tools, clinicians can accurately identify the often subtle indicators of the disorder and recommend individualized treatment. Regardless of the pharmacologic prescribed, it is important to tailor treatment for patients with BD by considering the disease course, potential adverse effects, and comorbidities.

### Diagnosis, treatment, and recovery maintenance in bipolar depression [^1116LAam]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder and inappropriate pharmacotherapeutic treatment are common issues. Clinicians should screen for manic or hypomanic symptoms during depressive episodes to differentiate between bipolar depression and other depressive disorders. Depression is the dominant pole of bipolar disorder, and effective maintenance therapy must prevent the recurrence of depressive episodes. Few pharmacologic treatments have evidence supporting both short- and long-term efficacy for bipolar depression. Clinicians must consider the existing evidence on the long-term efficacy of various pharmacologic and psychosocial interventions for preventing and treating bipolar mood episodes.

### An approach to revealing clinically relevant subgroups across the mood spectrum [^113xRx5M]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Individuals diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder (BP1), bipolar 2 disorder (BP2), or major depressive disorder (MDD) experience varying levels of depressive and (hypo)manic symptoms. Clarifying symptom heterogeneity is meaningful, as even subthreshold symptoms may impact quality of life and treatment outcomes. The MOODS Lifetime self-report instrument was designed to capture the full range of depressive and (hypo)manic characteristics.

- **Methods**: This study applied clustering methods to 347 currently depressed adults with MDD, BP2, or BP1 to reveal naturally occurring MOODS subgroups. Subgroups were then compared on baseline clinical and demographic characteristics as well as depressive and (hypo)manic symptoms over twenty weeks of treatment.

- **Results**: Four subgroups were identified: (1) high depressive and (hypo)manic symptoms (N = 77, 22%), (2) moderate depressive and (hypo)manic symptoms (N = 115, 33%), (3) low depressive and moderate (hypo)manic symptoms (N = 82, 24%), and (4) low depressive and (hypo)manic symptoms (N = 73, 21%). Individuals in the low depressive/moderate (hypo)manic subgroup had poorer quality of life and greater depressive symptoms over the course of treatment. Individuals in the high and moderate severity subgroups had greater substance use, longer duration of illness, and greater (hypo)manic symptoms throughout treatment. Treatment outcomes were primarily driven by individuals diagnosed with MDD.

- **Limitations**: The sample was drawn from three randomized clinical trials. Validation is required for this exploratory study.

### Bipolar disorder maintenance treatment: Monitoring effectiveness and safety [^114gzNYy]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Bipolar disorder is a chronic illness that requires long-term treatment. The goal of this treatment is to shorten or prevent mood episodes without increasing cycle frequency, thereby increasing the length of well periods. Treatment guidelines recommend mood stabilizers as first-line medications. Several atypical antipsychotics are also approved as monotherapy or as adjuncts to mood stabilizers for maintenance treatment.

Combination therapy with two mood stabilizers or a mood stabilizer and an antipsychotic may be necessary to achieve or maintain remission of the patient's symptoms. When treating patients with mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics during the maintenance phase, physicians should systematically monitor for adverse effects, particularly weight gain, and tolerability issues. It is essential to address these issues in a timely manner to enhance treatment adherence and improve patient outcomes.

### Selecting appropriate treatments for maintenance therapy for bipolar disorder [^1143utf9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Long-term management of bipolar disorder is a crucial component of treatment because the recurrence of the illness negatively affects patients' daily lives and increases their risks for poor health and suicide. An ideal maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder is relatively simple to take, prevents recurrence of both manic and depressive episodes, and is well-tolerated over the long term. Although many different types of medications are used for maintenance therapy of bipolar disorder, none can be considered ideal for a majority of people with bipolar disorder, and each specific form of therapy has different strengths and limitations.

Clinicians need to be aware of unique efficacy and side effect factors when choosing long-term therapy and consider treatment components, goals, and individual patient characteristics, which are essential to the successful long-term management of bipolar disorder. Additionally, several forms of psychotherapy specifically tailored to the needs of people with bipolar disorder should be considered as an adjunct to medication.

### Beyond evidence-based treatment of bipolar disorder: Rational pragmatic approaches to management [^116LE4iN]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The evidence for the efficacy of many currently available treatments for bipolar disorder is based on studies of nonrefractory patients with bipolar disorder. Therefore, it is not surprising that most treatment recommendations and guidelines for the treatment of bipolar disorder and its many comorbidities depend heavily on data from placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials (RCTs). However, these RCTs provide little direction for clinicians regarding optimal next steps for non- or partial-responders and those with ongoing medical and psychiatric comorbidities.

Given this and the paucity of RCTs at later treatment junctures, we deemed it appropriate to initiate a discussion on the quality of data that some experts in the field might consider using when choosing and sequencing drugs and their combinations. We acknowledge that many other clinical investigators may prefer very different sequences, but we thought the suggestions offered here might be useful to some clinicians in the field, might start discussions of other options in the literature, and, at the same time, provide a preliminary outline for a new round of much-needed clinical trials to better inform clinical practice.

Given the very wide range of the quality of the data and clinical principles on which the suggestions are based, only minimal references are included. A comprehensive review of the literature supporting each option would be outside the scope of this manuscript.

### Beyond evidence-based treatment of bipolar disorder: Rational pragmatic approaches to management [^113cVP6G]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine must advance based on what works for an individual patient. Data from randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for making clinical judgments; however, there are many pitfalls to this assumption. Patients are highly selected for homogeneity for the RCTs and typically do not represent the range and complexity of patients in the general population. There is little room for generating clinical predictors of response, as only half the patients receive the active medication; real responders cannot be readily separated from placebo responders, and secondary analyses of possible predictors and subgroups have methodological limitations that are frowned upon by the FDA and many journal editors and referees.

The most egregious deficit is that there are rarely sufficient RCTs in patients with bipolar disorder to cover the whole range of first-, second-, or third-line treatments. Even when an RCT does exist in a given area, it often provides no guidance for the clinician interested in knowing what might be the next best option for nonresponders. Another problem is that most treatment guidelines take the perspective that most patients are responsive to initial treatment. In reality, many patients — perhaps the majority in some settings — present with complex late-stage illness that shows considerable treatment refractoriness, which is rarely addressed in RCTs. These treatment refractory patients are often excluded from industry-sponsored RCTs.

### The clinical efficacy of psychological interventions for bipolar depression: A systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis [^117T5tCS]. Psychological Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Unlike conventional meta-analyses, individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis assesses moderator variables at the level of each participant, generating more precise estimates. The objective of this study was to investigate whether psychological therapy reduces depression symptoms in people with Bipolar I and II disorders and examine whether baseline depression has a moderating effect on treatment outcomes. Through the use of several electronic databases, a systematic search was conducted.

Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials evaluating a psychological intervention for adults diagnosed with Bipolar I or II disorder. Titles and abstracts were screened, followed by full texts. The authors of the included studies were asked to provide IPD from their trials. A multilevel model approach was used to analyze the data.

From the 7,552 studies found by our searches, six studies with 668 participants were eligible. **Intervention outcomes**: Intervention significantly reduced depression scores. There was a significant association between baseline depression and post-treatment depression scores. No statistically significant interaction was found between condition allocation and baseline depression score.

When IPD from the two most comparable studies were analyzed, CBT had reduced depression scores relative to the comparator condition. However, the study included patient data from only six studies, which were heterogeneous in terms of intervention type, outcome measure, and comparators. Overall, the psychological interventions tested significantly reduced bipolar depression scores.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^11538XJY]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Due to frequent depressive onset, variable help-seeking for hypomanic or manic periods, temporal instability of symptoms, and high rates of comorbidity, accurate and timely identification of bipolar disorder (BD) can be difficult to achieve in many cases. Indeed, many individuals are not accurately diagnosed until up to 10 years after the onset of symptoms, with one to four alternate diagnoses typically being given prior to correct recognition and treatment. This delay has important consequences, including inadequate initial treatment and worse prognosis in terms of episode recurrence and functional outcome.

The most frequent misdiagnosis is that of major depressive disorder (MDD), as patients are more likely to present for the treatment of depressive symptoms and may not recall periods of hypomania or mania, or may not interpret them as being pathological. Recall and insight are particularly impaired during periods of acute depression, with pronounced memory or concentration difficulties.

- **Suspicion indicators**: There are several features of depression that may increase suspicion of bipolarity and prompt more careful investigation, including earlier age of illness onset, highly recurrent depressive episodes, a family history of BD, depression with psychotic features, psychomotor agitation, atypical depressive symptoms such as hypersomnia, hyperphagia, and leaden paralysis, postpartum depression and psychosis, past suicide attempts, and antidepressant‐induced manic symptoms or rapid cycling.

Given the recent change in DSM-5 to allow the possibility of depression symptom presentation alongside…

### Prevalence and correlates of burden among caregivers of patients with bipolar disorder enrolled in the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder [^113zsBYF]. Bipolar Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Caring for a relative with schizophrenia or dementia is associated with reports of high caregiver burden, symptoms of depression, poor physical health, negligence of the caregiver's own health needs, elevated health service use, low social support, and financial strain. This study presents the design and preliminary data on the costs and consequences of caring for a relative or friend with bipolar disorder from the Family Experience Study, a longitudinal study of the primary caregivers to 500 patients enrolled in the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder.

- **Methods**: Subjects were primary caregivers of 500 patients with bipolar disorder, diagnosed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and the Affective Disorder Evaluation. Caregivers were evaluated within one month after patients entered the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program using measures of burden, coping, health/mental health, and use of resources and costs.

- **Results**: Eighty-nine percent, 52%, and 61% of caregivers, respectively, experienced moderate or higher burden in relation to patient problem behaviors, role dysfunction, or disruption of household routine. High burden caregivers reported more physical health problems, depressive symptoms, health risk behavior, health service use, and less social support than those with lower burden. They also provided more financial support to their bipolar relatives.

- **Conclusions**: Burdens experienced by family caregivers of people with bipolar disorder are associated with problems in health, mental health, and cost.

### New approaches in managing bipolar depression [^112r9h19]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Historically, the pharmacological treatment of bipolar depression has not been well studied. New data are beginning to emerge regarding the efficacy of new medications and the use of combinations of mood stabilizers and antidepressants in the acute and long-term treatment of bipolar depression. We reviewed data from recent randomized, controlled trials of mood stabilizers and antidepressants in the treatment of bipolar depression, as well as naturalistic studies examining the risk of switching and depressive relapse with ongoing antidepressant treatment.

### Abilify [^115yb38F]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Screening patients for bipolar disorder: A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitating a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression.

It should be noted that Abilify is not approved for use in treating depression in the pediatric population.

- **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)**: A potentially fatal symptom complex, sometimes referred to as NMS, may occur with the administration of antipsychotic drugs, including Abilify. Rare cases of NMS occurred during Abilify treatment in the worldwide clinical database. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated.

### Defining and achieving recovery from bipolar disorder [^114NSftn]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Management of bipolar disorder in many ways is similar to the management of schizophrenia in that the goals in the treatment of both disorders are to avoid rehospitalization, manage behavioral symptoms, and promote functional recovery. This review will define functional recovery in bipolar disorder, discuss relapse prevention, and consider some implications for treatment. The most notable implication for treatment is that clinicians need to use stricter criteria when defining recovery in bipolar disorder. Recovery should not be defined merely by symptomatic remission or even syndromal remission; rather, recovery should include symptomatic recovery, syndromal recovery, functional recovery, and a return to an acceptable quality of life for the patient.

### Self-management and bipolar disorder — a clinician's guide to the literature 2011–2014 [^116XN7a4]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2014). Low credibility.

This review provides clinicians and individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) with an overview of evidence-based skills shown to be effective in BD and amenable to self-management, including psychoeducation; monitoring moods, medications, and social function; sleep hygiene; setting goals and relapse plans; and healthy lifestyles (physical activity, healthy eating, weight loss and management, medical comorbidities). Currently available self-management resources for BD are summarized by mode of delivery, such as workbooks, mobile technologies, internet, and peer-led interventions. Regardless of the self-management intervention or topic, the research suggests that personally tailored interventions of longer duration and greater frequency may be necessary to achieve the maximal benefit among individuals with BD. Means to support these self-management interventions as self-sustaining entities are critically needed. Hopefully, the recent investment in patient-centered research and care will result in best practices for the self-management of BD by mode of delivery. Since self-management of BD should complement rather than replace medical care, clinicians need to partner with their patients to incorporate and support advances in self-management for individuals with BD.
