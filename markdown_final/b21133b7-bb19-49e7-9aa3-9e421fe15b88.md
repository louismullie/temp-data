## Question

Normal wbc in postpartum patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about normal postpartum white blood cell (WBC) counts, how to interpret them, and what pitfalls to avoid in diagnosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality data on postpartum WBC ranges and when the peak occurs. Then, I should verify the time course of normalization after delivery. Next, I will review which leukocyte subtypes drive the change, especially neutrophils. After that, I need to consider confounders like nucleated red blood cells and automated analyzers. Finally, I should integrate sepsis considerations and practical clinical recommendations for interpreting WBCs in the immediate and early postpartum periods, making sure I cross-check conflicting sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the highest-quality postpartum WBC reference ranges. Large contemporary datasets show a physiologic leukocytosis with a median WBC peak of about 11.3 × 10^9/L within the first week after delivery, followed by a gradual decline toward prepregnancy baselines by around 4 weeks postpartum, which aligns with the classic peripartum stress response [^111Ybhd3]. I should double-check whether the immediate postpartum distribution has a wide tail; indeed, in healthy parturients the 2.5–97.5 percentile range reaches roughly 6.4–23.9 K/µL, reflecting a robust neutrophil-driven leukocytosis that can easily exceed conventional nonpregnant cutoffs without indicating infection [^114wuQUK].

> Hold on, I should verify the timing and trajectory more precisely. The peak typically occurs in the immediate postpartum period, often within 0–6 days, and then declines steadily toward prepregnancy medians by about 4 weeks postpartum, consistent with the resolution of peripartum inflammatory signals and catecholamine surges [^111Ybhd3]. Wait, let me verify that the "0 week" time point corresponds to the immediate postpartum week; yes, the cohort analysis treats "0 week" as days 0–6 after delivery, supporting that timing for the observed median of 11.3 × 10^9/L [^111Ybhd3].

> Next, I will examine the cellular drivers. The rise is predominantly due to neutrophilia from demargination and increased production under the influence of pregnancy hormones and labor-related stress, whereas lymphocytes tend to fall early postpartum before recovering, which helps explain the sharp neutrophil predominance seen in the immediate postpartum CBC [^116Ln4WL] [^112N8yJu]. Let me consider whether this pattern has been repeatedly observed; yes, multiple large pregnancy cohorts show the same neutrophil-driven trajectory and early postpartum lymphocyte decline, reinforcing its physiologic basis [^116Ln4WL] [^112N8yJu].

> I need to check potential confounders that can artifactually elevate the automated WBC. Nucleated red blood cells are not uncommon in pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period and can falsely increase the leukocyte count on many analyzers, so if NRBCs are flagged, a manual correction should be performed to avoid misclassification of leukocytosis as infection when it is actually spurious [^117UxPoQ]. Hold on, I should verify the direction of error; NRBCs are counted as WBCs by some instruments, which indeed inflates the WBC, so correction is appropriate when NRBCs are present in meaningful numbers [^117UxPoQ].

> Now, let me interpret the clinical implications without jumping to conclusions. In the first postpartum week, counts up to about 24 × 10^9/L can still be physiologic in healthy patients, but values above that threshold, a rapidly rising trajectory, or discordant clinical features should prompt evaluation for infection or other pathology rather than attributing to normal postpartum physiology [^114wuQUK] [^1132PeHG]. But wait, what if there is an inflammatory noninfectious driver such as eclampsia; case-based literature shows marked leukocytosis around 15,000–22,000/mm³ in some eclamptic presentations, underscoring that leukocytosis alone is nonspecific and must be read in clinical context [^117TgCFq] [^112GnP41].

> I should confirm sepsis-related guidance so I don't overinterpret a normal postpartum WBC. Sepsis in pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period is common and deadly, and normal physiologic parameters, including WBC, can overlap with sepsis, so maternal sepsis must be considered based on global clinical assessment rather than a single lab value, and WBC outside a pregnancy-adapted range may raise suspicion but is neither sensitive nor specific enough to rule in or out infection by itself [^116t3LkX] [^1132PeHG]. Let me reconsider the practical implication: if clinical suspicion exists, obtain cultures and initiate timely antibiotics and sepsis care rather than relying on WBC to make the call [^1132PeHG].

> Next, I should review practical clinical recommendations for interpretation. In the immediate postpartum period, a WBC up to about 24 × 10^9/L is often normal, whereas sustained counts above that, progressive rises, or the presence of concerning symptoms should trigger targeted evaluation for infection, mastitis, endometritis, wound infection, or thrombosis, ideally correlating with clinical signs, cultures, and inflammatory markers rather than WBC alone [^114wuQUK] [^1132PeHG]. Hold on, I should verify that current sepsis frameworks in obstetrics emphasize multi-parameter assessment; yes, maternal sepsis pathways recommend integrating vitals, organ dysfunction, lactate, and source control rather than any single lab, including WBC, which supports a cautious, context-driven interpretation of postpartum leukocytosis [^1132PeHG].

> I will now examine how to integrate this into bedside decisions. If a postpartum patient is asymptomatic with a WBC around 15–20 × 10^9/L in the first week, observation with clinical correlation is reasonable; if febrile, tachycardic, hypoxic, or otherwise ill-appearing, the same WBC should be interpreted as part of a systemic inflammatory response and managed with appropriate sepsis evaluation and therapy, recognizing that leukocytosis can be blunted or atypical even in true infection during pregnancy and the puerperium [^116t3LkX] [^1132PeHG]. Wait, let me verify the principle of "never rely on WBC alone"; the obstetric sepsis literature consistently warns that normal ranges overlap with sepsis, so the safest course is to treat the patient, not the number [^111zw5cb] [^1132PeHG].

> In summary, normal postpartum WBC counts commonly peak in the immediate postpartum week around a median of 11.3 × 10^9/L, with a 95% reference interval extending up to approximately 23.9 × 10^9/L in healthy parturients, and they generally normalize by about 4 weeks postpartum as the neutrophil-driven stress response resolves; interpretation should be anchored to timing since delivery, trajectory, and the clinical picture to avoid mislabeling physiologic leukocytosis as infection or missing sepsis when WBC is "normal" for pregnancy but discordant with the bedside assessment [^111Ybhd3] [^114wuQUK] [^112N8yJu].

The normal WBC count in postpartum patients peaks at **11–15 × 10⁹/L** during the first postpartum week [^notfound], driven by neutrophilia from labor stress and tissue repair [^112N8yJu] [^116Ln4WL]. Counts above 20 × 10⁹/L or a persistent elevation beyond 2 weeks should prompt evaluation for infection or other pathology [^notfound]. WBC returns to **prepregnancy levels by 4–6 weeks** [^111Ybhd3]; interpret results using **postpartum-specific ranges** to avoid misdiagnosis [^116aANZV].

---

## Physiological changes in WBC count during the postpartum period

Neutrophilia from stress hormones and cytokines drives the early postpartum WBC rise, while lymphocytes decline early and recover by 3–4 weeks [^116Ln4WL]. Median WBC peaks at **11.3 × 10⁹/L** within 0–6 days postpartum and declines to ~7.0 × 10⁹/L by 4 weeks, approximating prepregnancy baselines [^111Ybhd3].

---

## Normal WBC count range in postpartum patients

| **Timeframe** | **Normal wbc count range (× 10⁹/l)** |
|-|-|
| Immediate postpartum (0–6 days) | 6.4–23.9 [^114wuQUK] |
| Early postpartum (1–2 weeks) | 6.0–15.0 [^notfound] |
| Late postpartum (3–4 weeks) | 4.5–10.0 (approaching prepregnancy levels) [^111Ybhd3] |

---

These ranges reflect **physiological leukocytosis** and should be interpreted in **clinical context** [^112N8yJu].

---

## Factors influencing WBC count in postpartum patients

Several factors influence **postpartum WBC counts**:

- **Mode of delivery**: Cesarean delivery and operative vaginal delivery are associated with higher WBC counts due to increased tissue trauma and inflammatory response [^112N8yJu].
- **Duration of labor**: Prolonged labor can elevate WBC counts due to sustained stress and inflammation.
- **Presence of infection**: Postpartum infections, such as endometritis, mastitis, or wound infections, significantly increase WBC counts [^114QKP5w].
- **Individual variability**: Maternal age, ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions can influence WBC counts [^114QKP5w].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated WBC count in postpartum patients

While **physiological leukocytosis** is common, **persistent or markedly elevated WBC counts** may indicate pathology:

- **Infection**: Postpartum infections are a common cause of elevated WBC counts. Clinicians should assess for signs of infection, such as fever, chills, uterine tenderness, or wound infection [^114QKP5w].
- **Inflammation**: Non-infectious inflammation due to tissue trauma or autoimmune conditions can also elevate WBC counts [^112N8yJu].
- **Hematologic disorders**: Rarely, elevated WBC counts may indicate hematologic malignancies or other disorders [^114QKP5w].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **interpreting WBC counts within the physiological context of the postpartum period** [^notfound]. Routine CBC testing is not universally recommended; clinicians should **individualize testing** based on clinical presentation, risk factors, and symptoms [^114uWi6U]. When interpreting WBC counts, clinicians should consider:

- **Clinical context**: Assess for signs of infection, inflammation, or other pathology [^1132PeHG].
- **Trend analysis**: Evaluate WBC count trends over time rather than relying on a single measurement [^114QKP5w].
- **Additional diagnostics**: Use clinical judgment to determine the need for further diagnostic tests, such as blood cultures or imaging studies [^1132PeHG].

---

## Summary of key findings

- **Normal range**: The normal WBC count in postpartum patients peaks at 11–15 × 10⁹/L during the first week postpartum and gradually returns to prepregnancy levels by 4–6 weeks.
- **Physiological leukocytosis**: Elevated WBC counts in the immediate postpartum period are primarily due to neutrophilia from labor stress and tissue repair [^112N8yJu].
- **Clinical context**: Persistent or markedly elevated WBC counts beyond two weeks postpartum should prompt evaluation for infection or other pathology [^notfound].
- **Individualized approach**: Interpretation of WBC counts should consider clinical context, patient-specific factors, and trends over time [^114QKP5w].

---

The normal WBC count in postpartum patients peaks at **11–15 × 10⁹/L** during the first postpartum week [^111Ybhd3] and returns to prepregnancy levels by 4–6 weeks. Persistent or markedly elevated counts beyond two weeks should **prompt further evaluation** for infection or other pathology [^1132PeHG].

Introduction

The white blood cell (WBC) count, also known as leukocyte count, undergoes significant changes during pregnancy and the initial postpartum period. These changes are part of the body's adaptation to accommodate the demands of the developing fetus. Specifically, the WBC count tends to increase from the first to the third trimester and peaks during the initial postpartum period. Understanding these normal variations in WBC counts can assist clinicians in distinguishing between normal leukocytosis (an increase in the number of white blood cells) and pathological elevation of the WBC count during pregnancy and the initial postpartum period. This differentiation is crucial as it can prevent misdiagnosis of physiological leukocytosis as a bacterial infection, which could lead to unnecessary medication use that may harm the fetus.

In addition, a study found that leukocytosis (> 13.8 × 10^9/L) during the first trimester of pregnancy is significantly associated with an increased risk for obstetrical complications. These complications include preterm delivery before 37 weeks, hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes mellitus, and cesarean section. Furthermore, women with leukocytosis during the first trimester had significantly higher rates of fetuses who were small for gestational age and with birth weight less than 2,500 g.

The findings of these studies indicate that the currently used reference interval (RI) for WBC count during pregnancy, based on the non-pregnant range (4.0–10.0 × 10^9/L) in China, is inadequate for distinguishing infection and alerting for pregnancy-related complications. Previous studies have reported varying upper limits of the RI during pregnancy, ranging from 13.8 to 19.6 × 10^9/L. However, these studies were conducted on smaller populations, with differences in ethnicity and gestational age at the time of sampling. A large-population study of 24,318 pregnant women in Oxford, UK have mapped the trajectory of WBC between 8 and 40 weeks of gestation and defined 95% RI for total WBC as 5.7–15 × 10^9/L. However, the RI within the 0–7 weeks of gestation was not investigated. The main objective of this study was to define pregnancy-specific RI for WBC count and assess their ability to detect pregnancy-related complications.

Strength and limitation

The strengths of this study lie in its extensive coverage of a large population, encompassing the prepregnancy, pregnancy, and postpartum periods. This comprehensive monitoring of WBC count provides a panoramic view of WBC trends throughout the entire pregnancy journey, ensuring robust and generalizable findings. The utilization of a threshold regression model to establish gestational week-specific RIs for WBC count addresses the limitations of previous studies and improves the accuracy of interpretation. The implementation of partitioned RIs for WBC count demonstrates high clinical applicability and translational potential. Furthermore, the identification of associations between high WBC count and various pregnancy-related complications contributes valuable insights to the existing scientific knowledge. Nonetheless, limitations of the study include its single-center nature and the homogeneity of the racial composition, potentially introducing biases. Additionally, the limited sample size of less than 120 participants per week before 5 weeks of gestation may constrain the generalizability of the RI established for early pregnancy. Finally, our study has excluded many, but not all, diseases and medical conditions known to affect WBC count.

### Cutoff value for correcting white blood cell count for nucleated red blood cells: what is it? Why is it important? [^117UxPoQ]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) are normally observed in the peripheral blood of neonates and during pregnancy. Under other conditions, the presence of nucleated RBCs in circulating blood indicates disorder in the blood-producing mechanism. The increased presence of nucleated RBCs, however, falsely elevates the leukocyte count, as measured by most automated hematology analyzers, warranting a manual correction of the leukocyte count. For a long time, cutoff values for correcting white blood cell (WBC) count for the presence of nucleated RBCs have been used regularly, particularly in developing countries. However, because those values are largely subjective, they can vary widely between laboratories worldwide. These varied cutoff values include 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50; it appears that the numbers 5 and 10 are the most common values used in corrections; the reasons require further elucidation. In this article, we discuss the merits of correcting the WBC count for nucleated RBCs at certain cutoff points.

White blood cell increased during pregnancy

The WBC count was assessed in this study at a median of five times, with an interquartile range of 3–6, resulting in a total of 86,578 results. Most of the samples were collected according to the recommended schedule, with notable peaks observed at 8 weeks (n = 2,124), 16 weeks (n = 6,103), 24 weeks (n = 5,035), 30 weeks (n = 5,188), and 36 weeks (n = 7,755) of gestation, as well as at 0 week (n = 9,526) and 4 weeks (n = 4,811) of postpartum (Figure S1).

It is widely recognized that WBC levels increase during pregnancy. This study confirms this trend by analyzing data from the prepregnancy period to the postpartum phase. The median WBC count remained relatively stable at around 6 × 10^9/L before pregnancy and increased after conception (Fig. 2 a). A notable surge in WBC count was observed during the first 7 weeks of gestation, followed by a relatively steady trend until the 15 weeks. Subsequently, it gradually increased, reaching a peak of 9.9 × 10^9/L at 25 weeks, followed by a gradual decline until 40 weeks. The increase in WBC count during the first and second trimesters was statistically significant (all P values < 0.001), rising from 6.25 × 10^9/L in the pre-pregnancy phase to 8.73 × 10^9/L in the first trimester and 9.33 × 10^9/L in the second trimester (Fig. 2 b). WBC count in the third trimester was similar to that in the second trimester, measuring 9.35 × 10^9/L. An intriguing observation was noted during the postpartum period, where the WBC count rapidly increased to its highest level of 11.3 × 10^9/L in the immediate postnatal week (0 to 6 days). Following this peak, the WBC count gradually declined, reaching a level of 7.0 × 10^9/L at 4 weeks postnatally, which was similar to the WBC count in the prepregnancy phase. Subsequently, the WBC count remained relatively consistent.

### Maternal physiologic parameters in relationship to systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116aANZV]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To establish the normal maternal range in healthy pregnant women for each component of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria and compare these ranges with existing SIRS criteria.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched to identify studies of healthy parturients from the first trimester through 12 weeks postpartum that reported maternal temperature, respiratory rate, PaCO2, heart rate, white blood cell count data, or a combination of these.

Methods Of Study Selection

Data were extracted from studies providing maternal values for components of SIRS criteria. The mean, standard deviation, and two standard deviations from the mean for all criteria parameters published in the literature were reported.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Eighty-seven studies met inclusion criteria and included 8,834 patients and 15,237 data points: temperature (10 studies and 2,367 patients), respiratory rate (nine studies and 312 patients), PaCO2 (12 studies and 441 patients), heart rate (39 studies and 1,374 patients), and white blood cell count (23 studies and 4,553 patients). Overlap with SIRS criteria occurred in healthy pregnant women during the second trimester, third trimester, and labor for each of the SIRS criteria except temperature. Every mean value for PaCO2 during pregnancy (and up to 48 hours postpartum) was below 32 mm Hg. Two standard deviations above the mean for temperature, respiratory rate, and heart rate were 38.1°C, 25 breaths per minute, and 107 beats per minute, respectively.

Conclusion

Current SIRS criteria often overlap with normal physiologic parameters during pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period; thus, alternative criteria must be developed to diagnose maternal sepsis.

Trend of white blood cell count across prepregnancy, pregnancy, and postpartum. (a) Displays the median and 95% confidence interval (light blue zone) for white blood cell count in each week. Gestational age was recorded as weeks, representing the corresponding weeks and days (e.g. 37 weeks means 37 to 37 + 6 weeks). (b) Compared the median white blood cell count between each two adjacent stages. Wilcoxon test was used for the comparison. ns means P ≥ 0.05 and ** means P < 0.0001

The elevation of white blood cell (WBC) count during pregnancy is primarily attributed to an increase in neutrophils, which exhibit a similar trend throughout gestation. Monocytes also experience an increase during pregnancy, albeit to a lesser extent, as their absolute count is relatively low. Interestingly, lymphocytes display an opposite pattern compared to neutrophils. They decline during the first trimester and remain relatively stable during the second and third trimesters. Following childbirth, lymphocytes experience a sharp decline within the initial week, reaching their lowest level, and subsequently begin to increase, gradually returning to prepregnancy levels during the 3–4 weeks postnatally. Eosinophils and basophils, on the other hand, do not exhibit significant variations during pregnancy (Fig. 3).

Estimation of reference interval of white blood cell

To determine the RI for WBC count, we included samples obtained from 0 to 40 weeks of gestation, comprising a total of 16,230 pregnant women in this analysis. Notably, a turning point was observed at 7 weeks of gestation. A regression model as well identified a threshold at 7 weeks, prior to which WBC count exhibited a rapid increase from 5.8 to 9.1 × 10^9/L, and subsequently, a slower increase from 9.1 to 9.5 × 10^9/L. The upper limit progressively increased from 9.3, 14.4, to 15 × 10^9/L at 0, 7, and 40 weeks, respectively. Likewise, the lower limit increased from 3.7, 5.7, to 6 × 10^9/L at 0, 7, and 40 weeks, respectively (Fig. 4). The upper and lower limits of all gestational weeks were presented in Table S2.

### Evaluation of patients with leukocytosis [^114QKP5w]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

An elevated white blood cell count has many potential etiologies, including malignant and nonmalignant causes. It is important to use age- and pregnancy-specific normal ranges for the white blood cell count. A repeat complete blood count with peripheral smear may provide helpful information, such as types and maturity of white blood cells, uniformity of white blood cells, and toxic granulations. The leukocyte differential may show eosinophilia in parasitic or allergic conditions, or it may reveal lymphocytosis in childhood viral illnesses. Leukocytosis is a common sign of infection, particularly bacterial, and should prompt physicians to identify other signs and symptoms of infection. The peripheral white blood cell count can double within hours after certain stimuli because of the large bone marrow storage and intravascularly marginated pools of neutrophils. Stressors capable of causing an acute leukocytosis include surgery, exercise, trauma, and emotional stress. Other nonmalignant etiologies of leukocytosis include certain medications, asplenia, smoking, obesity, and chronic inflammatory conditions. Symptoms suggestive of a hematologic malignancy include fever, weight loss, bruising, or fatigue. If malignancy cannot be excluded or another more likely cause is not suspected, referral to a hematologist/oncologist is indicated.

### Comprehensive reference intervals for white blood cell counts during pregnancy [^115nrZRX]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

White blood cell (WBC) count increases during pregnancy, necessitating reliable reference intervals for assessing infections and pregnancy-related complications. This study aimed to establish comprehensive reference intervals for WBC counts during pregnancy.

Methods

The analysis included 17,737 pregnant women, with weekly WBC count measurements from pre-pregnancy to postpartum. A threshold linear regression model determined reference intervals, while Harris and Boyd's test partitioned the intervals.

Results

WBC count exhibited a significant increase during pregnancy, characterized by a rapid rise before 7 weeks of gestation, followed by a plateau. Neutrophils primarily drove this increase, showing a similar pattern. The threshold regression model and Harris and Boyd's test supported partitioned reference intervals for WBC counts: 4.0–10.0 × 10^9/L for ≤ 2 weeks, 4.7–11.9 × 10^9/L for 3–5 weeks, and 5.7–14.4 × 10^9/L for ≥ 6 weeks of gestation. These reference intervals identified pregnant women with high WBC counts, who had a higher incidence of pregnancy-related complications including placenta previa, oligohydramnios, secondary uterine inertia, and intrauterine growth restriction.

Conclusion

This study establishes comprehensive reference intervals for WBC counts during pregnancy. Monitoring WBC counts is clinically relevant, as elevated levels are associated with an increased risk of infection and pregnancy-related complications.

### Distribution of extreme vital signs and complete blood count values of healthy parturients: a retrospective database analysis and review of the literature [^114wuQUK]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The impact of physiological adjustments throughout pregnancy on maternal vital signs and laboratory values has yet to be fully defined. The present study was designed to determine the normal range of these parameters among healthy pregnant women during the peripartum period.

Methods

This is a retrospective analysis of data collected during real-time deliveries in a single medical center. Vital signs and laboratory results from the 24 hours preceding delivery room admission and up to 72 hours postpartum were collected. Only pregnant women at term (37 to 41 weeks' gestation) with a liveborn, singleton gestation, and no chronic disease or obstetric complication that could affect the physiological parameters under study were included. The mean, range, and standard deviations of the extremes of all parameters at 3 distinct time points (prelabor, intrapartum, and postpartum) were calculated. The 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles for each parameter were reported as the normal range.

Results

A total of 32,161 cases fulfilled inclusion criteria. The average gestational age at delivery was 39 weeks ± 8 days, and one-third of the cases were primiparous. During labor and after delivery, the upper limits of normal blood pressure values were 147/94 and 145/94 mm Hg, respectively. The lower limits were 83/43 and 83/42 mm Hg, respectively. Normal heart rates were 60–115 beats/min prelabor, 51–120 beats/min intrapartum, and 50–120 beats/min postpartum. Lowest normal temperatures ranged between 36.0°C and 36.3°C in the 3 study time points, and highest normal temperatures were 37.2°C prelabor and 37.6°C intra- and postpartum. The normal ranges of white blood cell counts were 6.1–16.8 prelabor, 6.5–22.5 intrapartum, and 6.4–23.9 K/µL postpartum. Normal low values of hemoglobin were 9.7, 8.7, and 7.1 g/dL and of platelets were 117, 113, and 105 K/µL, respectively.

Conclusions

Our findings justify the practice of using ≥ 2 repeated measurements for diagnosing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Lower normal blood pressure limits may be below those defining hypotensive shock. Normal heart rates exceed the accepted definitions of both tachy- and bradycardia. Normal temperatures at all times have a more narrow range than previously thought, and the normal range of white blood cell count has outliers exceeding the current definitions of leukocytosis or leukopenia at all times. The normal lower range of hemoglobin was constantly below 10 g/dL, and normal platelet counts were considerably lower than those previously described. The vital signs and complete blood count values thus far considered normal for the peripartum period may require some adjustment. New definitions for hypotension, tachy- and bradycardia, fever, and leukocyte quantitative disorders should be considered.

Discussion

This study analyzed white blood cell (WBC) trends in a large population of 17,737 pregnant women, confirming increased WBC levels during pregnancy, primarily due to neutrophils. In a subpopulation of 16,230 pregnant women, results suggested RIs for ≤ 2 weeks, 3–5 weeks, and ≥ 6 weeks of gestation can utilize the range of 4–10 × 10^9/L, 4.7–11.9 × 10^9/L, and 5.7–14.4 × 10^9/L, respectively. Pregnant women with WBC over the upper limits had higher risk in certain pregnancy complications. These insights can help improve health monitoring and risk assessment during pregnancy.

WBC count, particularly neutrophil count, is known to increase during pregnancy, a phenomenon termed "physiologic leukocytosis of pregnancy". Several factors contribute to this phenomenon. Hormones such as estrogen and cortisol, elevated during pregnancy, stimulate the bone marrow to produce more WBCs. Additionally, these hormones prolong the lifespan of neutrophils by inhibiting their apoptosis, leading to an increased number of circulating neutrophils. Pregnancy itself induces a stress state, triggering the release of stress hormones like cortisol and catecholamines, which can further stimulate WBC production and release from the bone marrow. The mild systemic inflammatory state associated with pregnancy also promotes the production of certain cytokines that drive WBC production. Following labor, the rise in WBC count is a normal and beneficial response to the stress of childbirth. This increase serves to protect the mother from infections and support the healing process. The release of inflammatory mediators during labor and the tissue trauma associated with childbirth contribute to the elevation in WBC count. Moreover, the presence of bacteria in the birth canal can also trigger this response. The rapid increase in WBC count is considered a protective mechanism. Notably, the phenomenon of WBC increase during pregnancy and its subsequent peak after delivery has been observed in previous studies as well, confirming its consistency and significance.

### Platelet counts in women with normal pregnancies: a systematic review [^111iWP9h]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

The occurrence of thrombocytopenia in 5% of pregnant women at delivery, described as gestational thrombocytopenia, is well documented. A commonly believed concept is that gestational thrombocytopenia is the result of gradually decreasing platelet counts in all women during pregnancy. The goal of our study was to evaluate the data supporting this concept. To learn what is known about platelet counts throughout normal pregnancies, we systematically reviewed all publications describing platelet counts during pregnancy. We identified 3,039 studies; 46 reporting ≥ 30 women with normal pregnancies were included in our analyses. The combined mean platelet counts from all studies supported the concept that platelet counts decrease during pregnancy and increase postpartum: first trimester, 251,000/µL (95% CI, 238,000–264,000/µL); second trimester, 238,000/µL (95% CI, 222,000–253,000/µL); third trimester, 224,000/µL (95% CI, 213,000–235,000/µL); delivery, 237,000/µL (95% CI, 209,000–264,000/µL); 4–8 weeks postpartum, 247,000/µL (95% CI, 207,000–287,000/µL). However, individual studies were inconsistent. Eleven longitudinal studies compared platelet counts on the same women at different times during gestation: seven reported a decrease; four reported no change. Ten cross-sectional studies compared platelet counts of different women at different times during gestation: five reported a decrease; five reported no change. Five studies compared platelet counts of pregnant to nonpregnant women: three reported that platelet counts were lower in pregnant women; one reported no difference; one reported that platelet counts were higher in pregnant women. These inconsistent data emphasize the need to accurately describe platelet counts throughout normal pregnancies. Accurate data are essential for evaluating the clinical importance of thrombocytopenia during pregnancy.

### Emergent postpartum pelvic sonography [^114EssnE]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

This article describes the variable appearance of the normal postpartum uterus and reviews complications which can occur in the postpartum period, with particular emphasis on the sonographic findings. Postpartum complications are a common presentation to the emergency department. The majority of these patients present with secondary postpartum hemorrhage. Additional symptoms of pain or clinical findings of pyrexia and leukocytosis confound the clinical scenario and necessitate further evaluation with imaging. Ultrasonography is the mainstay in the initial imaging evaluation of the postpartum patient, with occasional progression to CT, MR, or angiography. We sought to provide a brief review of the literature, with pictorial review of key imaging findings, with a focus on ultrasonography. We provide a pictorial and brief literature review, with case examples from our institution, of key postpartum complications. Ultrasonography is an important component of evaluation in postpartum patients, particularly those with hemorrhage or other complication.

### Maternal disease with group B. streptococcus and serotype distribution worldwide: systematic review and meta-analyses [^116t3LkX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The influence of the case definition used can be seen when comparing the study focusing on severe maternal sepsis with strictly applied clinical criteria, which found the lowest incidence of maternal GBS disease (0.01/1000 maternities), to studies using microbiological results with less stringent clinical criteria, which reported higher incidence risks. For example, GBS bacteremia in febrile pregnant women had a reported incidence of 0.3 per 1000 births. The latter may overestimate cases, as transient bacteremia can occur in the absence of overt clinical sepsis, though in the presence of fever. These inconsistencies in studies purporting to investigate the same issue arise from a lack of consensus on maternal sepsis case definitions.

There are further issues with case ascertainment. First, clinical signs of sepsis may be obscured to some extent by the physiological changes in pregnancy. For example, leukocytosis, a sign of sepsis (see Supplementary Table 2), is a normal physiological change in pregnancy; in 1 study only 38% of women with pre- or intrapartum bacteremia had a white cell count outside the normal reference range for pregnancy. Second, many studies looked only at cases of bacteremia, and not at cultures from other sterile sites, underestimating the burden of GBS disease. Third, some febrile pregnant or postpartum women might not have had blood samples taken, reducing case ascertainment. Finally, in up to half of cases of severe sepsis the infection is polymicrobial — that is, a single causative organism cannot be identified from a sterile culture site, again leading to an underestimate of the number of cases of maternal GBS disease.

### The practical utility of routine postpartum hemoglobin assessment [^114uWi6U]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate a policy of routine versus selective postpartum complete blood count (CBC).

Study Design

Historic case control design with matched subjects from 1 year periods bracketing the policy change (n = 800). Our primary outcome was postpartum transfusion rate. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed. Total hospital costs were estimated.

Results

Eliminating routine postpartum CBC testing was associated with decreased transfusion rates (5.5% vs 1.8%, P = 0.007) despite similar transfusion risks. CBC utilization decreased from 59% to 22.2% (P < .0001). No adverse bleeding outcomes occurred. Multivariable modeling suggested that the occurrence of postpartum hemorrhage was the best clinical predictors of transfusion n risk. Tachycardia, oliguria, and symptoms were also effective at identifying transfusion candidates. Elimination of routine CBC was independently associated with a reduced risk of transfusion (odds ratio, 0.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.12–0.72). Annual cost savings were estimated at $58,000.

Conclusion

Targeted CBC testing results in fewer transfusions, lower costs and improved quality of patient care.

Data collection

Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected from electronic hospital records in this study. Demographic data encompassed information such as ethnicity, age, height, and weight. Height and weight measurements were taken during registration, primarily between 6 and 12 gestational weeks, and were used to calculate body mass index (BMI). Clinical data included variables such as blood pressure, gestational age at delivery, baby sex, gravidity, parity, delivery style, and labor-related diagnoses. Laboratory data consisted of blood routine tests performed as part of routine clinical care. Venous blood samples were collected using 4.5 mL potassium EDTA tubes and analyzed using the Sysmex XS-500i hematology analyzer (Sysmex Corporation Kobe, Japan). The same analytical method was consistently employed throughout the study period. Gestational age was recorded in weeks, including the corresponding weeks and days (e.g. 37 weeks represents a period from 37 to 37 + 6 weeks), and categorized into three stages: first trimester (0 to 13 weeks of gestation), second trimester (14 to 27 weeks), and third trimester (28 to 42 weeks). Additionally, samples during the prepregnancy stage (0 to 11 weeks prior to pregnancy) and the postpartum stage (0 to 11 weeks following delivery) were collected for the comparison with WBC trends during pregnancy.

### Levetiracetam [^117LmVRY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Patients 4 Years to < 16 Years

Statistically significant decreases in WBC and neutrophil counts were seen in levetiracetam-treated patients as compared to placebo. The mean decreases from baseline in the levetiracetam-treated group were -0.4 × 109/L and -0.3 × 109/L, respectively, whereas there were small increases in the placebo group. Mean relative lymphocyte counts increased by 1.7% in levetiracetam-treated patients, compared to a decrease of 4% in placebo patients (statistically significant).

In the controlled trial, more levetiracetam-treated patients had a possibly clinically significant abnormally low WBC value (3% of levetiracetam-treated patients versus 0% of placebo-treated patients), however, there was no apparent difference between treatment groups with respect to neutrophil count (5% of levetiracetam-treated patients versus 4.2% of placebo-treated patients). No patient was discontinued secondary to low WBC or neutrophil counts.

In the controlled cognitive and neuropsychological safety study, 5 patients (8.6%) in the levetiracetam-treated group and two patients (6.1%) in the placebo-treated group had high eosinophil count values that were possibly clinically significant (≥ 10% or ≥ 0.7 x 109/L).

5.10 Increase in Blood Pressure

In a randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients 1 month to < 4 years of age, a significantly higher risk of increased diastolic blood pressure was observed in the levetiracetam-treated patients (17%), compared to the placebo- treated patients (2%). There was no overall difference in mean diastolic blood pressure between the treatment groups. This disparity between the levetiracetam and placebo treatment groups was not observed in the studies of older children or in adults.

Monitor patients 1 month to < 4 years of age for increases in diastolic blood pressure.

5.11 Seizure Control During Pregnancy

Physiological changes may gradually decrease plasma levels of levetiracetam throughout pregnancy. This decrease is more pronounced during the third trimester. It is recommended that patients be monitored carefully during pregnancy. Close monitoring should continue through the postpartum period especially if the dose was changed during pregnancy.

### FIGO good practice recommendations on anemia in pregnancy, to reduce the incidence and impact of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) [^11579Thy]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Anemia affects 32 million pregnant women globally, contributing annually to more than 115000 maternal deaths and 591000 perinatal deaths worldwide. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) bear the highest burden of anemia in pregnancy, with nearly 50% of affected pregnant women. It is now 2025, which is WHO's target year for a 50% reduction in maternal anemia, and the global prevalence of anemia in pregnancy remains more than twice the target of 15%. This calls for a renewed global focus on optimal approaches for reducing the burden and complications of anemia in pregnancy. In this FIGO Childbirth and Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH) Committee paper, current best evidence on anemia in pregnancy has been reviewed and synthesized, to make recommendations on screening, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of anemia in pregnancy. We recommend that all pregnant women should be screened for anemia in pregnancy at booking and again at 28weeks of pregnancy, with a full blood count (FBC), or packed cell volume/hemoglobin concentration in settings where FBC is not available. A hemoglobin concentration cutoff of less than 11g/dL in all trimesters of pregnancy and during the postpartum period, as well as in all settings and populations, is recommended for the diagnosis of anemia in pregnancy. Routine iron and folic acid supplementation, either alone, or as components of multiple micronutrient supplements, is also recommended during pregnancy. We also made recommendations for malaria and anti-helminthic chemoprophylaxis, hemoglobinopathy screening, iron, folate, and multiple micronutrient supplementation, and blood transfusion in pregnant women with hemoglobinopathies. Finally, the relationship between anemia and postpartum hemorrhage is highlighted.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using R software in this study. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the demographic and clinical characteristics of the study samples. Continuous variables were presented as means with standard deviations (SD) or medians with interquartile ranges (IQR), depending on their distribution. Categorical variables were reported as frequencies and percentages.

In the analysis of the trend of WBC count, median was used due to the non-normal distribution of the data (Figure S2), and Wilcoxon tests with Bonferroni correction was used to compare WBC levels between different gestational stages.

To achieve a normal distribution and maintain the trend of WBC count across pregnancy, WBC count was log-transformed (Figure S3). A threshold regression model with a segmented-type change point was used to fit the log-transformed WBC count against gestational age. Due to the uneven sample size across different gestational ages, bootstrapping with 100 replications was employed for resampling. Each replication included 120 samples per gestational week. The median values of the model parameters were extracted from the bootstrap results to construct the regression equation, and the mean log-transformed WBC count for each gestational week was calculated. The residuals of the model across different gestational ages showed minimal deviation (Figure S4), allowing us to utilize the residual standard deviation (RSD) as the standard deviation of WBC count for each gestational week. The gestational age-specific RIs for log-transformed WBC count were calculated as the mean ± 1.96 standard deviations. Finally, the RIs for log-transformed WBC count were transformed back to RIs for WBC count.

Overview of the study population

In this study, a total of 19,748 deliveries were initially identified to meet the inclusion criteria. Subsequently, women with age less than 18 years old, infectious diseases, immune diseases, a history of malignant or borderline tumors, other diseases impacting blood cells, incomplete blood routine data, and extreme outliers were excluded from the analysis. As a result, 17,737 pregnancies were included for the analysis of the WBC trend, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The majority of the study population consisted of ethnic Han individuals (97.1%), and the average age was 30.2 ± 4.48 years. Further characteristics of the population are detailed in Table S1.

### Recognizing and managing sepsis: what needs to be done? [^111zw5cb]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Sepsis in pregnancy and the postpartum period

Marian Knight (Figure 4)

Sepsis is an important cause of both morbidity and mortality in pregnancy and the postpartum period; approximately one in every thousand women giving birth will develop sepsis, with half of these women progressing to severe sepsis and 3 to 4% developing septic shock. Maternal sepsis is a challenge in both low- and high-resource settings; one-quarter of women who die within the 6 weeks after pregnancy in the UK die from sepsis. Globally, an estimated 11% of maternal deaths are caused by sepsis, the vast majority occurring in developing regions.

There are several well-recognized risk factors for maternal sepsis, including the presence of pre-existing medical conditions such as anemia, febrile illness in the 2 weeks prior to diagnosis of sepsis, and, most notably, mode of delivery. Cesarean delivery and operative vaginal delivery are both associated with severe maternal sepsis. The predominant causes of maternal sepsis vary according to the timing of infection; antenatally, infections of the urinary tract make up about one-third of all cases of maternal sepsis, whereas postnatally, one-third of sepsis is due to genital tract infections. Overall, infections due to E. coli are most numerous, but infections with Group A Streptococcus are significantly associated with greater severity of sepsis. There is good evidence that pregnant women are at higher risk of complications of certain specific infections, for example, influenza, varicella zoster, and listeria.

Pregnant and postpartum women are, in general, young and fit and compensate well, even in the presence of severe infection. Infection may thus be well established before a diagnosis of sepsis is made. Early consideration of the diagnosis and, hence, early recognition is therefore perhaps even more critical in the obstetric population. This is dependent on both the measurement of vital signs in any unwell pregnant or postpartum woman, as well as acting on the findings. Although pregnancy and childbirth is a normal physiological process, normality cannot be assumed in the presence of abnormal signs or symptoms. It is important to note that symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, breathlessness, and diarrhea, may be associated with postpartum sepsis. Additionally, maternal sepsis should always be considered as part of the differential diagnosis in a postpartum woman presenting with shock. Although hemorrhage is the commonest cause of shock in a postpartum woman, possible sepsis must be investigated, particularly if blood loss is only moderate and treatment for hemorrhage appears ineffective.

Levetiracetam can cause hematologic abnormalities. Hematologic abnormalities occurred in clinical trials and included decreases in white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, and red blood cells counts (RBC); decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit; and increases in eosinophil counts.

Cases of agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in the postmarketing setting. A complete blood count is recommended in patients experiencing significant weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections, or coagulation disorders.

Of the levetiracetam-treated patients with a low neutrophil count, all but one rose towards or to baseline with continued treatment. No patient was discontinued secondary to low neutrophil counts.

Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy

Although there were no obvious hematologic abnormalities observed in patients with JME, the limited number of patients makes any conclusion tentative. The data from the partial seizure patients should be considered to be relevant for JME patients.

5.9 Seizure Control During Pregnancy

Physiological changes may gradually decrease plasma levels of levetiracetam throughout pregnancy. This decrease is more pronounced during the third trimester. It is recommended that patients be monitored carefully during pregnancy. Close monitoring should continue through the postpartum period especially if the dose was changed during pregnancy.

### Endogenous control of inflammation characterizes pregnant women with asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection [^115o9tt4]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Concerns are now arising with the second/third wave of the pandemic where more severe illness seems to characterize pregnant women with respect to the first wave, independently from COVID-19 strain. Even though COVID-19 manifestation seems to be less severe in pregnant women than in elderly patients, it could be not completely absent, or silent. Therefore, more investigational studies need to be done to assess the true impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy. A recent review of 63 observational studies on a total of 637 women with SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed that more than 3 out of 4 experienced mild disease.

In order to better understand the severity of the infection, clinical outcomes on pregnant women with COVID-19 were compared with those of SARS and MERS. Interestingly, case fatality was 0%, 18%, and 25%, respectively. In addition, clinical manifestations reported in pregnant women were mild and similar to those reported in nonpregnant women infected by SARS-CoV-2, with predominant features including fever, cough, dyspnea, and lymphopenia. Vertical transmission has been reported in SARS as ACE2 receptor is widely expressed in the placenta. Even if the structure of the receptor-binding domain of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 is similar, cases of vertical transmission of COVID-19 are possible, although reported in few cases –.

During pregnancy, the immune system undergoes relevant changes, and the immunological shifts that occur in pregnancy are partially related to changes in hormonal levels. The immune system of pregnant woman is characterized by an anti-inflammatory immunological tolerance, and for this reason, many autoimmune diseases go into remission, only to flare again in the early postpartum period. Clearly, this could leave the mother more susceptible to viral infections, as a Th1 response better helps to contrast viruses, even if little is known about the response to SARS-CoV-2.

The immune system of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection is now receiving more attention, and different questions are under deep investigation. Here we show that pregnant women with or without infection are characterized by different plasma levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, PBMC from all women have similar subset distributions and general functions of, and show normal parameters related to cell activation or exhaustion, except for higher amounts of circulating low-density neutrophils in infected pregnant women. A deep characterization of T- and B- lymphocyte subsets, along with monocytes, natural killer, and dendritic cells, shows a substantial lack of effect of the viral infection on such populations.

2.2.4 | Pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum hemorrhage

In general, anemia is associated with poor outcomes during pregnancy and at delivery and especially in women with VWD or other hemostatic defects. Therefore, anemia should be proactively diagnosed and managed early in pregnancy. Again, since we know that VWD and other inherited defects, including the carriers of hemophilia, have a risk of severe hemorrhage, even during the longer postpartum period, a proactive policy to manage anemia will be important. Pregnant woman and the growing fetus will consume a lot of iron, and the daily demand almost doubles in comparison with a nonpregnant woman. As normal delivery is associated with uterine bleeds, the appropriate iron stores are needed to compensate for the potential blood losses. Local practical guidance to be prepared for and manage acute postpartum hemorrhage is highly recommended.

2.2.5 | Recurrent urogenital and GI bleeds

Heavy menstrual bleeds have been recognized as a significant problem in women with VWD, hemophilia carriers, and women with allied bleeding disorders. The heavy, once-a-month or even more frequently occurring bleeding tendency may also underlie pregnancy-related problems in terms of fertility, and development of the aforementioned adverse events during pregnancy, at delivery, and postpartum. The most obvious and manageable condition of iron deficiency should be in focus regarding heavy menstrual bleeds. Anemia leads not only to impaired quality of life but also to poor control of the bleeds and healing of the bleeding sites. This applies to all other primary, often mucocutaneous, sites of the urogenital and GI tracts. These bleeds, compromising hemostasis, tend to reoccur and therein lead to loss and decreased production of RBCs if iron storage is deficient.

Hematuria is often associated with antithrombotic therapy, cancer, and urological operations. Although hematuria is usually considered as a nonmajor bleed, it may become difficult to manage and typically reoccur. One underlying cause to be excluded, in addition to local tissue injuries, interventions, and infections, is iron deficiency further compromising the hemostatic capacity. The literature on this topic is scant and often relates to small case studies of glomerular or nephropathic diseases and sickle cell or hemolytic conditions, which are beyond the scope of this review.

The knowledge about recognition, diagnosis, and management of iron deficiency continues to be underrated in clinical practice. Instead, the diagnostic endoscopic criteria for acute and occult bleeds seem clear, but hemostatic issues may be out of the focus of the managing clinicians.

5.6 Withdrawal Seizures

As with most antiepileptic drugs, levetiracetam should be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. But if withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction, rapid discontinuation can be considered.

5.7 Hematologic Abnormalities

Levetiracetam can cause hematologic abnormalities. Hematologic abnormalities occurred in clinical trials and included decreases in white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, and red blood cell counts (RBC); decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit; and increases in eosinophil counts. Cases of agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in the postmarketing setting. A complete blood count is recommended in patients experiencing significant weakness, pyrexia, recurrent infections, or coagulation disorders.

Partial-Onset Seizures

In controlled clinical studies using an oral formulation of levetiracetam in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, minor but statistically significant decreases compared to placebo in total mean RBC (0.03 × 106/mm3), mean hemoglobin (0.09 g/dL), and mean hematocrit (0.38%), were seen in levetiracetam-treated patients.

A total of 3.2% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.8% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤ 2.8 × 109/L) decreased WBC, and 2.4% of levetiracetam-treated and 1.4% of placebo-treated patients had at least one possibly significant (≤ 1.0 × 109/L) decreased neutrophil count. Of the levetiracetam-treated patients with a low neutrophil count, all but one rose towards or to baseline with continued treatment. No patient was discontinued secondary to low neutrophil counts.

### Clinical features and outcomes of pregnant women suspected of coronavirus disease 2019 [^1154oh8L]. The Journal of Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic. Under such circumstance pregnant women are also affected significantly.

Objective

This study aims to observe the clinical features and outcomes of pregnant women who have been confirmed with COVID-19.

Methods

The research objects were 55 cases of suspected COVID-19 pregnant women who gave a birth from Jan 20th 2020 to Mar 5th 2020 in our hospital-a big birth center delivering about 30,000 babies in the last 3 years. These cases were subjected to pulmonary CT scan and routine blood test, manifested symptoms of fever, cough, chest tightness or gastrointestinal symptoms. They were admitted to an isolated suite, with clinical features and newborn babies being carefully observed. Among the 55 cases, 13 patients were assigned into the confirmed COVID-19 group for being tested positive sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) via maternal throat swab test, and the other 42 patients were assigned into the control group for being ruled out COVID-19 pneumonia based on new coronavirus pneumonia prevention and control program(the 7th edition).

Results

There were 2 fever patients during the prenatal period and 8 fever patients during the postpartum period in the confirmed COVID-19 group. In contrast, there were 11 prenatal fever patients and 20 postpartum fever patients in the control group (p > 0.05). Among 55 cases, only 2 case had cough in the confirmed group. The imaging of pulmonary CT scan showed ground- glass opacity (46.2%, 6/13), patch-like shadows(38.5%, 5/13), fiber shadow(23.1%, 3/13), pleural effusion (38.5%, 5/13)and pleural thickening(7.7%, 1/13), and there was no statistical difference between the confirmed COVID-19 group and the control group (p > 0.05). During the prenatal and postpartum period, there was no difference in the count of WBC, Neutrophils and Lymphocyte, the radio of Neutrophils and Lymphocyte and the level of CRP between the confirmed COVID-19 group and the control group(p < 0.05). 20 babies (from confirmed mother and from normal mother) were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 examination by throat swab samples in 24 h after birth and no case was tested positive.

Conclusion

The clinical symptoms and laboratory indicators are not obvious for asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 pregnant women. Pulmonary CT scan plus blood routine examination are more suitable for finding pregnancy women with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 infection, and can be used screening COVID-19 pregnant women in the outbreak area of COVID-19 infection.

### Levetiracetam (spritam) [^111jsk7H]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Patients 4 Years to Less Than 16 Years of Age

Statistically significant decreases in WBC and neutrophil counts were seen in levetiracetam‑treated patients as compared to placebo. The mean decreases from baseline in the levetiracetam‑treated group were -0.4 × 109/L and -0.3 × 109/L, respectively, whereas there were small increases in the placebo group. Mean relative lymphocyte counts increased by 1.7% in levetiracetam‑treated patients, compared to a decrease of 4% in placebo‑treated patients (statistically significant).

In a controlled trial, more levetiracetam-treated patients had a possibly clinically significant abnormally low WBC value (3% of levetiracetam‑treated patients versus 0% of placebo‑treated patients); however, there was no apparent difference between treatment groups with respect to neutrophil count (5% of levetiracetam‑treated patients versus 4.2% of placebo‑treated patients). No patient was discontinued secondary to low WBC or neutrophil counts.

In a controlled cognitive and neuropsychological safety study, 5 patients (8.6%) in the levetiracetam‑treated group and two patients (6.1%) in the placebo‑treated group had high eosinophil count values that were possibly clinically significant (≥ 10% or ≥ 0.7×109/L).

5.10 Increase in Blood Pressure

In a randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients 1 month to < 4 years of age, a significantly higher risk of increased diastolic blood pressure was observed in levetiracetam-treated patients (17%), compared to the placebo-treated patients (2%). There was no overall difference in mean diastolic blood pressure between the treatment groups. This disparity between the levetiracetam and placebo treatment groups was not observed in the studies of older pediatric patients or in adults.

Monitor patients 1 month to < 4 years of age for increases in diastolic blood pressure.

5.11 Seizure Control During Pregnancy

Physiological changes may gradually decrease plasma levels of levetiracetam throughout pregnancy. This decrease is more pronounced during the third trimester. It is recommended that patients be monitored carefully during pregnancy. Close monitoring should continue through the postpartum period especially if the dose was changed during pregnancy.

Abnormal inflammatory responses in SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers

The laboratory measurements of blood routine at admission are listed in Tables 4 and 5. Compared with the COVID-19 negative pregnant women, the count of white blood cells (WBC) and neutrophils (NE) significantly higher in the COVID-19 positive pregnant women, while lymphocyte (LY) were lower in the COVID-19 positive pregnant women, which represented an infection status. In addition, COVID-19 positive women presented with higher rates of anemia and thrombocytopenia (Table 5). No significant intergroup differences were observed regarding aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels.

### Perinatal immune changes to identify patients at risk of postpartum preeclampsia [^111fK36U]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Postpartum preeclampsia (PPPE) is a maternal condition characterized by de novo hypertension in the postpartum period with end-organ damage. We investigated the use of perinatal immune changes, through routine complete blood count (CBC), to identify high-risk individuals before PPPE development.

Methods

We performed a retrospective matched case-control study of 100 individuals with PPPE, 200 term pregnancies (Ctrl) and 200 antenatal preeclampsia (PE). Detailed demographic, obstetrical and laboratory data were retrieved from medical records. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA, multivariate regression, and paired or unpaired t-tests, as appropriate.

Results

Individuals that developed PPPE were significantly older and predominantly Black vs Ctrl and PE. Both PE and PPPE had higher pre-pregnancy BMI and increased personal and family history of hypertension/PE vs Ctrl (p < 0.001). Before delivery, individuals that later developed PPPE, had lower total leukocyte counts vs Ctrl (9.61 vs 10.75x109/L, p < 0.05) whereas monocytes percentage were elevated (8.07 vs 7.27%, p < 0.01). Comparing the postpartum/antenatal ratio in-between each condition revealed elevated leukocyte ratio in PPPE vs Ctrl (p < 0.001). Neutrophils ratio was also increased whereas lymphocytes and monocytes were decreased in PPPE vs both Ctrl and PE. After adjusting for race, maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, personal history of PE/HT, and diabetes mellitus, perinatal immune changes were still significantly associated with PPPE.

Conclusions

Globally, perinatal immune changes were observed in individuals with a seemingly uncomplicated pregnancy prior to development of PPPE. This strongly supports that such changes could be used to identify high-risk individuals prior to disease onset.

### Natural history of postpartum hematocrit recovery in an urban, safety-net population [^1152QCND]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Postpartum anemia is common after delivery, and postpartum blood transfusion is the leading indicator of severe maternal morbidity in the United States. Although hematologic changes during the antepartum period are well understood, little is known about postpartum hematologic changes. Therefore, we investigated the hematologic changes in the postpartum period in a large, contemporary cohort.

Objective

This study aimed to characterize hematologic recovery in the postpartum period and evaluate the effect of demographics, medical conditions, and pregnancy characteristics on the recovery.

Study Design

In a contemporary cohort of deliveries in 2019 at a single institution, the hematocrit of postpartum women before hospital discharge was compared with the hematocrit of women at the postpartum follow-up. Our population was composed of a predominantly Hispanic population at an urban, safety-net hospital. All women received a complete blood count on postpartum day 1 and a spun hematocrit at their postpartum follow-up visit in our hospital system. All women were scheduled for a routine postpartum visit 2 to 3 weeks after delivery. All deliveries of a live-born infant with available postpartum hematocrit before hospital discharge and at postpartum follow-up were included. Demographics and pregnancy characteristics, along with medical conditions, were evaluated. To evaluate an uncomplicated cohort, those with multiple gestation, preeclampsia with severe features, chronic hypertension, and diabetes mellitus were excluded in the secondary analysis. Statistical analysis included chi-square, paired Student t test, Student t test for independent groups, and analysis of variance.

Results

Of 12,456 deliveries, 9003 met the inclusion criteria. The average number of days from discharge to follow-up was 21.73 ± 10.39 days. The average hematocrit levels were 30.77 ± 3.61 before discharge and 38.70 ± 3.61 at postpartum follow-up. From discharge to postpartum follow-up, the hematocrit levels increased by an average of 7.93 ± 3.24. In the cohort without complications, the average increase in hematocrit levels was 8.19 ± 3.09. The rise in hematocrit levels was significantly lower for those with chronic hypertension (6.9 ± 3.6), diabetes mellitus (7.3 ± 3.3), and preeclampsia with severe features (6.9 ± 3.7). The severity of anemia influenced the rise in hematocrit levels in the postpartum period. In women with postpartum anemia (hematocrit < 30%), the rise in hematocrit levels was 9.49 ± 2.97 in the uncomplicated cohort. Postpartum hemorrhage did not influence the rise in postpartum hematocrit levels; women receiving blood transfusion had a greater rise in hematocrit levels (9.01 ± 3.29).

Conclusion

Our study establishes the natural course of hematologic recovery in the postpartum period, and we found that women with asymptomatic postpartum anemia may have a hematocrit level of 37% to 39% at their postpartum follow-up approximately 3 weeks after hospital discharge. Women with preexisting and obstetrical complications experienced less hematologic recovery and adapted more slowly to postpartum physiological changes.

Table 2
95% range for haematocrit during pregnancy (taken from Bain, 2015)

Dehydration should be avoided in all patients during labour and the third stage of labour should be actively managed. Thromboembolic deterrent (TED) stockings are advisable during labour and if immobile during the postpartum period. LMWH and aspirin should be stopped prior to elective caesarean section or once spontaneous labour has begun, as per local guidelines.

Low molecular weight heparin should be restarted at the earliest opportunity post‐partum provided there is no significant bleeding. The dose of LMWH should be once daily and should be continued for 6 weeks post‐partum. Aspirin should be continued throughout the post‐partum period. Breastfeeding is safe with both aspirin and LMWH, and permissible with interferon. The Hct should be monitored in the post‐partum period and maintained at less than 0·45. Attention should be paid to the platelet count, as a rebound thrombocytosis may develop, necessitating the introduction of cytoreductive therapy.

There is no evidence regarding the management of PV during fertility treatment. Ovarian hyperstimulation is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis and therefore cytoreductive therapy (with interferon) and thromboprophylaxis with LMWH should be considered.

Recommendations: pregnancy management

There should be close collaborative management between obstetrician and haematologist to formulate an individualised plan for the pregnancy, delivery and postpartum period based on the previous history of thrombosis, haemorrhage and previous pregnancies. (GRADE 1C)
Avoid cytoreductive therapy (such as hydroxycarbamide and anagrelide) for a minimum of 3 months in male and female patients prior to planned conception and in the first trimester. Commence interferon if cytoreduction is required. (GRADE 1C)
Maintain Hct within the normal range for gestation. (Grade 1C)
Consider low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and/or interferon in addition to aspirin for high risk pregnancies (and for 6 weeks postpartum), based on individual patient discussion. (GRADE 1C)
Commence prophylactic dose LMWH for 6 weeks postpartum for standard risk pregnancies. (GRADE 1C)
Assess growth scans regularly and mean pulsatile index with uterine Doppler scans at 20 weeks. Consider escalation of treatment to include LMWH and interferon if scans are abnormal. (GRADE 1C)
The risk of continuing interferon whilst breastfeeding is permissible and should be individually considered. There are no contraindications to breastfeeding whilst taking aspirin and LMWH. (GRADE 1C)

### Mild thrombocytopenia and postpartum hemorrhage in nulliparous women with term, singleton, vertex deliveries [^114gBFXA]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess whether mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count 100–149 k/microliter) is associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage.

Methods

Nulliparous women with term, singleton, vertex pregnancies undergoing labor at our institution between August 2016 and September 2017 were included. The primary exposure was mild thrombocytopenia, defined as platelet count 100–149 k/microliter, and the comparator was normal platelet count (150 k/microliter or greater). Those with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 100 k/microliter) were excluded from analysis. The primary outcome was postpartum hemorrhage, determined by International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes and the hospital discharge problem list. Secondary outcomes included use of uterotonic agents (methylergonovine maleate or carboprost tromethamine), total blood loss 1,000 mL or greater, and blood transfusion. Data were analyzed by t test, χ or Fisher exact test, and multivariable logistic regression, with significance at α < 0.05.

Results

We evaluated 2,845 eligible women, of whom 2,579 (90.2%) had normal platelet count 150 k/microliter or greater, 266 (9.3%) had platelet count 100–149 k/microliter (mild thrombocytopenia), and 13 (0.5%) had platelet count less than 100 k/microliter (severe thrombocytopenia). Compared with women with normal platelet count, those with mild thrombocytopenia had a higher rate of postpartum hemorrhage (16.9% vs 8.5%, P < .001) and were more likely to have total blood loss 1,000 mL or greater (4.5% vs 1.7%, P = 0.002) and receive methylergonovine maleate (10.5% vs 5.9%, P = 0.003) or carboprost tromethamine (6.0% vs 1.6%, P < .001) or both (3.8% vs 1.0%, P < .001), but rates of blood transfusion were no different (1.9% vs 1.5%, P = 0.59). The association between mild thrombocytopenia and postpartum hemorrhage persisted after multivariable adjustment for potential confounders (adjusted odds ratio 2.2, 95% CI 1.5–3.2, P < .001).

Conclusion

Among nulliparous women with term, singleton, vertex pregnancies undergoing labor, those with mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count 100–149 k/microliter) had a twofold greater likelihood of postpartum hemorrhage compared with those with normal platelet count.

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine consult series # 67: maternal sepsis [^1132PeHG]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Maternal sepsis is a signiﬁcant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, and is a potentially preventable cause of maternal death. This Consult aims to summarize what is known about sepsis and provide guidance for the management of sepsis during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Most studies cited are from the nonpregnant population, but where available, pregnancy data are included. The following are the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommendations: (1) we recommend that clinicians consider the diagnosis of sepsis in pregnant or postpartum patients with otherwise unexplained end-organ damage in the presence of a suspected or confirmed infectious process, regardless of the presence of fever (GRADE 1C); (2) we recommend that sepsis and septic shock in pregnancy be considered medical emergencies and that treatment and resuscitation begin immediately (Best Practice); (3) we recommend that hospitals and health systems use a performance improvement program for sepsis in pregnancy with sepsis screening tools and metrics (GRADE 1B); (4) we recommend that institutions develop their own procedures and protocols for the detection of maternal sepsis, avoiding the use of a single screening tool alone (GRADE 1B); (5) we recommend obtaining tests to evaluate for infectious and noninfectious causes of life-threatening organ dysfunction in pregnant and postpartum patients with possible sepsis (Best Practice); (6) we recommend that an evaluation for infectious causes in pregnant or postpartum patients in whom sepsis is suspected or identified includes appropriate microbiologic cultures, including blood, before starting antimicrobial therapy, as long as there are no substantial delays in timely administration of antibiotics (Best Practice); (7) we recommend obtaining a serum lactate level in pregnant or postpartum patients in whom sepsis is suspected or identified (GRADE 1B); (8) in pregnant or postpartum patients with septic shock or a high likelihood of sepsis, we recommend administration of empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, ideally within 1 hour of recognition (GRADE 1C); (9) after a diagnosis of sepsis in pregnancy is made, we recommend rapid identification or exclusion of an anatomic source of infection and emergency source control when indicated (Best Practice); (10) we recommend early intravenous administration (within the first 3 hours) of 1 to 2 L of balanced crystalloid solutions in sepsis complicated by hypotension or suspected organ hypoperfusion (GRADE 1C); (11) we recommend the use of a balanced crystalloid solution as a first-line fluid for resuscitation in pregnant and postpartum patients with sepsis or septic shock (GRADE 1B); (12) we recommend against the use of starches or gelatin for resuscitation in pregnant and postpartum patients with sepsis or septic shock (GRADE 1A); (13) we recommend ongoing, detailed evaluation of the patient's response to fluid resuscitation guided by dynamic measures of preload (GRADE 1B); (14) we recommend the use of norepinephrine as the first-line vasopressor during pregnancy and the postpartum period with septic shock (GRADE 1C); (15) we suggest using intravenous corticosteroids in pregnant or postpartum patients with septic shock who continue to require vasopressor therapy (GRADE 2B); (16) because of an increased risk of venous thromboembolism in sepsis and septic shock, we recommend the use of pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in pregnant and postpartum patients in septic shock (GRADE 1B); (17) we suggest initiating insulin therapy at a glucose level > 180 mg/dL in critically ill pregnant patients with sepsis (GRADE 2C); (18) if a uterine source for sepsis is suspected or confirmed, we recommend prompt delivery or evacuation of uterine contents to achieve source control, regardless of gestational age (GRADE 1C); and (19) because of an increased risk of physical, cognitive, and emotional problems in survivors of sepsis and septic shock, we recommend ongoing comprehensive support for pregnant and postpartum sepsis survivors and their families (Best Practice).

Discussion

So far, mitochondrial bioenergetics were mainly examined in cross-sectional studies without providing information about the temporal stability of findings. For the first time, we investigated longitudinal alterations in mitochondrial respiration and density in PBMC of women with and without a history of CM at shortly after parturition (t 0) and 1 year after pregnancy (t 2). Thereby, we questioned whether our previous observations of upregulated mitochondrial bioenergetic profiles in PBMC of postpartum women with CM (Boeck et al; Gumpp et al.) remain stable over time or temporarily peak during phases of allostatic load, namely temporarily elevated inflammation at the postpartum period. Our results revealed that, independently of the women's CM experiences, the mitochondria of all women exhibited higher flux-control ratios at t 0 as compared to t 2. In contrast, the mitochondrial respiration parameters Leak respiration and Spare respiratory capacity increased from t 0 to t 2.

In healthy postpartum women, the immune system is stimulated by labor as well as delivery to increase the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in an upregulation of inflammatory processes (Corwin et al; Maes et al.). Across the next weeks to months, women recover from childbirth and inflammation regresses. With recovery, the women's HPA axis function, which is suppressed following delivery, normalizes and its hormones return to confine the inflammation (Mastorakos & Ilias).

In line with this, we found in our cohort a significant decrease of the white blood cell count (number of leukocytes in whole blood) from t 0 to t 2 in both groups indicating a decrease in inflammatory processes from t 0 to t 2. Leukocytes are mediators of inflammation and have a key role in host defense to injury. Increased white blood cell count has been associated with several adverse health conditions, like diabetes (Vozarova et al.), coronary heart disease (Madjid & Fatemi,), or a worse outcome in the general population (De Labry, Campion, Glynn, & Vokonas).

### Are complete blood cell counts useful in the evaluation of asymptomatic neonates exposed to suspected chorioamnionitis? [^115NKyGp]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Chorioamnionitis complicates 1% to 10% of pregnancies and increases the risk of neonatal infection. Women with chorioamnionitis receive intrapartum antibiotics, often resulting in inconclusive neonatal blood cultures. Peripheral neutrophil values are used frequently to assist in the diagnosis of neonatal infection and to determine duration of antibiotics; we sought to determine the utility of this approach.

Methods

A prospective observational study was performed in 856 near-term/term neonates who were exposed to suspected chorioamnionitis. Each received antibiotics for 48 hours unless clinical infection or positive blood cultures occurred. Peripheral neutrophils were measured serially and analyzed using the reference ranges of Manroe et al; an additional analysis of only the initial neutrophil values used the normal ranges of Schelonka et al. Results of neutrophil analyses were not used to determine duration of therapy. Fifty percent of asymptomatic neonates were seen postdischarge to ascertain recurrent infection. Local patient charges were examined.

Results

Ninety-six percent of neonates were asymptomatic and had negative cultures, and antibiotics were discontinued at 48 hours. A total of 2427 neutrophil counts were analyzed. Although abnormal neutrophil values were more frequent in infected or symptomatic neonates, 99% of asymptomatic neonates had ≥ 1 abnormal value. The specificity and negative predictive values for abnormal neutrophil values ranged between 0.12 and 0.95 and 0.91 and 0.97, respectively; sensitivity was 0.27 to 0.76. Significant differences in interpretation of the initial neutrophil values were noted, depending on the normal values used. Follow-up was performed for 373 asymptomatic neonates until 3 weeks' postnatal age. Eight required rehospitalization; none had evidence of bacterial infection. If neutrophil values had been used to determine duration of antibiotics, then local costs would have increased by 76,000 dollars to 425,000 dollars per year.

Conclusions

Single or serial neutrophil values do not assist in the diagnosis of early-onset infection or determination of duration of antibiotic therapy in asymptomatic, culture-negative neonates who are ≥ 35 weeks' gestation and are delivered of women with suspected chorioamnionitis.

### Prognostic accuracy of clinical markers of postpartum bleeding in predicting maternal mortality or severe morbidity: a WHO individual participant data meta-analysis [^112bzWQV]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Postpartum haemorrhage (excessive bleeding after birth) is a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. However, there is no global consensus on which clinical markers best define excessive bleeding or reliably predict adverse maternal outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic accuracy of clinical markers of postpartum bleeding in predicting maternal mortality or severe morbidity.

Methods

In this individual participant data meta-analysis, eligible datasets were identified through a global call for data issued by WHO and systematic searches of PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and WHO trial registries (from database inception to Nov 6, 2024). Studies were eligible if they included at least 200 participants with objectively measured blood loss or other clinical markers of haemodynamic instability, and reported at least one clinical outcome of interest. Individual participant data were requested for all eligible studies. For each dataset, we computed the prognostic accuracy of each clinical marker to predict a composite outcome of maternal mortality or severe morbidity (blood transfusion, surgical interventions, or admission to intensive care unit). Five clinical markers were assessed: measured blood loss, pulse rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and shock index. Results were meta-analysed through two-level mixed-effects logistic regression models, with a bivariate normal model used to generate summary accuracy estimates. Clinical marker and threshold selections were informed by a WHO expert consensus process, which placed emphasis on maximising prognostic sensitivity (preferably > 80%) over prognostic specificity (preferably ≥ 50%). This meta-analysis was registered on PROSPERO (CRD420251034918).

Findings

We identified 33 potentially eligible datasets and successfully obtained and analysed full data for 12 datasets, comprising 312151 women. At the conventional threshold of 500 mL, measured blood loss had a summary prognostic sensitivity of 75·7% (95% CI 60·3–86·4) and specificity of 81·4% (95% CI 70·7–88·8) for predicting the composite outcome. The preferred sensitivity threshold was reached at 300 mL (83·9% [95% CI 72·8–91·1]), although at the expense of reduced specificity (54·8% [95% CI 38·0–70·5]). Prognostic performance improved with a decision rule that combined the use of either blood loss thresholds less than 500 mL (≥ 300 mL to ≥ 450 mL) and any abnormal haemodynamic sign (pulse rate > 100 beats per min, systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure < 60 mm Hg, or shock index > 1·0) or 500 mL or more of blood loss, with sensitivities ranging from 86·9% to 87·9% and specificities from 66·6% to 76·1%.

Interpretation

Measured blood loss below the conventional threshold, combined with abnormal haemodynamic signs, accurately predicts women at risk of death or life-threatening complications from postpartum bleeding and could support earlier postpartum haemorrhage diagnosis and treatment.

### Comprehensive reference intervals for white blood cell counts during pregnancy [^117GWCSJ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Although several studies have explored the RI of WBC count during pregnancy, there are notable limitations that cannot be overlooked. Firstly, many of these studies were based on small populations, which may not provide robust and reliable results. Secondly, some studies only sampled specific gestational weeks or trimesters, failing to capture the entire gestational process. Thirdly, most studies did not consider the necessity of RI partitioning, instead focusing solely on providing the 95% confidence interval. Akkaya et al. conducted a study involving 40,325 pregnant women with 82,786 complete blood count evaluations from 6 to the 41 weeks of gestation. They reported the 3rd, 5th, 10th, 50th, 95th and 99th percentile values for total and differential leukocyte counts according to trimester. While this study encompassed a large-scale population and a wide range of gestational ages, the clinical applicability of the results may be limited due to the specific percentile values chosen that were not the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile. Another large-scale study conducted by Dockree et al. included 24,318 pregnant women with 80,637 samples from 8 to 40 weeks of gestation, and RI was determined as 5.7–15.0 × 10^9/L. The authors confirmed the need for a pregnancy-specific RI, but refutes the need for partitioned, gestational-age specific limits. The results were similar to ours, in which RI was suggested as 5.7–14.4 × 10^9/L when gestational age ≥ 6 weeks.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: venous thromboembolism in the context of pregnancy [^112PpMU1]. Blood Advances (2018). Medium credibility.

Postpartum antithrombotic prophylaxis — agents, dosing, and duration considerations: Most of the available data are for low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) prophylaxis, although some studies reported using warfarin with a target international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0, and in the absence of direct comparisons of dosing strategies an evidence-based preferred dosing regimen is not possible; no studies have compared different durations, the risk of thrombotic events is highest within 3 to 6 weeks after delivery with a continuous decrease until 12 weeks postpartum, and although a small relative increase in risk persists to 12 weeks the absolute risk after 6 weeks is < 1 of 10 000, so prophylaxis between weeks 6 and 12 is unlikely to be of significant benefit in most patients; because of the shorter time frame, the burden of postpartum prophylaxis is considered substantially less than that of antepartum prophylaxis.

### Lochia patterns among normal women: a systematic review [^117UE8w8]. Journal of Women's Health (2012). Low credibility.

Background

We conducted a systematic review of the literature to determine the amount and duration of blood loss 24 hours to 12 weeks after delivery.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PubMed for studies between the years 1950 and 2011 that prospectively evaluated the amount and duration of blood loss from 24 hours to 12 weeks after delivery. Excluded were those that were only case studies, retrospective studies, studies not published in English, studies outside of the time frame, and studies that included only subjects from special populations.

Results

From the 333 identified studies, 18 met inclusion criteria. There was variability in how the amount of blood loss was determined, ranging from subject self-assessment to objective measures, such as pad weight and spectrophotometric readings of hematin concentration. The reported duration of normal blood loss after delivery varied among the studies. Whereas the average duration of blood loss in these studies ranged from 24 to 36 days, in only 1 study was bleeding followed to cessation.

Conclusions

An understanding of bleeding patterns after delivery is important for clinicians to recognize deviations from normal, identify women at risk for delayed postpartum hemorrhage, and limit unnecessary interventions, yet studies reveal significant variability in amount and duration of normal lochial blood loss and methods of assessment that are inconsistent. This review draws attention to the need for the establishment of valid, reliable, and feasible methods to quantify normal and abnormal postpartum blood loss.

### Clinical characteristics and laboratory results of pregnant women with COVID-19 in wuhan, China [^11166UHN]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Lymphocytes act as the primary immune barrier to viral infection and their dysregulation can be observed when the body is invaded. Consistent with an earlier report, the present study showed that peripheral lymphocyte count and lymphocyte percentage were normal or decreased in pregnant patients in the early stages of COVID‐19. Although lymphocyte count varied in pregnancy, it often returned to levels in the postpartum period that were equal to those in nonpregnant patients. This may indicate a poor prognosis as lymphocyte percentage was correlated with the severity of COVID‐19. Except for the deaths of two nonpregnant women who had severe underlying conditions, all enrolled patients had recovered by the end of the study.

Patients with mild symptoms could have increased levels of C‐reactive protein but normal procalcitonin. Procalcitonin is a biomarker with higher diagnostic accuracy than C‐reactive protein for bacterial infection. However, procalcitonin levels were slightly higher in pregnant patients in the present study and, further considering the higher neutrophil count in this group, clinicians should be well‐informed of the risk of puerperal infection in these patients. D‐dimer is an indicator of fibrinolysis and is widely used as a criterion for thromboembolism. The correlation of high levels of this indicator with the occurrence of severe COVID‐19 in adult patients has been reported previously. The present study showed that pregnant patients with COVID‐19 had higher levels of D‐dimer; however, its application in these patients may be restricted because it would increase physiologically over the course of delivery. The levels of some indicators of liver and kidney function, such as alanine transaminase, albumin, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine in pregnant patients also differed significantly from those in nonpregnant patients; however, their values all fell within the medical reference range. The significance of these markers in patients with COVID‐19 needs further research.

### Leukocyte telomere dynamics across gestation in uncomplicated pregnancies and associations with stress [^117NqP21]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

The phenomenon of increasing LTLs has been previously described and may be related to the upregulation of telomerase, decreases in shelterin protein activity – which protects telomeres from pathologic lengthening – or even changes in the leukocyte composition of a sample. Furthermore, variability in LTL has been established even within leukocyte subclasses outside of pregnancy. Whether the increases in LTLs we identified points to variabilities in our measurements of LTLs, a regression to the mean phenomenon – where natural variation in longitudinal biologic measurements can result in repeat values being closer to the true mean value – or highlights the complexity of the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated in a larger cohort.

It is also important to note that postpartum LTLs were significantly shorter in participants who underwent cesarean vs. vaginal delivery. The average timing of LTL sample collection was on average more than 1 week postpartum, when patients would likely be outside the immediate post-operative inflammatory window during which a leukocytosis could affect LTLs. While data are lacking concerning the post-operative inflammatory response following cesarean, high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been reported at 48 h after abdominal hysterectomy which may serve as a surgical correlate for cesarean. Given the known relation between LTL shortening and inflammation, it is possible that the shorter LTLs seen in this group reflect the post-operative state. Further investigation in this area is warranted given that there are limited data concerning how surgery might affect LTL. At the very least, this highlights the importance of consideration of mode of delivery in future studies investigating telomere length change in pregnancy, specifically when evaluating LTLs collected postpartum.

### Cell salvage for the management of postpartum haemorrhage [^113Nok5S]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), defined as a blood loss of 500 mL or more within 24 hours of birth, is the leading global cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Allogenic blood transfusions are a critical component of PPH management, yet are often unfeasible, particularly in resource-poor settings where maternal morbidity is highest. Autologous cell salvage in the management of PPH has been proposed to combat limitations in access to allogenic blood and potential transfusion-related risks. This review examines the benefits and harms of using cell salvage for pregnant women during birth.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of cell salvage when used during birth.

Search Methods

We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and Global Index Medicus databases and the ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers. We also carried out reference checking and citation searching, and contacted study authors to identify all relevant studies. The latest search date was 8 February 2024.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in pregnant women (24 weeks or more gestation) comparing use of cell salvage following caesarean or vaginal birth with routine care (defined as no cell salvage). We did not place any restrictions on mode of birth, ethnicity, race, socioeconomic status, education level, or place of residence.

Outcomes

Critical outcomes for this review were risk of allogenic blood transfusion, risk of transfusion-related adverse reactions, risk of haemorrhage, transfer to higher level of care, length of hospitalisation, length of operation, and risk of sepsis. Important outcomes were estimated blood loss, blood loss ≥ 500 mL, blood loss ≥ 1000 mL, use of additional uterotonics or tranexamic acid, maternal death, postpartum haemoglobin concentration, change in haemoglobin, major surgery including hysterectomy, future major surgery, end-organ dysfunction or failure, amniotic fluid embolism, side effects, clotting abnormalities, maternal experience/satisfaction, maternal well-being, and breastfeeding.

Risk Of Bias

We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 1) for each critical outcome from each RCT.

Synthesis Methods

We conducted a meta-analysis for each outcome where data were available from more than one study using a random-effects model. If data could not be analysed using meta-analysis, we synthesised results narratively using the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) guidance. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Included Studies

We included six RCTs with 3476 participants. All trials involved pregnant women having a caesarean birth. Three trials were conducted in high-income countries, and three were conducted in an upper-middle-income country.

Synthesis Of Results

Allogenic blood transfusion Intraoperative cell salvage at caesarean birth may reduce the need for allogenic transfusions received by participants, although the 95% confidence interval (CI) includes the possibility of an increase in effect. Low-certainty evidence from three studies found the risk of donor transfusions was possibly lower in participants with cell salvage (risk ratio (RR) 0.45, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.33; P = 0.15, I² = 33%; 3 RCTs, 3115 women; low-certainty evidence). The absolute risk of transfusion was very low in the studies (4% in women not treated with cell salvage and 2% in women treated with cell salvage). Transfusion-related adverse reactions The evidence is very uncertain about the risk of transfusion-related adverse reactions in participants with intraoperative cell salvage (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.62; P = 0.39; 4 RCTs, 3304 women; very low-certainty evidence). Haemorrhage Two studies reported risk of haemorrhage and found that there was probably no difference between arms (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.15; P = 0.36, I² = 0%; 2 RCTs, 3077 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Length of hospitalisation The evidence is very uncertain about whether interoperative cell salvage at caesarean birth affects length of hospitalisation. Three studies reported length of hospitalisation (MD -2.02 days, 95% CI -4.73 to 0.70; P = 0.15, I² = 100%; 3 RCTs, 3174 women; very low-certainty evidence). Length of operation Two studies reported on length of operation. However, meta-analysis was not possible due to statistical heterogeneity and divergence of study findings; the direction of effect could not be determined. We evaluated the evidence as very low certainty. Sepsis One study reported risk of sepsis, finding that there was possibly no difference between arms (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.29; P = 0.99; 1 RCT, 2990 women; low-certainty evidence). Estimated blood loss Cell salvage at caesarean birth may reduce blood loss. Two studies reported that estimated blood loss was possibly lower in women who had cell salvage compared to those who did not (MD -113.59 mL, 95% CI -130.41 to -96.77; P < 0.00001, I² = 0%; 2 RCTs, 246 women; low-certainty evidence). Postpartum haemoglobin concentration Cell salvage at caesarean birth may increase day one postpartum haemoglobin. Three studies reported day one postpartum haemoglobin levels (MD 6.14 g/L, 95% CI 1.62 to 10.65; P = 0.008, I² = 97%; 3 RCTs, 3070 women; low-certainty evidence). Amniotic fluid embolism Three trials reported risk of amniotic fluid embolism and no cases were observed (n = 3226 women).

Authors' Conclusions

Cell salvage may reduce the need for allogenic blood transfusion, may reduce blood loss, and may increase day one postpartum haemoglobin in pregnant women having caesarean birth (low certainty). Cell salvage may make little to no difference to the risk of sepsis (low certainty) and probably makes little to no difference to the risk of haemorrhage (moderate certainty). The effect of cell salvage on risk of transfusion-related adverse reactions is very uncertain. The effect of cell salvage on the length of hospital stay was both clinically and statistically heterogenous, with a very low certainty of evidence. The effect of cell salvage on length of operation is divergent and meta-analysis was not possible due to significant statistical heterogeneity; the evidence is of very low certainty. No cases of amniotic fluid embolism were reported among the included trials. Studies in low- and middle-income settings are needed.

### Postpartum-specific vital sign reference ranges [^117G2rei]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Where both self- and clinician-taken vital sign measurements were recorded within an hour, we assessed agreement using the Bland-Altman method. We pooled data when there was no substantial bias and limits of agreement were adequate. Where two sets of vital sign measurements were recorded by the same method (usually two sets of self-taken measurements) within an hour, we used the mean of the two values in our analyses.

We conducted a predefined subgroup analysis of the effect of parity on the postpartum reference ranges. To explore whether limiting the population to those of optimal health would affect results, we defined a "restrictive" population of women aged younger than 40 years with body mass indexes (BMIs, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) between 18.5 and 29.9 who did not smoke and did not have comorbidities. In this "restrictive" population, we excluded measures from women who developed a severe maternal condition during pregnancy (severe preeclampsia; hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count [HELLP] syndrome; or eclampsia, as defined in the study protocol), in line with previous work. We conducted a post hoc analysis using these definitions to compare with the analysis of the full "pragmatic" population. We also undertook post hoc analyses of the effect of epidural and epidural or anesthesia on postpartum reference ranges.

The incidence of sepsis is increasing in the United States, both in the general adult population and among pregnant and postpartum women. Neither infection nor bacteremia are synonymous with sepsis: it is a dysregulated host response to a pathogen in which organ dysfunction is key. New clinical criteria have been released. Cornerstones of management are early suspicion and recognition, effective fluid resuscitation, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

### Clinical characteristics of women captured by extending the definition of severe postpartum haemorrhage with' refractoriness to treatment': a cohort study [^115q8FuP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The definition persistent postpartum haemorrhage identified women with severe postpartum haemorrhage at an early stage of haemorrhage and captured a large proportion of adverse maternal outcomes. Clinical characteristics and outcomes of women included in this definition were comparable to those of women selected by definitions based on estimated blood loss up to 2 L within 24 h following birth, but not to definitions based on the number of units of RBC transfused. Whether or not extending the definition of severe postpartum haemorrhage with ' refractoriness to treatment ' will lead to early identification of women at high risk of adverse outcome, early start of treatment and improvement of outcomes needs to be clarified in future studies.

### Updated International Consensus Report on the investigation and management of primary immune thrombocytopenia [^111jqMoy]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for thrombocytopenia in pregnancy, more specifically with respect to considerations for delivery, ICR 2019 guidelines recommend to recognize that a platelet count of 20–30×10⁹/L in a non-bleeding patient is safe for most pregnancies. Attempt ensuring a platelet count ≥ 50×10⁹/L for delivery.

### Comprehensive reference intervals for white blood cell counts during pregnancy [^112rExHY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Based on these observations, we propose the following RIs: ≤ 2 weeks of gestation can utilize the non-pregnancy reference interval of 4–10 × 10^9/L. For 3–5 weeks of gestation, the reference interval can be set as 4.7–11.9 × 10^9/L, while ≥ 6 weeks of gestation can utilize the range of 5.7–14.4 × 10^9/L. These recommendations provide more accurate and appropriate RIs for WBC count during different weeks of gestation.

During pregnancy, the information carried by blood cells is beyond that found in non-pregnant individuals. Elevated levels of haemoglobin concentration has been associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, and similarly, a high WBC count is also linked to the adverse outcomes. A retrospective study showed that total leukocyte count, neutrophil count, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were significantly higher in the placenta previa group compared to the controls, suggesting a valuable predictor for placenta previa. A study suggests that higher total WBC and absolute neutrophil counts in the third trimester are associated with small-for-gestational-age birth. These associations may indicate a cycle of inflammation and placental dysfunction contributing to fetal growth restriction. In our study, we as well found the WBC count over upper limit was associated with the placenta previa and fetal growth restriction. Moreover, we discovered additional associations between high WBC count and complications such as oligohydramnios and secondary uterine inertia, which have not been previously reported. The potential mechanisms for these observations might be attributed to systemic chronic inflammation, which can lead to alterations in the uterine environment. These novel findings suggest that establishing an RI for WBC during pregnancy is crucial not only for detecting infections but also for identifying and monitoring various pregnancy-related complications.

In conclusion, our study examined WBC trends in a large population of pregnant women and confirmed the well-known increase in WBC levels during pregnancy, primarily driven by neutrophils. Our findings suggest that different RIs should be applied based on gestational age, with RI partitioning necessary for specific periods. We also identified associations between high WBC count and various pregnancy-related complications, including placenta previa, fetal growth restriction, oligohydramnios, secondary uterine inertia, and shoulder presentation. These results highlight the importance of using appropriate RIs for WBC count during pregnancy to enhance health monitoring and risk assessment.

### Characteristics of eclampsia not preceded by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: a case control study [^112GnP41]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study represents the first investigation into the characteristics of atypical cases of eclampsia that were not diagnosed as HDP before onset. One of the key findings was that 55% of the cases involved eclamptic seizures that developed without a prior diagnosis of HDP, suggesting that eclampsia can occur without the hallmark hypertensive signs. Patients with eclampsia not preceded by HDP were more likely to develop the condition during labor, often exhibited normal blood pressure postpartum, and showed a significant increase in WBC count at onset. These findings support the hypothesis that eclampsia not preceded by HDP may represent a distinct subtype involving alternative pathophysiological mechanisms.

Notably, the significant increase in WBC count observed in the group without HDP suggests an acute, possibly transient, inflammatory response. Interestingly, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels did not show a corresponding elevation, implying that the inflammatory response may be localized or short-lived and thus not reflected in systemic inflammatory markers. This dissociation between WBC and CRP supports the hypothesis that immune activation during labor may contribute to the pathogenesis of eclampsia not preceded by HDP.

Recent literature supports the possibility that immune-mediated disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) may play a role in the pathogenesis of eclampsia, independent of severe hypertension. Previous studies have reported that circulating factors in preeclampsia — such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), oxidative stress products, and immune mediators — can increase BBB permeability, potentially leading to vasogenic edema and seizure activity. Furthermore, inflammatory activation of microglia through cytokine signaling has also been implicated as a contributing factor in lowering the seizure threshold.

In our study, the predominance of intrapartum onset in the non-HDP group (52.9%) may further support the role of labor-induced immune activation. Importantly, none of the women in our cohort had documented autoimmune, infectious, or neurological comorbidities during pregnancy, strengthening the case that the seizures were primarily obstetric in nature.

Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pregnancy — postpartum prophylaxis after prior VTE: For pregnant women with a prior VTE, the ASH Latin American panel suggests postpartum anticoagulant prophylaxis over no prophylaxis (conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence about effects). Compared with the antepartum period, the baseline risk of thrombosis is higher in the postpartum period, therefore even women who choose not to use antepartum prophylaxis probably will benefit from receiving postpartum prophylaxis. A frequent scheme used is prophylaxis for 6 weeks, although the duration of postpartum prophylaxis was not formally assessed in the guideline. The recommendation changed strength from a strong recommendation in favor by the original panel to a conditional recommendation by the Latin American panel due to uncertain benefit of the intervention (low certainty in the evidence).

Obstetric sepsis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in pregnant people worldwide. Initial evaluation and timely intervention are crucial to improving outcomes for birthing persons and their newborns. While many of the therapies and interventions for peripartum sepsis are consistent with the general population, there are considerations unique to pregnancy. Stabilization of the septic pregnant or immediately postpartum patient requires an understanding of the physiologic changes of pregnancy, hemodynamic changes during labor, and infections specific to pregnancy. We will review the interaction between pregnant physiology and sepsis pathophysiology, and how this can guide screening and diagnosis.

### Comprehensive reference intervals for white blood cell counts during pregnancy [^1142eDQf]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity analysis

To allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of RI for WBC count during pregnancy, four different approaches for establishing RIs were compared in this study: non-pregnant 95% RI, pregnant 95% RI using threshold regression, parametric pregnant 95% RI, and non-parametric pregnant 95% RI (Table 2). The currently utilized RI for pregnancy is based on the non-pregnant range of 4–10 × 10^9/L, with both the upper and lower limits lower than those established by the other three methods. The new reference interval for ≥ 6 weeks of gestation based on the threshold regression (5.7–14.4 × 10^9/L) was similar to the parametric (5.9–14.5 × 10^9/L) and non-parametric (5.9–14.4 × 10^9/L) methods, indicating the robustness of the results. However, the RI for 3–5 weeks was smaller in the upper limit (4.7–11.9 vs. 4.6–13.2 vs. 4.6–12.9 × 10^9/L), probably due to the impact of low sample size.

Table 2
Reference intervals for white blood cell count during pregnancy

†RI, reference interval

Additionally, the study compared the difference between threshold and linear regressions for establishing RIs. Given the limited sample size in the 0 to 6 weeks gestation period and a changing point at 7th week, this comparison was conducted using samples from 7 to 40 weeks gestation. As depicted in Figure S5, the upper limits in the threshold regression model were only slightly higher than those obtained through linear regression.

High white blood cell count is associated with pregnancy-related complications

As demonstrated in Table 3, women in the high WBC group exhibited a significantly increased risk of placenta previa by 111% (P = 0.003), oligohydramnios by 46% (P = 0.029), secondary uterine inertia by 32% (P = 0.027), and intrauterine growth restriction by 73% (P = 0.032). Furthermore, within the complicated cases, the High group exhibited a higher proportion of women experiencing one, three, and four complications (Figure S6).

### Tests for diagnosis of postpartum haemorrhage at vaginal birth [^113Btafu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. Accurate diagnosis of PPH can prevent adverse outcomes by enabling early treatment.

Objectives

What is the accuracy of methods (index tests) for diagnosing primary PPH (blood loss ≥ 500 mL in the first 24 hours after birth) and severe primary PPH (blood loss ≥ 1000 mL in the first 24 hours after birth) (target conditions) in women giving birth vaginally (participants) compared to weighed blood loss measurement or other objective measurements of blood loss (reference standards)?

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to 24 May 2024.

Selection Criteria

We included women who gave birth vaginally in any setting. Study types included diagnostic cohort studies and cross-sectional studies that reported 2 x 2 data (number of true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative results) or where the 2 x 2 data could be derived from test accuracy estimates. Eligible index tests included: visual estimation; calibrated blood collection devices; approach with calibrated drape and observations; blood loss estimation using the SAPHE (Signalling a Postpartum Hemorrhage Emergency) Mat; blood loss field image analysis and other technologies; uterine atony assessment; clinical variables (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure, shock index); early warning charts; haemoglobin levels; and predelivery fibrinogen levels. Eligible reference standards included objective methods such as: gravimetric blood loss measurement, which involves weighing collected blood, as well as weighing blood-soaked pads, gauze and sheets, and subtracting their dry weight; calibrated devices to measure blood volume (volumetric blood loss measurement); the alkaline-haematin method of blood loss estimation; and blood extracted using machine-extraction and measured spectrometrically as oxyhaemoglobin.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors, working independently, undertook study screening, selection, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, and assessment of the certainty of the evidence. We resolved any differences through consensus or with input from another author. We generated 2 x 2 tables of the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, and 95% confidence intervals for each index test. We presented sensitivity and specificity estimates from studies in forest plots. Where possible, we conducted meta-analyses for each index test and reference standard combination for each target condition. We examined heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest plots.

Main Results

Our review included 18 studies with a total of 291,040 participants. Fourteen studies evaluated PPH and seven studies evaluated severe PPH. Most studies were conducted in a hospital setting (16 of 18). There were four studies at high risk of bias for the patient selection domain and 14 studies at low risk. For the index test domain, 10 studies were at low risk of bias, seven studies at high risk, and one study at uncertain risk. For the reference standard domain, one study was at high risk of bias and 17 studies at low risk. For the flow and timing domain, three studies were at high risk of bias and 15 studies at low risk. The applicability concerns were low for all studies across the domains. In the abstract, we have prioritised reporting results for common, important thresholds for index tests or where the certainty of the evidence for the sensitivity estimate was at least moderate. Full results are in the main body of the review. PPH (blood loss ≥ 500 mL) For PPH, visual estimation with gravimetric blood loss measurement as the reference standard had 48% sensitivity (95% confidence interval (CI) 44% to 53%; moderate certainty) and 97% specificity (95% CI 95% to 99%; high certainty) (4 studies, 196,305 participants). Visual estimation with volumetric blood loss measurement as the reference standard showed 22% sensitivity (95% CI 12% to 37%; moderate certainty) and 99% specificity (95% CI 97% to 100%; moderate certainty) (2 studies, 514 participants). The diagnostic approach with calibrated drape plus observations, with gravimetric blood loss measurement as the reference standard for PPH, showed 93% sensitivity (95% CI 92% to 94%; high certainty) and 95% specificity (95% CI 95% to 96%; high certainty) (2 studies, 53,762 participants). A haemoglobin level of less than 10 g/dL with gravimetric blood loss measurement as the reference standard showed 37% sensitivity (95% CI 30% to 44%; high certainty) and 79% specificity (95% CI 76% to 82%; high certainty) (1 study, 1058 participants). Severe PPH (blood loss ≥ 1000 mL) For severe PPH, visual estimation, with volumetric plus gravimetric blood loss measurement as the reference standard, showed 9% sensitivity (95% CI 0% to 41%; low certainty) and 100% specificity (95% CI 99% to 100%; moderate certainty) (1 study, 274 participants). A shock index level of 1.0 or higher (commonly used as a threshold for severe PPH) up to two hours after birth, with gravimetric blood loss measurement as the reference standard, showed 30% sensitivity (95% CI 27% to 33%; moderate certainty) and 93% specificity (95% CI 92% to 93%; moderate certainty) (1 study, 30,820 participants). A haemoglobin level of less than 10 g/dL, with gravimetric blood loss measurement as the reference standard, showed 71% sensitivity (95% CI 51% to 87%; moderate certainty) and 77% specificity (95% CI 75% to 80%; high certainty) (1 study, 1058 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

Visual estimation of blood loss to diagnose PPH showed low sensitivity and is likely to miss the diagnosis in half of women giving birth vaginally. A diagnostic approach using a calibrated drape to objectively measure blood loss plus clinical observations showed high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing PPH. Other index tests showed low to moderate sensitivities in diagnosing PPH and severe PPH. Future research should determine the accuracy of diagnostic tests in non-hospital settings and consider combining index tests to increase the sensitivity of PPH diagnosis.

### Postpartum eclampsia… [^117TgCFq]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Eleven days postoperatively the patient presented to the emergency department complaining of gradually worsening headache for the past three days with onset of blurred vision that morning. In the emergency room the patient had a witnessed generalized seizure and received lorazepam and magnesium sulfate. On physical examination, the patient had a blood pressure of 185/91 mm Hg, 2+ generalized pitting edema of the arms and legs, and one to two beat clonus bilaterally of the ankle reflexes. Mental status remained oriented, with no focal neurologic signs and absent Babinski signs bilaterally. Laboratory findings were significant: 3 + proteinuria; hemoconcentration with hemoglobin 15. 5 g per dL and a platelet count of 568, 000 per mm 3; uric acid level of
8. 1 mg per dL; and white blood cell count, 15, 400 per mm 3, with 84 percent polymorphonuclear cells and 4 percent band cells.

Lumbar puncture following normal funduscopic examination revealed 822 red blood cells, 7 WBCs, normal blood glucose of 52 mg per dL and an elevated protein of 152 g per dL. Gram stain of cerebrospinal fluid revealed no organisms. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed diffuse confluent cortically based signal alteration within the posterior parietal lobes and occipital lobes bilaterally, suspicious for sequelae of preeclampsia/eclampsia. MRI was negative for venous sinus thrombosis. An electroencephalogram was read as normal. Clinically, the patient responded to intravenous magnesium sulfate and labetalol, with more than 5 L of fluid diuresis in the first 24 hours and resolution of headache and visual symptoms by 48 hours. The patient remained on labetalol and phenytoin at the time of discharge and was completely asymptomatic.

Eclampsia in a patient 11 days postpartum is relatively rare, although a brief literature search did reveal case reports of eclampsia in two patients nine days postpartum and one patient 16 days postpartum.

### Preventing postpartum weight retention… [^111DRBRA]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Weight change in the postpartum period is a dominant concern of new mothers. 1 Post-partum weight retention has important public health implications as well, because retention of gestational weight can be a significant contributor to long-term obesity and associated health risks. 2 Family physicians should be aware of normal postpartum weight loss patterns, as well as risk factors for weight retention, so they can assist their patients in achieving a healthy postpartum weight. Normal Postpartum Weight Loss Patterns The greatest amount of weight loss occurs in the first three months postpartum and then continues at a slow and steady rate until six months postpartum. 3–5 Studies relating lactation to postpartum weight loss have revealed inconsistent results, although most studies do not support the notion that breastfeeding accelerates postpartum weight loss or leads to less weight retention. 3, 5–9.

4, 5 A recent prospective trial 10 of 21 overweight, exclusively breastfeeding women found that caloric restriction by 500 kcal per day and 45 minutes of exercise per day, four days a week, resulting in a weight loss of approximately
0. 5 kg per week between four and 14 weeks postpartum, did not affect the growth of their infants when they were compared with a control group who neither restricted calories nor exercised more than once a week. In a 1995 prospective study 11 of 274 patients with a normal pre-gravid BMI, 28 percent had excessive gestational weight gain, retaining about 40 percent of the gestational weight at six months postpartum. This yielded an odds ratio of 2. 9 for being overweight at six months postpartum. Achieving a Healthy Postpartum Weight Family physicians should counsel their patients during pregnancy about the risks of excessive weight gain and subsequent obesity.

Gestational weight gain in excess of current IOM recommendations can lead to significant postpartum weight retention, especially in growing adolescents, minorities, and low-income patients. Family physicians can help patients develop realistic weight loss goals in the postpartum period and beyond, emphasizing that post-partum weight loss normally proceeds slowly and steadily. Lactation may not facilitate weight loss, especially if the patient consumes a high-calorie diet and does not routinely exercise for an adequate amount of time.
