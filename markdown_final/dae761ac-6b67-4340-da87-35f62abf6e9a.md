## Question

fasting insulin value of test

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the fasting insulin test — what it measures, how to interpret it, when it is useful, and how to act on results. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physiology and what fasting insulin actually reflects. Then, I should verify how fasting insulin is measured and the assay pitfalls. Next, I will review validated surrogate indices like HOMA-IR and QUICKI and their cutoffs. After that, I need to check the clinical contexts where fasting insulin adds value versus where it does not. Finally, I will synthesize practical interpretation and next steps, including when to escalate to dynamic testing or C-peptide, and I will double-check pediatric nuances and assay standardization issues before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the physiology. Fasting insulin reflects basal pancreatic beta-cell secretion and hepatic insulin clearance; in insulin resistance, basal insulin is often elevated to maintain euglycemia, so a higher fasting insulin signals compensated resistance, whereas low insulin in the face of hyperglycemia suggests beta-cell failure, which is a different pathophysiology I need to keep in mind [^05454fa9] [^17e57e08].

> Wait, let me verify the measurement issues before interpreting any number. Insulin assays vary widely in specificity and cross-reactivity, there is no universal reference range, and fasting insulin exhibits pulsatile secretion with substantial within-person variability; therefore, a single value can be misleading, and results are not comparable across laboratories without harmonized assays, which is why many guidelines de-emphasize routine fasting insulin testing in general practice [^fddb7c15] [^db9c822a] [^e5f48a26].

> I will now examine surrogate indices that incorporate fasting insulin. HOMA-IR uses fasting glucose and insulin to estimate hepatic insulin resistance; common cutoffs in adults include > 2.5–3.0 for metabolic risk, with some cohorts using > 4.65 or > 5.9 depending on the population and assay, while QUICKI, the inverse log transform, typically flags insulin resistance when < 0.35; I should confirm that these thresholds are population- and assay-specific and not overgeneralize across settings [^64077493] [^800041cb] [^48ad968d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical utility. In adults with obesity or metabolic syndrome, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR can help quantify insulin resistance and risk-stratify for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and elevated fasting insulin predicts incident metabolic syndrome in longitudinal cohorts; however, in children and adolescents, professional societies advise against routine fasting insulin or HOMA-IR for diagnosis because of poor standardization and limited added value over BMI and glucose measures, so I need to be cautious about ordering it in pediatrics [^8de2af3d] [^4a1d1e8e] [^e5f48a26].

> Let me consider special populations where fasting insulin is actually informative. In suspected insulinoma, inappropriately normal or elevated insulin in the face of hypoglycemia supports endogenous hyperinsulinism, and I should pair insulin with C-peptide and proinsulin to distinguish factitious insulin use; in chronic kidney disease, fasting insulin is artifactually elevated due to reduced clearance, so HOMA-IR overestimates resistance and clamp studies are preferred when available; in pregnancy, fasting insulin rises progressively and is not routinely used for GDM screening, though it may be elevated in GDM and can contextualize risk when interpreted with glucose values [^2621a5a8] [^f3389925] [^94816994] [^b41936bb].

> Next, I should review how to interpret a given fasting insulin value. I need to check the lab's reference range, ensure a true fasting state, and consider the clinical context; for example, a fasting insulin around 5–15 μU/mL with normal glucose suggests normal sensitivity, whereas values above roughly 20–25 μU/mL with normal glucose suggest compensated insulin resistance, and very high insulin with high glucose implies both resistance and beta-cell strain; but wait, I should double-check that these numeric anchors are assay-dependent and only rough guides, not diagnostic cut points [^db9c822a] [^800041cb].

> I should confirm when to escalate beyond fasting insulin. If prediabetes is suspected and fasting glucose is normal, a 75-g OGTT can uncover isolated impaired glucose tolerance driven by peripheral insulin resistance; if beta-cell function is the question, C-peptide (random or stimulated) better reflects endogenous secretion and is preferred in insulin-treated patients; and if I need a precise insulin sensitivity measure, a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp remains the gold standard, though it is impractical for routine care [^a0d60e4c] [^31079d4f] [^2621a5a8].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or adolescent with obesity? I initially thought HOMA-IR might be broadly useful there, but hold on, I should verify the guidance: the Endocrine Society advises against routine fasting insulin or HOMA-IR in youth because of lack of standardization and limited clinical utility; instead, screening should rely on fasting glucose, HbA1c, and risk factors, reserving insulin measures for research or select clinical scenarios [^e5f48a26] [^43206474].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. First, ensure a true fasting sample and interpret results only with the local lab's reference range and the concurrent fasting glucose. Second, calculate HOMA-IR or QUICKI if insulin was measured and consider the pattern: high insulin with normal glucose suggests compensated resistance, high insulin with high glucose suggests decompensation, and low insulin with high glucose suggests beta-cell failure. Third, use fasting insulin primarily to refine risk, guide lifestyle counseling, or inform etiologic workups in specific contexts, rather than as a standalone diagnostic test. Finally, avoid overinterpreting a single value and, when results are discordant or decisions hinge on accuracy, repeat fasting insulin or proceed to C-peptide or OGTT as appropriate [^64077493] [^a0d60e4c] [^31079d4f].

The fasting insulin test measures **basal insulin** after an overnight fast to assess insulin resistance or beta-cell function. Normal fasting insulin is **2–20 μU/mL** (12–120 pmol/L), but assay variability and lack of standardization limit absolute cutoffs [^fddb7c15] [^db9c822a]. Elevated fasting insulin with normal glucose indicates insulin resistance [^17e57e08]; low insulin with hyperglycemia suggests beta-cell dysfunction [^05454fa9]. HOMA-IR (fasting insulin × glucose / 22.5) is commonly used, with **> 2.5** suggesting insulin resistance, though population-specific thresholds vary [^64077493] [^800041cb]. Clinical context, concurrent glucose, and dynamic tests (OGTT, C-peptide) improve interpretation and guide management [^2621a5a8] [^31079d4f].

---

## Physiological basis of fasting insulin measurement

Fasting insulin reflects **basal insulin secretion** and hepatic clearance; it rises with insulin resistance to maintain normoglycemia and falls when beta-cell function declines [^e61cd35c] [^17e57e08]. Insulin is secreted in pulses, so single measurements can vary; repeated sampling or use of indices improves reliability [^fe0767ce] [^94d08f7d].

---

## Normal fasting insulin levels

Typical fasting insulin ranges are **2–20 μU/mL** (12–120 pmol/L), but assays differ and lack standardization, so lab-specific reference intervals are essential [^fddb7c15] [^db9c822a]. Population differences (age, sex, BMI, ethnicity) further complicate universal cutoffs [^c9c792d6].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated fasting insulin

Elevated fasting insulin with normal glucose indicates **compensatory hyperinsulinemia** from insulin resistance [^17e57e08]. It predicts higher risk of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [^8de2af3d] [^4a1d1e8e]. In obesity, fasting insulin correlates with hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance and tracks with cardiometabolic risk [^32d93eb1] [^17e57e08].

---

## Clinical significance of low fasting insulin

Low fasting insulin with elevated glucose suggests **beta-cell dysfunction** or insulin deficiency, as in type 1 diabetes or advanced type 2 diabetes [^e3ea050f]. In hypoglycemia, inappropriately normal or elevated insulin with low glucose suggests endogenous hyperinsulinism (e.g. insulinoma) [^e3ea050f].

---

## Calculation and interpretation of HOMA-IR

HOMA-IR = (fasting insulin [μU/mL] × fasting glucose [mmol/L]) / 22.5; **> 2.5** commonly indicates insulin resistance, but thresholds vary by population and assay [^64077493] [^800041cb]. HOMA-IR correlates with clamp-derived insulin resistance and is widely used in research and clinics [^94d08f7d] [^64077493].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Assay variability**: Lack of standardization limits comparability across labs [^fddb7c15] [^db9c822a].
- **Physiological variability**: Pulsatile secretion and circadian rhythms affect single measurements [^fe0767ce].
- **Population specificity**: Cutoffs should be population- and assay-specific [^800041cb] [^c9c792d6].
- **Clinical context**: Always interpret alongside glucose, BMI, and clinical findings [^2621a5a8].

---

## Clinical applications and guidelines

- **Metabolic syndrome**: Elevated fasting insulin supports the diagnosis and risk stratification [^8de2af3d] [^4a1d1e8e].
- **Prediabetes**: Helps identify insulin resistance in normoglycemia [^17e57e08] [^72bbdf7e].
- **Diabetes management**: Informative in type 2 diabetes, less useful in type 1 diabetes [^notfound].
- **Pediatrics**: Not routinely recommended due to variability and lack of standardization [^e5f48a26].

---

## Alternative and complementary tests

- **OGTT**: Assesses glucose tolerance and insulin dynamics; more sensitive than fasting glucose alone [^9fc58e38] [^b800a811].
- **C-peptide**: Assesses endogenous insulin secretion; useful in insulin-treated patients [^31079d4f] [^e8618519].
- **Clamp studies**: Gold standard for insulin resistance, but impractical for routine use [^88924a16] [^2621a5a8].

## Clinical interpretation and management strategies

| **Fasting insulin level** | **Clinical interpretation** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|-|
| Elevated (> 20 μU/mL) | Insulin resistance | - Lifestyle modification <br/> - Weight loss <br/> - Exercise <br/> - Pharmacotherapy (e.g. metformin) [^notfound] |
| Low (< 2 μU/mL) | Beta-cell dysfunction | - Insulin therapy <br/> - Beta-cell assessment <br/> - Diabetes management [^notfound] |
| Normal (2–20 μU/mL) | Normal insulin sensitivity | - Routine monitoring <br/> - Lifestyle maintenance [^notfound] |

---

The fasting insulin test provides insight into **insulin resistance** and beta-cell function, but results must be interpreted in clinical context and with awareness of assay limitations. HOMA-IR is a practical tool, and dynamic tests or C-peptide refine diagnosis and guide therapy [^2621a5a8] [^31079d4f].

### What is a normal glucose value? Differences in indexes of plasma glucose homeostasis in subjects with normal fasting glucose [^098c2121]. Diabetes Care (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate differences in indexes of plasma glucose/insulin homeostasis and cardiovascular disease risk factors among subjects with normal fasting glucose (NFG), impaired fasting glucose, or glucose intolerance. Although individuals with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations > 5.4 mmol/l but < 6.1 mmol/l have been shown to have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes over 5 years, little is known about glucose metabolism abnormalities in this population.

Research Design and Methods

We compared insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity using several indexes derived from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in 668 subjects from the Quebec Family Study who had varying degrees of FPG.

Results

There was a progressive decline in indexes of beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity when moving from NFG to type 2 diabetes. Compared with subjects with low NFG (FPG < 4.9 mmol/l), subjects with high NFG (FPG 5.3–6.1 mmol/l) were more insulin resistant (P < 0.01), had higher insulin and C-peptide responses during an OGTT (P < 0.05), and had reduced insulin secretion (corrected for insulin resistance). Subjects with high NFG were also characterized by higher plasma triglyceride levels and reduced HDL cholesterol concentrations and by a smaller LDL particle size. All these differences remained significant, even after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and waist circumference. In addition, subjects with mid NFG (FPG 4.9–5.3 mmol/l) were characterized by impaired insulin secretion, decreased insulin sensitivity, higher triglyceride concentrations, and lower HDL cholesterol concentrations compared with subjects with low NFG.

Conclusions

Independent of age, sex, and adiposity, there are differences in indexes of plasma glucose/insulin homeostasis and in cardiovascular risk factors among subjects with low, mid, and high NFG, suggesting the presence, in the upper normal glucose range, of abnormalities in glucose homeostasis, which may predispose to type 2 diabetes.

### Insulin initiation: bringing objectivity to choice [^b16b1589]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Short term glycemic indices

Parameter 1: fasting plasma glucose

Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) is a function of hepatic glucose output, and is a prime target for effective anti-diabetes therapy. Basal insulin is more effective than prandial insulin at controlling fasting glycemia. This observation is concordant with the basic pharmacology of basal insulin.

Fasting plasma glucose levels, therefore, can be considered as an objective marker to guide the choice of insulin preparation. High FPG levels should prompt a basal insulin prescription, while relatively normal FPG levels in the setting of uncontrolled HbA1c may encourage a consideration of alternative regimes.

The drawback with using FPG as a single deciding factor, however, is that it does not assess the relative contribution of postprandial hyperglycemia. This value alone does not help one decide whether to choose a basal or a basal-bolus regime for management of diabetes. Hence, while it should be one of the factors used to inform insulin decision making, it cannot be the sole marker for this purpose.

### Values of fasting glucose levels, glucose tolerance tests, and glucose-insulin ratios as predictors of glucose tolerance [^b98c6015]. Fertility and Sterility (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the ability to use parameters obtainable from an oral glucose tolerance test to predict insulin action as determined under hyperinsulinemic, hyperglycemic conditions.

Design

Prospective clinical investigation.

Setting

University medical center clinical research unit.

Patient(S)

Healthy male volunteers.

Intervention(S)

Oral glucose tolerance test and hyperglycemic (+125 mg/dL) clamp studies.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Glucose and insulin (I) levels, rate of glucose uptake (M) under hyperglycemic conditions, and M/I ratios.

Result(S)

Among individuals with normal glucose tolerance, as assessed by an oral glucose tolerance test, the fasting insulin level is the glucose tolerance test parameter that correlates best with insulin action during a hyperglycemic clamp.

Conclusion(S)

Measurement of fasting serum insulin levels in conjunction with an oral glucose tolerance test improves the ability to assess insulin action. Such combinations may improve the ability to diagnose insulin-resistant states.

### Insulin assay standardization: leading to measures of insulin sensitivity and secretion for practical clinical care [^fddb7c15]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

We call for the introduction of a sustainable insulin assay standardization program. A standardized insulin assay will encourage research leading to measures of insulin sensitivity that will be practical for clinical care in a general population. Cutoff values of insulin concentrations and insulin sensitivity can then be determined that are associated with known magnitude of risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Additional criteria could be developed, perhaps based on fasting or stimulated insulin concentrations, which would guide therapy for type 2 diabetes and assist in confirming the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Insulin secretion and action are central to the pathophysiology of diabetes. It is time to address the chaos in the measures of these key processes.

### Insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity in relation to fasting glucose in healthy subjects [^123e68ae]. Diabetes Care (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This study evaluated insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity in healthy subjects with normal fasting glucose.

Research Design and Methods

A total of 148 healthy women (aged 53–70 years) underwent a glucose-dependent arginine stimulation test and a 2-h euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. In the arginine test, arginine (5 g) was injected intravenously under baseline (fasting) conditions and after raising the glucose levels to 15 and > 28 mmol/l. From this test, the acute insulin response (AIR) to arginine during the three glucose levels (AIR1, AIR2, and AIR3) were estimated. The subjects were divided into quartiles of fasting glucose (n = 37 in each group [range < 4.32; 4.33–4.84; 4.85–5.22; and 5.23–6.1 mmol/l, respectively).

Results

The results show that 1) AIR1 was higher in subjects in the two highest quartiles (P = 0.004), 2) AIR3 was higher in the quartile with the highest fasting glucose (P = 0.012), and 3) insulin sensitivity was reduced in subjects in the highest quartile (P = 0.026) compared with the lower quartiles. The results also show, in contrast, that AIR2 did not show a similar trend to be increased at higher fasting glucose.

Conclusions

It is concluded that 1) raised fasting glucose (albeit still within normal values) augments baseline and maximal arginine-induced insulin secretion in healthy subjects, and 2) this is associated with reduced insulin sensitivity. This suggests that high, but still normal, fasting glucose may contribute to the augmented insulin secretion in subjects with low insulin sensitivity.

### Evaluation of glycaemic status in young people with clinical insulin resistance; fasting glucose, fasting insulin or an oral glucose tolerance test? [^fcef9c92]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

It is important to identify young people with prediabetes for early intervention. However, it is unclear how to best screen overweight and obese young people for prediabetes. The objective of this study was to compare fasting indices with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in diagnosing prediabetes.

Design

Retrospective review.

Patients

A total of 224 young people, aged 12.0 years (range: 3.2–17.3 years), with clinical features of insulin resistance, who had an OGTT between 2000 and 2007 at a tertiary children's hospital, Sydney, Australia.

Measurements

Oral glucose tolerance test.

Results

A total of 168 (75%) participants had normal glucose tolerance, 45 (20%) had prediabetes and 11 (5%) had type 2 diabetes; 29 of those with prediabetes and 10 with type 2 diabetes were identified by fasting glucose criteria alone. Young people with normal fasting glucose and fasting insulin ≤ 180 pmol/l had lower insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment median 1.9 vs. 4.2, P < 0.001), higher insulin sensitivity index (2.4 vs. 1.0, P < 0.001) and a lower early insulin response (insulinogenic index 2.5 vs. 4.1, P < 0.001) compared to those with normal fasting glucose and higher fasting insulin levels. If a fasting insulin cut point (≤ 180 pmol/l) was used in addition to fasting glucose to determine the need for an OGTT, 114 (68%) young people with normal glucose tolerance would have avoided the test. By contrast, the diagnosis of impaired glucose tolerance, identified by an OGTT, would have been missed in three children.

Conclusion

Fasting glucose and insulin levels should be measured in young people with insulin resistance before undertaking a time- and resource-intensive OGTT.

### Pediatric obesity-assessment, treatment, and prevention: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^e5f48a26]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Pediatric obesity — plasma insulin measurement and insulin resistance: Although commonly obtained, insulin measurements do not add to diagnosis and are not recommended; attempts to diagnose insulin resistance by measuring plasma insulin concentration or any surrogate in clinical settings have no merit because they have no diagnostic value, there is no well-defined cutoff or universally accepted numeric expression, adult studies show fasting insulin explains no more than 5% to 50% of variability in insulin sensitivity and proposed cutoffs vary by 2.5-fold, fasting insulin can be similar in obese youths with normal versus impaired glucose tolerance, and therefore measuring plasma insulin concentrations remains a research tool with no clinical value for evaluation of obesity.

### Impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glycaemia: the current status on definition and intervention [^8e28d157]. Diabetic Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

A workshop was convened by the International Diabetes Federation to review the latest information relating to the risks associated with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) for future diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The workshop sought to address three questions: (i) are the current definitions of IGT and IFG appropriate; (ii) are IFG and IGT risk factors, risk markers or diseases; (iii) what interventions (if any) should be recommended for people with IFG and IGT? The determinants of elevated fasting glucose and 2-h plasma glucose in an oral glucose tolerance test (2-HPG) levels differ. Raised hepatic glucose output and a defect in early insulin secretion are characteristic of the former, and peripheral insulin resistance is most characteristic of the latter. Therefore, it is not surprising that the concordance between the categories of IFG and IGT is limited. In all prevalence studies to date only half or less of people with IFG have IGT, and even a lower proportion (20–30%) with IGT also have IFG. In the majority of populations studied, IGT is more prevalent than IFG, and there is a difference in phenotype and gender distribution between the two categories. IFG is substantially more common amongst men and IGT slightly more common amongst women. The prevalence of IFG tends to plateau in middle age whereas the prevalence of IGT rises into old age. Both IFG and IGT are associated with a substantially increased risk of developing diabetes, with the highest risk in people with combined IFG and IGT. Because IGT is commoner than IFG in most populations it is more sensitive (but slightly less specific) for identifying people who will develop diabetes. In most populations studied, 60% of people who develop diabetes have either IGT or IFG 5 years or so before, with the other 40% having normal glucose tolerance at that time. The limited published data suggest that both isolated IFG (I-IFG) and isolated IGT (I-IGT) are similarly associated with cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidaemia, with the highest risk in those with combined IFG and IGT. However, some data have suggested that I-IGT is more strongly associated with hypertension and dyslipidaemia (features of the metabolic syndrome) than I-IFG. In unadjusted analyses both IFG and IGT are associated with CVD and total mortality. In separate analyses for fasting and 2-HPG adjusted for other cardiovascular risk factors (from the DECODE study) there remains a continuous relationship between 2-HPG and mortality, but an independent relationship with fasting glucose is only found above 7.0 mmol/l. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels are continuously and positively associated with CVD and total mortality independent of other CVD risk factors. Life style interventions, including weight loss and increased physical activity, are highly effective in preventing or delaying the onset of diabetes in people with IGT. Two randomized controlled trials of individuals with IGT found that life style intervention studies reduce the risk of progressing to diabetes by 58%. The oral hypoglycaemic drugs metformin and acarbose have also been shown to be effective, but less so than the life style measures. Similar data do not yet exist for the effectiveness of such interventions in people with I-IFG. Larger studies are required to evaluate the effects of interventions on cardiovascular outcomes in people with IGT. Cost effective strategies to identify people with IGT for intervention should be developed and evaluated. The use of simple risk scores to assess who should undergo an oral glucose tolerance test is one promising approach, although these will need to be population-specific. In conclusion, IGT and IFG differ in their prevalence, population distribution, phenotype, and risk of total mortality and CVD. The consensus of the workshop was: 1. The diagnostic thresholds for all categories of glucose intolerance should be revisited in the light of the latest evidence. There was no clear consensus (with current evidence) on whether IFG and IGT should be classified as diseases, but they clearly represent risk factors and risk markers for diabetes and CVD, respectively. 2. Both IGT and IFG are similarly associated with an increased risk of diabetes, but IGT is more strongly associated with CVD outcomes. 3. Risks are higher when IGT and IFG coexist. 4. Life style interventions are highly effective in delaying or preventing the onset of diabetes in people with IGT and may reduce CVD and total mortality, but the latter requires formal testing.

### Should prediabetes be treated pharmacologically? [^9719bda2]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Summary Points

Prediabetes is a dysglycemia with glycemic values between normal and those that define diabetes. People with prediabetes are characterized by decreased insulin sensitivity (insulin resistance) and impaired insulin secretion that cannot meet the extra demands on the pancreatic beta cells imposed by the insulin resistance. Prediabetes increases the risk for the subsequent development of diabetes. This risk begins with a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration of 4.6–4.8 mmol/L and increases in a curvilinear manner, with the chances of developing diabetes progressively rising the closer the dysglycemia is to the diagnostic criteria for diabetes.

The criteria for the diagnosis of prediabetes differs between the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the international community (Table 1). Moreover, in contrast to the recommendation that the diagnosis of diabetes be confirmed, there is no such recommendation for the diagnosis of prediabetes. This is unfortunate because on a repeat oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) within 2–6 weeks, approximately half of individuals with Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) have a normal result. If the international Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) criterion were used to diagnose prediabetes, 32% were normal on repeat testing. OGTTs are rarely used in clinical practice (except in pregnancy) so the diagnosis of prediabetes rests on FPG and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) testing. Depending on where one lives and the test used for the diagnosis, there is a marked difference in whether an individual will be diagnosed with prediabetes or not. To illustrate using the largest possible difference, the prevalence of prediabetes in the USA diagnosed by a FPG concentration of 5.6–6.9 mmol/L is 37.5% compared with the international prevalence diagnosed by an HbA1c level of 42–46 mmol/mol of 5.8%.

### Homeostasis model assessment: insulin resistance and β-cell function from fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in man [^fa7e24ec]. Diabetologia (1985). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)" for polycystic ovary syndrome and diabetes mellitus type 2.

The Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) estimates insulin resistance based on fasting plasma glucose and fasting plasma insulin levels. It is widely used to assess metabolic health, particularly in studies of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.

The Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) offers insights into an individual's insulin sensitivity using two key measurements: fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels. These inputs are required to evaluate insulin resistance and can be provided in different units.

For fasting glucose, you can use:

- mg/dL, with a range from 50 to 400
- mmol/L, with a range from 2.78 to 22.2

For fasting insulin, the options are:

- uIU/mL, with a range from 1 to 100
- pmol/L, with a range from 6 to 600

If the measurements are given in mmol/L or pmol/L, conversions will be necessary. Convert fasting glucose from mmol/L to mg/dL by multiplying by 18.0182. For insulin, convert from pmol/L to uIU/mL by dividing by 6.

After standardizing the units, the HOMA-IR score is calculated using the formula:

HOMA-IR Score = (fasting insulin in uIU/mL * fasting glucose in mg/dL) / 405

The result, rounded to two decimal places, determines the level of insulin resistance:

- Scores less than 1 indicate normal insulin sensitivity.
- Scores from 1 to just under 2 suggest mild insulin resistance.
- Scores from 2 to just under 3 imply moderate insulin resistance.
- Scores of 3 or more reflect severe insulin resistance.

These interpretations help contextualize how the body's insulin management might be impacting health, signaling the potential risk for conditions associated with insulin resistance.

### Rationale and methods for the estimation of insulin secretion in a given patient: from research to clinical practice [^b8a97311]. Diabetes (2002). Low credibility.

Although the plasma insulin assay is now 40 years old, it is not widely used in clinical practice. However, simple methods (such as the various indexes relating fasting insulin to fasting glucose), the increase in plasma insulin at the 30th minute of an oral glucose tolerance test, and the increase in insulin or C-peptide after stimulation by glucagon are relatively reliable compared with more sophisticated approaches to assess beta-cell sensitivity to glucose, kinetics of insulin secretion, residual insulin secretion, or insulin sensitivity. But these measures are of no decisive help in distinguishing between the various forms of impaired fasting glucose or non-insulin-dependent diabetes, such as type 2 diabetes, slow type 1 diabetes, the various forms of maturity-onset diabetes of the young, or the mitochondrial genome defects. No data are available to show that the measurement of plasma insulin may be of help to adapt the treatment of a diabetic patient, except for the need of insulin therapy. There are some suggestions that fasting plasma insulin and, more precisely, the homeostasis model assessment indexes may help to predict the progression toward diabetes or the progressive deterioration of beta-cell function in diabetic patients.

### Does the association of the triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio with fasting serum insulin differ by race / ethnicity? [^3c2cf21b]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2008). Low credibility.

It is of great interest that the association of the TG/HDL-C ratio with hyperinsulinemia was stronger among people with a BMI < 25 kg/m 2 than those with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2. As shown in a previous study, about 16% people with normal weight (BMI < 25 kg/m 2) was identified to be insulin resistant; thus search for clinically simple and useful biomarkers to detect insulin resistance among people with normal weight is necessary. Although BMI, a less expensive and convenient measure, may serve as an indicator for insulin resistance among people with excessive weight, an elevation in the TG/HDL-C ratio could be a novel marker for hyperinsulinemia among people with normal weight in routine clinical practice.

Our study has several strengths that deserve attention. First, the generalizability of our results has been enhanced by the use of a nationally representative sample. Second, the large sample for each of the three racial/ethnic groups enables us to empirically test differences between the groups in the associations of the TG/HDL-C ratio with FSI. A limitation stems from the use of FSI as a surrogate measure of insulin resistance in our data, but previous studies have shown that fasting insulin is a valid and reliable surrogate measure of insulin resistance. Furthermore, although a direct measure would theoretically be preferable, the lack of standardized insulin assay greatly limits the clinical utility of that approach for identifying insulin-resistant persons. Without a standard insulin assay, no absolute value can be developed to predict the presence of insulin resistance across laboratories or clinical settings. Thus, if one wants to use fasting insulin to assess the state of insulin resistance, it is necessary to develop different cut-points for every assay. In contrast, triglyceride and HDL cholesterol concentrations are standardized and readily available measures in routine clinical practice. Consequently, it seems more clinically effective to use relatively simple metabolic markers such as the TG/HDL-C concentration ratio in the effort to identify apparently healthy people at increased risk of developing a variety of adverse clinical outcomes.

### Insulin sensitivity and its measurement: structural commonalities among the methods [^e61cd35c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2000). Low credibility.

Insulin is the principal hormone of metabolic regulation. Reduced responses to insulin constitute an underlying feature of type 2 diabetes. It is, therefore, incumbent on those who work in this area (as well as many others) to characterize this response, in as simple and consistent a way as possible, so that this measure can be used both in the investigational and clinical setting. This type of approach, although eminently useful, is necessarily an oversimplification. Not only does insulin sensitivity change in pathological situations, but also in normal physiology. Tissue-specific, metabolite-specific, as well as process-specific responses may be expected to occur. Variations also occur in time-depending on the physiological state of the individual (e.g. pregnancy, aging) or following diurnal rhythms. It is perhaps remarkable that any consistent assessment of overall insulin sensitivity can be made. The observation that this can often be achieved has led to hypotheses suggesting that sensitivity to insulin is primarily determined at a single site (tissue, metabolite). At the same time, there are many discussions about the inconsistencies inherent in different approaches to the measurement of this parameter, suggesting that some of these variants, metabolic or otherwise, could lead to the low correlation between methods sometimes seen. Nevertheless, most methods used in the assessment of insulin sensitivity examine the response to insulin of a single metabolite, glucose, primarily in the muscle and liver, and under fasting conditions and should, therefore, demonstrate insulin sensitivity that is comparable among methods.

### Elevated fasting insulin predicts the future incidence of metabolic syndrome: a 5-year follow-up study [^8de2af3d]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Morrison et al. have recently shown that an interaction between the BMI and the HOMA score is associated with the development of MS in children and De Boer et al. has shown in children that the features of MS are correlated with the fasting insulin levels. Not surprisingly, higher fasting glucose within the normal range in children is associated with increased insulin levels, yet that study was correlative rather than prognostic. Our study adds to the growing evidence by showing that elevated insulin occurs early and it predicts the subsequent development of MS. We have also found that an elevated fasting insulin level itself is potentially a key early feature in the pathophysiology of the clinical risk factor cluster of MS.

There have been many studies that have shown that patients with MS are at an increased risk of cardiovascular atherosclerosis. Mehta et al. have recently shown that measures of insulin resistance, such as HOMA-IR, add predictive value over and above the diagnosis of MS itself in terms of the correlation with coronary artery calcification, which is a marker of the atherosclerotic risk. In the study by Tenenbaum et al. insulin resistance assessed by HOMA-IR was an independent predictor for new major cardiovascular events among patients with preexisting coronary artery disease. Therefore, strategies that screen patients' insulin levels and therapies that specifically target hyperinsulinemia may have value to prevent this common risk factor for CVD.

### A novel fasting blood test for insulin resistance and prediabetes [^3e1504af]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Insulin resistance (IR) can precede the dysglycemic states of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by a number of years and is an early marker of risk for metabolic and cardiovascular disease. There is an unmet need for a simple method to measure IR that can be used for routine screening, prospective study, risk assessment, and therapeutic monitoring. We have reported several metabolites whose fasting plasma levels correlated with insulin sensitivity. These metabolites were used in the development of a novel test for IR and prediabetes.

Methods

Data from the Relationship between Insulin Sensitivity and Cardiovascular Disease Study were used in an iterative process of algorithm development to define the best combination of metabolites for predicting the M value derived from the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, the gold standard measure of IR. Subjects were divided into a training set and a test set for algorithm development and validation. The resulting calculated M score, M(Q), was utilized to predict IR and the risk of progressing from normal glucose tolerance to impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) over a 3 year period.

Results

M(Q) correlated with actual M values, with an r value of 0.66. In addition, the test detects IR and predicts 3 year IGT progression with areas under the curve of 0.79 and 0.70, respectively, outperforming other simple measures such as fasting insulin, fasting glucose, homeostatic model assessment of IR, or body mass index.

Conclusions

The result, Quantose(TM), is a simple test for IR based on a single fasting blood sample and may have value as an early indicator of risk for the development of prediabetes and T2DM.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^6f6f72c9]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

In 2003, the ADA lowered the threshold for "normal" FPG from < 6.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL) to < 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL). This change has been contentious and has not been accepted by all organizations. The rationale is based on data that individuals with FPG values between 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and 6.05 mmol/L (109 mg/dL) are at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes. More-recent evidence indicates that FPG concentrations even lower than 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) are associated with a graded risk for type 2 diabetes. Data were obtained from 13,163 men between 26 and 45 years of age who had FPG values < 5.55 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and were followed for a mean of 5.7 years. Men with FPG values of 4.83–5.05 mmol/L (87–91 mg/dL) have a significantly increased risk of type 2 diabetes, compared with men with FPG values < 4.5 mmol/L (81 mg/dL). Although the prevalence of diabetes is low at these glucose concentrations, the data support the concept of a continuum between FPG and the risk of diabetes.

RECOMMENDATION: ROUTINE MEASUREMENT OF PLASMA GLUCOSE CONCENTRATIONS IN AN ACCREDITED LABORATORY IS NOT RECOMMENDED AS THE PRIMARY MEANS OF MONITORING OR EVALUATING THERAPY IN INDIVIDUALS WITH DIABETES B (low).

### Diminution of early insulin response to glucose in subjects with normal but minimally elevated fasting plasma glucose. evidence for early β-cell dysfunction [^3ab6644d]. Diabetic Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Aim

Systematic analysis of beta-cell function in Japanese health examinees.

Methods

In 938 Japanese health examinees (627 men and 311 women, mean age and body mass index, 54.0 years and 23.6 kg/m2, respectively), plasma specific insulin was measured at fasting and during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. The subjects were stratified into six groups based on fasting plasma glucose ≤ 5.1 mmol/l, 5.2–6.0 mmol/l, 6.1–6.9 mmol/l, 7.0–7.8 mmol/l, 7.9–8.7 mmol/l, and ≥ 8.8 mmol/l as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th groups, respectively.

Results

Distribution of fasting insulin showed a very modest 'inverted U' shape, with the peak in the 5th group. Progressive increase from the 1st toward the 5th group was significant. In contrast, the ratio of change in insulin to change in glucose from 0 to 30 min during the glucose tolerance test was greatest in the 1st group and progressively declined in the groups with higher fasting glycaemia. Difference in the ratio was most striking and highly significant between the 1st and 2nd groups. Distribution of the insulin to glucose ratio of subjects with normal glucose tolerance significantly overlapped with that of untreated patients with diabetes.

Conclusions

In a Japanese population, (i) beta-cell starts to deteriorate during normoglycaemia with a minimal elevation of fasting plasma glucose, and (ii) there are glucose-tolerant subjects with beta-cell dysfunction.

### Glucoregulatory physiology in subjects with low-normal, high-normal, or impaired fasting glucose [^7d6b9e07]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

We determined whether variations in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) within the nondiabetic range represent differences in insulin action or secretion.

Subjects and Methods

Using results of the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, we classified 39 adults (body mass index range 20–56 kg/m2) as having normal fasting glucose (NFG, < 100 mg/dl, n = 24) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG, 100–125 mg/dl, n = 15). The NFG group was subdivided into low-NFG (< 90 mg/dl, n = 11) and high-NFG (90–99 mg/dl, n = 13). The 2-h oral glucose tolerance test plasma glucose value was used to assign normal or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) status. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, quantitative insulin sensitivity check index, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance; beta-cell function was assessed by calculating the insulinogenic index, homeostasis model assessment, and the disposition index.

Results

Compared with low-NFG subjects, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance were lower among persons with isolated IFG and combined IFG-IGT. The hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (micromol/kg x min(-1)/pmol/liter) was 0.109 ± 0.011 in low-NFG subjects, 0.088 ± 0.009 in IFG subjects (P = 0.04), and 0.022 ± 0.003 in IFG-IGT subjects (P = 0.0014). The spread in FPG from 70–125 mg/dl was associated with a greater than 3-fold difference in insulin sensitivity. Compared with low-NFG subjects, the disposition index decreased by 32.8% in high-NFG subjects (P = 0.08), by 45.6% in subjects with isolated IFG (P < 0.02), and by 49.8% (P < 0.02) in those with combined IFG-IGT.

Conclusion

Compared with persons with low-NFG, those with IFG or combined IFG-IGT have significant alteration of glucoregulatory physiology, whereas high-NFG (pre-prediabetes) status might portend nascent glucoregulatory perturbations.

C-peptide testing — indications, sampling, and interpretation in insulin-treated individuals: A C-peptide test is only indicated in people receiving insulin treatment, and a random sample with concurrent glucose within 5 h of eating can replace a formal stimulation test for classification; if the result is ≥ 600 pmol/L (≥ 1.8 ng/mL) the circumstances of testing do not matter, whereas if the result is < 600 pmol/L (< 1.8 ng/mL) with concurrent glucose < 4 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL) or possible fasting, consider repeating the test, noting that very low levels (e.g., < 80 pmol/L [< 0.24 ng/mL]) do not need to be repeated; C-peptide values 200–600 pmol/L (0.6–1.8 ng/mL) are indeterminate, C-peptide must be measured prior to insulin discontinuation, and C-peptide should not be tested within 2 weeks of a hyperglycemic emergency.

Fasting insulin response assessments

Multiple-sampled glucose tolerance tests required to produce the Kraft and Hayashi patterns are resource-intensive. This may explain the popularity of fasting measures such as homeostasis modal assessment (HOMA). HOMA was originally developed to assess insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), pancreatic beta-cell function (HOMA-β) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S) from fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations. This is based on the relationship between basal insulin and glucose concentrations reflecting hepatic glucose output and insulin secretion. Normal pancreatic beta-cell function or insulin sensitivity is considered 100% and normal insulin resistance is 1.0. HOMA variants can be determined either by using the calculations shown in figure 1 or by using HOMA 2 from the online calculator. HOMA2 uses model-derived estimates, which better accounts for variations in glucose resistance and when plasma glucose concentrations are above 10 mmol/L. However, there are numerous flaws to using measures based on fasting insulin as discussed below.

Figure 1
HOMA calculations where glucose is mmol/L and insulin is mU/L.HOMA, homeostasis model assessment; HOMA-β; HOMA to assess pancreatic beta-cell function; HOMA-IR, HOMA to assess insulin resistance; HOMA-S, HOMA to assess insulin sensitivity.

Flaws in using fasting insulin resistance models

There are several flaws with using insulin resistance models that are based on fasting insulin and glucose concentrations, including the physiology of insulin secretion and basal levels, the use of insulin resistance as the disease state of concern, and implementation and interpretation of the test itself.

Insulin physiology

Plasma insulin concentrations are labile due to the physiology of insulin release from the pancreas. Insulin is released in a pulsatile manner leading to oscillatory concentrations in the blood. These oscillations have a slow ultradian periodicity (~140 min), which is modulated by a small-amplitude high-frequency oscillation (periodicity 3–10 min). It is hypothesised that the periodic release of insulin prevents downregulation of receptors leading to insulin resistance. Loss of these regular insulin oscillations is considered to be an early indicator of diabetes.

However, these oscillations make a single sample of insulin impractical for clinical practice, as it will be unknown where the insulin levels lie in these periodic cycles. It has been suggested that if fasting insulin concentrations are required, then the average of three samples, taken at 5 min intervals, should be used; however, this rarely is done in clinical practice.

### Elevated fasting insulin predicts the future incidence of metabolic syndrome: a 5-year follow-up study [^5b0ec9d7]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Metabolic syndrome (MS) has received increased attention as an important epidemiological tool for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). MS is a cluster of CVD and T2DM risk factors with a shared pathophysiology. Although there is still debate about insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia being central to the clustering of these common CVD risk factors, they have been recognized as pathophysiologic linking factors of MS. Early and identification of those people who are most likely to develop the MS and/or its component features should lead to targeted and "tailored" intervention strategies, and particularly lifestyle modifications such as exercise and dietary changes.

So far, there have been only limited data of the relationship between the future development of MS and the baseline insulin level, which is a surrogate maker of insulin sensitivity/resistance. Thus, in this large, well characterized, cohort study of otherwise healthy subjects without T2DM or MS, we aimed to assess whether the baseline insulin levels can predict the development of MS. We hypothesized that measuring the fasting insulin in healthy subjects can predict the subsequent development of MS.

### Fasting serum C-peptide levels predict cardiovascular and overall death in nondiabetic adults [^eadb9152]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Insulin resistance is a component of type 2 diabetesand is associated with obesityand glucose, lipid and blood pressure dysregulation, in a conglomeration of cardiovascular risk factors defined as metabolic syndrome. – Insulin resistance is characterized by hyperinsulinemiain the setting of normal or elevated serum glucose and has been related to incident diabetes, coronary heart disease, – and mortality – in subgroups of nondiabetic subjects. Therefore, assessment of insulin resistance is an important way to identify individuals without diabetes who are at an increased risk for adverse outcomes and potentially targets them for early intervention.

Previous studies have included measurement of serum insulin levels as a marker of insulin resistance. An alternative marker is C‐peptide, a protein that is cosecreted with insulin on an equimolar basis from pancreatic beta cells. Unlike insulin, it does not undergo hepatic first pass metabolism, has a longer half‐life, and has been recognized as a more stable and accurate marker of endogenous insulin secretion. – However, there is limited data on the clinical and epidemiological value of C‐peptide measurement as a marker of insulin resistance, especially in individuals without known diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, it is unclear how C‐peptide compares to other known indices of insulin resistance in predicting cardiovascular and overall death.

We hypothesized that fasting serum C‐peptide level is a better marker of insulin resistance than insulin level alone and would be useful in the prediction of death related to cardiovascular disease in adults without diabetes. To test this hypothesis, we compared fasting serum C‐peptide level to other measures of insulin resistance as a predictor of future cardiovascular and overall death using biochemical and outcome data from a nationally representative sample of nondiabetic adults living in the United States. Additionally, we studied the relationship between C‐peptide levels and mortality related to cardiovascular diseases, independent of other known cardiovascular or diabetes risk factors.

### Joint analysis of fasting and postprandial plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in Venezuelan women [^37705245]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in fasting and postprandial reflect the metabolism of glucose by the human body and are useful in the diagnosis of metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and insulin resistance. In this work, these concentrations are jointly analyzed in Venezuelan women and 28 classes that better specify each metabolic condition are generated.

Materials and Methods

Each class comprises a combination of fasting and postprandial ranges of glucose and insulin concentrations defined in the literature as normal, impaired and diabetic. A hypothesis test was used to find statistically significant differences between the classes, and confidence intervals for age and glucose and insulin concentrations were defined for each class.

Results and Conclusion

The process of deterioration of glucose metabolism advances with the age of the subject, more than half of the prediabetics have impaired glucose levels in fasting but normal in postprandial and normal insulin levels in fasting and postprandial, and one third of diabetics have diabetic glucose levels in fasting and postprandial and normal insulin levels in fasting and postprandial. This categorization of subjects would allow the application of a more specific treatment and the possibility of predicting the progress of the metabolic disorder.

### Early insulin resistance in normoglycemic low-risk individuals is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis [^f39e735a]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is preceded by a slow, progressive subclinical disease that can start as early as childhood. Similarly, early insulin resistance, defined as the slow progressive need for higher fasting insulin to maintain normal fasting glucose concentrations, can be seen years or decades before the appearance of increased fasting glucose, glucose intolerance, and elevated glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) that are characteristic of the insulin resistance–prediabetes–type 2 diabetes spectrum.

Elevated HbA1c is an established index of cumulative exposure to high blood glucose that has already been shown to be associated with subclinical atherosclerosis (SA), even at values below the thresholds for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. Moreover, combining HbA1c with classical cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) significantly improves the prediction of the multiterritorial extent of SA. However, there is no previously published information about the potential added value of identifying earlier stages of insulin resistance when HbA1c is still "normal" or the association with the presence of SA. Insulin is rarely measured in routine clinical practice, precluding identification of early insulin resistance until later, more advanced stages of the type 2 diabetes disease spectrum. Similarly, SA frequently goes undetected until the first clinical event.

The homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) ratio is an easy-to-measure surrogate of early insulin resistance. The higher the insulin concentration needed to maintain low fasting glucose levels, the higher the HOMA-IR value, indicating the early development of insulin resistance. HOMA-IR also has the advantage of being a simple, feasible, and economical measure that can be easily integrated into medical practice and is a proven robust clinical and epidemiological tool. The present study explored the association of HOMA-IR with SA in a large cohort of middle-aged individuals with normal HbA1c and no established CVD.

### Fasting and 2-hour plasma glucose and insulin: relationship with risk factors for cardiovascular disease in overweight nondiabetic children [^63c63c51]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The prevalence of childhood overweight is increasing relentlessly. An increase in the rates of pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes seems to follow the upward trend of obesity. Longitudinal studies in adults demonstrate that cardiovascular disease (CVD) changes are established before a diagnosis of diabetes is made and correlate better with 2-h glucose levels. Guidelines on diabetes and CVD from the European Society of Cardiology and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes have summarized that 2-h glucose provides better information about risk for CVD than fasting glucose and predicts increased cardiovascular risk in subjects with normal fasting glucose levels.

Meta-analyses of prospective data from 11 populations have shown that hyperinsulinemia, defined by the highest quartile cutoff for fasting insulin, was associated with cardiovascular mortality independently of other risk factors. A review of 19 Western prospective studies showed that the odds ratio (OR) for coronary heart disease for raised fasting insulin as well as nonfasting insulin were more modest than previously suspected (OR 1.12 [95% CI 0.98–1.28] and 1.35 [1.14–1.60], respectively).

No studies have evaluated whether a fasting or 2-h glucose and/or insulin value reflects better the presence of CVD risk factors in overweight children with normal glucose tolerance. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the relationship between glucose and insulin quartiles and CVD risk factors in an overweight pediatric population.

### The diagnosis of fasting hypoglycemia due to an islet-cell tumor obscured by a highly specific insulin assay [^af2df02f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

The work-up of fasting hypoglycemia may be difficult but is crucially important because a wrong diagnosis can lead to either unnecessary pancreatectomy or a missed pancreatic tumor. We describe a patient with severe fasting hypoglycemia [22–32 mg/dl (1.2–1.8 mmol/liter) after 6–10 h of fasting] in which the diagnosis of a secretory islet-cell tumor was obscured, rather than facilitated, by use of a new, highly specific serum insulin assay. Insulin measured by the specific assay suppressed normally during fasting hypoglycemia [undetectable at < 2.0–3.8 micro IU/ml (26.4 pmol/liter)], whereas insulin measured by older, less specific assays was diagnostically elevated [34, 73 micro IU/ml (236.1, 507.0 pmol/liter)]. Serum proinsulin and C-peptide levels were abnormal, and further work-up revealed an islet-cell tumor that secreted predominantly proinsulin. The tumor was surgically removed, relieving the fasting hypoglycemia. We conclude that insulin levels as measured by new, highly specific insulin assays may obscure the diagnosis of a functional, proinsulin-secreting islet-cell tumor. Because proinsulin cross-reacts with insulin in older insulin assays, C-peptide or proinsulin should be measured to rule out a proinsulin-secreting islet-cell tumor. Normative values for new insulin assays must be established during prolonged fasting.

### Does insulin secretion in patients with one abnormal glucose tolerance test value mimic gestational diabetes mellitus? [^b41936bb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate the insulin response to a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test and to compare the insulin levels in the gestational diabetes mellitus and single abnormal test value groups with a nondiabetic control group.

Study Design

One hundred ten Turkish women with uncomplicated pregnancy participated in this prospective controlled study between 24 to 28 weeks of gestation. A 100-g 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test was given, and glucose and insulin plasma levels were assayed. The subjects were classified according to established criteria. Early-phase insulin secretion was assessed by the insulinogenic index. Total insulin secretion was assessed by mean insulin level during the oral glucose tolerance test; insulin resistance was assessed by fasting insulin concentration and by the use of the homeostasis model. Data were analyzed by the Student t test and 1-way analysis of variance, with posthoc Bonferroni correction.

Results

The fasting insulin levels of patients with normal oral glucose tolerance test results were significantly lower than those of patients with gestational diabetes mellitus and a single value abnormality (P < .001 and P < .005, respectively). The insulinogenic index as a marker of early-phase insulin secretion was significantly lower in gestational diabetes mellitus, compared with that of patients with normal oral glucose tolerance test results (P < .05). The worsening of glycemic profile from normal oral glucose tolerance test results to gestational diabetes mellitus was associated with an increase in the homeostasis model; no significant difference was found between gestational diabetes mellitus and a single value abnormality group in terms of both the homeostasis model and the insulinogenic index. Values for total insulin secretion were highest in gestational diabetes mellitus, followed by the single value abnormality group, both significantly differing from the values of patients with normal oral glucose tolerance test results (P < .001 and P < .005, respectively).

Conclusion

In this prospective study of Turkish subjects, we found a striking similarity in terms of patient characteristics between the gestational diabetes mellitus group and the single value abnormality group. Additionally, when we used fasting insulin level and insulin resistance as 2 separate criteria of analysis, patients with single value abnormality were indistinguishable from patients with gestational diabetes mellitus; both groups were significantly different from the normal oral glucose tolerance test group. Our findings suggest that a single abnormal test value on an oral glucose tolerance test should be regarded as a pathologic finding and that the patient with a single abnormal test value may be treated similarly to the patient with gestational diabetes mellitus.

### A concerted decline in insulin secretion and action occurs across the spectrum of fasting and postchallenge glucose concentrations [^7068c4e2]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Aims/Hypothesis

Individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) are at increased risk of developing diabetes over the subsequent decade. However, there is uncertainty as to the mechanisms contributing to the development of diabetes. We sought to quantitate insulin secretion and action across the prediabetic range of fasting glucose.

Methods

We studied a cohort of 173 individuals with a fasting glucose concentration < 7.0 mM after an overnight fast using a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Insulin action (S(i)) was estimated using the oral glucose minimal model, and β-cell responsivity indices (φ) were estimated using the oral C-peptide minimal model. The disposition index (DI) for each individual was calculated. The relationship of DI, φ and S(i) with fasting and postchallenge glucose, as well as other covariates, was explored using a generalized linear regression model.

Results

In this cross-sectional study, S(i) and DI were inversely related to fasting glucose concentrations. On the other hand, φ was unrelated to fasting glucose concentrations. S(i), φ and DI were all inversely related to area above basal glucose concentrations after glucose challenge. Multiple parameters including body composition and gender contributed to the variability of S(i) and DI at a given fasting or postchallenge glucose concentration.

Conclusions/Interpretation

Defects in insulin secretion and action interact with body composition and gender to influence postchallenge glucose concentrations. There is considerable heterogeneity of insulin secretion and action for a given fasting glucose likely because of patient subsets with isolated IFG and normal glucose tolerance.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^f3389925]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

In contrast to the above considerations, measurement of plasma insulin and proinsulin concentrations is necessary to establish the pathogenesis of fasting hypoglycemia. The diagnosis of an islet cell tumor is based on the persistence of inappropriately increased plasma insulin concentrations in the face of a low glucose concentration. In addition, an increase in the ratio of fasting proinsulin to insulin in patients with hypoglycemia strongly suggests the presence of an islet cell tumor. The absence of these associated changes in glucose, insulin, and proinsulin concentrations in an individual with fasting hypoglycemia makes the diagnosis of an islet cell tumor most unlikely, and alternative explanations should be sought for the inability to maintain fasting euglycemia.

Measurement of the C-peptide response to intravenous glucagon can aid in instances in which it is difficult to differentiate between the diagnosis of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Even in this clinical situation, however, the response to drug therapy will provide useful information, and measurement of C-peptide may not be clinically necessary. Measurement of C-peptide is essential in the investigation of possible factitious hypoglycemia due to surreptitious insulin administration.

In the past, some advocated insulin assays in the evaluation and management of patients with the polycystic ovary syndrome. Women with this syndrome manifest insulin resistance by androgen excess, as well as by abnormalities of carbohydrate metabolism; both abnormalities may respond to treatment with metformin or thiazolidinediones. Although clinical trials have generally evaluated insulin resistance by using the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, ratios of fasting glucose to insulin, and other modalities, the optimal laboratory evaluation of these patients in routine clinical care has not been clearly defined. It is unclear whether assessing insulin resistance through insulin measurement has any advantage over assessment of physical signs of insulin resistance (BMI, presence of acanthosis nigricans), and routine measurements of insulin are not recommended by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

### Exploring the potential role of C-peptide in type 2 diabetes management [^253c7503]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

C‐peptide has been best validated in differentiating T1D or insulin‐requiring diabetes from non‐insulin requiring diabetes. Guidance on estimated cut‐off values are available in a review article by Jones et al. as well as guidelines for T1D, although both cautioned against over‐interpretation of values close to the suggested thresholds.(see Figure 1) A non‐fasting serum C‐peptide < 200 pmol/L (equivalent to fasting C‐peptide threshold < 80 pmol/L) indicates near‐absolute insulin deficiency. Levels between 200 and 600 pmol/L (fasting threshold 80–250 pmol/L) are likely to correlate with T1D or monogenic diabetes but may also occur in insulin‐treated T2D. The upper limit of this range is arbitrary, estimated from previous studies on different populations. Non‐fasting (stimulated and random) serum C‐peptide values ranging from 500–970 pmol/L distinguished between insulin‐requiring and non‐insulin‐requiring diabetes. In addition, it is recognised that there can be significant variability between laboratories in C‐peptide measurement; particularly at higher levels of C‐peptide. While the variations in C‐peptide results across most modern assays are generally modest, certain assays still produce substantially different results, with a maximum difference of 35% as shown in a recent comparison of five different assays. Hence, C‐peptide thresholds used at each centre may need to be adjusted depending on the assay used at the local laboratory. Efforts by various international organisations are currently underway to harmonise and standardise C‐peptide measurement. Despite the uncertainty around these thresholds, they have been successfully utilised in studies, for example, to clarify diabetes aetiology and in some cases, have allowed for successful insulin withdrawal.

### The significance of impaired fasting glucose versus impaired glucose tolerance: importance of insulin secretion and resistance [^6cb6c8ab]. Diabetes Care (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The American Diabetes Association recommended substituting 2hBS (glycemia at the second hour of an oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT]) for fasting blood glucose (FBS) in screening for glucose intolerance. It is debated whether these tests measure the same abnormality and relate to defective insulin secretion or resistance. This study examines the diagnostic effectiveness of FBS versus 2hBS and their relationship with insulin secretion and resistance.

Research Design and Methods

Based on history or physical findings suggesting glucose intolerance, we enrolled 398 unselected subjects admitted to a general Internal Medicine ward. After 5 days of a weight-maintaining diet, FBS, 2hBS, and insulin were measured during OGTT. The homeostatic model assessment was used to assess beta-cell function and insulin resistance.

Results

Excluding 19 patients with diabetes (5%), we identified 284 subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), 22 with isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG), 59 with isolated impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and 14 with associated IFG/IGT. The sensitivity of FBS in predicting 2hBS was 19%, specificity 93%. Positive and negative predictive values were 39% and 83%, respectively. Insulin resistance was absent in NGT and IFG and markedly elevated in IGT and IFG/IGT, whereas defective insulin release was significant only in isolated IFG.

Conclusions

In unselected patients, elevated FBS depends primarily on defective insulin secretion, and impaired 2hBS on insulin resistance. Because these tests measure different alterations, they are useful in combination.

### Fasting plasma glucose 6–12 weeks after starting insulin glargine predicts likelihood of treatment success: a pooled analysis [^b7d02304]. Diabetic Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate whether fasting plasma glucose values measured early during insulin therapy can identify patients with Type 2 diabetes who may not achieve adequate glycaemic control after 6 months and will require additional treatment.

Methods

Patient-level data from seven prospective, randomized, controlled studies using treat-to-target methods were pooled to evaluate the efficacy of insulin glargine. Fasting plasma glucose was measured at baseline, week 6 or 8 (6/8) and week 12. HbA(1c) was measured at week 24 to assess glycaemic control.

Results

One thousand and thirty-six patients (56% male, 81% white) were included in the analysis (mean age 56.3 years; duration of diabetes 8.4 years). Baseline mean fasting plasma glucose was 11.2 mmol/l and mean HbA(1c) was 73 mmol/mol (8.8%). After 24 weeks of treatment, mean HbA(1c) decreased to 53 mmol/mol (7.0%); 56% of patients reached a target HbA(1c) ≤ 53 mmol/mol (7.0%). Significant correlations with week 24 HbA(1c) were obtained for fasting plasma glucose measured at week 6/8 and week 12 (r = 0.32; P < 0.0001 for both). Patients with fasting plasma glucose > 10 mmol/l at week 6/8 or week 12 were significantly less likely to achieve the HbA(1c) target at the end of treatment than patients with fasting plasma glucose < 8.9 mmol/l (P < 0.0001 for both). If fasting plasma glucose was > 10 mmol/l at week 6/8 or week 12, patients had only a 27% chance of reaching the HbA(1c) goal.

Conclusions

Fasting plasma glucose remaining > 10 mmol/l after 6–12 weeks of glargine therapy indicates that reaching target HbA(1c) ≤ 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) is unlikely and calls for individualized attention to consider further therapeutic options.

### The clinical utility of C-peptide measurement in the care of patients with diabetes [^31079d4f]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

It has been proposed that C-peptide results are corrected for concurrent glucose measurement. While this appears to better correlate with β-cell mass and glucose intolerance after islet cell transplant, there are limited published data using this approach in clinical practice, making interpretation of this ratio difficult. A pragmatic approach is to measure concurrent glucose to exclude hypoglycaemia (which will suppress insulin and C-peptide) with a glucose > 8 mmol/l considered a stimulated value. The homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) B calculation using fasting insulin and C-peptide is not advised for use in clinical practice and is not valid in those on insulin therapy.

Non-fasting 'random' C-peptide is likely to be the most easily performed blood test of insulin secretion in the clinical setting. A large study of C-peptide in the classification of adult diabetes suggested non-fasting random C-peptide with a concurrent glucose over 8 mmol/l was superior to both fasting and glucagon-stimulated C-peptide measurement in correctly classifying clinically well-defined Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Random non-fasting C-peptide appears superior to fasting C-peptide in classifying diabetes based on autoantibody status. However, the utility of random C-peptide measurement has otherwise been little examined. Despite this, it is likely that in many clinical situations a random (and therefore presumably imprecise) measure of insulin secretion may suffice. The spread of C-peptide levels is wide and a high or very low level will exclude or confirm severe insulin deficiency; a fasted or stimulated test could then be conducted should the result be indeterminate.

### Serum α-hydroxybutyrate (α-HB) predicts elevated 1 h glucose levels and early-phase β-cell dysfunction during OGTT [^9fc58e38]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2014). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Prediabetes is one of the strongest clinical risk factors for diabetes and vascular disease. In prediabetes and the early stages of diabetes, fasting glucose and HbA1c are often highly correlated, reflecting basal hepatic glucose output in the fasting state. The 75 g OGTT provides important, additional, diagnostic information by challenging insulin–glucose homeostasis with conditions that simulate the usual postprandial state, in which there is induction of insulin secretion, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and other tissues, and suppression of hepatic glucose production. As such, the OGTT can uncover defective glucose regulation that is not observed in the fasting state. Consistent with this, up to 40% of individuals with abnormal 2 h OGTT glucose values have normal fasting glucose levels. Hence, fasting blood glucose and HbA1c values are not adequate substitutes for the OGTT. Nevertheless, the OGTT is not routinely administered in most clinical practice settings, in part due to the time and technical effort it requires.

Recent studies are revealing that there is more to be learned from an OGTT than 2 h glucose values, which primarily reflect the rate of glucose clearance as a function of peripheral insulin resistance. Pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, the more proximal cause of diabetes, is directly reflected in impaired early-phase insulin response, and thus steeper early rises in glucose values during the first hour of the OGTT. Consistent with this, it has been demonstrated in two large prospective studies that the 1 h postload plasma glucose value obtained during the 75 g OGTT is a strong, independent predictor of risk for diabetes, even in individuals with normal (ie, not prediabetic or diabetic) fasting or 2 h glucose levels (normal glucose tolerance; NGT). In the San Antonio Heart Study and the Botnia Study, baseline 1 h glucose levels predicted diabetes incidence better than did either fasting or 2 h glucose, and were strongly associated with indices of β-cell function and insulin resistance.

### Different mechanisms for impaired fasting glucose and impaired postprandial glucose tolerance in humans [^05454fa9]. Diabetes Care (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the pathophysiology of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in a more comprehensive and standardized fashion than has hitherto been done.

Research Design and Methods

We studied 21 individuals with isolated IFG (IFG/normal glucose tolerance [NGT]), 61 individuals with isolated IGT (normal fasting glucose [NFG]/IGT), and 240 healthy control subjects (NFG/NGT) by hyperglycemic clamps to determine first- and second-phase insulin release and insulin sensitivity. Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) indexes of beta-cell function (HOMA-%B) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were calculated from fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations.

Results

Compared with NFG/NGT, IFG/NGT had similar fasting insulin concentrations despite hyperglycemia; therefore, HOMA-IR was increased approximately 30% (P < 0.05), but clamp-determined insulin sensitivity was normal (P > 0.8). HOMA-%B and first-phase insulin responses were reduced approximately 35% (P < 0.002) and approximately 30% (P < 0.02), respectively, but second-phase insulin responses were normal (P > 0.5). NFG/IGT had normal HOMA-IR but approximately 15% decreased clamp-determined insulin sensitivity (P < 0.03). Furthermore, HOMA-%B was normal but both first-phase (P < 0.0003) and second-phase (P < 0.0001) insulin responses were reduced approximately 30%. IFG/NGT differed from NFG/IGT by having approximately 40% lower HOMA-%B (P < 0.012) and approximately 50% greater second-phase insulin responses (P < 0.005).

Conclusions

Since first-phase insulin responses were similarly reduced in IFG/NGT and NFG/IGT, we conclude that IFG is due to impaired basal insulin secretion and preferential resistance of glucose production to suppression by insulin, as reflected by fasting hyperglycemia despite normal plasma insulin concentrations and increased HOMA-IR, whereas IGT mainly results from reduced second-phase insulin release and peripheral insulin resistance, as reflected by reduced clamp-determined insulin sensitivity.

### Correlation between measures of insulin resistance in fasting and non-fasting blood [^fcfdd86e]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Assessment of insulin resistance presents a challenge for epidemiological research. The standard method to measure insulin resistance/sensitivity is the euglcaemic clamp technique, which requires infusions of insulin and glucose over about 2 hours with measurements of blood glucose every few minutes. The test is unsuitable for large-scale population-based studies because it is invasive, expensive, and time-consuming. Hence a number of surrogate measures have been developed based on insulin, glucose and triglyceride levels in fasting blood. Many of these surrogates correlate strongly with direct measurements of insulin resistance and are generally regarded as valid measures.

Even fasting blood tests can be problematic for population-based studies, however, because many participants may be unwilling to fast overnight before attending the study: for example, less than half of the participants followed the instruction to fast in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Moreover, some participants may not admit to having eaten on the morning of the test increasing measurement variability due to the mix of fasting and non-fasting samples and introducing the potential for bias. Fasting also restricts scheduling of assessments because the blood tests are usually taken before breakfast and adds to the time and resources needed for the research because participants may need to be provided with food before undergoing further assessments.

Levels of adiponectin, and the ratio between leptin and adiponectin have also been proposed as surrogate markers of insulin resistance. It has been suggested that the leptin:adiponectin ratio may be a stable indicator in non-fasted people since the fluctuations in their levels are modest. Nevertheless, both are altered by prolonged fasting and studies reporting non-fasting measures of these adipokines have been criticised because of this.

It is unknown whether insulin resistance can be assessed using non-fasting blood. For most epidemiological purposes, the issue is not whether there are differences in the absolute values between fasting and non-fasting measures, but the extent to which non-fasting values reflect the underlying trait. We hypothesised that fasting and non-fasting metabolic indices would be highly correlated and, in preparation for an assessment of the 38 year-old participants of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health & Development Study, sought to compare these in healthy adults.

### Insulin function in obese children within the low and high ranges of impaired fasting glycemia [^a111ba7f]. Pediatric Diabetes (2019). Medium credibility.

Background/Objective

Impaired fasting glycemia (IFG) reflects an intermediate hyperglycemia in the fasting state. Which fasting glucose level that actually is associated with impaired insulin-glucose homeostasis in children and adolescents with obesity is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate how insulin and glucose homeostasis in children and adolescents with obesity in Sweden varies within different fasting glucose levels in the non-diabetic range.

Subjects

The subjects, n = 333, were divided into three groups based on their fasting glucose level. Normoglycemic range: up to 5.5 mmol/L (n = 268); the exclusive range the American Diabetes Association (ADA) has for IFG diagnosis: 5.6–6.0 mmol/L (n = 44); and IFG according to World Health Organization: 6.1–6.9 mmol/L (n = 21). The three groups were of similar age, degree of obesity, fasting insulin levels, sex, and migrant background distribution.

Methods

We used an insulin-modified frequent sample intravenous glucose tolerance test to study acute insulin response (AIR), insulin sensitivity (SI), and disposition index (DI) in children and adolescents with obesity. The main outcome measures were AIR, SI, and DI in three groups based on fasting glucose level.

Results

Fasting glucose levels ranging from 5.6 to 6.0 mmol/L were not associated with a lower AIR, SI, or DI compared with the normoglycemic range. However, glucose levels ranging from 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L were associated with lower AIR and lower DI, but no statistical differences in SI were present.

Conclusions

IFG in the exclusive ADA range was not associated with disturbed glucose metabolism. This suggests that IFG contributes to adverse metabolic profile in children differently to what has been described previously in adult obese populations.

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^c822be76]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Provocative fasting test protocol and hyperinsulinism indicators — In the absence of a "critical sample", a provocative fasting test is the most informative method for identifying the etiology of hypoglycemia disorders. For safety, a fasting test should be done with frequent monitoring of vital signs, PG, and BOHB concentrations. A PG concentration of 50 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) is sufficiently low to elicit diagnostic responses and, after appropriate specimens, the fast may be terminated; it can also be stopped for signs of distress or a plasma BOHB measurement of > 2.5 mmol/L. For suspected hyperinsulinism, the fasting test can be terminated when the PG concentration is < 50 mg/dL (< 2.8 mmol/L) with administration of glucagon (1 mg IV, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously), and an exaggerated glycemic response (> 30 mg/dL [> 1.7 mmol/L]) is nearly pathognomonic; because insulin may be below detection, include plasma BOHB and FFA (both inappropriately low; BOHB < 1.5 mmol/L [< 15 mg/dL], and FFA < 1.0–1.5 mmol/L [< 28–42 mg/dL]) and note an increased glycemic response to glucagon.

### Elevated fasting insulin predicts the future incidence of metabolic syndrome: a 5-year follow-up study [^9af48b86]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

We addressed the hypothesis that measuring the fasting insulin in healthy subjects would enable predicting the subsequent development of MS. This study has shown that in a general cohort of healthy Asian subjects, 8.5% developed MS over a 5 year period and that elevated fasting insulin levels predicted the development of subsequent MS even in the subgroup of patients without any MS component at baseline. This was particularly seen for the subjects in the highest quartile of the insulin levels when compared to those subjects with lower fasting insulin levels. Therefore, high baseline fasting insulin levels independently predicted the development of MS over time.

Numerous studies have been performed that showed that insulin resistance is associated with MS per se or the factors that comprise MS (e.g. NAFLD, T2DM, CVD). In the study by Mykkänen et al. insulin sensitivity assessed by frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test and the minimal model showed significant association with the number of metabolic disorders. In addition, fasting hyperinsulinemia has been used as a surrogate estimate of insulin resistance according to various combinations of fasting insulin and the glucose concentration such as HOMA (homeostatic model assessment), but not the fasting insulin level per se. Assuming that insulin resistance and the obesity being the central pathogenic factor in the development of MS, a recent study reported the role of leptin, an adipokine associated with obesity, on the prediction of MS and CVD risk. However, our study is the only study that has measured the baseline insulin concentration as a surrogate marker in order to evaluate the risk of developing MS among individuals with and without any MS component and as stratified by the fasting insulin concentration.

### Measuring and estimating insulin resistance in clinical and research settings [^800041cb]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

Cutoff values for surrogate fasting indexes

Among the best predictors of peripheral IR measured with the clamp (M values) are fasting glucose and plasma insulin concentrations, BMI, waist circumference, and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Fasting glucose and plasma insulin are used in many surrogate fasting indexes (Table 2). The most used is the HOMA‐IR index that was first proposed in 1985 and then updated in 1998. Stern et al. analyzed a large cohort (2,138 without and 193 with diabetes) studied with a 40 mU/min·m 2 EHC and defined presence of IR if any of the following conditions were met: (1) HOMA‐IR > 4.65, (2) BMI > 28.9 kg/m 2, or (3) HOMA‐IR > 3.60 and BMI > 27.5 kg/m 2. Tam et al. analyzed White participants (116 without and 51 with diabetes) studied with a 120 mU/min·m 2 EHC and defined presence of IR if HOMA‐IR > 5.9 or if HOMA‐IR > 2.8 when high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) < 51 mg/dL. Isokuortti et al. determined that HOMA‐IR > 2.0 identified participants with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This low cutoff for HOMA‐IR also defined IR in studies on general populations involving both Caucasian and Asian participants.

### Insulin resistance in obesity can be reliably identified from fasting plasma insulin [^32d93eb1]. International Journal of Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Insulin resistance is the major contributor to cardiometabolic complications of obesity. We aimed to (1) establish cutoff points for insulin resistance from euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps (EHCs), (2) identify insulin-resistant obese subjects and (3) predict insulin resistance from routinely measured variables.

Subjects/Methods

We assembled data from non-obese (n = 112) and obese (n = 100) men who underwent two-step EHCs using [6,6-(2)H2]glucose as tracer (insulin infusion dose 20 and 60 mUm(-2)min(-1), respectively). Reference ranges for hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity were calculated from healthy non-obese men. Based on these reference values, obese men with preserved insulin sensitivity or insulin resistance were identified.

Results

Cutoff points for insulin-mediated suppression of endogenous glucose production (EGP) and insulin-stimulated glucose disappearance rate (Rd) were 46.5% and 37.3μmolkg(-)(1)min(-)(1), respectively. Most obese men (78%) had EGP suppression within the reference range, whereas only 12% of obese men had Rd within the reference range. Obese men with Rd < 37.3μmolkg(-1)min(-1) did not differ from insulin-sensitive obese men in age, body mass index (BMI), body composition, fasting glucose or cholesterol, but did have higher fasting insulin (110 ± 49 vs 63 ± 29pmoll(-1), P < 0.001) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (4.5 ± 2.2 vs 2.7 ± 1.4, P = 0.004). Insulin-resistant obese men could be identified with good sensitivity (80%) and specificity (75%) from fasting insulin > 74pmoll(-1).

Conclusions

Most obese men have hepatic insulin sensitivity within the range of non-obese controls, but below-normal peripheral insulin sensitivity, that is, insulin resistance. Fasting insulin (> 74pmoll(-1) with current insulin immunoassay) may be used for identification of insulin-resistant (or metabolically unhealthy) obese men in research and clinical settings.

### Insulin resistance and systemic metabolic changes in oral glucose tolerance test in 5340 individuals: an interventional study [^17e57e08]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes affects approximately 1 in 11 adults worldwide, and people with diabetes are at a twofold excess risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). A decline in insulin sensitivity is an early sign of susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, typically manifested as elevated levels of fasting insulin. Insulin is a key regulator of glucose metabolism by promoting glucose uptake in peripheral tissues and inhibiting glucose production in the liver. Insufficient insulin action results in increased fasting glucose and eventually leads to overt type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance (IR) is also linked to the development of cardiometabolic complications, the risk arising already prior to the onset of type 2 diabetes. Studies in the fasting state have identified a cluster of biomarkers robustly associated with IR and predisposing to increased risk for CVD. In the modern society, however, people spend most of their waking hours at a postprandial state, yet we are not aware of epidemiological studies on non-fasting metabolism in representative cohorts.

### Metabolic tests to determine risk for type 1 diabetes in clinical trials [^91f3c791]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

Evaluate the reproducibility and relationship of various metabolic tests conducted as part of the Diabetes Prevention Trial-type 1 diabetes.

Methods

Coefficients of variation, intraclass correlation coefficients, and Pearson correlations between the same metabolic tests performed at different times as well as the different tests were determined.

Results

Fasting samples on the same day had a coefficient of variation of < 10 for C-peptide, 11 for insulin, and 2 for glucose. Testing on separate days approximately doubled the variance. Stimulated insulin values had less variance than fasting values and there was only a moderate correlation between fasting and stimulated values on each test. While highly correlated, C-peptide values from mixed meal tolerance tests are significantly lower than that obtained during oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs). Neither peak nor area under the curve C-peptide on the oral glucose tolerance test was different between those with abnormal and normal glucose tolerance. Those with abnormal as compared with normal glucose tolerance had lower 30-min C-peptide and a longer time to peak C-peptide.

Conclusions

A large, multi-centre trial, with tests performed over a decade-long period, can provide robust data. C-peptide data from oral glucose tolerance tests and mixed meal tolerance tests differ; therefore, the same stimulation test should be used to evaluate changes in beta cell function over time. Worsening glucose tolerance is associated with lower C-peptide at 30 min and a delay in peak secretion on the oral glucose tolerance test. This Diabetes Prevention Trial-type 1 diabetes data can be used in planning parameters for future studies, including evaluation of new algorithms to determine risk of disease.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycaemic control and insulin resistance: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a469086c]. Diabetic Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

To systematically review the evidence for the effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycaemia, insulin resistance, progression to diabetes and complications of diabetes.

Methods

Systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials comparing vitamin D or analogues with placebo. We extracted data on fasting glucose, glycaemic control, insulin resistance, insulin/C-peptide levels, micro- and macrovascular outcomes and progression from non-diabetes to diabetes. Studies were assessed independently by two reviewers according to a pre-specified protocol.

Results

Fifteen trials were included in the systematic review. Trial reporting was of moderate, variable quality. Combining all studies, no significant improvement was seen in fasting glucose, HbA(1c) or insulin resistance in those treated with vitamin D compared with placebo. For patients with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, meta-analysis showed a small effect on fasting glucose (-0.32 mmol/l, 95%CI -0.57 to -0.07) and a small improvement in insulin resistance (standard mean difference -0.25, 95%CI -0.48 to -0.03). No effect was seen on glycated haemoglobin in patients with diabetes and no differences were seen for any outcome in patients with normal fasting glucose. Insufficient data were available to draw conclusions regarding micro- or macrovascular events; two trials failed to show a reduction in new cases of diabetes in patients treated with vitamin D.

Conclusions

There is currently insufficient evidence of beneficial effect to recommend vitamin D supplementation as a means of improving glycaemia or insulin resistance in patients with diabetes, normal fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance.

### Use of fasting blood to assess the prevalence of insulin resistance in women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^39f24df7]. Fertility and Sterility (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the prevalence of insulin resistance (IR) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) using baseline fasting blood measurements of glucose and insulin.

Design

Prospective clinical study.

Setting

Academic endocrinology unit in Palermo, Italy.

Patient(S)

Two hundred and sixty-seven women with PCOS, consecutively evaluated, and 50 consecutively selected ovulating controls.

Intervention(S)

Fasting blood was obtained for glucose and insulin measurements from all women. For 60 women with PCOS and 20 controls an insulin tolerance test (ITT) was also performed.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Assessment of normal and abnormal values for fasting insulin, glucose/insulin ratio, and the calculated indices of the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), quantitative sensitivity check index (QUICKI), as well as Kitt (kinetic disappearance of glucose) values after ITT. Evaluation was performed of the ability to detect IR using these methods in obese and nonobese women with PCOS.

Result(S)

Normal insulin sensitivity was defined by insulin levels < 12 mU/mL, glucose/insulin ratios of > 6.4, HOMA values of < 47, and QUICKI values of > 0.333. In the entire PCOS groups, IR was diagnosed in 65.4% of women using glucose/insulin ratios and in 77% and 79.2% using HOMA and QUICKI. In obese women (body mass index > 28 in 48% of group), IR was present in 76.7% as measured by glucose/insulin ratios but was significantly higher (95.3%) using values of either HOMA or QUICKI (P < .01). All indices correlated with Kitt values with QUICKI showing the best correlation.

Conclusion(S)

Insulin resistance was detected in approximately 80% of women with PCOS, and in 95% of obese women. The detection of IR is superior using the calculated indices HOMA and QUICKI.

### Defining insulin resistance from hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps [^88924a16]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

The question of what is a normal and clinically relevant M value derived from clamps using other insulin infusion doses, such as 120 mU/m 2 ⋅ min, is unknown. As such, it is difficult for clinicians to explain the importance of the results from these clamps to research participants. The 120 mU/m 2 ⋅ min insulin was chosen for this analysis for two major reasons: 1) endogenous glucose production is likely to be fully suppressed, and 2) a shorter time is needed to reach steady-state conditions with a higher infusion rate, thus making this insulin dose more cost-effective while also reducing participant burden. Moreover, although the clamp technique is the gold standard for directly assessing insulin resistance in humans, it is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and overall expensive. Therefore, the ability to predict results of the clamp from other clinical data, which are both easier to obtain and less expensive to measure, is important.

In the current study, we assembled data from clamp studies performed under standard operating procedures at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center (PBRC; Baton Rouge, LA), between 2001 and 2011, with an insulin infusion rate of 120 mU/m 2 ⋅ min. Our aims were to 1) determine a cutoff point for identifying insulin resistance for hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies performed at 120 mU/m 2 ⋅ min in a white population and 2) generate equations from commonly measured clinic and blood variables for predicting insulin sensitivity (M values derived from the clamp).

### Impaired glucose tolerance is a more advanced stage of alteration in the glucose metabolism than impaired fasting glucose [^1816e591]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Recent reports have shown a lack of agreement between the impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and the impaired fasting glucose (IFG) categories, suggesting that correspond to different impaired glucose metabolism stages.

Objective

To determine the differences of serum insulin levels between subjects with IFG and IGT diagnoses.

Methods

Cross-sectional study of 52 subjects with IFG and 48 with IGT diagnosis, and a euglycemic group of 140 subjects. Serum glucose and insulin were measured in both fasting and 2-h 75-g oral post-load glucose (2-h PG).

Results

Subjects with IFG showed the highest fasting and 2-h PG serum insulin levels, whereas subject with IGT the lowest. Serum insulin values showed no significative changes between the fasting and 2-h PG conditions in the subjects with IGT, whereas the subjects with IFG showed significative hyperinsulinemia. The serum glucose 2-h PG showed an increase of 0.2 mmol/l (CI(95%) 0.07–0.33), 0.5 mmol/l (CI(95%) 0.41–0.58) and 3.6 mmol/l (CI(95%) 3.39–3.81) with respect to basal values, whereas the increase of serum insulin 2-h PG was of 54 pmol/l (CI(95%) 53.71–55.29), 918 pmol/l (CI(95%) 917.49–918.51) and 0.5 pmol/l (CI(95%) 0.15–0.84) for the euglycemic, IFG and IGT subjects, respectively.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that subjects with IFG show hyperinsulinemia whereas those with IGT have low insulin secretion in response to oral load glucose, suggesting that IFG and IGT correspond to different stages of impaired glucose metabolism.

### Approach to the patient: insulinoma [^e3ea050f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and Presentation

The Whipple triad, named after the American surgeon Allen O. Whipple (1881–1963), is the diagnostic hallmark establishing the existence of a hypoglycemic disorder and has the following 3 features: (1) symptoms, signs, or both consistent with hypoglycemia; (2) low plasma glucose measured at the time of the symptoms and signs; and (3) relief of symptoms and signs when the glucose is raised to a normal level. In addition to the familiar hypoglycemic symptoms such as sweating, palpitations, nervousness, and feeling of hunger, neuroglycopenic symptoms such as confusion, visual disturbances, or seizures may also occur. The latter may cause patients to be misdiagnosed with a psychiatric or neurological disorder. Symptoms occur mainly in the fasting state, but up to 20% of patients also described postprandial symptoms. By definition, in endogenous hyperinsulinism, the insulin secretion does not decrease to very low levels when plasma glucose concentrations decrease to hypoglycemic levels. Thus, in patients with insulinoma, plasma insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin concentrations are inappropriately high in the setting of low fasting plasma glucose concentrations. According to the most recent clinical practice guidelines, critical diagnostic findings are present when the confirmed fasting plasma glucose concentrations are preferably below 45 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) or below 55 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) (= hypoglycemia — depending on guidelines and cutoffs — the optimal cutoff level for blood glucose is currently still a matter of debate), plasma insulin concentrations of at least 3 μU/mL (18 pmol/L), plasma C-peptide concentrations of at least 0.6 ng/L (0.2 nmol/L), and plasma proinsulin concentrations of at least 5.0 pmol/L. The patients presented here fulfilled all these criteria. If hypoglycemia does not occur spontaneously, a 72-hour prolonged fasting test should be performed and blood should be drawn for measurements of insulin, and pro-insulin, or C-peptide measurements if hypoglycemia occurs. Some authors have advocated shorter fasting tests. There are data suggesting that a standardized evaluation of neurocognitive function during the fasting test (using the Mini-Mental test) can be helpful and more important than a glucose concentration threshold. Indeed, a median decrease in Mini-Mental score of ≥ 6 points has been shown to be superior for stopping the fasting test than a predefined glucose concentration. For the differential diagnosis of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia not caused by insulinoma in individuals who have not undergone upper gastrointestinal surgery, such as persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in infancy and noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome (nesidioblastosis), administration of exogenous insulin or sulfonylureas, insulinomatosis, and insulin (receptor) autoimmune syndrome (Hirata disease), the reader is referred to other publications.

The actual cut points used may not, Alberti noted, be correct. The upper limit is the diabetes criterion, while the lower is an arbitrary figure. Those with IGT at levels exceeding 170 mg/dl fasting glucose probably have considerably greater risk than those with 2-h glucose levels closer to 140 mg/dl. The IFG criteria based on equalizing the numbers of individuals with IFG and IGT do not appear to be an evidence-based recommendation, and it is more accurate to understand that there is a continuum of risk within the glucose levels currently considered to represent pre-diabetes. First-phase insulin secretion becomes abnormal beginning at a fasting glucose of 95 mg/dl, Alberti stated, and he suggested that there is no real glucose cut point for CVD risk and that it is not clear why the risk of elevated 2-h glucose exceeds that of elevated fasting glucose.

One might, Alberti suggested, simply change the terminology and state that individuals with IFG or IGT in fact have diabetes, as has been suggested by the finding of retinopathy within populations of individuals with pre-diabetes. However, it would be rather complicated to abruptly double the number of individuals with diagnosed diabetes. What, he asked, is the pathophysiological basis for pre-diabetes? Islet abnormalities, insulin resistance, and genetic polymorphisms have been found, and the apparent distinction that IGT represents decreased glucose disposal while IFG is a state of glucose overproduction may be of importance. How, he asked, should we endeavor to detect individuals with pre-diabetes? This becomes an issue particularly if the GTT is not routinely performed, he stated, suggesting that it may be useful to develop screening approaches to determine appropriate candidates for the GTT, perhaps screening individuals based on obesity, family history or ethnic group, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or CVD. A possible stepwise approach is to start with a questionnaire such as that described by Tuomilehto (as summarized in ref.), perhaps supplemented by waist circumference measurement, followed first by fasting glucose measurement and then the GTT. Although A1C might be measured rather than performing a GTT, Alberti preferred the latter, suggesting that development of a home kit with oral glucose and test strips might be useful in population screening. An interesting study would compare the natural history of pre-diabetic individuals found by screening, pre-diabetic individuals found by history, and individuals having diabetes at initial presentation.

Abstract

The article discusses how to measure insulin resistance in muscle, liver, and adipose tissue in human participants. The most frequently used methodologies to evaluate insulin resistance are described in detail starting from the gold standard, that is, the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, to the intravenous glucose tolerance test, surrogate indices based on fasting measurements, or dynamic tests (such as oral glucose or mixed meal tolerance tests). The accuracy, precision, and reproducibility of the tests as well as cutoff values are reported.

### Older adults: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^98433ab1]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Simplification of complex insulin therapy — older adults on basal, prandial, or premixed insulin is guided by fasting and premeal finger-stick targets with structured dose changes and addition of noninsulin agents. For basal insulin, change timing from bedtime to morning; titrate dose of basal insulin based on fasting finger-stick glucose test results over 1 week with fasting goal 90–150 mg/dL (5.0–8.3 mmol/L), and goals may be changed based on overall health and goals of care; if 50% of the fasting finger-stick glucose values are over the goal increase dose by 2 units, and if ≥ 2 fasting finger-stick values/week are < 80 mg/dL (< 4.4 mmol/L) decrease dose by 2 units. For prandial insulin, if prandial insulin > 10 units/dose decrease dose by 50% and add noninsulin agent(s), and titrate prandial insulin doses down as noninsulin agent doses are increased with aim to discontinue prandial insulin; if prandial insulin ≤ 10 units/dose discontinue prandial insulin and add noninsulin agent(s). For individuals on premixed insulin, use 70% of total dose as basal only in the morning. When adding noninsulin agents, if eGFR is ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 start metformin 500 mg daily and increase dose every 2 weeks, as tolerated; if eGFR is < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, the individual is already taking metformin, or metformin is not tolerated, proceed to second-line agent. Every 2 weeks, adjust insulin doses and/or add glucose-lowering medications based on finger-stick glucose testing performed before lunch and before dinner, with goal 90–150 mg/dL (5.0–8.3 mmol/L) before meals; if 50% of premeal finger-stick values are over the goal increase the dose of short- or rapid-acting insulin, and if ≥ 2 premeal finger-stick values/week are < 90 mg/dL (< 5.0 mmol/L) decrease the dose of the medication.

### Insulinomas may present with normoglycemia after prolonged fasting but glucose-stimulated hypoglycemia [^87a37901]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Insulinomas are rare but are the most common cause of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in the adult population. Diagnosis of this pathology relies on clinical features along with laboratory tests and imaging investigations to aid in localization. One of the most robust standard tests used for establishing a biochemical diagnosis is the prolonged (72 h) fast. Currently, it is recommended that a prolonged supervised fast be performed, at least for 48 h if not for 72 h, and many would take the absence of hypoglycemia after a 72-h fast as evidence excluding the diagnosis.

Methods

We employed prolonged fasts and standard glucose tolerance tests, plus imaging studies and surgical pathology, in two patients with suspected insulinomas.

Results

The prolonged 72-h fast was normal in both the patients, whereas in both cases a prolonged oral glucose tolerance test clearly demonstrated the induction of severe hyperinsulinemia followed by significant hypoglycemia. Surgical removal confirmed the presence of insulinomas in each case.

Conclusions

Although the sensitivity of the 72-h fast is high and still plays an important role in the diagnosis of an insulinoma, we suggest that a "normal" test result should be interpreted in the light of clinical symptoms.

Hypoglycemia background — glucose ranges and definition: Blood glucose levels are tightly regulated by several hormones, mainly insulin and glucagon. Normal blood glucose range is 70 to 120 mg/dL (3.9–6.6 mmol/L). Hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 70 or < 2.8 mmol/L) can result from starvation, underlying metabolic disorders, deficiencies of hormones, and medications.

### Gender-based differences in glycaemic control and hypoglycaemia prevalence in patients with type 2 diabetes: results from patient-level pooled data of six randomized controlled trials [^9297198b]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

In populations without diabetes, women also have lower HbA1c values in relation to fasting glucose values; however, when fasting glucose values exceed normal values, the HbA1c/gender differences become smaller or disappear 24. Moreover, gender differences were shown in regard to HbA1c distribution within prediabetic states. It was suggested that differences in height, but not physiology of glucose regulation, could be responsible for differences in 2‐h PPG levels, whereas gender differences in fasting glucose may be attributable to physiological differences involving both insulin sensitivity and β‐cell function 22. Gender differences in HbA1c could not be explained by differences in body composition. HbA1c may be influenced by many factors, including genetic factors, age, ethnicity and environment 25, and gender may also affect HbA1c variability. Overall there may be considerable differences between the correlation of individual average glucose and HbA1c levels.

In the present study at baseline, normal‐weight to slightly overweight (BMI < 28 kg/m 2) women had higher FBG and HbA1c values compared with men, although there were no gender differences in glycaemic control in the overall groups. After insulin initiation, FBG levels dropped more markedly and were lower at the end of the investigation in women; however, they also had significantly higher rates of hypoglycaemia, although men were found to have better reduction in HbA1c level.

Typically, FBG is determined by endogenous glucose production and therefore mostly depends on the liver 26. The product of hepatic glucose production and fasting insulin is a surrogate of hepatic insulin resistance. It can be speculated that the normal‐weight women having higher FBG and HbA1c values were not as well controlled, showing a higher degree of insulin resistance; that is, increased hepatic glucose production combined with inadequate insulin secretion. Both the insulin dose/kg and the reduction in FBG levels, however, were greater in this female subgroup, suggesting at least similar insulin sensitivity (although HbA1c reduction was lower in women irrespective of BMI group). The higher rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemia may further indicate that fewer efforts to reduce fasting glycaemia (e.g. increasing bedtime basal insulin and more focus on measurements and control of postprandial values) could have contributed to overall better metabolism with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia in lean women.

### How to screen obese children at risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus? [^8cf02f6a]. Clinical Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Recommended screening to identify children at risk for diabetes and its precursors impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and insulin resistance (IR) is fasted plasma glucose (FPG). This study evaluates the added value of fasted plasma insulin (FPI).

Methods

This study analyzed routinely collected data of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) of 311 obese children (age 10.8 ± 3.2 years). Diabetes and IGT were defined according to the American Diabetes Association criteria, IR as homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-IR ≥ 3.4.

Results

Cases diagnosed with an OGTT if FPG ≥ 5.6 mmol/L, compared with an OGTT performed if FPG ≥ 5.6 mmol/L or HOMA-IR ≥ 3.4, were, respectively, 4 (80%) versus 5 (100%) with diabetes, 7 (28%) versus 16 (64%) with IGT, and 0 (0%) versus 93 (100%) with IR.

Conclusions

Screening with FPG and FPI has equal burden compared with screening with FPG alone, identifies all patients with diabetes, and identifies more patients with precursors of diabetes.

### Clinical staging to guide management of metabolic disorders and their sequelae: a European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement [^64077493]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Insulin resistance, pre-diabetes, and Type 2 diabetes

The gold standard for evaluating insulin resistance, namely the hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp technique, is impractical for regular large-scale clinical practice. Hence, surrogate markers for insulin resistance have been proposed, the best known of which is the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), calculated using the formula: [fasting plasma insulin (mU/L) × plasma fasting glucose (mmol/L)]/22.5. A value of 2.5 or higher is considered to indicate insulin resistance. Additional surrogate markers include the triglyceride-glucose indexand triglyceride to HDL-cholesterol ratio, both of which are associated with risk of cardiovascular disease independent of LDL-cholesterol.

Pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes can be diagnosed by measuring (i) glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), (ii) fasting plasma glucose, or (iii) plasma glucose 2 h after an OGTT (Figures 4 and 5). The OGTT consists of a fasting glucose blood test followed by the consumption of a 75 g glucose drink and a diagnostic glucose blood test at 120 min. This test provides information about the pancreatic reserve to compensate for insulin resistance.

In the context of obesity, pre-diabetes is an easily measurable clinical manifestation of insulin resistance. However, it is important to note that insulin resistance can exist in the absence of dysglycaemia, and therefore, some individuals at an early stage of SMD will not be identified when using pre-diabetes as a proxy for insulin resistance. Therefore, we recommend using HOMA-IR in addition to HbA1c to determine whether an individual is at an early stage of SMD.

### Comprehensive validation of fasting-based and oral glucose tolerance test-based indices of insulin secretion against gold standard measures [^2621a5a8]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Reduced sensitivity to the action of insulin and deficient insulin secretion are two physiological defects underlying type 2 diabetes (T2D) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).

Insulin secretion and sensitivity are associated across a negative feedback loop, in which beta-cells reimburse for changes in whole-body insulin sensitivity through a proportional and reciprocal increase in insulin secretion.

Insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion can be accurately determined by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamps or intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTTs) that are considered "gold standards" for these measurements. Precise assessment of these two traits is crucial to identify subphenotypes of pre-diabetes and T2D, which is gaining increasing importance by acknowledgment of the pathophysiological heterogeneity of this condition. Furthermore, these measures can support the prediction of diabetes in non-diabetic subjects. However, the invasive, expensive, and time-consuming gold standard procedures are not applicable in routine clinical practice.

Several indices have been proposed to estimate insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion, based on more readily measurable parameters obtained in the fasting state or after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Their usefulness is influenced by the degree of correlation with gold standard indicators, by their reproducibilityand by their ability to predict diabetes incidence similarly to more complex methods.

Many surrogate methods for insulin sensitivity assessment have been proposed and validated, but comprehensive studies to compare insulin secretion measures to gold standard methods are scarce. While several indices for beta-cell assessment based on dynamic changes in insulin and glucose during OGTT have been separately evaluated in numerous studies, most of these indices have not been compared head-to-head and there is still disagreement about their validity. Therefore, our work is aimed at performing a large, comprehensive comparative analysis of all types of indicators obtained in the fasting state or during OGTT to determine the secretion of insulin in comparison with the gold standards IVGTT and hyperglycemia clamp in two well-phenotyped cohorts. Moreover, the novel hyperglycemic clamp was used in one of our included trialsallows for defining surrogate indices for glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1)–stimulated insulin secretion.

### Repeatability characteristics of simple indices of insulin resistance: implications for research applications [^94d08f7d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate test characteristics, such as normality of distribution, variation, and repeatability, of simple fasting measures of insulin sensitivity and to use the results to choose among these measures. Duplicate fasting samples of insulin and glucose were collected before 4 h of euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamping using insulin infusion rates ranging from 40–600 mU/m2 x min. Currently recommended estimates of insulin sensitivity, including the fasting insulin, 40/insulin, the homeostasis model assessment, the logarithmic transformation of the homeostasis model assessment, and the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index, were evaluated. The normality of distribution and the variability of the tests (coefficient of variation and discriminant ratio) were compared between the measures and against the "gold standard" hyperinsulinemic clamp. Data from 253 clamp studies in 152 subjects were examined, including 79 repeated studies for repeatability analysis. In subjects ranging from lean to diabetic, the log transformed fasting measures combining insulin and glucose had normal distributions and test characteristics superior to the other simple indices (logarithmic transformation of the homeostasis model assessment coefficient of variation, 0.55; discriminant ratio, 13; Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index coefficient of variation, 0.05; discriminant ratio, 10) and statistically comparable to euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps (coefficient of variation, 0.10; discriminant ratio, 6.4). These favorable characteristics helped explain the superior correlations of these measures with the hyperinsulinemic clamps among insulin-resistant subjects. Furthermore, therapeutic changes in insulin sensitivity were as readily demonstrated with these simple measures as with the hyperinsulinemic clamp. The test characteristics of the logarithmic transformation of the homeostasis model assessment and the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index are superior to other simple indices of insulin sensitivity. This helps explain their excellent correlations with formal measures both at baseline and with changes in insulin sensitivity and supports their broader application in clinical research.

### Screening and diagnosis of prediabetes: where are we headed? [^51f0bc44]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

It is currently estimated that more than 300 million people have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), putting them at increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its adverse consequences. In addition, many others are at risk on the basis of a family history of T2DM, obesity, dyslipidaemia and hypertension. Screening for risk should include both blood glucose testing in high-risk populations and prescreening (e.g. by questionnaire, waist circumference measurement) to identify high-risk individuals in overall low-risk populations; these individuals should then undergo glucose testing. Fasting plasma glucose measurement cannot diagnose IGT; the preferred definite test for diagnosis is oral glucose tolerance testing.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2009 [^b800a811]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

B. Diagnosis of diabetes

Current criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant adults are shown in Table 2. Three ways to diagnose diabetes are recommended at the time of this statement, and each must be confirmed on a subsequent day unless unequivocal symptoms of hyperglycemia are present. Although the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is more sensitive and modestly more specific than the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) to diagnose diabetes, it is poorly reproducible and difficult to perform in practice. Because of ease of use, acceptability to patients, and lower cost, the FPG has been the preferred diagnostic test. Though FPG is less sensitive than the OGTT, the vast majority of people who do not meet diagnostic criteria for diabetes by FPG but would by OGTT will have an A1C value well under 7.0%.

Though the OGTT is not recommended for routine clinical use, it may be useful for further evaluation of patients in whom diabetes is still strongly suspected but who have normal FPG or IFG (see Section I.C).

The use of the A1C for the diagnosis of diabetes has previously not been recommended due to lack of global standardization and uncertainty about diagnostic thresholds. However, with a world-wide move toward a standardized assay and with increasing observational evidence about the prognostic significance of A1C, an Expert Committee on the Diagnosis of Diabetes was convened in 2008. This joint committee of ADA, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, and the International Diabetes Federation will likely recommend that the A1C become the preferred diagnostic test for diabetes. Diagnostic cut-points are being discussed at the time of publication of this statement. Updated recommendations will be published in Diabetes Care and will be available at diabetes.org.

C. Diagnosis of pre-diabetes

Hyperglycemia not sufficient to meet the diagnostic criteria for diabetes is categorized as either impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), depending on whether it is identified through the FPG or the OGTT:
IFG = FPG 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) to 125 mg/dl (6.9 mmol/l)
IGT = 2-h plasma glucose 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) to 199 mg/dl (11.0 mmol/l)

IFG and IGT have been officially termed "pre-diabetes". Both categories of pre-diabetes are risk factors for future diabetes and for cardiovascular disease (CVD).

### Preanalytical, analytical, and computational factors affect homeostasis model assessment estimates [^db9c822a]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Fasting plasma glucose was 5.2 ± 0.5 mmol/l, and median serum insulin (measured by 11 insulin assays) was 59 (IQR 38–78) pmol/l in normoglycemic subjects, 6.2 ± 0.4 mmol/l and 117 (54–142) pmol/l for subjects with pre-diabetes, and 8.4 ± 2.2 mmol/l and 86 (46–142) pmol/l for type 2 diabetic subjects. A P value of 0.07 was obtained from a Kruskal-Wallis test for insulin across the groups. HOMA-β was highest in those with pre-diabetes at 109% (71–149), lower in those with normoglycemia at 85% (64–128), and lowest in those with type 2 diabetes at 63% (38–88) (P = 0.0002). HOMA-IR was 1.30 (0.84–1.65) in normoglycemic subjects, highest in subjects with pre-diabetes at 2.58 (1.24–3.12), and slightly lower in diabetic subjects at 2.13 (1.19–3.54) (P = 0.022). Values for HOMA-S were 82% (67–137) for normoglycemic subjects, 40% (33–84) in those with pre-diabetes, and 50% (29–93) in those with diabetes (P = 0.025).

Percentage of patients with data outside input limits for HOMA calculators

All glucose values obtained were appropriate for the HOMA calculator version 2.2. However, 4.3% of insulin results (55 in total) were < 20 pmol/l, and 1% (12 in total) were > 300 pmol/l and, therefore, were not accepted. The actual numbers of insulin values outside limits for each assay can be seen in supplemental Table 2 (available in the online appendix). HOMA estimates are presented in Fig. 1; both inclusion of participants with insulin values set to HOMA limits if outside these limits and exclusion if outside limits are shown.

Choice of HOMA calculator

For illustrative purposes only, the RIA calculator rather than SI calculator was used with assays specific for insulin; estimates of HOMA-β differed by 11% (P < 0.0001) and of HOMA-IR by 15% (P < 0.0001).

### Modified quantitative insulin sensitivity check index is better correlated to hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp than other fasting-based index of insulin sensitivity in different insulin-resistant States [^ffb72b4f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Fasting-based index estimates of insulin sensitivity were compared with euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (IS clamp) measurements in 148 subjects: normal controls (n = 46), and obese (n = 12), polycystic ovary syndrome (n = 16), first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic (n = 17), impaired glucose tolerance (n = 28), and type 2 diabetic (n = 29) patients. The fasting-based indexes tested included log homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), the revised QUICKI, and a new revised QUICKI using fasting plasma glycerol. In the population studied, at 40 mU/m(2).min (n = 30) revised QUICKI (r = 0.86; P < 0.0001) and QUICKI-glycerol (r = 0.87; P < 0.0001) gave higher correlations with the IS clamp than QUICKI and log HOMA (r = 0.78 and r = -0.78; P < 0.001). For subjects tested at 75 mU/m(2).min (n = 118), comparable correlations were found for all indexes (r > 0.80; P < 0.0001). When studied in subgroups, revised QUICKI and QUICKI-glycerol give significantly higher correlations with the IS clamp than other indexes for lean control subjects studied at 40mU/m(2).min and impaired glucose tolerance subjects. We confirmed, in a large patient population with a wide range of insulin sensitivities, that no single test is superior in all groups of patients. However, QUICKI and revised QUICKI are good indexes that offer correlations similar to or higher than values obtained with log HOMA. Such indexes are simple tools to estimate insulin sensitivity appropriate for epidemiological studies.

### Insulin resistance in euglycemic cirrhosis [^48ad968d]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

IR measurement

IR was assessed by the Homeostasis Model Assessment method for the evaluation of IR (HOMA-IR). HOMA was first developed in 1985 by Matthews et al. It is a method used to quantify IR and β-cell function from basal (fasting) glucose and insulin concentrations. HOMA is a model of the relationship of glucose and insulin dynamics that predicts fasting steady-state glucose and insulin concentrations for a wide range of possible combinations of IR and β-cell function. HOMA-IR = (glucose × insulin)/22.5; insulin concentration is reported in μU/L and glucose in mmol/L. The constant of 22.5 is a normalizing factor; i.e., the product of normal fasting plasma insulin of 5 μU/mL, and the normal fasting plasma glucose of 4.5 mmol/L typical of a "normal" healthy individual = 22.5. Value of HOMA-IR more than 1.64 implied the presence of abnormally high IR. Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), as an alternative surrogate marker of IR, computed as 1/ [log insulin (μU/mL) + log fasting blood sugar (FBS) (mg/dL)]. Value < 0.35 is suggestive for IR. QUICKI is an empirically-derived mathematical transformation of FBS and plasma insulin concentrations that provides a consistent and precise index of insulin sensitivity with better positive predictive power. HOMA-β a parameter reflecting the insulin secretion ability of pancreatic β-cells, was calculated as [360 × insulin (μU/mL)]/FBS (mg/dL) -63]. Estimation with the help of HOMA-β model parallels equally with that of the euglycemic clamp method (r = 0.88).

Statistical analysis

HOMA calculator 2.2 was used to calculate the HOMA IR and HOMA-β values while QUICKI values were calculated with a scientific calculator. Parametric data are expressed as mean values ± standard deviation (SD) and categorical variables as percentages. Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test were used for the comparison of dichotomous variables and Student's t test for continuous variables. Whenever more than 2 continuous variables were present, ANOVA one-way analysis was used for calculating the P values. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Spearman and Pearson's coefficient correlation were used to compare the regression coefficient between the two groups. All data were analyzed using the SAS 8.0 statistical package.

### Are insulin resistance, impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance all equally strongly related to age? [^76ea4e83]. Diabetic Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Insulin resistance (IR) has been considered an underlying cause of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG). Whether IR increases with age has been debated. We investigated the age-associated deterioration in the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) of IR and in glucose metabolism.

Methods

Ten (nine including women) European studies contributed data on 6314 men and 6393 women aged 30–88 years. The cohort- and sex-specific top 25% of HOMA of IR in non-diabetic subjects was used to define HOMA-IR.

Results

Compared with subjects aged 50–59 years, the cohort- and body mass index-adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for HOMA-IR was 0.83 (0.64, 1.08), 0.87 (0.74, 1.03), 1.20 (1.02, 1.42) and 1.45 (1.10, 1.92) in men and 0.84 (0.62, 1.14), 0.91 (0.77, 1.09), 1.38 (1.19, 1.62) and 1.71 (1.35, 2.17) in women, respectively, aged 30–39, 40–49, 60–69 and ≥ 70 years (P < 0.0001 for trend test). The same increasing trend was also observed for IFG. In contrast, the corresponding odds ratios for IGT increased linearly and more strongly with age, being 0.37 (0.22, 0.63), 0.67 (0.52, 0.87), 1.55 (1.24, 1.92) and 2.96 (2.13, 4.13) in men and 0.51 (0.31, 0.85), 0.66 (0.52, 0.86), 1.92 (1.57, 2.35) and 3.85 (2.89, 5.12) in women, respectively.

Conclusions

Age is more strongly associated with IGT than with HOMA-IR or IFG in non-diabetic European populations.

### The impact of insulin administration during the mixed meal tolerance test [^5c37d954]. Diabetic Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

The mixed meal tolerance test is the gold standard measure of endogenous insulin secretion. Practical issues limit the routine clinical use of this test, including omitting insulin prior to the ingestion of a high-carbohydrate liquid mixed meal, which can result in marked hyperglycaemia. We aimed to assess whether insulin omission is necessary during the mixed meal tolerance test and whether fasting C-peptide was a practical alternative to the test.

Methods

Ninety-one adults with insulin-treated diabetes (Type 1 n = 56, Type 2 n = 35) underwent two mixed meal tolerance tests; one standard without insulin and one with the patient's usual morning insulin.

Results

The 90-min serum C-peptide was highly correlated in the standard mixed meal tolerance test and the test with insulin (r = 0.98, P < 0.0001). There was a 20% reduction in the peak C-peptide value when insulin was given {test with insulin [0.39 (0.01–1.16) vs. test without insulin 0.48 (0.01–1.36) nmol/l, P = 0.001]}, but the original serum C-peptide cut-off for significant endogenous insulin secretion (≥ 0.2 nmol/l) still correctly classified 90/91 patients (98% sensitivity/100% specificity). Fasting serum C-peptide was highly correlated to 90-min serum C-peptide during the test (r = 0.97, P < 0.0001). A fasting serum C-peptide ≥ 0.07 nmol/l was the optimal cut-off (100% sensitivity and 97% specificity) for significant endogenous insulin secretion (defined as 90-min stimulated serum C-peptide ≥ 0.2 nmol/l).

Conclusions

Insulin omission may not always be necessary during a mixed meal tolerance test and fasting serum C-peptide may offer a practical alternative in insulin-treated patients.

Niacin is an antidyslipidemic agent that may cause blood sugar elevation in patients with diabetes, but its effects on glucose and insulin values in nondiabetic statin-treated subjects with cardiovascular disease and at high risk for diabetes are less well known.

Methods

This was a prespecified, intent-to-treat analysis of the Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic syndrome with low high-density lipoprotein/high triglycerides: Impact on Global Health outcomes trial which randomized 3,414 participants at 92 centers in the US and Canada to extended-release niacin (ERN) plus simvastatin/ezetimibe (ERN) or simvastatin/ezetimibe plus placebo (Placebo). Baseline and annual fasting glucose and insulin values were measured. Those experiencing an adverse event indicative of diabetes or starting medications for diabetes were considered to have confirmed diabetes. In addition, nondiabetic subjects with 2 annual follow-up glucose measurements were categorized into normal, impaired fasting glucose or newly diagnosed diabetes (presumed or confirmed) states.

Results

Compared with placebo, ERN increased annual fasting glucose from baseline to 1 year in both those with normal (7.9 ± 15.8 vs 4.3 ± 10.3 mg/dL; P < .001) and impaired fasting glucose (4.1 ± 18.7 vs 1.4 ± 14.9; P < .02) and increased insulin levels. Both effects waned over the next 2 years. There were less consistent effects in those with baseline diabetes. There was an increased risk of progressing from normal to presumed or confirmed impaired fasting glucose (ERN 197/336) cases (58.6%) vs placebo 135/325 cases (41.5%; P < .001) over time, but no difference in diabetes development in the 2 treatment groups except in those with normal fasting glucose at baseline.

Conclusions

The addition of ERN to simvastatin/ezetimibe had marginal effects on glycemia in those with diabetes at baseline, and there was a trend toward increased development of new-onset diabetes. In addition, ERN increased the risk of developing impaired fasting glucose, which may have deleterious consequences over time and warrants further study.

### NHANES 2009–2010: oral glucose tolerance test data documentation, codebook, and frequencies… [^fb301421]. wwwn.cdc.gov (2009). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus was assessed by measures of fasting plasma glucose, two-hour glucose and serum insulin in participants, aged 12 years and over, who were examined in the morning session only. Glycohemoglobin measures were collected in a full sample and are available in a separate dataset, GLU_F. Participants, aged 12 years and older, who were examined in the morning session and met a 9 hour fast, were eligible. This is a subsample of the NHANES and requires the use of special weights. Plasma specimens were processed, stored and shipped to Fairview Medical Center Laboratory at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis Minnesota for analysis. Beginning in 2005, an oral glucose tolerance test was added to the laboratory protocol. A fasting glucose blood test was performed on all participants, 12 years and older, who were examined in the morning session, after a 9 hour fast.

After the initial venipuncture, participants were asked to drink a calibrated dose of TrutolTM and had a second venipuncture 2 hours after drinking the Trutol. The fasting glucose value in mg/dL was converted to mmol/L by multiplying by 0.
05551. NHANES Survey Design: "Time from fasting glucose & OGTT" GTDDR2MN is used to define: "Time from glucose challenge & OGTT" GTXDRANK is used to define: "Amount of glucose challenge the SP drank" GTDCODE is used to define: "Incomplete OGTT Comment Code" Sampling Weights. The analyst is strongly encouraged to use the OGTT sampling weights in this file to analyze 2009–2010 two-hour OGTT glucose levels. There will be two weight variables associated with the subsample for the diabetes data. Use the fasting sample weights when analyzing the fasting glucose and insulin levels only.

Use the OGTT sample weights when analyzing the insulin, fasting AND OGTT glucose levels or when analyzing ONLY OGTT glucose levels. NOTE: the fasting glucose and insulin weights and data are in a separate file.

### Differential performance of surrogate indices of fasting insulin resistance in low-birthweight and normal-birth weight cohorts: observations from hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp studies in young, Asian Indian males [^23fa71fb]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the predictive accuracy of surrogate measures of fasting insulin resistance/sensitivity like the Homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA -IR), Fasting glucose/insulin ratio (FG-IR), Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), and the 20/fasting C peptide x fasting plasma glucose [20/(FCP × FPG)] index in comparison to M value derived from hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (HEC) studies in two birth weight based cohorts of Asian Indian males.

Methods

HEC studies were performed in non-diabetic Asian Indian males (n = 117), born of normal birth weight (n = 59, birth weight > 2.5 kgs) and low birth weight (n = 58, birth weight < 2.5 kgs). Anthropometry and biochemical analysis were done. Surrogate indices of fasting insulin resistance were calculated and data were analysed by Pearson's correlation and Random calibration model analysis.

Results

Amongst surrogate indices of fasting insulin resistance/sensitivity, the mean values for HOMA-IR, QUICKI, FG-IR, 20/(FCP × FPG) index and M value were similar between the two groups. Significant positive correlation was observed for FG-IR and QUICKI with M value (the gold standard measure of insulin sensitivity derived from HEC procedure) in the low birth weight cohort in contrast to the normal birth weight cohort, wherein no significant correlation was observed for any of the indices. Random calibration model analysis showed highest predictive accuracy for QUICKI in both the study groups.

Conclusion

The QUICKI index showed highest predictive accuracy in the normal birth weight and the low birth weight cohorts of Asian Indian males.

### Effects of vitamin D on insulin resistance and fasting blood glucose in pregnant women with insufficient or deficient vitamin D: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^2de34601]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 24. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to check the normality of the data. Fasting blood glucose levels before and after the intervention, depression score before the intervention and one-hour and two-hour glucose tolerance tests had normal distribution. Vitamin D and fasting blood insulin levels before and after the intervention, insulin resistance index before and after the intervention and depression score after the intervention had abnormal distribution. Mean (SD) were reported for normally distributed data and median (IQR) for abnormally distributed data. Chi-square, chi-square for trend, independent t-test and Fisher's exact test were used to evaluate the homogeneity of the study groups in terms of sociodemographic and obstetric characteristics. To compare the data with normal distribution between the two groups, we used independent t-test and ANCOVA with adjustment of baseline values. For abnormally distributed data, change score (post-intervention value-baseline value) was calculated and the normality of the change score was assessed using Kolmogorov-smirnov test. Only the change of fasting blood insulin had normal distribution. Then, independent t-test was used to compare the two groups in terms of the data with normal distribution, ​​and Mann-Whitney U test for data with abnormal distribution

### Identifying prediabetes using fasting insulin levels [^72bbdf7e]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether patients with prediabetes can be accurately and easily identified in clinical settings using a predictive clinical and laboratory model.

Methods

This retrospective study examined demographic and laboratory data from patients who had undergone 2-hour glucose testing for suspected prediabetes or diabetes between 2000 and 2004. Patients who met the diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus were excluded. Prediabetes was defined as a fasting glucose concentration ≥ 100 mg/dL and ≤ 125 mg/dL or a 2-hour postprandial glucose concentration ≥ 140 mg/dL and < 200 mg/dL. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to identify calculated or measured clinical and laboratory attributes that predict the presence of prediabetes, including fasting insulin quartiles, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index.

Results

Of 965 patients, 287 (29.7%) had prediabetes. The study population primarily consisted of white, obese, female patients. A multivariate model revealed that compared with the referent lowest quartile of fasting insulin (mu = 4.9 [± SD] ± 1.2 microIU/mL), subsequent insulin quartiles increased the likelihood of identifying prediabetes (quartile 2: mu = 8.0 ± 0.8 microIU/mL, odds ratio [OR] = 2.076, confidence interval [CI] = 1.241–3.273; quartile 3: mu = 12.2 ± 1.7 microIU/mL, OR = 3.151, CI = 1.981–5.015; quartile 4: mu = 25.9 ± 12.4 microIU/mL, OR = 5.035, CI = 3.122–8.122). Older age and increased diastolic blood pressure also contributed modestly to this model. Further analysis using the area under the curve revealed that at a fasting insulin level > 9.0 microIU/mL, prediabetes would be correctly identified in 80% of affected patients. A second model revealed that increased HOMA-IR index (OR = 1.303, CI = 1.205–1.410) and older age (OR = 1.037, CI = 1.024–1.05) predicted prediabetes.

Conclusions

The most robust model, which used fasting insulin levels, may provide the most utility as a clinical tool because the highest quartiles suggest significantly greater likelihood of identifying prediabetes.

### Elevated fasting insulin predicts the future incidence of metabolic syndrome: a 5-year follow-up study [^bc72d87a]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

There are several limitations in our study. There is ongoing controversy about whether the concept of metabolic syndrome is useful to predict CVD and T2DM. The diagnosis of MS has recently been shown to be useful for predicting subsequent CVD events, including in Asian cohorts and in a recent meta-analysis. Insulin sensitivity does not account for 100% of the variation in insulin response. Kim et al. showed that the fasting insulin concentration reflects less than 40% of the variability in insulin resistance as measured by a direct technique, although the fasting insulin concentration is significantly associated with insulin resistance. This study population was extremely well characterized, yet it was a homogenous population and it is representative of an adult Korean working population. This limits the generalizability of the data to other patient populations to some extent. Although the euglycemic insulin clamp test is currently the best and most accurate technique for assessing insulin sensitivity, the fasting insulin level was used as the marker for insulin resistance in this current study. The reason we didn't use the euglycemic insulin clamp technique is that it is almost impossible to perform this test in all the participants in this kind of large study population. Lastly, we did not analyze the risk for MS with Cox proportional hazard model or Kaplan-Meir survival estimate. This study was done in subjects who performed health examination twice in 5 years of interval, 2003 and 2008. We cannot specify the exact point when the subjects developed the disease of interest during those 5 years. Therefore, Cox proportional hazard model or Kaplan-Meir survival estimate could not be used, and this could have lowered the significance of the results. However, our study result has its own meaning study in that high baseline insulin concentration predicts the risk of developing MS among individuals with and without any MS component and as stratified by the fasting insulin concentration.

In conclusion, this study is the first to evaluate elevated fasting insulin as an independent predictive factor for the development of subsequent MS over a 5 year period in a well characterized cohort of apparently healthy adults. This study supports the concept that hyperinsulinemia is an early feature, if not the central feature, of the cardiovascular clusters of MS. We have to keep in mind the importance of high fasting insulin levels not just as a surrogate marker to predict future development of MS, but also the increased risk for future CVD itself as well. The usefulness of strategies to reverse hyperinsulinemia, such as lifestyle modifications, on the prevention of MS and CVD, warrants further investigation.

### Toward an improved diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome other clues to the presence of insulin resistance [^8bb5df93]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

A substantial portion of the population of the United States has the Metabolic Syndrome, a condition that greatly increases risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Insulin resistance, and the resulting compensatory hyperinsulinemia, is the principal pathophysiologic abnormality underlying the majority of these cases. Based on the most recent recommendations of the National Cholesterol Education Panel, such patients can be identified by the presence of three or more of the following traits: impaired fasting glucose, abdominal obesity, hypertension, elevated levels of triglycerides, and low concentrations of HDL-cholesterol. However, a significant number of insulin resistant (and thus high risk) individuals will not be identified using these criteria. This discrepancy occurs because insulin resistance is a continuous variable, without an absolute cut-off between normal and abnormal, and those fitting the definition are the most insulin resistant. Moreover, easily applicable testing to diagnose insulin resistance accurately in the general population is currently not feasible. It is therefore necessary to broaden the criteria that define the metabolic syndrome to include other conditions associated with the presence of insulin resistance. Such conditions include the following: a family history of type 2 diabetes or coronary artery disease in first- or second-degree relatives, signs of an over active sympathetic nervous system, and elevated concentrations of uric acid. By recognizing these "other conditions", appropriate lifestyle changes and medication can be recommended to help prevent cardiovascular disease and diabetes from developing in these high-risk patients.

### Elevated fasting insulin predicts the future incidence of metabolic syndrome: a 5-year follow-up study [^4a1d1e8e]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Results

During the mean follow up of 5 years, 199 of 2350 subjects (8.5%) developed MS. Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics of the study participants according to the quartiles of baseline fasting insulin levels. There were significant differences in the demographics and risk factors between as the fasting insulin increases from first quartile to 4 th quartile. As the baseline fasting insulin level increased, the subjects were more likely to be obese and on average showed gradually increasing mean values for fasting glucose, fasting insulin, systolic blood pressure and lipid profiles.

As seen in Figure 2, the proportion of subjects who developed MS increased as the quartile of the baseline fasting insulin level increased from the first to the fourth quartile in the whole cohort of subjects without any MS component. For the subjects in the highest quartile for insulin levels, 16.4% subsequently developed MS in the whole cohort. The proportion of subjects who developed diabetes mellitus significantly increased as the baseline fasting insulin level increased from first to fourth quartile (Figure 2).

### Prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline based on expert opinion [^7a1d75a7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Pediatric obesity — insulin resistance (IR) assessment states that fasting insulin is an optional test to quantify IR by calculation of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) or by noting fasting insulin is more than 2 sd above the mean for the laboratory doing the test. HOMA-IR is defined as HOMA-IR = (fasting insulin in μU/ml × fasting glucose in mmol/liter) divided by 22.5, and in nondiabetic children HOMA correlates as high as 0.91 with clamp measures. Based on a study of 1,802 adolescents aged 12–19 yr from the 1999–2002 NHANES, a HOMA-IR > 3.49 was recommended as evidence of IR; using that criterion, roughly 46–52% at a BMI in at least the 95th percentile, roughly 11–16% at least the 85th but below the 95th percentile, and 4% below the 85th percentile were insulin resistant. In Mexican children aged 10–14 yr, similar results were reported with 3, 12, and 47% insulin resistant at BMIs below the 85th percentile, at least the 85th but below the 95th percentile, and at least the 95th percentile, respectively. The use of any index of IR is complicated by concerns about the lack of standardized measures for the quantification of insulin and the need to be assured that the blood sample is obtained in a truly fasting state.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^1ea2a013]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy–associated insulin resistance (IR), asymptomatic hyperglycemia, impaired fasting plasma glucose (IFPG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and diabetes mellitus (DM) form a spectrum of increasing severity. IFPG is often defined as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of 100–125 mg/dL. IGT is often defined as an elevated 2-hour plasma glucose (PG) of 140–199 mg/dL in a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or, if the patient weighs < 43 kg, 1.75 g per kg of glucose up to a maximum of 75 g. DM is often defined as either an FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL, a random plasma glucose (RPG) ≥ 200 mg/dL in a patient with hyperglycemia symptoms, a glycosylated hemoglobin (HgbA1c) of ≥ 6.5%, or a 2-hour PG ≥ 200 mg/dL in an OGTT. The Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living With HIV does not recommend performing routine measurements of insulin levels, HgbA1c, or glucose tolerance without consulting an endocrinologist; these guidelines are instead based on the readily available RPG and FPG levels, and the HgbA1c test may underestimate glycemia in people with HIV, it is not recommended for diagnosis and may present challenges for monitoring. Management: For patients with an FPG of 100–125 mg/dL, impaired FPG suggests insulin resistance; consult an endocrinologist. For patients with an FPG of < 100 mg/dL, this FPG is normal, but a normal FPG does not exclude IR; recheck FPG in 6–12 months.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^a9cef25b]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

AACE 2023 insulin intensification — parameters and targets: Although A1C is a key measure, insulin titration requires multiple glycemic parameters including FBG, premeal or 2-hour postprandial BG, and CGM metrics including TIR, time below range, and GMI. In general, targets for fasting and premeal glucose are < 110 mg/dL, without hypoglycemia and can be individualized based on comorbidities and clinical status. The use of CGM is recommended for persons treated with insulin to optimize glycemic control while minimizing hypoglycemia.

### Reframing prediabetes: a call for better risk stratification and intervention [^1388b133]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Prediabetes is an intermediate state of glucose homeostasis whereby plasma glucose concentrations are above normal but below the threshold of diagnosis for diabetes. Over the last several decades, criteria for prediabetes have changed as the cut points for normal glucose concentration and diagnosis of diabetes have shifted. Global consensus does not exist for prediabetes criteria; as a result, the clinical course and risk for type 2 diabetes vary. At present, we can identify individuals with prediabetes based on three glycemic tests (hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose, and 2-h plasma glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test). The majority of individuals diagnosed with prediabetes meet only one of these criteria. Meeting one, two, or all glycemic criteria changes risk for type 2 diabetes, but this information is not widely known and does not currently guide intervention strategies for individuals with prediabetes. This review summarizes current epidemiology, prognosis, and intervention strategies for individuals diagnosed with prediabetes and suggests a call for more precise risk stratification of individuals with prediabetes as elevated (one prediabetes criterion), high risk (two prediabetes criteria), and very high risk (three prediabetes criteria). In addition, the roles of oral glucose tolerance testing and continuous glucose monitoring in the diagnostic criteria for prediabetes need reassessment. Finally, we must reframe our goals for prediabetes and prioritize intensive interventions for those at high and very high risk for type 2 diabetes.

### Surrogate estimates of insulin sensitivity in obese youth along the spectrum of glucose tolerance from normal to prediabetes to diabetes [^bf55be84]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

In epidemiological studies of childhood obesity, simple and reliable surrogate estimates of insulin sensitivity are needed because the gold standard, the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, is not feasible on a large scale.

Objective

To examine the correlation of fasting and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)-derived surrogate indices of insulin sensitivity with the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in obese adolescents with normal glucose tolerance, prediabetes, and diabetes.

Patients and Design

A total of 188 overweight/obese adolescents (10 to < 20 yr old) who completed a standard 2-h OGTT and 3-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp were included. Fasting-derived surrogates [fasting glucose (G(F)), fasting insulin (I(F)), 1/I(F), G(F)/I(F), homeostasis model assessment and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index] and OGTT-derived surrogates [whole-body insulin sensitivity index and the ratio of glucose and insulin areas under the curve (Gluc(AUC)/Ins(AUC))] were calculated.

Main Outcome Measures

We evaluated the correlations between the clamp-measured insulin sensitivity and the surrogate estimates and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves.

Results

Fasting indices (1/I(F), G(F)/I(F), homeostasis model assessment of insulin sensitivity, and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index) correlated significantly with clamp insulin sensitivity (r = 0.82, 0.78, 0.81, and 0.80, respectively), with lower correlations between the OGTT surrogates and clamp (whole-body insulin sensitivity index, r = 0.77; Gluc(AUC)/Ins(AUC), r = 0.62). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves was more than or equal to 0.94 for all surrogates except Gluc(AUC)/Ins(AUC.) Across quartiles of clamp-measured insulin sensitivity, there was a significant overlap in individual values of I(F), 1/I(F), and G(F)/I(F).

Conclusion

In obese adolescents with normal or impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes, OGTT-derived surrogates do not offer any advantage over the simpler fasting indices, which correlate strongly with clamp insulin sensitivity. Surrogate indices of insulin sensitivity could be used in epidemiological studies but not to define insulin resistance in individual patients or research subjects.

### Higher fasting insulin but lower fasting C-peptide levels in African Americans in the US population [^c9c792d6]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Fasting serum insulin and fasting serum C-peptide are risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes. Because of the higher incidence of type 2 diabetes in African Americans and Hispanic Americans, it is likely that these groups may differ from non-Hispanic whites in their levels of insulin and C-peptide.

Methods

We analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of adults in the US population for whom sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory information were obtained. The data were used to describe distributions of fasting insulin and fasting C-peptide in non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican American men and women aged ≥ 20 years without a medical history of diabetes.

Results

Among men, Mexican Americans had higher insulin values than non-Hispanic whites and blacks. Among women, both Mexican Americans and blacks had higher insulin values than whites. For C-peptide, differences by sex and race-ethnicity paralleled those seen for fasting insulin with the exception that black men had significantly lower C-peptide values than whites and Mexican Americans. After adjustment for age, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body mass index (BMI), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), the higher levels for insulin in blacks and Mexican Americans remained; both black men and women had significantly lower C-peptide values than whites and Mexican Americans. The molar ratio of fasting C-peptide to fasting insulin was similar for men and women in each race-ethnic group. However, blacks had substantially lower ratios than whites and Mexican Americans.

Conclusions

We found wide variations in fasting insulin and fasting C-peptide levels by race and ethnicity in US adults that were not explained by confounding factors, primarily measures of obesity. Most notably, the higher fasting insulin and lower fasting C-peptide levels in blacks implies that there is a derangement in insulin clearance and an impairment in beta-cell function in blacks compared with whites and Mexican Americans.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 190: gestational diabetes mellitus [^bc9507b6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) — pharmacologic treatment is recommended when target glucose goals are not met with nutrition therapy and exercise, although a systematic review found no conclusive evidence for a specific threshold value at which medical therapy should be started. Insulin, which does not cross the placenta, is traditionally added to nutrition therapy if fasting blood glucose levels consistently are greater than or equal to 95 mg/dL, if 1-hour levels consistently are greater than or equal to 140 mg/dL, or if 2-hour levels consistently are greater than or equal to 120 mg/dL. When fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia are present after most meals, a typical starting total insulin dosage is 0.7–1.0 units/kg daily, divided as multiple injections using long-acting or intermediate- acting insulin in combination with short-acting insulin, with subsequent adjustments individualized to monitored glucose patterns. For isolated abnormalities, targeted regimens may suffice, such as nighttime intermediate-acting insulin (eg, NPH) for elevated fasting values or short-acting insulin before breakfast for elevated breakfast postprandials. For long-acting and intermediate-acting needs, NPH has been the mainstay, with insulin glargine and insulin detemir described for long-acting use; for short-acting needs, insulin analogues — including insulin lispro and insulin aspart — have been used in pregnancy and do not cross the placenta, and insulin lispro and insulin aspart should be used preferentially over regular insulin because both have a more rapid onset that permits dosing at mealtime rather than 10–15 minutes beforehand, improving glycemic control and reducing hypoglycemia from timing errors.

### HbA (1c) diagnostic categories and β-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity in overweight / obese adolescents [^b9ebf05d]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) is used to monitor diabetes control in diagnosed patients. In 2009, an international expert committee recommended that HbA 1c also be used for diagnosis of diabetes and risk of diabetes. Subsequently, HbA 1c diagnostic cutoffs were incorporated into the 2010 American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines for diabetes (HbA 1c ≥ 6.5%) and prediabetes (HbA 1c 5.7 to < 6.5%). Unlike glycemic measures (e.g. fasting glucose, oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT]), the HbA 1c may be performed in the nonfasting state. However, adoption of these proposed criteria continues to be debated. In cross-sectional studies of adults, the HbA 1c criteria had lower sensitivity for diabetes diagnosis compared with OGTT or a single fasting plasma glucose. But, the sensitivity of the HbA 1c criteria improved when compared with repeated fasting plasma glucose samples (3 years apart), and the combination of fasting glucose and HbA 1c provided the greatest predictive value for 10-year diabetes risk compared with fasting glucose alone (single or repeated). Furthermore, in a longitudinal study, HbA 1c identified fewer cases of prediabetes at baseline, but had similar predictive value for progression to diabetes as fasting glucose (∼5-year follow-up). Accordingly, recent pediatric studies indicate that HbA 1c identifies fewer adolescents with diabetes/prediabetes compared with glycemic measures. However, similar to adults, HbA 1c improved the predictive value of glycemic measures alone after a 2-year follow-up in adolescents. Because glycemic measures of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are linked to impaired insulin secretion relative to insulin sensitivity, conferring an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, we hypothesized that alterations in the pathophysiologic mechanisms of type 2 diabetes could be detected in the ADA recommended at-risk/prediabetes category (HbA 1c 5.7 to < 6.5%). Therefore, we aimed to evaluate in vivo insulin sensitivity and β-cell function in overweight/obese youth categorized according to the 2010 ADA HbA 1c criteria as normal versus prediabetes.

### Impact of C-peptide preservation on metabolic and clinical outcomes in the diabetes control and complications trial [^631c1de3]. Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial established that a stimulated C-peptide concentration ≥ 0.2 nmol/L at study entry among subjects with up to a 5-year diabetes duration is associated with favorable metabolic and clinical outcomes over the subsequent 7 years of follow-up. Herein we further examine the association of both fasting and stimulated C-peptide numerical values with outcomes. In the intensive treatment group, for a 50% higher stimulated C-peptide on entry, such as from 0.10 to 0.15 nmol/L, HbA1c decreased by 0.07% (0.8 mmol/mol; P = 0.0003), insulin dose decreased by 0.0276 units/kg/day (P < 0.0001), hypoglycemia risk decreased by 8.2% (P < 0.0001), and the risk of sustained retinopathy was reduced by 25% (P = 0.0010), all in unadjusted analyses. Other than HbA1c, these effects remained significant after adjusting for the HbA1c on entry. While C-peptide was not significantly associated with the incidence of nephropathy, it was strongly associated with the albumin excretion rate. The fasting C-peptide had weaker associations with outcomes. As C-peptide decreased to nonmeasurable concentrations, the outcomes changed in a nearly linear manner, with no threshold or breakpoint. While preservation of stimulated C-peptide at ≥ 0.2 nmol/L has clinically beneficial outcomes, so also does an increase in the concentration of C-peptide across the range of values.

PREDICTION OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS AND NODAT

An elevated level of glucose in the blood, whether examined in the fasting state or during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), is among the best predictors of type 2 diabetes mellitus in population studies. Using OGTTs, insulin and glucose levels were obtained from participants in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and used to estimate insulin sensitivity (1/fasting insulin and the insulin sensitivity index) and insulin secretion (corrected insulin response and ratio of 30-min change in insulin to 30-min change in glucose). Improvements in insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion that occurred as a response to intervention were associated with lower diabetes risk, supporting the hypothesis that effectiveness of intensive lifestyle was due to improved insulin sensitivity concomitant with preservation of pancreatic β-cell function.

Although useful in population studies, neither the OGTT nor the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, derived from concentrations of fasting glucose and insulin, may adequately mirror the altered carbohydrate metabolism of individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or ESRD. Concentrations of endogenous insulin are elevated in patients with CKD because of decreased renal clearance of endogenous insulin. Patients with CKD and ESRD are more resistant to insulin than those with normal renal function, as assessed with a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Although clamp studies have been performed at all stages of kidney disease and in patients with stable renal function after transplantation, they have not been evaluated as predictors of NODAT. The use of homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance to predict NODAT is modestly supported in one study. Despite the logistics of the test, the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp may prove to be a better tool for the prediction of NODAT, as suggested by some investigators.

### Glucose and insulin measurements from the oral glucose tolerance test and mortality prediction [^541e2315]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To verify what information from oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) independently predicts mortality.

Research Design and Methods

A total of 1,401 initially nondiabetic participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging aged 17–95 years underwent one or more OGTTs (median 2, range 1–8), with insulin and glucose measurements taken every 20 min over the course of 2 h included in this study. Proportional hazards using the longitudinally collected data and Bayesian model averaging were used to examine the association of OGTT measurements individually and grouped with mortality, adjusting for covariates.

Results

Participants were followed for a median 20.3 years (range 0.5–40). The first-hour OGTT glucose and insulin levels increased only modestly with age, whereas levels during the second hour increased 4% per decade. Individually, 100- and 120-min glucose measures and fasting and 100-min insulin levels were all independent predictors of mortality. When all measures were considered together, only higher 120-min glucose was a significant independent risk factor for mortality.

Conclusion

The steeper rise with age of the OGTT 2-h glucose values and the prognostic primacy of the 120-min glucose value for mortality is consistent with previous reports and suggests the value of using the OGTT in clinical practice.

### The need for a prognostic biomarker and challenge test for phenotypic flexibility [^ec6f2c05]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

The global burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and others have risen to account for 74% of all deaths globally. The World Health Organization identifies nutrition as a key contributor to NCD deaths, which have grown despite the adoption and refinement of population-based dietary guidance over the last four decades. Because broad dietary recommendations have not blunted these trends, public and private investment in precision nutrition strategies has risen dramatically. In 2021, the National Institutes of Health launched the largest precision nutrition research program of its kind — The Nutrition for Precision Health Study.

The field of precision nutrition has been challenged by the inability to accurately predict how a specific dietary pattern may impact an individual's metabolic health and prevent or decrease risk for chronic disease. The work of Drs. Mitchell, Stinson, Chang, and Krakoff published in this issue of Nutrition & Diabetes is, to our knowledge, the first study to identify predictors of incident type 2 diabetes using a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT). This research lends support to the use of an MMTT for diagnosing risk of diabetes, with the potential for predicting risk of other disease states.

Currently, fasting blood tests are considered the standard of care for determining chronic disease risk. However, evidence shows that post-prandial measures of insulin, glucose, and lipids are independent risk factors for chronic disease, in particular for diabetes and cardiovascular disease; post-prandial glucose increases the risk of cardiometabolic diseases even in individuals with normal fasted glucose levels. These observations highlight the importance of measuring multiple metabolites in both the fasted and non-fasted state. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), traditionally used for the clinical diagnosis of diabetes, considers post-prandial glucose and insulin dynamics in addition to fasted measures. However, the composition of the OGTT (glucose) does not reflect the composition of a mixed meal, nor the resulting metabolites in the human post-prandial state. Further, the OGTT may not adequately challenge multiple metabolic systems beyond those involved in glucose metabolism.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^2c916831]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to monitoring of glycemic status, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to encourage checking blood glucose levels when appropriate based on the insulin therapy, such as when fasting, before meals and snacks, after meals, at bedtime, in the middle of the night, before, during, and after exercise, when hypoglycemia is suspected, after treating low blood glucose levels until they are normoglycemic, when hyperglycemia is suspected, and before and while performing critical tasks such as driving.
