## Question

What are the characteristic tympanic membrane findings in otitis media?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the characteristic tympanic membrane (TM) findings that distinguish acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME), and normal ears, and to outline how pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry support that differentiation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic framework and the primacy of pneumatic otoscopy. Then, I should verify the hallmark TM features for AOM versus OME. Next, I will review the role and limitations of tympanometry. After that, I need to consider confounders and special scenarios that can mislead diagnosis. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and double-check that each assertion aligns with guideline-level evidence and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — AOM and OME are overlapping entities along a continuum, so distinguishing them hinges on the presence of acute inflammatory signs and the TM's position and mobility rather than color alone. I should confirm that guidelines prioritize pneumatic otoscopy as the primary method to document middle ear effusion (MEE) and to distinguish AOM from OME, with tympanometry as an adjunct when otoscopy is uncertain or technically limited [^111UfCEi] [^114Lzcn9] [^111nq8E7].

> Now, I will examine the hallmark TM findings for AOM. Wait, let me verify the most discriminative sign: moderate-to-severe bulging of the TM is the strongest single predictor of AOM, with very high specificity and substantial likelihood ratios, whereas mild bulging alone is insufficient unless paired with recent ear pain or intense erythema. I should double-check that immobility and cloudiness further increase diagnostic certainty, and that erythema alone is supportive but less specific. The combination of cloudy, bulging, and distinctly immobile TM yields the highest diagnostic yield for AOM on pneumatic otoscopy [^1154NTQj] [^113CCLkG] [^115ZLyDQ] [^11598rhu].

> Next, I should review the TM findings for OME. Let me think about the key discriminators: OME typically shows an opacified or dull TM without acute inflammatory signs, often neutral or retracted, and with reduced but not completely absent mobility on pneumatic otoscopy. I need to ensure I mention that air-fluid levels or bubbles may be visible behind the TM when the effusion is serous, and that the membrane lacks the outward bulge characteristic of AOM. Opacification is the main feature that helps separate OME from no effusion, while bulging is absent in OME [^1165A9xp] [^112DTwz6] [^113HFnAF].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of tympanometry and its limitations. A flat Type B tympanogram supports MEE but cannot reliably distinguish AOM from OME, so I must not over-interpret a Type B as diagnostic for AOM by itself. I should confirm that tympanometry is best used as an objective adjunct when pneumatic otoscopy is inconclusive, when visualization is limited, or when child cooperation is poor, and that it complements rather than replaces otoscopy. Guidelines recommend tympanometry when the diagnosis remains uncertain after attempted pneumatic otoscopy [^116Pc6KS] [^111nq8E7].

> I need to check confounders that can mislead diagnosis. Cerumen impaction can obscure the TM and mimic or mask effusion, so clearing the canal is essential before assessment. Retraction from negative middle ear pressure can mimic effusion but shows different mobility patterns on pneumatic otoscopy. Early AOM may present before frank effusion accumulates, leading to erythema and pain with minimal bulging or even a dry tap at tympanocentesis. I should also remember that TM color alone is unreliable, and that erythema can reflect crying or fever rather than infection. These pitfalls underscore why pneumatic otoscopy with attention to position and mobility is critical [^115ZgPQQ] [^114CU1fy] [^11414y1T] [^115ZLyDQ].

> Let me consider special scenarios briefly. In infants, clinicians may rely more on erythema plus other abnormalities due to limited cooperation, but I should confirm that this is less reliable than bulging and mobility assessment. In chronic OME, the TM may appear atrophic or show retraction pockets, and surveillance is recommended at 3–6 month intervals until resolution or intervention is indicated. But wait, what if there is otorrhea through an intact canal? I should verify that new-onset otorrhea not due to otitis externa supports AOM even without classic bulging, and that TM perforation with otorrhea can be inferred by fogging of the otoscope lens when the full TM is not visualized [^113GTM9P] [^113DZn4h] [^1154NTQj] [^114xkZz9].

> I will now synthesize a practical, stepwise approach. First, clear cerumen to visualize the entire TM. Then, perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess contour, color, translucency, and mobility, prioritizing bulging and impaired mobility for AOM and opacification with reduced but present mobility for OME. If the diagnosis remains uncertain or the child cannot tolerate insufflation, obtain tympanometry; a Type B tracing supports MEE but still requires clinical correlation to distinguish AOM from OME. Finally, document laterality, duration, and severity, and avoid diagnosing AOM in the absence of MEE or compatible TM findings. This sequence aligns with AAP/AAFP and AAO-HNS guidance and maximizes diagnostic accuracy [^111UfCEi] [^113cHwvq] [^111nq8E7].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overstated that a Type B tympanogram equals AOM — let me reconsider and correct that. A Type B tracing indicates MEE and supports either AOM or OME; it cannot by itself establish acute inflammation. I should confirm that the diagnosis of AOM still requires either moderate-to-severe bulging or mild bulging with recent ear pain or intense erythema, or new-onset otorrhea not due to otitis externa, whereas OME is fluid without acute inflammatory signs. This distinction prevents overdiagnosis and unnecessary antibiotics [^1154NTQj] [^113CCLkG] [^1165A9xp].

> In summary, I need to ensure the core message is precise: for AOM, look for moderate-to-severe bulging with impaired mobility and often cloudiness or intense erythema; for OME, expect opacification with reduced but not absent mobility and no acute inflammatory signs; and use pneumatic otoscopy as the primary tool, with tympanometry as an adjunct when needed. This approach reduces misclassification, guides appropriate management, and aligns with high-quality evidence and contemporary pediatric guidelines [^115ZLyDQ] [^111UfCEi] [^113cHwvq].

The characteristic tympanic membrane (TM) findings in otitis media are: **bulging** with **erythema** and **impaired mobility** for acute otitis media (AOM) [^1154NTQj] [^115ZLyDQ], and **retraction** with **dullness** and **reduced mobility** for otitis media with effusion (OME) [^1165A9xp] [^115fNHJ1]. These features help distinguish AOM from OME and guide management [^113HFnAF].

---

## Acute otitis media (AOM)

AOM is an **acute infection** of the middle ear characterized by rapid-onset inflammation and effusion [^1165A9xp]. The following TM findings are characteristic:

- **Bulging**: Moderate to severe bulging of the TM is the most reliable sign of AOM, indicating increased middle ear pressure from effusion and inflammation [^1154NTQj] [^113HFnAF].

- **Erythema**: The TM appears red or hyperemic due to inflammation; however, erythema alone is less specific and can be seen with crying or fever [^114tb56W].

- **Impaired mobility**: The TM is immobile or only slightly mobile on pneumatic otoscopy due to fluid in the middle ear [^114CU1fy] [^115ZLyDQ].

- **Opacity**: The TM may appear cloudy or opaque because of the underlying effusion [^11598rhu].

- **Air-fluid levels**: Occasionally, an air-fluid level may be visible behind the TM, indicating middle ear effusion [^114CU1fy].

---

## Otitis media with effusion (OME)

OME is characterized by **fluid in the middle ear without acute inflammatory signs**. The TM findings differ from AOM:

- **Retraction**: The TM is typically retracted due to negative middle ear pressure from Eustachian tube dysfunction [^114tb56W] [^11599XCx].

- **Dullness**: The TM appears dull or opaque, reflecting the presence of fluid [^113HFnAF] [^111mFeTC].

- **Reduced mobility**: The TM shows reduced mobility on pneumatic otoscopy, but not complete immobility as seen in AOM [^112DTwz6] [^115ZLyDQ].

- **Air bubbles**: Air bubbles or an air-fluid level may be visible behind the TM, indicating effusion [^114CU1fy].

---

## Chronic otitis media (COM)

COM is characterized by **persistent middle ear inflammation** with chronic effusion or structural changes. TM findings include:

- **Perforation**: A persistent perforation of the TM, often with chronic otorrhea [^116mFQG9].

- **Tympanosclerosis**: White, chalky patches on the TM due to calcification [^notfound].

- **Retraction pockets**: Chronic negative pressure causes retraction pockets, which may lead to cholesteatoma formation [^1156Q5DX].

- **Chronic effusion**: The TM appears dull with reduced mobility due to persistent effusion [^1165A9xp].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy and clinical implications

Pneumatic otoscopy is the **primary diagnostic tool** for assessing TM mobility and confirming middle ear effusion [^111UfCEi]. Tympanometry provides objective confirmation, particularly when otoscopy is inconclusive [^116ziDYg]. Accurate identification of these TM findings is essential to differentiate AOM from OME, guide appropriate treatment, and prevent complications such as hearing loss and structural damage [^113cHwvq].

---

The characteristic TM findings in otitis media include bulging, erythema, and impaired mobility for AOM, and retraction, dullness, and reduced mobility for OME. Recognizing these findings is **essential for accurate diagnosis and management** [^115ZLyDQ] [^115fNHJ1] [^112DTwz6].

Background

Lack of agreed-upon diagnostic criteria for acute otitis media (AOM) has led to inconsistencies in clinical care, misleading research results, and misguided educational efforts. The objective of this study was to examine findings that expert otoscopists use when diagnosing AOM.

Methods

A group of experienced otoscopists examined 783 children presenting for primary care. In addition, endoscopic still images of the tympanic membranes (TMs) were obtained. A random sample of 135 of these images was sent for review to a group of 7 independent physicians who were expert otoscopists. We examined the findings that both groups of observers used to distinguish between AOM, otitis media with effusion (OME), and no effusion.

Results

Among both groups of observers, bulging of the TM was the finding judged best to differentiate AOM from OME: 96% of ears and 93% of ear image evaluations assigned a diagnosis of AOM by members of the 2 groups were reported as showing bulging of the TM, compared with 0% and 3%, respectively, of ears and ear image evaluations assigned a diagnosis of OME. Opacification of the TM was the finding that best differentiated OME from no effusion.

Conclusions

We describe findings that are used by experienced otoscopists to diagnose AOM and OME. The findings point to the advisability under most circumstances of restricting antimicrobial treatment for AOM to children who have TM bulging, and they call into question clinical trials of the treatment of AOM in which TM bulging has not been a required element for participation.

Objectives

We report the findings of an evidence assessment on the accuracy of methods of diagnosing middle ear effusion in children with otitis media with effusion (OME).

Methods

We searched Medline (1966-January 2000), the Cochrane Library (through January 2000), and Embase (1980-January 2000) and identified additional articles from reference lists in proceedings, published articles, reports, and guidelines. Excluded were nonhuman studies; case reports; editorials; letters; reviews; practice guidelines; non-English-language publications; and studies on patients with immunodeficiencies, craniofacial anomalies (including cleft palate), primary mucosal disorders, or genetic conditions. From each eligible study, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy, and prevalence of OME in the cohort. We determined the number of studies for each comparison of a diagnostic method and a reference standard listed within the scope of our assessment. For comparisons with 3 or more studies, we derived random effects estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence rate. Using the pooled estimates, we plotted the performance of each diagnostic test in terms of sensitivity and (1 - specificity) and identified the best performer among the tests included in the comparison.

Results

Among 8 diagnostic methods, pneumatic otoscopy had the best apparent performance with a sensitivity of 94% (95% confidence interval: 92%-96%) and a specificity of 80% (95% confidence interval: 75%-86%). However, examiner qualifications were reported inconsistently, and training was not specified.

Conclusions

The finding that pneumatic otoscopy can do as well as or better than tympanometry and acoustic reflectometry has significant practical implications. For the typical clinician, pneumatic otoscopy should be easier to use than other diagnostic methods. The important question may be what degree of training will be needed for the clinician to be as effective with pneumatic otoscopy as were the examiners in the studies reviewed in this report.

Middle ear

The middle ear is hidden behind the tympanic membrane, what makes direct non-invasive evaluation limited in many cases.

Although the pathology itself can be well estimated on otoscopic examination, further questions concerning the extent of the disease, exact location, structures involved and possible bone erosion, will be addressed in detail only with CT and/or MRI.

The majority of everyday practice cases will consist of inflammatory diseases, either chronic or acute, and sometimes tumours. On CT examination, these entities will demonstrate a mass, or a diffuse opacification of middle ear cavity.

Since an opacified middle ear is a common finding on imaging studies, a practical classification has been used, in order to facilitate differential diagnosis (Table 3).

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^114Lzcn9]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — diagnosis and initial observation research priorities — states there will probably never be a gold standard for diagnosis of AOM because of the continuum from otitis media with effusion (OME) to AOM, and performing tympanocentesis studies on children with uncomplicated otitis is likely not feasible because of ethical and other considerations. Devices that more accurately identify the presence of middle ear effusion (MEE) and bulging that are easier to use than tympanometry during office visits would be welcome, with additional development of inexpensive, easy-to-use video pneumatic otoscopes still a goal. For less certain tympanic membrane (TM) appearances, randomized controlled trials could clarify the benefit of initial antibiotics and initial observation, and such studies must also specify severity of illness, laterality, and otorrhea, establish appropriate end points, and, when TM appearance is unimproved, require randomization to continued observation and antibiotic groups. The most efficient and acceptable methods of initial observation should continue to be studied balancing the convenience and benefits with the potential risks to the patient.

Chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) surveillance — "Clinicians should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected". This is a "Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm", with "Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, observational studies", "Level of confidence in the evidence: High", and "Policy level: Recommendation". Benefits include detection of structural tympanic membrane changes and new hearing difficulties that may prompt reassessment and discussion of listening-learning strategies with ongoing counseling, while risks/costs are limited to the "Cost of follow-up", and the "Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm". Timing is intentionally flexible because "The surveillance interval is broadly defined at 3 to 6 months", and patient preference is acknowledged: "Role of patient preferences: Moderate; opportunity for shared decision making regarding the surveillance interval".

Otitis media with effusion — tympanometry preparation and calibration. Prior to performing tympanometry, the ear canal should be examined with otoscopy for cerumen blockage, foreign bodies, drainage, tympanic membrane perforation, or a collapsed canal to correlate findings with tympanometry results. Proper calibration of the tympanometer is essential for accurate results.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) frequently asked questions — ear fluid is described as "a buildup of mucus or liquid behind the eardrum, without symptoms of an ear infection", and ear infections (acute otitis media [AOM]) "cause fever, ear pain, and active (acute) inflammation"; in OME the fluid "is not actively infected, and pain may be absent or minimal". The page notes that "Nearly all children get ear fluid at least once by school age". Children may have "no symptoms at all or more subtle findings", and clinicians can detect fluid "by looking in the ear canal (otoscopy) or by measuring the movement of the eardrum (tympanometry or pneumatic otoscopy)". Causes listed include "a cold, an ear infection (AOM), or the normal congestion (negative pressure)", and most fluid "goes away on its own in weeks or months". OME "is of more concern if it lasts > 3 mo", and "Your doctor should check the ears periodically until the fluid is gone"; management advice notes that the "best advice can be found in clinical practice guidelines" based on evidence and consideration of benefits and harms.

### Does this child have acute otitis media? [^115ZLyDQ]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common problems in pediatrics. An accurate diagnosis of AOM can guide proper treatment and follow-up.

Objective

To systematically review the literature regarding precision and accuracy of history taking and physical examination in diagnosing AOM in children.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE for English-language articles published from 1966 through May 2002. Bibliographies of retrieved articles and textbooks were also searched.

Study Selection

We located studies with original data on the precision or accuracy of history or physical examination for AOM in children. Of 397 references initially identified, 6 met inclusion criteria for analysis.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently reviewed and abstracted data to calculate likelihood ratios (LRs) for symptoms and signs.

Data Synthesis

Four studies of symptoms used clinical diagnosis as the criterion standard and were limited by incorporation bias. Ear pain is the most useful symptom (positive LRs, 3.0–7.3); fever, upper respiratory tract symptoms, and irritability are less useful. One study of clinical signs used tympanocentesis as the criterion standard, and we adjusted the results to correct for verification bias. A cloudy (adjusted LR, 34; 95% confidence interval, 28–42), bulging (adjusted LR, 51; 95% CI, 36–73), or distinctly immobile (adjusted LR, 31; 95% CI, 26–37) tympanic membrane on pneumatic otoscopy are the most useful signs for detecting AOM. A distinctly red tympanic membrane is also helpful (adjusted LR, 8.4; 95% CI, 6.7–11) whereas a normal color makes AOM much less likely (adjusted LR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.19–0.21).

Conclusions

Although many of the studies included in this analysis are limited by bias, a cloudy, bulging, or clearly immobile tympanic membrane is most helpful for detecting AOM. The degree of erythema may also be useful since a normal color makes otitis media unlikely whereas a distinctly red tympanic membrane increases the likelihood significantly.

Tympanometry — policy scope and implementation notes are provided. The purpose is to promote tympanometry as an objective tool in diagnosing otitis media with effusion, both for confirming pneumatic otoscopy findings and as an alternative to otoscopy when visualization of the membrane is limited, and tympanometry can objectively assess tympanic membrane mobility for patients who are difficult to examine or do not tolerate insufflation. Value judgments: None; Intentional vagueness specifies that the individual who performs tympanometry is not specified and whether to use portable or tabletop tympanometry is at the discretion of the clinician; Role of patient preferences: Limited; Exceptions: Patients with recent ear surgery or trauma; Policy level: Strong recommendation; Differences of opinion: None.

Clinical Practice Guideline: Otitis media with effusion (OME) — strong recommendations state that the update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing OME in a child and should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess for OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both. Clinicians should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy and should manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown). Clinicians should recommend against using intranasal or systemic steroids for treating OME, should recommend against using systemic antibiotics for treating OME, and should recommend against using antihistamines, decongestants, or both for treating OME.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^112YAxw6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2004 guideline codeveloped by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Family Physicians, provides evidence-based recommendations to manage otitis media with effusion (OME), defined as the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection. Changes from the prior guideline include consumer advocates added to the update group, evidence from 4 new clinical practice guidelines, 20 new systematic reviews, and 49 randomized control trials, enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of OME.

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing OME and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy, identify children who are most susceptible to developmental sequelae from OME, and educate clinicians and patients regarding the favorable natural history of most OME and the clinical benefits for medical therapy (eg, steroids, antihistamines, decongestants). Additional goals relate to OME surveillance, hearing and language evaluation, and management of OME detected by newborn screening. The target patient for the guideline is a child aged 2 months through 12 years with OME, with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage children with OME, and it applies to any setting in which OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline, however, does not apply to patients < 2 months or > 12 years old.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should document the presence of middle ear effusion with pneumatic otoscopy when diagnosing OME in a child; (2) should perform pneumatic otoscopy to assess for OME in a child with otalgia, hearing loss, or both; (3) should obtain tympanometry in children with suspected OME for whom the diagnosis is uncertain after performing (or attempting) pneumatic otoscopy; (4) should manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known) or 3 months from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown); (5) should recommend against using intranasal or systemic steroids for treating OME; (6) should recommend against using systemic antibiotics for treating OME; and (7) should recommend against using antihistamines, decongestants, or both for treating OME. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should document in the medical record counseling of parents of infants with OME who fail a newborn screening regarding the importance of follow-up to ensure that hearing is normal when OME resolves and to exclude an underlying sensorineural hearing loss; (2) should determine if a child with OME is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from middle ear effusion because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (3) should evaluate at-risk children for OME at the time of diagnosis of an at-risk condition and at 12 to 18 months of age (if diagnosed as being at risk prior to this time); (4) should not routinely screen children for OME who are not at risk and do not have symptoms that may be attributable to OME, such as hearing difficulties, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, or ear discomfort; (5) should educate children with OME and their families regarding the natural history of OME, need for follow-up, and the possible sequelae; (6) should obtain an age-appropriate hearing test if OME persists for 3 months or longer OR for OME of any duration in an at-risk child; (7) should counsel families of children with bilateral OME and documented hearing loss about the potential impact on speech and language development; (8) should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; (9) should recommend tympanostomy tubes when surgery is performed for OME in a child < 4 years old; adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); (10) should recommend tympanostomy tubes, adenoidectomy, or both when surgery is performed for OME in a child ≥ 4 years old; and (11) should document resolution of OME, improved hearing, or improved quality of life when managing a child with OME.

Tympanometry as an adjunct to pneumatic otoscopy — indications for use. Tympanometry is a useful adjunct to pneumatic otoscopy because it provides objective evidence of middle ear status, and although recommended as a first-line diagnostic test for OME, pneumatic otoscopy has varying degrees of validity and accuracy in routine clinical practice; all studies examining test performance of pneumatic otoscopy have used experienced otoscopists with special training, validation, or both, whereas OME is most often diagnosed by primary care providers who are not validated and do not often use a pneumatic attachment. There are no specific studies that validate the performance characteristics of tympanometry as a confirmatory, or adjunctive, test with pneumatic otoscopy, and we therefore recommend tympanometry when the diagnosis of OME is uncertain after pneumatic otoscopy is used or attempted; specific situations for which tympanometry is recommended include child intolerance of pneumatic otoscopy; inability to reliably perform pneumatic otoscopy because of training or equipment considerations (eg, inability to obtain an air-tight seal); difficulty visualizing the tympanic membrane because of partially obstructing cerumen that cannot be readily removed by the clinician; difficulty visualizing the tympanic membrane because of a very narrow or stenotic external auditory canal (eg, Down syndrome); uncertainty about the presence or absence of OME because of equivocal findings on pneumatic otoscopy; need or desire to rule out OME in an at-risk (Table 3) child; and need or desire for objective confirmation of OME before surgery.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — antibiotic benefit magnitude and NNT: To prevent mastoiditis, the number needed to treat is approximately 4800 patients to prevent 1 case of mastoiditis. When otoscopic improvement (resolution of tympanic membrane bulging or intense erythema) is required for success, the NNT is 3 to 4, compared with 8 to 16 for symptom improvement alone, and middle ear effusion may persist for weeks or months and is not a criterion for otoscopic failure.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — key term definitions specify that OME is the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection, and chronic OME is OME persisting for ≥ 3 mo from the date of onset (if known) or from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown). Acute otitis media (AOM) is the rapid onset of signs and symptoms of inflammation of the middle ear, and middle ear effusion is fluid in the middle ear from any cause that is present with both OME and AOM and may persist for weeks or months after AOM resolves. Hearing assessment gathers information about a child's hearing status via caregiver report or formal testing and does not include use of noisemakers or other nonstandardized methods. Pneumatic otoscopy examines middle ear mobility by changing ear canal pressure, with a normal eardrum moving briskly but becoming minimal or sluggish with fluid. A tympanogram objectively measures tympanic membrane vibration and pressure; with fluid the tracing is flat or nearly flat, and with air at abnormal pressure the peak shifts left if negative or right if positive. Conductive hearing loss reflects impaired sound transmission often associated with effusion, whereas sensorineural hearing loss results from abnormal transmission of sound from the sensory cells of the inner ear to the brain.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^113pYmHw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Statement 5 — Surveillance of chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) states that clinicians should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME who do not receive tympanostomy tubes, until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is detected, or structural abnormalities of the tympanic membrane or middle ear are suspected. This is a recommendation based on observational studies, with a preponderance of benefit over harm, with aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on observational studies, and level of confidence in evidence: High. Benefits include detection of structural changes in the tympanic membrane that may require intervention, detection of new hearing difficulties or symptoms that would lead to reassessing the need for tympanostomy tube insertion, discussion of strategies for optimizing the listening-learning environment for children with OME, and ongoing counseling and education of parents/caregiver; risks, harms, costs are the cost of examination(s). The surveillance interval is intentionally vague and is broadly defined at 3 to 6 months, and "significant" hearing loss is broadly defined as one that is noticed by the caregiver, reported by the child, or interferes in school performance or quality of life, and there is a role for patient (caregiver) preferences with opportunity for shared decision making regarding the surveillance interval. Quality improvement opportunity items include promoting continuity of care, avoiding preventable complications through surveillance, and gaining insight into natural history of chronic middle ear fluid.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion [^114EDL2Q]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical practice guideline on otitis media with effusion (OME) provides evidence-based recommendations on diagnosing and managing OME in children. This is an update of the 1994 clinical practice guideline "Otitis Media With Effusion in Young Children", which was developed by the Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research (now the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality). In contrast to the earlier guideline, which was limited to children aged 1 to 3 years with no craniofacial or neurologic abnormalities or sensory deficits, the updated guideline applies to children aged 2 months through 12 years with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery selected a subcommittee composed of experts in the fields of primary care, otolaryngology, infectious diseases, epidemiology, hearing, speech and language, and advanced practice nursing to revise the OME guideline. The subcommittee made a strong recommendation that clinicians use pneumatic otoscopy as the primary diagnostic method and distinguish OME from acute otitis media (AOM). The subcommittee made recommendations that clinicians should (1) document the laterality, duration of effusion, and presence and severity of associated symptoms at each assessment of the child with OME; (2) distinguish the child with OME who is at risk for speech, language, or learning problems from other children with OME and more promptly evaluate hearing, speech, language, and need for intervention in children at risk; and (3) manage the child with OME who is not at risk with watchful waiting for 3 months from the date of effusion onset (if known), or from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown). The subcommittee also made recommendations that (4) hearing testing be conducted when OME persists for 3 months or longer, or at any time that language delay, learning problems, or a significant hearing loss is suspected in a child with OME; (5) children with persistent OME who are not at risk should be reexamined at 3- to 6-month intervals until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; and (6) when a child becomes a surgical candidate, tympanostomy tube insertion is the preferred initial procedure. Adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); repeat surgery consists of adenoidectomy plus myringotomy, with or without tube insertion. Tonsillectomy alone or myringotomy alone should not be used to treat OME. The subcommittee made negative recommendations that (1) population-based screening programs for OME not be performed in healthy, asymptomatic children and (2) antihistamines and decongestants are ineffective for OME and should not be used for treatment; antimicrobials and corticosteroids do not have long-term efficacy and should not be used for routine management. The subcommittee gave as options that (1) tympanometry can be used to confirm the diagnosis of OME and (2) when children with OME are referred by the primary clinician for evaluation by an otolaryngologist, audiologist, or speech-language pathologist, the referring clinician should document the effusion duration and specific reason for referral (evaluation, surgery), and provide additional relevant information such as history of AOM and developmental status of the child. The subcommittee made no recommendations for (1) complementary and alternative medicine as a treatment for OME based on a lack of scientific evidence documenting efficacy and (2) allergy management as a treatment for OME based on insufficient evidence of therapeutic efficacy or a causal relationship between allergy and OME. Last, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed. The purpose of this guideline is to inform clinicians of evidence-based methods to identify methods to identify, monitor, and manage OME in children aged 2 months through 12 years. The guideline may not apply to children older than 12 years because OME is uncommon and the natural history is likely to differ from younger children who experience rapid developmental change. The target population includes children with or without developmental disabilities or underlying conditions that predispose to OME and its sequelae. The guideline is intended for use by providers of health care to children, including primary care and specialist physicians, nurses and nurse practitioners, physician assistants, audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and child development specialists. The guideline is applicable to any setting in which children with OME would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating children with OME. Rather, it is designed to assist primary care and other clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all children with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

A systematic review found that pneumatic otoscopy had the best balance of sensitivity (94%) and specificity (80%) when compared with myringotomy as the gold standard. When pneumatic otoscopy is inconclusive, tympanometry can be used to improve diagnostic accuracy.

### Automated classification platform for the identification of otitis media using optical coherence tomography [^116C31Mk]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

To diagnose OM, physicians typically utilize a standard otoscope to visually assess the eardrum (tympanic membrane, TM). Otoscopes provide surface illumination and magnification of the TM and allow for qualitative interpretation of visual indicators related to OM infection, including the coloration and transparency of the TM and presence of middle ear fluid. Pediatricians and otolaryngologists intimately familiar with OM have an estimated diagnostic accuracy in the range of 50–70% using otoscopy, – although early career physicians remain unquantified. Given the difficulty in properly diagnosing OM, AOM is frequently misdiagnosed. To effectively treat patients diagnosed with OM, current treatment protocols attempt to provide recommended best practices for antibiotic prescription and TT surgery by integrating evidence-based medicine though a systematic review of past studies and data. Treatment protocols are designed with this uncertainty in mind, aim to reduce antibiotic over-prescription, and mitigate antibacterial resistance proliferation. Despite these efforts, treatment for AOM is one of the most common reasons for children to be prescribedand even overprescribedantibiotics, and the distribution of antibiotics remains high.

The following constitutes key background information on acute otitis media:

- Definition: AOM is defined as an infection of the middle ear space.
- Pathophysiology: AOM is mostly caused by bacteria (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis) followed by viruses.
- Disease course: The inflammatory disease due to middle ear space infection with particular involvement of the tympanic membrane results in AOM, which presents with clinical presentations of earache, otorrhea, headache, fever, general malaise, and hearing impairment. AOM is a self-limiting condition.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: AOM is not associated with an increase in mortality.

Acute otitis media (AOM) follow-up and middle ear effusion (MEE): There is little scientific evidence for a routine 10- to 14-day reevaluation visit for all children with an episode of AOM. Persistent MEE is common and can be detected by pneumatic otoscopy (with or without verification by tympanometry) after resolution of acute symptoms, with 60% to 70% of children having MEE at two weeks after successful antibiotic treatment, decreasing to 40% at 1 month and 10% to 25% at 3 months. The presence of MEE without clinical symptoms is defined as otitis media with effusion (OME), which must be differentiated clinically from AOM and requires infrequent additional monitoring but not antibiotic therapy.

American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) key points on pediatric hearing screening — applicable to children evaluated for OME — state that any parental concern about hearing loss should be taken seriously and requires an objective hearing screening of the patient. All providers of pediatric health care should be proficient with pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry; however, neither method assesses hearing. Developmental abnormalities, level of functioning, and behavioral problems may preclude accurate results on routine audiometric screening and testing, and in this situation, referral to an otolaryngologist and audiologist should be made. The results of abnormal screening should be explained carefully to parents, and the child's medical record should be flagged to facilitate tracking and follow-up. Any abnormal objective screening result requires audiology referral and definitive testing.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^11598rhu]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — otoscopic signs and diagnostic performance are characterized in a two-site Finnish study correlating tympanic membrane (TM) color, mobility, and position with the presence of middle ear effusion (MEE) obtained by tympanocentesis; 2911 children were followed from 6 months to 2.5 years of age, with 11 804 visits analyzed and MEE present in 84.9% and 81.8% of visits with acute symptoms. AOM was diagnosed if MEE was found and the child had fever, earache, irritability, ear rubbing or tugging, simultaneous other acute respiratory tract symptoms, vomiting, or diarrhea. The combination of a "cloudy", bulging TM with impaired mobility was the best predictor of AOM using the symptom-based diagnosis; impaired mobility had the highest sensitivity and specificity (approximately 95% and 85%, respectively), cloudiness had the next best combination of high sensitivity (~74%) and high specificity (~93%), and bulging had high specificity (~97%) but lower sensitivity (∼51%). A TM that was hemorrhagic, strongly red, or moderately red also correlated with the presence of AOM, whereas a TM that was only "slightly red" was not helpful diagnostically. In a small myringotomy series, 31 children (40 ears) were studied; bulging TMs had positive bacterial cultures 75% of the time, increasing to 80% if the TM was yellow, and the conclusion is that moderate to severe bulging of the TM represents the most important characteristic in the diagnosis of AOM.

Pneumatic otoscopy — practical steps emphasize creating an air-tight seal, gentle pressure changes, and mobility assessment to support otitis media with effusion diagnosis. After attaching the speculum to the otoscope, the bulb is fully squeezed and the tip tightly sealed with a finger; a speculum slightly wider than the canal is selected; before insertion the bulb is squeezed halfway (about 50% of the bulb width); the speculum is inserted deep enough for an air-tight seal but not to cause pain; and mobility is tested by very slight, gentle squeezing and releasing several times. Diagnosis of otitis media with effusion is supported when tympanic membrane movement is sluggish, dampened, or restricted, and complete absence of mobility is not required. Rationale notes that many children have negative middle ear pressure so both positive and negative pressure are needed to fully assess mobility and that without effusion the membrane moves briskly with minimal pressure, whereas with effusion motion is reduced but some motion is almost always possible.

Tympanic membrane (TM) appearance and mobility — signs associated with middle ear effusion (MEE): The normal TM is translucent, pearly gray, and has a ground-glass appearance, and specific landmarks including the short process and the manubrium of the malleus and the pars flaccida can be visualized. Inward movement of the TM on positive pressure and outward movement on negative pressure should occur; when the TM is retracted, the short process of the malleus becomes more prominent and the manubrium appears shortened. Inward motion with positive pressure may be restricted or absent but outward mobility can be seen when negative pressure is applied. If the TM does not move perceptibly with gentle positive or negative pressure, MEE is likely, and application of pressure may make an air-fluid interface behind the TM more evident, which is diagnostic of MEE.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) outcome assessment and documentation — clinicians are encouraged to document patient-centered outcomes when managing children with OME to ensure patient follow-up and assess effectiveness, and resolution can be documented by normal tympanic membrane mobility with pneumatic otoscopy or a sharp peak on tympanometry with either normal middle ear pressure (type A curve) or negative pressure (type C1 curve); for children with tympanostomy tubes, resolution can be documented by an intact and patent tube with otoscopy or a large ear canal volume with tympanometry. Improved hearing can be documented through age-appropriate comprehensive audiometry, and improved quality of life can be measured using the OM-6, which has 6 brief questions; the caregiver completes the survey at baseline and again after a minimum follow-up period of 1 month, and a change score rates clinical change as trivial, small, moderate, or large. The time interval for assessing OME outcomes is at the discretion of the clinician; for watchful waiting or surveillance, outcome assessment can take place at a follow-up visit, and for surgery it can take place at the postoperative or subsequent follow-up visit; if documentation is not possible because of loss to follow-up, this should be noted in the medical record along with attempts to contact the family.

### Otitis media [^11378QAH]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media (OM) or middle ear inflammation is a spectrum of diseases, including acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME; 'glue ear') and chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). OM is among the most common diseases in young children worldwide. Although OM may resolve spontaneously without complications, it can be associated with hearing loss and life-long sequelae. In developing countries, CSOM is a leading cause of hearing loss. OM can be of bacterial or viral origin; during 'colds', viruses can ascend through the Eustachian tube to the middle ear and pave the way for bacterial otopathogens that reside in the nasopharynx. Diagnosis depends on typical signs and symptoms, such as acute ear pain and bulging of the tympanic membrane (eardrum) for AOM and hearing loss for OME; diagnostic modalities include (pneumatic) otoscopy, tympanometry and audiometry. Symptomatic management of ear pain and fever is the mainstay of AOM treatment, reserving antibiotics for children with severe, persistent or recurrent infections. Management of OME largely consists of watchful waiting, with ventilation (tympanostomy) tubes primarily for children with chronic effusions and hearing loss, developmental delays or learning difficulties. The role of hearing aids to alleviate symptoms of hearing loss in the management of OME needs further study. Insertion of ventilation tubes and adenoidectomy are common operations for recurrent AOM to prevent recurrences, but their effectiveness is still debated. Despite reports of a decline in the incidence of OM over the past decade, attributed to the implementation of clinical guidelines that promote accurate diagnosis and judicious use of antibiotics and to pneumococcal conjugate vaccination, OM continues to be a leading cause for medical consultation, antibiotic prescription and surgery in high-income countries.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^111Upxyv]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Tympanic membrane (TM) examination — pneumatic otoscopy technique and cerumen management: Accurate diagnosis of AOM in infants and young children may be difficult; the pneumatic otoscope is the standard tool used in diagnosing otitis media (OM), and a surgical head facilitates cerumen cleaning. Cerumen may be removed by using a curette, gentle suction, or irrigation. The pneumatic otoscope should have a high light source of sufficient brightness and an air-tight seal to permit application of positive and negative pressure; in general, nondisposable specula achieve a better seal with less pain, and the speculum size should be chosen to gently seal at the outer portion of the external auditory canal. Pneumatic otoscopy permits assessment of TM contour, color, translucency, and mobility. Instruction in proper evaluation of middle ear status should begin during the first pediatric rotation and continue through postgraduate training.

### Development of an algorithm for the diagnosis of otitis media [^111mFeTC]. Academic Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The relative importance of signs and symptoms in the diagnosis of otitis media has not been adequately evaluated. This has led to a large degree of variation in the criteria used to diagnose otitis media, which has resulted in inconsistencies in clinical care and discrepant research findings.

Methods

A group of experienced otoscopists examined children presenting for primary care. We investigated the signs and symptoms that these otoscopists used to distinguish acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME), and no effusion. We used recursive partitioning to develop a diagnostic algorithm. To assess the algorithm, we validated it in an independent dataset.

Results

Bulging of the tympanic membrane (TM) was the main finding that otoscopists used to discriminate AOM from OME; information regarding the presence or absence of other signs and symptoms added little to the diagnostic process. Overall, 92% of children with AOM had a bulging TM compared with 0% of children with OME. Opacification and/or an air-fluid level was the main finding that the otoscopists used to discriminate OME from no effusion; 97% of children diagnosed with OME had an opaque TM compared with 5% of children diagnosed with no effusion. An algorithm that used bulging and opacification of the TM correctly classified 99% of ears in an independent dataset.

Conclusions

Bulging of the TM was the finding that best discriminated AOM from OME. The algorithm developed here may prove to be useful in clinical care, research, and education concerning otitis media.

A large individual patient data meta-analysis recently showed that children aged less than 2 years with bilateral, as compared with unilateral, acute otitis media (AOM) were at higher risk for persistent symptoms without antibiotic treatment. Prior studies have shown a propensity for children with bilateral AOM to be infected with bacterial pathogens, specifically Haemophilus influenzae. The objectives of this study were to further characterize risk factors for bilateral AOM and to assess the propensity for specific viral and bacterial pathogens to predispose to bilateral versus unilateral AOM.

Methods

We performed a secondary data analysis on 1216 cases of AOM diagnosed and treated at our institution: 566 subjects underwent tympanocentesis and middle ear fluid (MEF) culture. We compared subjects with bilateral and unilateral AOM for demographic characteristics, clinical findings, parent/clinician perception of AOM severity, and MEF study results for bacteria and viruses.

Results

When compared with children who have unilateral AOM, children with bilateral AOM were more likely to be younger (P < 0.001), have H. influenzae isolated from one or both MEFs (P < 0.0001), and have more severe inflammation of the tympanic membrane on otoscopic examination (P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

Compared with children who have unilateral AOM, children with bilateral AOM are more likely to have bacteria in the MEF and have more severe inflammation of the tympanic membrane. This may help explain why children with bilateral AOM are more likely to experience persistent symptoms without antibiotic treatment. Laterality of AOM should be considered when discussing treatment options with parents.

### A study of correlation between tympanic membrane perforation size with hearing loss in patients with inactive mucosal chronic otitis media [^115oFBv8]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study is directed towards establishing a correlation between the objective measurement of tympanic membrane (TM) perforation size with hearing loss in patients with inactive mucosal chronic otitis media (COM), and to compare the otoscopic findings of the TM perforation vis-a-vis the results obtained by image analysis of the endoscopic image of the perforation.

Materials and Methods

An observational, prospective and hospital based study was performed on 107 ears (78 patients) with inactive mucosal chronic otitis media. Objective measurement of the TM perforation size was done by capturing the images of the perforation on ImageJ analysis software. A correlation was established between the hearing loss and the perforation with respect to its size and location. The accuracy of the otoscopic finding of the perforation was established with respect to the endoscopic image of the perforation.

Results

The extent of the hearing loss was seen to increase with increasing size of the TM perforation (r = 0.435, p < 0.0001). Posterior perforations had a 12% greater hearing loss than anterior perforations but this was significant only at the frequency of 500Hz (p = 0.02). There was a positive correlation between the otoscopic estimation of the size of the perforation with the endoscopically obtained image.

Conclusion

Hearing loss in chronic otitis media is directly proportional to the size of the TM perforation and posteriorly based perforations have worse audiometric thresholds at lower frequencies (500Hz).

### Otoscopic and tympanometric findings in acute otitis media yielding dry tap at tympanocentesis [^11414y1T]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The value of tympanometry in detection of middle ear effusion (MEE) has been widely studied in otitis media with effusion. There has been no direct comparison of tympanometric and tympanocentesis (TAP) findings in acute otitis media (AOM). We compared otoscopic, tympanometric and TAP findings in AOM including cases of AOM without effusion.

Methods

In a study of AOM treatment of 90 children, a tympanogram was obtained, and TAP was performed before and after 5 days of treatment. Subjects were followed with otoscopy and tympanometry every 2 weeks for 3 months or until the MEE cleared.

Results

In 130 AOM ears, otoscopic, tympanometric and TAP findings were available; MEE was obtained from 110 ears. Of 20 ears with a dry tap, 18 had abnormal tympanogram and otoscopic findings. With TAP findings as the standard, sensitivity and positive predictive value of type B tympanogram were 97 and 87%, respectively. Of 18 AOM ears yielding dry tap, 2 yielded MEE 5 days later, and 8 continued with evidence of MEE 5 days-12 weeks later. Five subjects with 8 AOM ears yielding dry tap were lost to follow-up; all had short duration of clinical symptoms.

Conclusions

Although otoscopic and tympanometric findings suggested the presence of MEE in AOM, MEE was unobtainable by TAP in 14% of cases. Dry tap cases likely represent early AOM before accumulation of detectable MEE. However, technical difficulty in obtaining small amounts of or highly viscous MEE could not be excluded. Sensitivity and positive predictive value of abnormal tympanograms in detection of MEE in AOM cases are comparable with those in otitis media with effusion.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^112uYFSv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion — natural history supports observation: "OME occurring after an episode of AOM resolves in 75% to 90% of cases by the third month". Among newly diagnosed OME with a type B tympanogram, "56 will improve… by 3 months; 72 will have improved at 6 months; and 87 will no longer have a flat tracing at 12 months", whereas with chronic OME, "19 will resolve by 3 months, 25 by 6 months, 31 by 12 months, and 33… by 24 months". A type B tympanogram is "an imperfect measure of OME (81% to 94% sensitivity and 74% to 94% specificity vs myringotomy)". The guideline notes "The recommendation for a 3-month period of observation is based on a clear preponderance of benefit over harm".

### Tympanic membrane abnormalities and hearing levels at the ages of 5 and 6 years in relation to persistent otitis media and tympanostomy tube insertion in the first 3 years of life: a prospective study incorporating a randomized clinical trial [^112TvtgB]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

One current practice guideline recommends myringotomy with tympanostomy tube insertion (M&T) for young children in whom middle-ear effusion (MEE) has persisted for 3 months, and another recommends the procedure after MEE has persisted for 4 to 6 months provided that a bilateral hearing loss of ≥ 20 dB is present. Sequelae of M&T are not uncommon, but the extent to which these sequelae are attributable to M&T itself or to the middle-ear disease that prompted the procedure or to both has not been clear. Our objective in the present study was to examine the prevalence of various tympanic membrane (TM) abnormalities in otherwise healthy children at the age of 5 years and hearing levels at the age of 6 years in relation to persistent MEE and M&T in the children's first 3 years of life.

Methods

In a prospective study of child development in relation to early-life otitis media, we randomly assigned 429 children who met specified criteria regarding the persistence of MEE in their first 3 years of life to undergo M&T either promptly (the "early-treatment" group) or after a defined extended period if MEE remained present (the "late-treatment" group). We also followed a representative sample of 241 children who ranged from having no MEE to having MEE whose cumulative duration fell just short of meeting randomization criteria for the clinical trial (the "nontrial" group). Most of the children in each group underwent both otomicroscopic examination at the age of 5 years and audiometric testing at the age of 6 years, at times when they were free of MEE. Among these children, M&T had been performed in 82.3% of those in the early-treatment group, 38.1% of those in the late-treatment group, and 3.0% of those in the nontrial group.

Results

At the age of 5 years, we found 1 or more types of TM abnormality in 1 or both ears in 70.7%, 42.5%, and 9.5% of the children in the early-treatment, late-treatment, and nontrial groups, respectively. Within the 3 groups, however, among children who received tubes, the proportions who had an abnormality of some type were similar, namely, 82.6%, 80.4%, and 83.3%, respectively. The corresponding proportions among children who had not received tubes were 15.4%, 19.3%, and 7.2%, respectively. Segmental atrophy and tympanosclerosis were the most common abnormalities found. At the age of 6 years, mean pure-tone average audiometric thresholds in the early-treatment, late-treatment, and nontrial groups, respectively, were 6.18 dB, 5.49 dB, and 4.63 dB in left ears and 6.17 dB, 6.02 dB, and 4.32 dB in right ears. The thresholds in the early- and late-treatment groups did not differ significantly, but the thresholds in the early- and late-treatment groups were each significantly higher than in the nontrial group. Within the early- and late-treatment groups, we found no significant relation between hearing levels and the presence or type of TM abnormalities.

Conclusion

In otherwise healthy children who have persistent MEE during their first 3 years of life, ready resort to M&T results in far more TM abnormalities at age 5 than does selective management in which most children do not receive the procedure. With these differing approaches, however, hearing levels at age 6 do not differ. Regardless of whether children with persistent early-life MEE receive M&T, they have more TM abnormalities at age 5 and negligibly poorer hearing at age 6 than do children who had less or no otitis media. Longer term otologic and audiologic outcomes of persistent early-life MEE and of M&T remain to be determined. In view of 1) the present findings and the remaining uncertainties concerning sequelae, 2) the fact that M&T involves certain immediate risks — albeit minimal — and substantial cost, and 3) previously reported findings in the study's randomized clinical trial that show no developmental advantage at ages 3 and 4 years accruing from children's having received prompt M&T, a prolonged period of watchful waiting seems desirable in otherwise healthy children who are younger than 3 years and have persistent, asymptomatic MEE that is not complicated by sensorineural or severe conductive hearing loss, balance dysfunction, or severe TM retraction.

### Haemophilus influenzae type b as an important cause of culture-positive acute otitis media in young children in Thailand: a tympanocentesis-based, multi-center, cross-sectional study [^112gpgyV]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

During screening and enrollment, ENTs maintained a logbook to collect anonymized demographic information for subjects 3 to 59 months of age who were diagnosed with AOM to determine the representativeness of the AOM patients who were included in the study. ENTs obtained informed consent from parents/guardians of eligible children prior to performance of any study-specific procedures. Once enrolled, demographics, medical history, care history and general symptoms were collected and a clinical examination was performed; AOM was diagnosed after otoscopic examination of the tympanic membrane by the ENT and was classified according to the otoscopy score (8 grades) (OS-8), which measures the severity of tympanic-membrane inflammation. The OS-8 scale is only appropriate for use in children with an intact tympanic membrane, and therefore was not used for children with otorrhea. Spontaneous otorrhea or an OS-8 score of at least 2 was necessary for the child to meet AOM diagnosis criteria. The levels of the OS-8 scale from level 2 are as follows: 2 indicates hyperemia, air-fluid level, no opacification, meniscus noted; 3 indicates hyperemia, complete effusion, no opacification; 4 indicates hyperemia, opacification, air-fluid level observed, no bulging; 5 indicates hyperemia, complete effusion, opacification, and no bulging; 6 indicates hyperemia, bulging rounded doughnut appearance of tympanic membrane; 7 indicates hyperemia with bulla formation.

### External and middle ear diseases: radiological diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms [^114xmsfv]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Non-traumatic opacified middle ear: acute inflammation/infection

Definition

Acute middle ear infection (acute otitis media, acute otomastoiditis) usually presenting with typical clinical image and in most cases not requiring imaging.

Symptoms

These include earache, fever, pain, otorrhea, conductive hearing loss. On otoscopy tympanic membrane is red and bulging.

Both from clinical and radiological points of view, it is important to differentiate between acute otitis media and secretory otitis.

Secretory otitis means fluid in the middle ear cavity without signs or symptoms of infection; this is usually caused when the Eustachian tube patency is compromised and fluid is trapped in the middle ear. Signs and symptoms of acute otitis media occur when effusion in the middle ear becomes infected.

Need for imaging usually takes place, if standard treatment fails, and complications occur.

Such complications include acute coalescent otomastoiditis (ACOM). This is an acute infection of middle ear and mastoid air cells, with progressive resorption of mastoid septae.

Preferable imaging method

Temporal bone HRCT is the modality of choice to evaluate possible ACOM. Erosion of mastoid septations and cortex is the most sensitive and specific finding (Fig. 17). When intracranial complications are suspected, MRI is the examination of choice.

Fig. 17
Acute coalescent otomastoiditis (ACOM). Axial scan in bone window demonstrates diffuse opacification of middle ear and mastoid with destructions of mastoid septations and sigmoid plate (arrow)

Clinically relevant imaging findings

Since in severe cases ACOM may lead to severe complications, like abscess formation and sinus thrombosis, the following structures should be evaluated carefully: labyrinth, meninges, sigmoid sinus, skull base.

Differential diagnosis

This includes rhabdomyosarcoma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, acute uncomplicated otomastoiditis and acquired cholesteatoma.

Treatment options

Acute otitis media is usually treated with antibiotics, sometimes myringotomy. With complicated ACOM, surgery and mastoidectomy are usually needed.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^1126XHCh]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Table 1 — abbreviations and definitions of common terms — defines tympanostomy tube insertion, otitis media categories, and related ear findings with explicit thresholds. Tympanostomy tube insertion is surgical placement through a myringotomy for temporary middle ear ventilation, and tubes generally last several months to several years, with synonyms including ventilation tubes, pressure equalization (PE) tubes, grommets (UK), and bilateral myringotomy and tubes (BMT). Chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) is OME persisting for 3 months or longer from onset or diagnosis. Persistent acute otitis media (AOM) includes relapse of AOM within 1 month after completing antibiotics, and when 2 episodes of otitis media occur within 1 month it may be difficult to distinguish recurrence from persistence. AOM is the rapid onset of middle-ear inflammation diagnosed by a distinctly bulging tympanic membrane with a middle ear effusion; OME is fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of AOM, and middle ear effusion (MEE) refers to fluid in the middle ear often from OME and during or after AOM. Tympanostomy tube otorrhea is discharge from the middle ear through the tube, a retraction pocket is a collapsed area of the tympanic membrane with sharp demarcation, and a tympanogram is an objective measure of tympanic membrane vibration and pressure, with a flat tracing if the middle ear is filled with fluid and a peak shifted based on pressure (left if negative, right if positive).

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^112hHsa5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) population-based screening — programs that screen all children with tympanometry or related methods are targeted by this statement and are discouraged because they offer little proven benefit and "is therefore not recommended"; instead, evaluation for OME is appropriate during routine well child visits or when ear-specific symptoms exist. Among screened children 3 to 7 years of age, a type B (flat) tympanogram has a sensitivity of 65% to 92% and a specificity of 43% to 80% for associated hearing loss, and the positive predictive value for pure tone hearing loss worse than 25 to 30 dB is only 33% to 49%. Because OME is found in 15% to 40% of healthy preschool children, a screening program could send up to 40% of children for additional assessment, creating strain without proven benefit; if asymptomatic OME is identified, then the initial management is watchful waiting, not early intervention.

### Face, content, and construct validity of a virtual reality otoscopy simulator and applicability to medical training [^114EGc8v]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Otoscopy is the medical term for the visual examination of the ear canal and eardrum. Proper handling of the otoscope and a correctly performed examination are essential skills for the diagnosis and treatment of otologic diseases, which are widespread in all age groups and can significantly impair the function of this important sensory organ. Acute otitis media is the most common reason why children in the United States are prescribed antibiotics. Often a general practitioner or pediatrician is consulted for ear pain, who then has to assess the eardrum. Due to the anatomy, only part of the entire surface can be seen through the otoscope such that a systematic scanning is needed to assess the entire tympanic membrane. Although otoscopy thus represents a key competence for various medical specialties, pediatricians and general practitioners typically have a training deficit in ear assessment. In 1992, Fisher and Pfleiderer demonstrated that the otoscopic skills of general practitioners are comparable to those of fourth-year medical students. Moreover, Pichichero and Poole revealed that when assessing acute otitis media or otitis media with effusion, general practitioners and pediatricians had a diagnostic accuracy of 36% to 51%.

### Pediatric residents' clinical diagnostic accuracy of otitis media [^117StNW2]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Pediatric resident physicians' clinical diagnostic accuracy of otitis media is unknown. We attempted to correlate the clinical examination of pediatric house staff with pediatric otolaryngologists and tympanometry.

Methods

Pediatric residents evaluated patients who were scheduled in the pediatric acute care clinic and completed a provider examination form detailing their otoscopic findings, interpretation, and treatment plan. Patients were then immediately reevaluated by a pediatric otolaryngologist using an identical form. Tympanometry was also performed by a pediatric audiologist. We used kappa statistics to calculate correlation of clinical findings and interpretation.

Results

A total of 103 patients consented for the study; 70 patients were examined by 27 different pediatric residents with 43 patients (86 ears) examined by all 3 providers. Correlation of clinical findings between all pediatric residents and the pediatric otolaryngologists was a kappa statistic of 0.30 (fair agreement). The individual diagnostic finding with the greatest correlation was tympanic membrane erythema (kappa statistic: 0.40 [fair agreement]), and the worst correlate was tympanic membrane position (kappa statistic: 0.16 [slight agreement]). Resident interpretation and tympanometry yielded a kappa statistic of 0.20 (slight agreement), and the otolaryngologist interpretation and tympanometry yielded a kappa statistic of 0.32 (fair agreement).

Conclusions

Otitis media is the most common disease seen by practicing general pediatricians, but there is a paucity of formalized resident education. We demonstrated only a slight to moderate correlation between the clinical diagnostic examinations of pediatric residents and pediatric otolaryngologists and tympanometry.

### Emerging technologies for the diagnosis of otitis media [^112j3n5g]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review new experimental techniques for the diagnosis of otitis media (OM).

Data Sources

Literature search in English in the following databases: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Ovid Medline, Google Scholar, and Clinical Evidence (BMJ Publishing) between January 1, 2005, and April 30, 2018. Subsequently, articles were reviewed and included only if relevant.

Review Methods

MeSH terms: ["diagnosis"] AND [all forms of OM] AND ["human"] AND ["ear"] and ["tympanic membrane"]. The retrieved innovative diagnostic techniques rely on and take advantage of the physical properties of the tympanomastoid cavity components: tympanic membrane (TM) thickness, its translucency and compliance; middle ear fluid characteristics; biofilm presence; increased tissue metabolic activity in OM states; and fluid presence in the mastoid cavity. These parameters are taken into account to establish OM diagnosis objectively. We review spectral gradient acoustic reflectometry, digital otoscopy, TM image analysis, multicolor reflectance imaging, anticonfocal middle ear assessment, optical coherence tomography, quantitative pneumatic otoscopy, transmastoid ultrasound, wideband measurements, TM thickness mapping, shortwave infrared imaging, and wideband acoustic transfer functions.

Conclusions

New experimental techniques are gradually introduced to overcome the limitations of standard otoscopy. The aforementioned techniques are still under investigation and are pending widespread clinical use. The implementation of these techniques in the market is dependent on their success in clinical trials, as well as on their future cost.

Implication For Practice

New techniques for the diagnosis of OM can objectively evaluate the morphology of the TM, determine the presence of middle ear fluid and evaluate its content, and thus potentially replace standard otoscopy.

### Tympanometry in discrimination of otoscopic diagnoses in young ambulatory children [^116Pc6KS]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Tympanometry can indicate middle ear effusion in children referred for tympanostomy tube placement. In outpatient setting, objective adjunctive tools are needed to diagnose the otitis media spectrum.

Methods

We enrolled and followed 515 children aged 6–35 months at primary care level. We compared tympanometry with pneumatic otoscopy and evaluated the proportions of type A, C1, C2, Cs and B tympanograms in relation to specific otoscopic diagnoses in 2206 and 1006 examinations at symptomatic and asymptomatic visits, respectively.

Results

At symptomatic visits, different peaked tympanograms were associated with a healthy middle ear as follows: type A in 78%, type C1 in 62%, type C2 in 54% and type Cs in 18% of examinations. In contrast, any peaked tympanogram was related to healthy middle ear in 67% of examinations. Flat (type B) tympanogram was related to otitis media with effusion in 44% and to acute otitis media in 56% of examinations, respectively. At asymptomatic visits, the peaked tympanograms together were associated with a healthy middle ear in 87% of otoscopic examinations. Flat tympanogram indicated otitis media with effusion as well in 87% of examinations.

Conclusions

Tympanometry is not a useful tool in detecting specific otoscopic diagnoses because it cannot distinguish between otitis media with effusion and acute otitis media. However, among outpatients all peaked tympanograms suggest a healthy middle ear and a flat tympanogram is useful in detecting any middle ear effusion. Thus, tympanometry can be used as an adjunctive tool, but accurate diagnosis requires careful pneumatic otoscopy.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^116j5aXh]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — epidemiology and natural history indicates that OME occurs most often between the ages of 6 months and 4 years, with high prevalence in early childhood and meaningful persistence and sequelae. In the first year of life, > 50% of children will experience OME, increasing to > 60% by age 2 years, and when children aged 5 to 6 years are screened, about 1 in 8 have fluid in one or both ears; in children with Down syndrome or cleft palate, prevalence ranges from 60% to 85%. Most episodes resolve within 3 months, but about 30% to 40% of children have repeated episodes and 5% to 10% of episodes last ≥ 1 year; at least 25% persist for ≥ 3 months and may be associated with hearing loss, balance problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, ear discomfort, recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), or reduced quality of life, and persistent fluid decreases tympanic membrane mobility and sound conduction with rare structural damage requiring surgery.

### Long-term tympanic membrane pathology dynamics and spontaneous healing in chronic suppurative otitis media [^116mFQG9]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Children in the developing parts of the world have a high prevalence of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). It is estimated that 65 to 330 million people worldwide have CSOM, yet very little is known about the natural course of the disease. The Inuit population of the Arctic regions is among those with the highest prevalences of CSOM. The aim of this study was to examine the long-term tympanic membrane changes since childhood among Inuit adolescents in Greenland and estimate the proportion of individuals affected by CSOM.

Methods

Follow-up study (2009) on a population-based cohort of 591 children originally examined during 1993 to 1994 at 3 to 8 years of age. Follow-up was attempted among 348 individuals still living in the areas. Video otoscopy and tympanometry were used. Data on otologic disease, ear surgery, and antibiotic use for otitis media were collected from medical records.

Results

Of 226 participants (65% of those contacted; median age, 22 years), 28 (12%) had present CSOM or had been surgically treated. Eleven were new cases of CSOM not seen between 1993 and 1994. Of those with CSOM in the initial study, 39% had healed spontaneously. The proportion of spontaneous healing was not influenced by the age at which CSOM was diagnosed in the initial study. Thirty-nine individuals (17%) had CSOM in either the initial study or at follow-up. Of these, 2 had never received antibiotic treatment for otitis media, and 15 had been treated less than 3 times. Eighty individuals (35%) at follow-up had CSOM, had undergone ear surgery, or had sequelae in the form of circular atrophy or myringosclerosis.

Conclusions

The proportion of spontaneous healing and the findings of new cases show that CSOM is a dynamic disease both on the individual as well as on the population level. Every third participant at follow-up had a perforation or sequelae from recurrent or long-lasting perforations, indicating a burden of disease from otitis media larger than what can be estimated in cross-sectional studies. There is a potential for increased treatment of otitis media in this population, which requires raised awareness of the disease in the population and the creation of guidelines customized to conditions in Greenland.

### Development and validation of an automated classifier to diagnose acute otitis media in children [^113XpPtx]. JAMA Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a frequently diagnosed illness in children, yet the accuracy of diagnosis has been consistently low. Multiple neural networks have been developed to recognize the presence of AOM with limited clinical application.

Objective

To develop and internally validate an artificial intelligence decision-support tool to interpret videos of the tympanic membrane and enhance accuracy in the diagnosis of AOM.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This diagnostic study analyzed otoscopic videos of the tympanic membrane captured using a smartphone during outpatient clinic visits at 2 sites in Pennsylvania between 2018 and 2023. Eligible participants included children who presented for sick visits or wellness visits.

Exposure

Otoscopic examination.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Using the otoscopic videos that were annotated by validated otoscopists, a deep residual-recurrent neural network was trained to predict both features of the tympanic membrane and the diagnosis of AOM vs no AOM. The accuracy of this network was compared with a second network trained using a decision tree approach. A noise quality filter was also trained to prompt users that the video segment acquired may not be adequate for diagnostic purposes.

Results

Using 1151 videos from 635 children (majority younger than 3 years of age), the deep residual-recurrent neural network had almost identical diagnostic accuracy as the decision tree network. The finalized deep residual-recurrent neural network algorithm classified tympanic membrane videos into AOM vs no AOM categories with a sensitivity of 93.8% (95% CI, 92.6%-95.0%) and specificity of 93.5% (95% CI, 92.8%-94.3%) and the decision tree model had a sensitivity of 93.7% (95% CI, 92.4%-94.9%) and specificity of 93.3% (92.5%-94.1%). Of the tympanic membrane features outputted, bulging of the TM most closely aligned with the predicted diagnosis; bulging was present in 230 of 230 cases (100%) in which the diagnosis was predicted to be AOM in the test set.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that given its high accuracy, the algorithm and medical-grade application that facilitates image acquisition and quality filtering could reasonably be used in primary care or acute care settings to aid with automated diagnosis of AOM and decisions regarding treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^116An3Mm]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Tympanometry — procedure and interpretation include how the test records middle ear function and recognized tracing types. Tympanometry provides an objective assessment of tympanic membrane mobility, eustachian tube function, and middle ear function by measuring the amount of sound energy reflected back when a small probe is placed in the ear canal, and a tympanogram is a graph of energy admitted to the tympanic membrane and middle ear as air pressure in the ear canal is varied from negative to positive and recorded graphically. Tympanometric tracings are classified into 3 main types, including type A with low probability of effusion, and a normal, type A Tympanogram has a height that varies but is normal within the 2 stacked rectangles; Ad indicates an abnormally flexible tympanic membrane, As indicates an abnormally stiff tympanic membrane, and a well-defined peak makes the likelihood of effusion low.

### The diagnosis and management of acute otitis media [^1122T38W]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis media (AOM) — watchful waiting versus immediate antibiotics (random assignment): In a trial of 233 patients randomly assigned to immediate antibiotics (amoxicillin, 90 mg/kg/day) or watchful waiting, inclusion required symptoms of ear infection, otoscopic evidence of AOM, and nonsevere AOM defined by a 3-item symptom score (OM-3) and an 8-item tympanic membrane appearance scale (OS-8). In the watchful waiting group, 66% of children completed the study without antibiotics, and there was no difference in parent satisfaction scores at day 12. Immediate antibiotics resolved symptoms faster than watchful waiting (P = .004), with a greater difference in children younger than 2 years (P = .008), and otoscopic and tympanogram scores were lower with antibiotics (P = .02 for otoscopic score, P = .004 for tympanogram). Failure and recurrence at 12 days were lower with antibiotics (5%) than with watchful waiting (21%), but by day 30 there was no difference (23% and 24%, respectively). Immediate antibiotics eradicated S pneumoniae carriage in the majority, but antibiotic-group day 12 isolates were more likely to be multidrug resistant than those from watchful waiting.

### Diagnostic accuracy, tympanocentesis training performance, and antibiotic selection by pediatric residents in management of otitis media [^113nm1yH]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the accuracy of pediatric residents in recognizing the physical examination findings of acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME), technical competence to perform tympanocentesis, and knowledge of guideline-recommended antibiotic management of AOM.

Methods

A total of 383 pediatric residents from various programs in the United States viewed 9 different video-recorded pneumatic otoscopic examinations of tympanic membranes during a continuing medical education course. The ability to differentiate AOM, OME, and normal was ascertained. A mannequin of a child was used to assess technical proficiency of performing tympanocentesis on artificial tympanic membranes. A series of questions was posed regarding appropriate, pathogen-directed, second-line antibiotic selection for AOM.

Results

The average ± standard deviation correct diagnosis on the otoscopic video examination was 41% ± 16% (range: 19%-70%; median: 38%) by pediatric residents, tympanocentesis was optimally performed by 89%, and appropriate antibiotic therapy for drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae was selected by 78% and appropriate therapy for beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae was selected by 74%.

Conclusions

According to this video-based examination, pediatric residents misdiagnose OME frequently. Pediatric residents have the skills to be trained to perform tympanocentesis. Approximately 75% of pediatric residents have knowledge of the appropriate antibiotics to select for treatment of resistant AOM pathogens. Interactive instruction with simulation technology may enhance skills and lead to improved diagnostic accuracy and treatment paradigms.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^115ZgPQQ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

At-risk populations and examination in cerumen impaction emphasize assessing patients who cannot identify or express symptoms; at-risk groups include elderly adults with concerns of dementia, developmentally delayed or nonverbal patients with behavioral changes, and young children with fevers, parental concerns, or speech delay, and the presence of cerumen in these patients can be considered impacted and removed. Physical examination of the external canal can be performed with a handheld speculum, an otoscope, or a binocular microscope, and cerumen may impair visualization of the tympanic membrane and assessment of the middle ear. In a pediatric cohort ranging in age from 2 to 60 months, cerumen was removed in 89 (29%) of 279 children subsequently diagnosed with acute otitis media, supporting that cerumen can inhibit or prevent diagnosis of middle ear disease.

### Clinical spectrum of acute otitis media complicating upper respiratory tract viral infection [^115Uyxw8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

acute otitis media (AOM) often occurs as a complication of upper respiratory tract infection (URI).

Objective

to describe otoscopic findings during URI, the full clinical spectrum of AOM, and outcome of cases managed with watchful waiting.

Methods

In a prospective study of 294 healthy children (6 months-3 years), characteristics of AOM complicating URI were studied. Otoscopic findings were categorized by tympanic membrane (TM) position, color, translucency, and mobility. Otoscopic score was assigned based on McCormick otoscopy scale (OS)-8 scale.

Results

during days 1 to 7 of URI, otoscopic findings at 1114 visits were consistent with AOM in 22%; myringitis (inflamed TM, no fluid) was diagnosed in 7%. In AOM episodes diagnosed within 28 days of URI onset, TM position was described as: nonbulging (19%), mild bulging (45%), bulging (29%), and TM perforation occurred in (6%). OS-8 scale showed mild TM inflammation (OS, 2–3) in 6%, moderate (OS, 4–5) in 59%, and severe (OS, 6–8) in 35%. In 54% of 126 bilateral AOM episodes, inflammation of both TMs was at different stages. Of 28 cases of nonsevere AOM managed with watchful waiting, 4 progressed and 3 later required an antibiotic.

Conclusions

AOM is a spectrum of infection that may present at various stages, even in the same child with bilateral disease. During URI, otoscopic changes are observed from the first day of onset. Understanding the wide clinical spectrum of AOM is needed to help with future clinical trial design and development of a scoring system to establish treatment criteria that will minimize antibiotic use.

### Diagnostic inaccuracy and subject exclusions render placebo and observational studies of acute otitis media inconclusive [^117T169X]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnostic accuracy and appropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria representative of children at greatest risk is of paramount importance in trials to evaluate placebo or observation as an option for acute otitis media (AOM) management.

Methods

Twelve observational studies spanning the time frame 1958–2005 and 13 natural history studies spanning the time frame 1968–2006 were evaluated for the diagnostic criteria, inclusion criteria, and exclusion criteria applied within the study design.

Results

Although a bulging or full tympanic membrane (TM) with effusion is the best indication of a diagnosis of bacterial AOM based on tympanocentesis findings, few observational and natural history studies required a bulging TM. Examination of subject inclusion criteria showed that many subjects did not have AOM but rather had no middle ear disease at all or they had otitis media with effusion. Exclusion criteria of subjects were also remarkable. Frequently children < 2 years old were excluded; mean age among the studies reflected an older age group, unlike the true epidemiology of AOM. Otitis prone children, those with severe disease, with a bulging TM, with fever, with a definite need for antibiotics, with recent antibiotic treatment, with recent AOM, or with perforation of the TM were often excluded.

Conclusions

Guidelines and some authorities have overlooked or discounted the importance of the issues of inaccurate diagnosis on study entry, broad inclusion criteria, and the creation of bias in exclusion criteria among placebo/natural history trials in AOM. The current data favoring observation of children with AOM should be reconsidered until better studies are conducted.

### Etiology of acute otitis media in children less than 5 years of age: a pooled analysis of 10 similarly designed observational studies [^112KmQyh]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

METHODS

Study Design

This pooled analysis included 10 observational studies with similar protocols (eg, same case definitions, same age grouping, similar sample handling and laboratory procedures and identical plans for data collection to limit heterogeneity between studies). However, some modification was allowed to account for potential differences in local acceptability of performing tympanocentesis in different AOM subpopulations. These studies were conducted between 2007 and 2011 in children of 3–59 months of age. In each study, inclusion criteria required a bulging, diffused or localized inflamed tympanic membrane or spontaneous otorrhea of < 24 hours since symptom onset, accompanied by one of the functional or general signs of otalgia/irritability, conjunctivitis or fever. The history of AOM cases enrolled, either sporadic or recurrent, could vary by country, depending on local clinical practice for management and treatment of disease. Middle ear fluid (MEF) samples were collected before antibiotic receipt at that visit by tympanocentesis or careful sampling of spontaneous otorrhea. Children receiving antibiotics before enrollment in the 72 hours before the visit as (1) systemic therapy for other conditions or (2) prophylactically for recurrent AOM were excluded, but AOM treatment failures were included. Further details about inclusion/exclusion criteria have been published previously. –

At the time of enrollment, a clinical examination was performed and medical history and general symptoms were collected by questionnaire. Severity of tympanic membrane inflammation was classified using the otoscopy scale-8 (described previously –). An episode of AOM was classified as new if there was a ≥ 30-day AOM symptom-free period before onset. AOM cases were classified as treatment failures if symptoms persisted despite initiation of physician-prescribed antibiotics in the 48–72 hours before study enrollment. Recurrent AOM was defined as a reported history of ≥ 3 episodes within the past 6 months or ≥ 4 episodes within the past 12 months. A child was classified as vaccinated if he/she received ≥ 2 PCV doses before age 1 year or ≥ 1 PCV dose after age 1 year. Cases were classified as severe if a child had ear pain or an axillary temperature ≥ 38.5°C and/or if his/her tympanic membranes were scored as OS-6 (indicative of hyperemia — bulging rounded doughnut appearance of tympanic membrane) or OS-7 (indicative of hyperemia with bulla formation).

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^1131Dqsw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guideline — otitis media with effusion (OME) key action statements specify that clinicians should obtain an age-appropriate hearing test if OME persists for 3 months or longer OR for OME of any duration in an at-risk child; should counsel families of children with bilateral OME and documented hearing loss about the potential impact on speech and language development; should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected; should recommend tympanostomy tubes when surgery is performed for OME in a child < 4 years old and state that adenoidectomy should not be performed unless a distinct indication exists (nasal obstruction, chronic adenoiditis); should recommend tympanostomy tubes, adenoidectomy, or both when surgery is performed for OME in a child ≥ 4 years old; and should document resolution of OME, improved hearing, or improved quality of life when managing a child with OME.

### Tuberculous otitis in infants: temporal bone histopathology and clinical extrapolation [^11569v23]. Otology & Neurotology (2006). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

The study of infant temporal bones with tuberculosis (TB) of the middle ear and mastoid could provide information to assist with clinical diagnosis in this population.

Background

The TB pandemic has become a critical global public health problem. With the rising incidence of the disease, otolaryngologists might encounter an increased frequency of otologic TB. Pediatric temporal bone reports of TB are rare.

Methods

Light microscopic examination was performed on both temporal bones from an infant who died as a result of miliary TB.

Results

The tympanic membranes were thickened with dilated blood vessels, yet were intact without perforations. Purulence, granulation tissue, and classic tubercles were observed in the middle ears and mastoids. Serous labyrinthitis and inflammatory cells surrounding the Cranial Nerve VIII in the internal auditory canal were observed in the inner ear.

Conclusions

The histological findings suggest that a clinical presentation of infantile tuberculous otitis media and mastoiditis could be a patient with otoscopic findings consistent with common otitis media with an intact tympanic membrane, likely in conjunction with inner ear symptoms. Lacking the classic finding of multiple tympanic membrane perforations, tuberculous otitis might be underappreciated in this population.

### Fibrosis within the tympanic membrane [^112iKLKw]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

A primary mass lesion arising from the tympanic membrane is extremely rare. The authors report a patient of extensive fibrosis within the tympanic membrane in a 65-year-old woman who did not have a history of ear infection. The patient complained of slow progressing hearing loss on the left side without otorrhea or otalgia. Otoscopic examination showed a thick tympanic membrane with whitish mass-like bulge, and pure-tone audiometry revealed conductive hearing loss. The lesion was totally resected, and final findings of a histopathologic examination revealed extensive fibrosis with subsiding inflammation within the tympanic membrane. Fibrosis within the tympanic membrane may present with slow progressing conductive hearing loss and should be considered a possible differential diagnosis of mass lesions in the tympanic membrane.

### The variable clinical presentation of tuberculosis otitis media and the importance of early detection [^117VCA16]. Otology & Neurotology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis (TB) is a rare cause of otitis media. This study aims to increase awareness on the clinical presentation of TB otitis media and illustrate how early detection affects treatment outcome.

Methods

Chart review of 12 patients (13 ears) from a tertiary hospital in Manila, Philippines, seen from 2004 to 2009. Clinical predictors of the disease were summarized. Clinical, radiologic, and audiometric outcomes after treatment were compared between treatment groups.

Results

The 5 otoscopic presentations were multiple perforations, single perforation with refractory otorrhea and exuberant granulation tissue formation, single perforation with minimal otorrhea and no granulation tissue formation, intact tympanic membrane with middle ear effusion, and intact tympanic membrane with tumorlike tissue in the middle ear. Clinical predictors of the disease were history of pulmonary TB, work-related contamination of the infection, positive purified protein derivative test, positive chest radiographic finding and intraoperative granulation tissue with cheesy material, and temporal bone computed tomographic scan findings. Patients who had no middle ear surgery showed significantly better clinical, radiologic, and audiometric outcomes than those who were diagnosed late and had more complicated surgical procedure.

Conclusion

The clinical presentation of TB otitis media is variable. Early detection of the early forms entail less surgical intervention and favors better treatment results.

### Otitis media with effusion in children aged 2–12 years attending the paediatric clinic at mulago national referral hospital, a Ugandan tertiary hospital: a cross-sectional study [^115fNHJ1]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design, setting, and population

This was a prospective cross-sectional study carried out among children aged 2 to 12 years, attending the Paediatric Clinic at the Mulago National Referral Hospital, Kampala, Uganda from February 2019 to April 2019. The inclusion criteria were all children aged 2–12 years, attending the Paediatric clinic at MNRH, all children whose parents or guardians consented, and all children with ages more than 8 years who assented to the study. The exclusion criteria were children with chronic ear infections, perforation of the tympanic membrane; children who were sick and needed to be admitted, and uncooperative children.

Study procedure

Recruitment of participants was done at the Paediatric Clinic, Mulago National Referral Hospital. Consecutive sampling was used on those who satisfy the eligibility criteria until the sample size was achieved. The research assistants and/or the principal investigator comprehensively explained to the parents or caretakers of the selected participants the purpose of the study, benefits, and risks and thereafter requested their participation. The eligible patients who agreed to participate signed a consent/assent form by writing their names and signature and subsequently were assigned a student number. Participants were then interviewed after seeing the Paediatrician or Clinician. They were examined and underwent otoscopy and tympanometry by the PI assisted by an Audiologist and the Pediatrician in the consultation room of the Pediatric Clinic. The diagnosis of OME was confirmed following the otoscopy findings (dull, retracted eardrum, presence of an air bubble or air-fluid level) and tympanometry findings (tympanogram type B).

We do not currently have at the Paediatric Clinic facilities to provide behavioral hearing testing in children, such as play audiometry and visual reinforcement audiometry, ABR, so our hearing assessment is limited to otoscopy and tympanometry.

Otological exam

Otoscopy was performed by the PI using a Welch-Allyn otoscope. This included the status of the tympanic membrane, normal, dull, retracted, presence of an air bubble or air-fluid level, absence or presence of perforation with or without pus discharge. The children who didn't have wax, tympanic membrane perforation, or ear discharge, were sent to the next test which was the tympanometry. Participants with impacted wax were advised to use a cerumen softener for three days. After the use of the softener, the ear syringing was carried out, then followed by an audiological assessment.

### When is fluid in the mastoid cells a worrisome finding? [^113x9LbA]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Mastoiditis is a common clinical entity that is technically present in all cases of otitis media; only a minority of cases actually represents the otolaryngologic emergency of acute coalescent mastoiditis. When reviewing an image with a radiologic diagnosis of mastoiditis, looking for key signs such as destruction of bony septa and considering patient presentation can help distinguish mild mastoiditis from acute coalescent mastoiditis.

Chronic otorrhoea from a tympanic membrane perforation is common. We present the case of a patient who had already received seemingly adequate treatment for his condition in the past. Yet, he presented to our outpatient clinic with worsening otalgia and otorrhoea, progressive hearing loss and a new tympanic membrane perforation. After a thorough otological evaluation, the patient's medical history and the histological specimen from a previous operation were reviewed. The findings met the diagnostic criteria of eosinophilic otitis media. After treatment with topic triamcinolone through the perforated tympanic membrane, the patient's otalgia subsided, hearing levels were improved and the size of the tympanic membrane perforation decreased.

### Rare case of ballooning herniation of the tympanic membrane [^113MCNcY]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 30-year-old otherwise healthy Swiss Military Officer presented to his local otolaryngologist for an episode of otitis media with effusion on the right side. The water sports enthusiast priorly had a 10 -year history of recurrent episodes of acute otitis media on the affected side. These were often accompanied with perforation of the tympanic membrane and otorrhea but showed spontaneous remission each time. The patient had been treated with antibiotics three times during the last 12 months and reported about hearing loss and a nonpulsatile permanent tinnitus (murmur) on the right side at presentation. He claimed intermittent slight otalgia but denied otorrhea or vertigo. Habitual Valsalva manoeuvres helped to improve the hearing ability.

Once again, the effusion resolved spontaneously after conservative treatment, but on the next presentation, 2 months later, the local otolaryngologist noticed a mass of unclear origin within the proximal external auditory canal. The formation persisted during two subsequent examinations in the following month. A needle aspiration revealed no substance, and the patient was referred to our clinic for further evaluation.

### Acute otitis media: part I. improving diagnostic accuracy… [^114tb56W]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

The classic findings of acute otitis media, such as fever and earache, are sometimes absent even in cases confirmed by tympanocentesis. A bulging, red, immobile tympanic membrane is highly associated with acute otitis media. However, many physicians rely on redness of the eardrum as the main diagnostic clue. As with symptoms in acute otitis media, the findings on physical examination also lack reliability. In a study of pneumatic otoscopic findings in 85 infants and children, 8 a poorly mobile, bulging, yellow and opacified tympanic membrane was the otoscopic finding that was most predictive of acute otitis media, but this appearance was noted in only 19 percent of the patients. The color of the tympanic membrane did not correlate at all with the presence or absence of a pathogen isolated from the middle ear exudate.

One analysis demonstrated that a bulging, opaque, immobile tympanic membrane had a 99 percent predictive value for acute otitis media compared with the findings at tympanocentesis. 9 The presence of a normal or retracted position of the tympanic membrane, with slightly impaired or normal mobility, was unlikely to be associated with acute otitis media unless the fluid behind the membrane was cloudy. A slightly red tympanic membrane with a normal position and normal mobility had a predictive value of only 7 percent for acute otitis media. Four characteristics of the tympanic membrane — position, mobility, color and degree of translucency — should be evaluated and described in every examination. The normal tympanic membrane is in the neutral position, pearly gray, translucent and responding briskly to positive and negative pressure, indicating an air-filled space.

An abnormal tympanic membrane may be retracted or bulging and immobile or poorly mobile to positive or negative air pressure. The position of the tympanic membrane is a key for differentiating acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion. In acute otitis media, the tympanic membrane is usually bulging. In otitis media with effusion, it is typically retracted or in the neutral position. The tympanic membrane can be thickened in both acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion, thereby reducing visibility through it. A yellow or grayish middle ear effusion can be seen behind the tympanic membrane in either condition.

### Tympanometry… [^11599XCx]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Otitis media with effusion is defined as fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of ear infection. 6 Using pneumatic otoscopy with tympanometry improves the accuracy of diagnosis because many abnormalities of the eardrum and ear canal that might cause an abnormal tracing can be visualized. Determining the presence of obstructing cerumen in the canal, perforation or ventilation tubes in the tympanic membrane, and characteristics of the tympanic membrane are helpful in correlating tympanometry findings with clinical disease. 8, 11, 12 When comparing either test alone, pneumatic otoscopy has a better sensitivity and specificity than tympanometry for the diagnosis of OME. 1 The two tests can be complementary, because pneumatic otoscopy provides a qualitative measure of tympanic membrane mobility and tympanometry produces more quantitative information. 11, 13. 14 The AAP/AAFP/AHRQ guidelines for AOM require the documentation of middle ear effusion for the diagnosis of AOM by tympanometry, pneumatic otoscopy, acoustic reflectometry, tympanocentesis, or the visualization of fluid in the external ear canal with tympanic membrane perforation. 2 However, for OME and AOM, pneumatic otoscopy is recommended as the primary tool for diagnosis of middle ear effusion. This is referred to as a type A tracing. In this figure, the ear canal volume is normal. Figure 1 also has a curve that demonstrates a high peak height, labeled as type A D. High static admittance can result from an overly mobile tympanic membrane caused by disarticulation with the bony structures of the middle ear, or a tympanic membrane that has healed over a perforation but is thinner and more compliant than expected.

Figure 2E demonstrates a highly negative pressure in the middle ear, correlating to a retracted tympanic membrane. A viral upper respiratory infection may impair the ventilatory function of the eustachian tube. Negative middle ear pressure develops and nasopharyngeal contents are aspirated into the middle ear, resulting in AOM. Final Comments The tympanometer is a useful, affordable diagnostic tool for the family physician.
