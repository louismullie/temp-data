## Question

can micro botox cause facial assymetry?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether micro‑botox can cause facial asymmetry and, if so, how and why that happens. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what micro‑botox actually entails in terms of dose, dilution, and injection plane. Then, I should verify the mechanism by which asymmetry could occur despite low unit doses. Next, I will review direct evidence for asymmetry after micro‑botox. After that, I should examine indirect evidence from conventional botulinum toxin studies and consensus statements. Then, I will consider patient‑specific and technique‑related risk factors. Finally, I will synthesize a risk‑mitigation approach and state a clear conclusion with practical guidance.

> Let me first confirm the treatment construct. Micro‑botox refers to multiple intradermal microdroplets of diluted onabotulinumtoxinA targeting superficial muscle fibers and adnexal structures to improve skin texture, oiliness, and fine lines, with typical total hemifacial doses around 39 units and delivery via 30–32 gauge needles creating small wheals spaced about 1 cm apart, which is a different pharmacokinetic and anatomic strategy than conventional intramuscular injections [^114CZKDg] [^1135JZwC].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism that could still produce asymmetry despite low unit doses. Even at low concentrations, botulinum toxin diffuses in three dimensions, and if microdroplets are placed too deep or in excessive volume, the field of effect can extend beyond the intended superficial plane and weaken underlying muscles, leading to asymmetric movement or resting position. Diffusion up to approximately 3 cm has been demonstrated, reinforcing the need for precise depth and conservative volumes [^113UQAqc] [^1132nvx6] [^117DHNXf].

> I should double‑check direct evidence. A systematic review of micro‑botox for a "face‑lifting" effect explicitly reported facial asymmetry as a common complication, alongside minor bruising, indicating that asymmetry is a recognized adverse outcome even with microdroplet techniques. This aligns with the mechanistic concern that unintended deeper diffusion or uneven distribution can create asymmetric weakness [^114CZKDg].

> Next, I should review indirect but corroborating data from conventional botulinum toxin studies. Systematic reviews and meta‑analyses of cosmetic BoNT‑A injections document asymmetric or unsatisfactory results as a complication category, with asymmetry reported in a small but real proportion of sessions. Consensus statements likewise warn that facial asymmetry can occur if injections are administered unequally between sides or if diffusion affects adjacent muscles, which is directly applicable to micro‑botox if technique is imprecise [^113m9MYS] [^115WoXAK] [^1115x9ds].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without considering risk modifiers. Pre‑existing facial asymmetry, altered anatomy from prior surgery, and neuromuscular disorders increase susceptibility to asymmetric outcomes. The FDA labeling for incobotulinumtoxinA explicitly advises caution in patients with marked facial asymmetry or altered anatomy, and this principle generalizes across BoNT‑A products and techniques, including micro‑botox [^112EHdA7] [^116iTBj2].

> I need to ensure I account for technique‑specific contributors. Uneven dosing between hemifaces, variability in injection depth, and inconsistent spacing or volume per point can all create asymmetric weakening; consensus guidance emphasizes meticulous attention to symmetry during planning and execution, and the micro‑botox literature itself highlights heterogeneity in injection sites and methods that could predispose to uneven effects if not standardized [^1115x9ds] [^114CZKDg].

> Let me consider mitigation strategies. To minimize asymmetry risk with micro‑botox, I should confirm strict intradermal placement with superficial wheals, use conservative volumes per point, maintain symmetric dosing and distribution, and individualize based on baseline asymmetry. If asymmetry emerges, small targeted adjustments or contralateral balancing can correct it, and any unintended weakness typically resolves as the toxin effect wanes over 3–4 months, consistent with the known duration of BoNT‑A effects in facial aesthetics [^113UQAqc] [^1112XU7x] [^114fwbQ5].

> But wait, what if the asymmetry is functional rather than purely aesthetic. I should confirm that diffusion‑related effects can alter oral competence or smile dynamics, particularly in the perioral region; expert technique reviews caution that improper depth or lateral spread around the mouth can cause oral incompetence or a drooping mouth, underscoring the importance of respecting anatomic danger zones even when using microdroplet approaches [^115kf89m].

> Synthesis and conclusion: Yes, micro‑botox can cause facial asymmetry, primarily via diffusion of toxin to underlying muscles when injections are too deep or volumes are excessive, or from uneven dosing or placement between sides. The risk is real but preventable with precise intradermal technique, conservative volumes, symmetric dosing, and careful patient selection, and any asymmetry that occurs is usually transient and correctable as the effect resolves [^114CZKDg] [^113UQAqc] [^1115x9ds].

---

Yes, micro Botox can cause **facial asymmetry** [^114CZKDg] if there is uneven dosing, asymmetrical injection technique, or unintended diffusion to adjacent muscles [^114fwbQ5]. Asymmetry is typically **transient and resolves within 3–4 months** as the effect wanes [^114fwbQ5]. Risk is minimized by using experienced injectors, precise dosing, and careful technique [^115yyZtD]; if asymmetry occurs, it can often be corrected with small touch-up injections [^114fwbQ5].

---

## Mechanisms of asymmetry with micro Botox

Facial asymmetry from micro Botox arises from **several mechanisms**:

- **Uneven dosing**: Slight differences in units per side can cause asymmetric muscle relaxation [^114fwbQ5].

- **Asymmetrical injection technique**: Variability in depth, angle, or placement can produce uneven effects [^1132nvx6].

- **Unintended diffusion**: Toxin spread to nearby muscles can cause unintended weakness or ptosis [^1132nvx6].

- **Pre-existing asymmetry**: Underlying facial asymmetry can be accentuated by Botox [^notfound].

---

## Incidence and clinical evidence

Although micro Botox is designed to minimize asymmetry, it can still occur. A systematic review of micro Botox for facial rejuvenation reported that **facial asymmetry was a common complication**, albeit typically minor and transient [^114CZKDg]. Additionally, broader cosmetic Botox literature documents asymmetry as a recognized adverse event, particularly in the lower face, where muscle interactions are more complex [^113m9MYS] [^115H1SP9].

---

## Clinical outcomes and duration of asymmetry

When asymmetry occurs after micro Botox, it is **generally mild and self-limited**, resolving within 3–4 months as the toxin's effect wears off [^1112XU7x]. Persistent asymmetry beyond this period is uncommon and may reflect underlying anatomical asymmetry or repeated uneven dosing.

---

## Factors influencing risk of asymmetry

Several factors influence the **risk of asymmetry** with micro Botox:

| **Factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Injector experience | Less experienced injectors have higher asymmetry rates [^notfound] |
| Injection technique | Uneven depth, angle, or placement increases risk [^1132nvx6] |
| Dose and dilution | Higher volumes or doses increase diffusion and asymmetry risk [^113UQAqc] |
| Patient-specific anatomy | Pre-existing asymmetry or muscle imbalance increases risk [^112EHdA7] |

---

## Preventive measures and corrective strategies

To minimize asymmetry risk, clinicians should:

- **Use experienced injectors**: Skilled practitioners reduce asymmetry risk [^114fwbQ5].

- **Employ precise dosing**: Careful, symmetrical dosing is essential [^1115x9ds].

- **Apply careful technique**: Consistent depth, angle, and placement are critical [^1132nvx6].

- **Assess pre-existing asymmetry**: Identify and adjust for underlying asymmetry [^112EHdA7].

If asymmetry occurs, **corrective strategies** include small touch-up injections to balance muscle activity [^114fwbQ5].

---

## Patient-reported outcomes and satisfaction

Despite the potential for asymmetry, patient satisfaction with micro Botox remains high, with many reporting subtle, natural-looking improvements in skin texture and fine lines. Asymmetry, when it occurs, is **usually minor and acceptable to patients**, particularly when they are informed about this potential risk beforehand.

---

## Long-term effects and recurrence

There is **no evidence of long-term or permanent asymmetry** from micro Botox; any asymmetry typically resolves with the toxin's effect, and repeated treatments do not increase the risk of persistent asymmetry if proper technique and dosing are maintained.

---

Micro Botox can cause **transient facial asymmetry** due to uneven dosing, technique, or diffusion, but this is usually mild and resolves within months. Risk is minimized by experienced injectors, precise dosing, and careful technique; asymmetry can often be corrected with touch-up injections [^114CZKDg].

### Effects of 2 botulinum toxin type A products… [^117DHNXf]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcomes and Measures Horizontal and vertical diameter and area of the fields of anhidrotic effect, the amplitude of evoked compound muscle action potentials, and the 4-point validated Wrinkle Severity Scale were assessed at 28 days. Results. The horizontal and vertical diameters of the fields of effect and the areas were significantly larger for onabotulinumtoxinA than those obtained for abobotulinumtoxinA. There were no significant differences between the products in the Wrinkle Severity Scale scores and Evoked Compound Muscle Action Potentials. OnabotulinumtoxinA had significantly more diffusion than abobotulinumtoxinA when isovolumetric injections of the same labeled unit dose of the products were injected. Photographic assessments included a standard set of 3 photographs of the forehead muscles: at rest and at maximum activity of the frontalis muscle and when the Minor test was performed.

The horizontal and vertical diameters of the FAE were quantified using commercial software and are expressed in centimeters. The area of the FAE was calculated using the same software and was performed considering the perimeter of the FAEs, assuming that they were not perfect circles. Considering the results of a previous study, 3 which found a difference of 0. 30 cm for the horizontal diameter and of
0. 58 cm2 for the area of the FAE, and defining a power of 80% and an α error of 5%, a sample size of 16 was obtained. However, 19 individuals were enrolled because a dropout rate of 15% was considered. Treatment with both products resulted in wrinkle improvement as assessed by the WSS and decrease in muscle activity by the ECMAP. No significant difference between the 2 products was observed when considering these 2 distinct end points and methods of measurement.

However, FAEs evaluated using the Minor test at the 28-day follow-up were significantly larger for onabotulinumtoxinA than those obtained with abobotulinumtoxinA. In previous studies, differences larger than 0. 30 cm for the horizontal diameter and
0. 58 cm2 for the area of the FAE were considered clinically relevant. 3, 10 In the present trial, the differences found between the 2 studied products at 28 days were 0. 40 cm for the horizontal diameter and approximately
0. 63 cm2 for the area of the FAE.

### Botulinum toxin injection in long-standing facial paralysis patients: improvement of facial symmetry observed up to 6 months [^112TNBbK]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Despite modern reanimation surgical techniques, facial paralysis presents with functional and aesthetic deficits. We evaluated facial symmetry after treating with botulinum toxin the healthy side of the face of 25 patients with long-standing facial paralysis who had previously been treated by surgical methods, with 6 months follow-up.

Methods

Evaluation consisted of a clinical score, the two subscales of the Facial Disability Index, and surface electromyography. The mean botulinum toxin dose was 38 ± 5 U (range = 15–69 U).

Results

The clinical score showed significant reduction of asymmetry of 48.4% at 1 month and 16.8% after 6 months. The initial result was a consequence of reduced motion on the treated side combined with better motion on the paralyzed side. At 6 months, the treated side returned to basal scores. The residual effect seen in symmetry was due to an increase (18%) of motion in the paralyzed side. There was a significant decrease in the action potential of muscles on the nonparalyzed side 1 month post injection but completely reverted after 6 months. The Physical Function Index increased, but not significantly. The Social/Well-Being Function Index showed a significant increase at 6 months compared to pretreatment.

Conclusion

The proposed treatment improved facial symmetry for up to 6 months. Even after the end of the clinical effect of the drug, the paralyzed side's clinical score was 18% higher than pretreatment, with an increased quality of life.

Injecting for the Upper Face and Overall Facial Enhancement

Treatment planning should consider whether the patient's goals and preferences are for one specific area or for overall facial shaping and enhancement. Facial muscles do not act in isolation but have complex interactions, and the treatment plan must consider the interdigitation of muscle fibers and the degree to which their activities are antagonistic to each other to ensure the desired aesthetic effect is achieved. For example, the most common indications of glabellar, lateral canthal, or forehead lines can all alter eyebrow shape and position, and this should be considered when planning and discussing treatment plans with the patient. In addition, facial muscles with different functions and orientations often overlap and cross various planes, making the depth of injection an important consideration. Injections made too superficial or too deep can lead to inadvertent injection of the wrong muscle, potentially causing an opposite effect from the desired outcome. Finally, facial asymmetry can occur if injections are administered unequally between both sides of the face.

Drooping Nasal Tip

A drooping nasal tip when smiling often involves increased activity of the depressor septi nasi or hypertonia of the LLAN. To prevent the nasal tip from drooping with animation, 1 injection in the middle of the columella is recommended. The aboBoNT-A RTU dose should be 10 U, and the injection should be perpendicular to the skin and deep in the region of the nasal spine, as both muscle bellies cross the midline at this point. If there is hypertonia of the LLAN muscle with a clear lift of the nasal sides and rotation of the tip downwards, some IBA members recommended injecting an additional point on each side at the sides of the alae nasi part of the LLAN. In this case, the aboBoNT-A RTU dose should be 10 U per point.

Pain is the most common adverse event and topical numbing creams are recommended. Patients should not be treated for nasal tip if the nose does not droop when smiling and talking. Injections into the LLAN should be made with caution because it is possible that the length of the upper lip can increase, resulting in ptosis. Other indications in the nasal area (eg, in the alar nasalis to decrease the size of nostril aperture) are only recommended for experienced injectors.

### Duration of clinical efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA in crow's feet lines: results from two multicenter, randomized, controlled trials [^114sFhx8]. Dermatologic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxin Type A was first shown to reduce the appearance of facial lines more than 20 years ago. – Since then, the number of botulinum toxin procedures has increased from almost 790,000 annually in 2000 to more than 6.6 million procedures in 2014. OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox; Allergan plc, Dublin, Ireland) has been extensively evaluated for treatment of glabellar lines (GL) and crow's feet lines (CFL), and has been investigated for treatment of other facial rhytids. – In multicenter, randomized controlled trials, onabotulinumtoxinA produced consistently high responder rates and rapid onset of action in subjects with GL – and, more recently, those with CFL. OnabotulinumtoxinA is approved for treatment of GL and CFL in the United States, European Union, and countries worldwide.

The duration of treatment response to onabotulinumtoxinA is likely an important factor in subject satisfaction with the treatment experience; it influences retreatment intervals and, in turn, treatment costs and patient convenience. In studies of onabotulinumtoxinA for treatment of GL, high subject satisfaction reported at Day 120 coincided with a response duration of at least 4 months. A meta-analysis of data from 4 phase 3 trials found that subject perception of improvement at Day 30 corresponded with a greater duration of effect on dynamic lines.

Limited information is available on the duration of clinical response in individuals with CFL. A multicenter, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled phase 2 study (N = 162) evaluated onabotulinumtoxinA at total doses of 6, 12, 24, or 36 U given through 3 injections per side in the lateral aspect of the orbicularis oculi. The median duration of response was 120 days with the 24 U dose, which was longer than the duration with lower doses and, paradoxically, somewhat longer than the duration with the highest dose. Based on the Subject's Global Assessment of Change in CFL (SGA-CFL), subjects consistently favored the 24 U dose over the other doses. The clinical efficacy and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA at a 24 U dose were further evaluated in the phase 3 CFL studies.

This report further describes investigator- and subject-assessed duration of response with onabotulinumtoxinA for treatment of CFL. It also examines the association of response duration with subjects' perception of improvement in their CFL.

### Onabotulinumtoxina (Botox cosmetic) [^114uKdUM]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.000000000000000e+00 4 Administration

Draw properly reconstituted toxin into the sterile syringe, preferably a tuberculin syringe, and expel any air bubbles in the syringe barrel (see Table 3). Remove the needle used to reconstitute the product and attach a 30–33 gauge needle. Confirm the patency of the needle.

Glabellar Lines

An effective dose for facial lines is determined by gross observation of the patient's ability to activate the superficial muscles injected.

In order to reduce the complication of ptosis, take the following steps:

Avoid injection near the levator palpebrae superioris, particularly in patients with larger brow depressor complexes.
Place lateral corrugator injections at least 1 cm above the bony supraorbital ridge.
Ensure the injected volume/dose is accurate and where feasible kept to a minimum.
Do not inject toxin closer than 1 cm above the central eyebrow.

Inject 4 Units (0.1 mL) of reconstituted BOTOX Cosmeticintramuscularly into each of 5 sites, 2 in each corrugator muscle and 1 in the procerus muscle for a total dose of 20 Units (see Figure 1). Typically, the initial doses of reconstituted BOTOX Cosmetic induce chemical denervation of the injected muscles one to two days after injection, increasing in intensity during the first week.

Field of Effect

If the dose is increased, the area of effectiveness (otherwise known as the field of effect) will increase, and by this, the final effect will also potentially increase. The field of effect of a BoNT-A formulation is a function of the active process of "spread" during injection and the subsequent passive process of diffusion afterward. The field of effect depends on a number of variables (including: injection volume; total dose; depth, angle, and rate of injection; anatomic area; desired degree of effect; and patient-specific factors)but today, the effect of dose on diffusion is considered to be the key factor influencing the field of effect and comparable results have been demonstrated between equal doses of different BoNT-A products.

AEs related to the field of effect have been infrequently observed in large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), as reflected by the low incidences of eyelid ptosis. When unwanted effects such as ptosis do occur, they can often be traced back to lack of injector experience or poor technique, which results in subsequent spread followed by diffusion to musculature adjacent to the site of injection.

Diffusion within the tissues is slower and not dependent on the injection technique, although volume might play a role in the initial spread of the toxin from the original site of injection. A recent study investigating the field of effect in 10 patients found a larger field of effect (ie, mean wrinkle reduction, 794.1 vs 486.6 mm 2) when a larger reconstitution volume (and hence injection volume) was used. Electromyography studies show that BoNT-A can diffuse up to 3 cm from the point of injection, making accurate identification and injection of target muscles essential to achieving the desired outcome.

### Management of post-facelift facial paralysis with botulinum toxin type a… [^1155d8dU]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Facial nerve injury after facelift is rare; hence, its treatment is poorly established. Botulinum toxin type A (BTXA) can be employed to resolve the asymmetry. To our knowledge, there is no protocol in the literature about the best timing for this treatment, injection sites, or recommended dose.

Objectives

The authors sought to propose a protocol to guide the management of asymmetries post-facelift.

Methods

Fifteen patients with post-rhytidectomy facial palsies were treated in the non-paralyzed side with BTXA. After analysis of the smile deviation vectors, it is possible to identify the muscles that should be treated. The dose varied from 1 to 2 volume-unit per point. Patients were examined after 15 days for outcomes evaluation and touch-up if needed. Patients were re-treated after 5 to 6 months in case of asymmetry recurrence.

Results

Symmetry was achieved in all cases. Six patients had definitive nerve lesions and required treatment every 6 months after the first session. Five patients had lesions affecting the upper third of the face; 4 of them were definitive nerve lesions. Two of the 4 patients who were treated less than 2 weeks after surgery recovered early from the post-facelift paralysis and developed reversed asymmetry due to the BTXA. In 7 patients, the post-facelift asymmetry was due to neuropraxis: the recovery from the nerve injury and BTXA treatment occurred symmetrically on both sides of the face in the following months after 1 single session.

Conclusions

Asymmetries post-facelift were successfully managed with the proposed protocol. The best time for injection was 2 to 4 weeks after surgery.

### Complications of cosmetic botulinum toxin A injections to the upper face: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113m9MYS]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Data Extraction and Quality Assessment

The following information was extracted, where available, from all included publications: study design and year of publication, number of patients, patient age, gender distribution, number of BoNT-A injections, BoNT-A formulation, BoNT-A dose, practitioner, specific complications as well as the total complication rate. Practitioners were categorized as doctor, nurse, or non-medical professional. Observed BoNT-A formulations were onabotulinum (ONA), abobotulinum (ABO), and incobotulinum (INCO), and doses were categorized as 0 to 10 U, 11 to 20 U, 21 to 30 U, 31 to 40 U, 41 to 50 U, and 50+ U. Complications were categorized in subgroups: 1) localized skin reaction (erythema, eczema, hematoma, bruising, or contusion); 2) remote skin reactions (rash or edema); 3) wound infection; 4) asymmetric or unsatisfying result; 5) facial neuromuscular symptoms (stiffness, weakness, pain, spasm, paresis, ptosis, dysesthesia); 6) headache; 7) ocular symptoms and infections; 8) pulmonary symptoms and infections; 9) gastrointestinal symptoms; 10) cardiovascular symptoms (hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia, myocardial infarction); 11) general symptoms (influenza-like symptoms, asthenia, chills, pyrexia, fatigue); 12) anaphylactic reaction; and 13) others (nausea, vertigo, etc). Complications were additionally rated as severe or non-severe. Severe complications were defined as those resulting in hospitalization, death, life-threatening conditions, disability, permanent damage, congenital anomaly, or requiring an intervention to prevent permanent impairment. When explicitly defined in the study whether a complication was treatment related or not, only probable or possible treatment-related complications were analyzed in the complication rate. When the total complication rate was not reported by the study, the rate was calculated based on the number of single complications identified. The complication rate was defined as the number of injection sessions with at least 1 complication divided by the total number of injection sessions. We did not analyze second cycles or open-label top-up cycles because of the risk of introducing bias, assuming that additional cycles are more likely to be taken by patients who had positive experiences without any complications after the first injection. Methodological quality of included studies was graded employing the quality assessment tool of the Effective Public Healthcare Panacea Project. We selected this tool because it is applicable to quantitative literature studies and has implications for public health. Given the increasing role of BoNT-A, we believe that its safety profile is critical to update and establish, and this has profound public health implications.

### Safety and tolerability of onabotulinumtoxinA in the treatment of facial lines: a meta-analysis of individual patient data from global clinical registration studies in 1678 participants [^111vd4mZ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

OnabotulinumtoxinA for the treatment of facial lines is a widely used cosmetic medical procedure and, as such, the safety and tolerability profile is of interest to health care providers and patients. Based on data from individual studies that were conducted according to regulatory guidelines to provide adequate safety and efficacy data to support product licensure (registration studies), the overall benefit:risk profile of onabotulinumtoxinA for facial lines has been favorable.

Objective

Our objective was to increase statistical power through meta-analysis to detect treatment group differences in adverse event (AE) incidence that may not have been evident in individual registration studies.

Methods

Individual participant data (n = 1678) were from 6 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and 3 open-label studies. Two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were for lateral canthal lines (3–18 U/side) and all others were for glabellar lines (10 or 20 U). Doses used reflect global product labeling in countries where licensed.

Results

Participant population was non-Hispanic white (43%) or Asian (52%) and predominantly female (88%). In double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, overall AE incidence did not significantly differ by treatment group (onabotulinumtoxinA vs placebo). The only individual AEs with significantly greater incidence in the onabotulinumtoxinA group were eyelid sensory disorder (2.5% vs 0.3%, P = 0.004; verbatim phrases "tight", "pressured", "heavy", "drooping feeling", "feeling of droopiness") and eyelid ptosis (1.8% vs 0%, P = 0.02), both present only in glabellar studies. Overall treatment-related (per investigator) AE incidence was greater in the onabotulinumtoxinA group versus placebo (24% vs 16%, P = 0.005), and treatment-related eyelid edema was an additional AE with significantly higher incidence in the onabotulinumtoxinA group versus placebo (P = 0.04). Incidence of all 3 of these AEs significantly decreased as number of treatment cycles increased. Eyelid sensory disorder and eyelid edema were more common in Asian participants. Acne, injection site pruritus, oral herpes, rash, lower respiratory tract infection, dental caries, and eye pain were significantly more common in placebo-treated compared with onabotulinumtoxinA-treated participants. Serious AE incidence did not significantly differ by treatment (onabotulinumtoxinA vs placebo) and no serious AEs were treatment related. There were no symptoms of weakness remote to the injection site or related to the central nervous system.

Limitations

Limitations included: (1) highly visible efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA may have resulted in reporting bias; (2) reliance on participant intervisit recall; (3) a relatively short follow-up period (1 year); (4) conclusions are based solely on the doses analyzed (ie, those used in the respective trials); and (5) exclusion of patients with severe medical disease in registration studies.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis confirms the safety and tolerability of onabotulinumtoxinA for glabellar and lateral canthal lines, at the doses studied, based on the most comprehensive controlled safety analysis of onabotulinumtoxinA performed to date. The AEs observed were generally mild to moderate; most treatment-related AEs were related either to physical injection of product or local pharmacologic effects. Even with the increased statistical power of a large sample size, no new onabotulinumtoxinA-associated AEs emerged.

BoNT-A Injections

A total of 4268 BoNT-A injection sessions were analyzed. The most frequently used BoNT-A formulation was ONA in 50.6% (n = 2158) of all injections. ABO was utilized in 28.7% (n = 1226) and INCO in 20.7% (n = 884) injection sessions. Doses ranged from 10 to 80 U for ONA injections into the glabellar and forehead region. The total complication rate was 16% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 8% to 26%, I2 = 98%), Figure 2. Headache and migraine were the most frequently reported adverse event and were recorded in 269 (6.3%) injection sessions, followed by local skin reactions such as bruising or hematoma at the injection site, reported in 163 (3.8%) patients, and facial neuromuscular symptoms in 141 (3.3%) injections. Other observed adverse events were pulmonary symptoms after 91 (2.1%) injection sessions and ocular symptoms in 39 (0.9%) cases. Cardiovascular symptoms were recorded in 22 (0.5%) patients, gastrointestinal symptoms in 18 (0.4%) cases, remote skin reactions after 11 (0.3%) injections, face asymmetry in 6 (0.1%) injection sessions, and general symptoms such as fatigue occurred as well after 6 (0.1%) injections (Supplemental Table 2, available online at). ONA injections (Figure 3) showed a complication rate of 16% (95% CI = 6% to 30%, I2 = 98%), INCO (Figure 4) of 6% (95% CI = 3% to 10%, I2 = 76%), and for ABO (Figure 5) an overall complication rate of 18% (95% CI = 4% to 39%, I2 = 98%) was reported.

### Patient selection… [^114fwbQ5]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

8; it is used off-label for all other cosmetic facial indications. It has become the treatment of choice for wrinkles occurring in the upper one-third of the face. It is also used in the lower two-thirds of the face, but this is more technically challenging and is an advanced application. 9–14. Patients with static wrinkles that are visible at rest are also candidates, but results are slower and patients may require two or three consecutive botulinum toxin treatments for significant improvements. 15 Deep static lines may not fully respond to botulinum toxin injection alone and may require combination treatment with dermal fillers or other cosmetic procedures to achieve optimal results. Aesthetic Consultation Facial areas of concern are assessed by the physician and patient simultaneously using a handheld mirror during the consultation.

Asymmetries such as uneven eyebrow height and eye aperture are identified. Areas are prioritized and treatment options discussed, including anticipated results and possible complications. Botulinum toxin is the only treatment for dynamic wrinkles currently approved by the FDA. 27 Figure 7 shows reduction of dynamic frown lines one month after treatment of the glabellar complex muscles with 20 units of onabotulinumtoxinA. 15 Return of muscle function is gradual, typically three to four months after treatment. Subsequent treatment is advised when muscle contraction is visible in the treatment area before facial lines return to their pretreatment appearance. 28 After multiple treatments, botulinum toxin effects may be prolonged and, for some patients, treatment intervals can be extended beyond three to four months.
29. Apraclonidine is reserved for refractory cases and should be used with caution because it can exacerbate or unmask underlying glaucoma.

32 Eyebrow ptosis and undesired eyebrow shape are usually related to unintended botulinum toxin effects in the frontalis muscle. Some of these complications can be corrected with botulinum toxin injection in muscles that antagonize the affected muscles; however, complications caused by involvement of adjacent muscles are temporary and will spontaneously resolve as botulinum toxin effects diminish. Facial asymmetry can result from uneven dosing of botulinum toxin. Consistent technique and careful attention to injection volumes at the time of treatment can reduce the incidence of asymmetries. Other rare complications associated with botulinum toxin injections include formation of antibodies, which can render treatments ineffective.

### A controlled phase 2b trial to assess the efficacy and safety of a single intervention of onabotulinumtoxinA for treating masseter muscle prominence [^111zKYFr]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Based on previous data and an assumption of a difference of ≥ 34% in the responder rate between the onabotA treatments and placebo, it was determined that ∼50 patients per group would be required to provide > 90% power using a 2-sided Mantel–Haenszel test, 10% dropout rate, and 5% significance level.

Efficacy analyses were conducted in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population, which comprised all patients who received study treatment and had ≥ 1 postbaseline MMPS assessment. The last-observation-carried-forward approach was used to impute missing postbaseline values. All statistical tests were 2-sided hypothesis tests performed at the 5% level of significance for main effects. For binary endpoints, P values for pairwise comparisons were calculated using a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel model stratified by baseline MMPS (Grade 4 or 5).

Between-treatment comparisons of changes from baseline in lower facial volume were analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with treatment and investigator site as factors and baseline MMPS grade as a covariate. Between-treatment comparisons of changes from baseline in lower facial width and mandibular facial angle 1C were analyzed using ANCOVA, with treatment and investigator site as factors and baseline MMPS grade and baseline scores as covariates.

Safety assessments were conducted in all treated patients who received ≥ 1 administration of study intervention. For vital signs, the last nonmissing assessment before the study intervention was used as the baseline for all analyses.

2.1 Instructions for Safe Use

The potency Units of BOTOX Cosmetic (onabotulinumtoxinA) for injection are specific to the preparation and assay method utilized. BOTOX Cosmetic is not equivalent to other preparations of botulinum toxin products, and therefore, units of biological activity of BOTOX Cosmetic cannot be compared to nor converted into units of any other botulinum toxin products assessed with any other specific assay method [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Description (11)].

Follow indication specific dosage and administration recommendations. Do not exceed the maximum recommended cumulative dose in a treatment session for any indication.

The safe and effective use of BOTOX Cosmetic depends upon proper storage of the product, selection of the correct dose, and proper reconstitution and administration techniques. Physicians administering BOTOX Cosmetic must understand the relevant neuromuscular and structural anatomy of the area involved and any alterations to the anatomy due to prior surgical procedures and disease.

Do not use BOTOX Cosmetic and contact AbbVie (1–800–678–1605) if:

The tamper evident features on the carton appear to be broken or compromised, or
The U.S. License number 1889 is not present on the vial label and carton labeling [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)]

2.2 Recommended Dose

The total recommended dose in adult patients by treatment area is shown in Table 1. BOTOX Cosmetic is administered by intramuscular injection.

### Botulinum toxin therapy of hemifacial spasm: bilateral injections can reduce facial asymmetry [^1154ev3D]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Botulinum toxin (BT) is the treatment of choice for hemifacial spasm (HFS). When BT is injected into the affected side, patients may experience increased facial asymmetry. We wanted to evaluate in a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled study whether bilateral BT injections may reduce this facial asymmetry. For this, we treated 19 HFS patients with unilateral and 24 with bilateral BT therapy using CBTX-A (Lanzhou Biological Products Institute, Lanzhou, China). BT doses on the affected side were standard doses, on the non-affected side they were one-third of those. Facial asymmetry was studied with the Sunnybrook facial grading system (SFGS), the Facial Clinimetric Evaluation Scale (FaCE), the Symmetry Scale for Hemifacial Spasm (SSHS) and a self-assessment scale. As shown in SFGS and SSHS, bilateral BT therapy reduces facial asymmetry, whilst unilateral BT therapy increases it. Both effects are more pronounced during voluntary facial movements than at rest. BT effect delay, BT effect duration, adverse effect frequency and severity were not affected. FaCE total score, some of its subscores and the self-assessment scale did not show an effect. Bilateral BT therapy may improve the outcome of BT therapy for HFS without producing additional adverse effects. This strategy, however, raises drug costs (by about a third). Using even higher doses in the non-affected side may intensify the improvement even further. Future studies may also monitor the patient's quality of life and the naïve public's overall perception of the patient's facial expression.

### Key parameters for the use of abobotulinumtoxinA in aesthetics: onset and duration [^115FJ6sc]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Dose Equivalence

It is well known that equivalent units of different BoNT-A products do not have equivalent potency. While all forms of type A toxins have identical mechanisms of action, the theoretical numbers of active 150 kDa molecules in a vial varies by manufactured product and this variation may have a relative relationship to the LD 50 (the median lethal dose which kills 50 percent of the test population). The LD50 may be expressed, for example, in units per mL and is proprietary for each company product, defining the potency units for those products. Comparing dose equivalence can therefore only be carried out indirectly, either by comparing muscle activity on bilateral sides of individual patients or different patient populations, or by comparing other markers of BoNT activity, such as diffusion halos, which form around the injection point. This clinically delimited area, usually round or oval in shape depending on the injection angle, marks the toxin's field of effect. Within this area there is an absence of voluntary muscular contraction and sweat gland activity; indeed, the absence of sweating can be used to demonstrate the size of the field of effect using the Minor's test. Hexsel et al have demonstrated the relationship between muscle weakening halos and sweating halos in their forehead model. Because the face contains so many muscles, an injection site may overlap a non-target muscle, particularly if the toxin diffuses more widely than expected. Conversely, if the toxin used does not develop the same field of effect obtained with another toxin, patients may not achieve the expected results.

### Botulinum toxin type A: fine-tuning treatment of facial nerve injury [^11423zjm]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment of patients following facial nerve injury can be daunting. A multitude of procedures have been developed to treat the paralyzed face. As patients recover from facial nerve injuries, a variety of asymmetries from nerve hypofunction (paresis or paralysis) or hyperfunction (synkinesis or spasm) often persist. Careful use of botulinum toxin type A can be very useful in improving symmetry in acute or chronic facial nerve abnormality by treating the relatively hyperfunctional side.

### Botulinum toxin to improve lower facial symmetry in facial nerve palsy [^117XdDjY]. Eye (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

In long-standing facial palsy, muscles on the normal side overcontract causing difficulty in articulation, eating, drinking, cosmetic embarrassment, and psychological effects as patients lack confidence in public.

Methods

We injected botulinum toxin A (BTXA) into the normal contralateral smile muscles to weaken them and restore symmetry to both active and passive movements by neutralising these overacting muscles.

Results

A total of 14 patients received BTXA (79% women, median age 47 years, average length of palsy 8 years). They were all difficult cases graded between 2 and 6 (average grade 3 House-Brackmann). All 14 patients reported improved facial symmetry with BTXA (dose altered in some to achieve maximum benefit). Average dose was 30 units, but varied from 10 to 80 units. Average time to peak effect was 6 days; average duration of effect was 11 weeks. Three patients had increased drooling (resolved within a few days).

Conclusion

The improvement in symmetry was observed by both patient and examining doctor. Patients commented on increased confidence, being more likely to allow photographs taken of themselves, and families reported improved legibility of speech. Younger patients have more muscle tone than older patients; the effect is more noticeable and the benefit greater for them. BTXA improves symmetry in patients with facial palsy, is simple and acceptable, and provides approximately 4 months of benefit. The site of injection depends on the dynamics of the muscles in each individual patient.

5.2 Spread of Toxin Effect

Postmarketing safety data from BOTOX Cosmetic and other approved botulinum toxins suggest that botulinum toxin effects may, in some cases, be observed beyond the site of local injection. The symptoms are consistent with the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence, and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death related to spread of toxin effects. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, and particularly in those patients who have an underlying condition that would predispose them to these symptoms. In unapproved uses and in approved indications, symptoms consistent with spread of toxin effect have been reported at doses comparable to or lower than doses used to treat cervical dystonia and spasticity. Advise patients or caregivers to seek immediate medical care if swallowing, speech or respiratory disorders occur.

### Asymmetrical smiles corrected by botulinum toxin serotype a… [^111MzSJ7]. Dermatologic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to identify the cause of an asymmetrical smile and to ascertain whether or not it would be correctable by injections of Botulinum toxin A (BTX-A).

Methods

Five patients with asymmetrical smiles were identified and found to lower one side of their lower lip in an exaggerated fashion when smiling or laughing. After close observation, it was determined that the ipsilateral depressor labii inferioris of the lower lip was hyperkinetic and retracted that side of the lips lower than its contralateral side when smiling or laughing. Injections of low-volume and low-dose BTX-A (BOTOX, Allergan, Inc.) were placed into the depressor labii inferioris on the side where the lower lip retracted the lowest.

Results

All of the five patients with asymmetrical smiles presented with unilateral hyperkinetic depressor labii inferioris and responded to injections of BOTOX. Their lower lips became level and their smiles were symmetrical within 1 week of the BOTOX treatments. Their lip symmetry lasted for at least 6 months after their initial treatment. With each additional treatment, the duration of BOTOX lasted even longer, averaging approximately 7 months.

Conclusion

BOTOX is an effective, safe, and long-lasting treatment for lower lip asymmetries caused by a hyperkinetic depressor labii inferioris.

2.000000000000000e+00 10 Blepharospasm

For blepharospasm, reconstituted BOTOX is injected using a sterile, 27–30 gauge needle without electromyographic guidance. The initial recommended dose is 1.25 Units-2.5 Units (0.05 mL to 0.1 mL volume at each site) injected into the medial and lateral pre-tarsal orbicularis oculi of the upper lid and into the lateral pre-tarsal orbicularis oculi of the lower lid. Avoiding injection near the levator palpebrae superioris may reduce the complication of ptosis. Avoiding medial lower lid injections, and thereby reducing diffusion into the inferior oblique, may reduce the complication of diplopia. Ecchymosis occurs easily in the soft eyelid tissues. This can be prevented by applying pressure at the injection site immediately after the injection.

The recommended dilution to achieve 1.25 Units is 100 Units/8 mL; for 2.5 Units it is 100 Units/4 mL (see Table 1).

In general, the initial effect of the injections is seen within three days and reaches a peak at one to two weeks post-treatment. Each treatment lasts approximately three months, following which the procedure can be repeated. At repeat treatment sessions, the dose may be increased up to two-fold if the response from the initial treatment is considered insufficient, usually defined as an effect that does not last longer than two months. However, there appears to be little benefit obtainable from injecting more than 5 Units per site. Some tolerance may be found when BOTOX is used in treating blepharospasm if treatments are given any more frequently than every three months, and is rare to have the effect be permanent.

The cumulative dose of BOTOX treatment for blepharospasm in a 30-day period should not exceed 200 Units.

### Update on botulinum toxin for facial aesthetics [^113XmfLa]. Dermatologic Clinics (2002). Low credibility.

The use of botulinum toxin has revolutionized the treatment of facial lines with an incomparable safety record over the past 14 years. The most common used injection sites are shown in Fig. 9. With the recent FDA approval for Botox in the treatment of glabellar lines, its use will likely increase dramatically. It is essential that practitioners have a detailed and specific knowledge of the facial and neck musculature to be injected to minimize untoward side effects, especially in the early days of new users' learning curve. The specifics of the dilutions and units per amount used for the various different commercial forms of botulinum toxin types A and B need to be understood fully and standardized together with the potential for antigenicity with the higher protein load of type B. In addition, specific indications for the use of botulinum toxin as adjunctive therapy for specific facial surgical procedures (i.e., blepharoplasty, surgical brow lift, and laser resurfacing) will become better understood. [figure: see text] Finally, even though the anatomy of the facial musculature is well described, individual differences in men and women, in different population groups, and in tissue qualities, such as turgor and elasticity [87], are important factors to be considered before undertaking botulinum toxin injections. It is likely that the use of specific measuring devices, such as digital imaging, will further help define the use of botulinum toxin for different muscle groups and facial aesthetic indications.

### Efficacy and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA for the treatment of platysma prominence: a randomized phase 2 dose-ranging study [^111bCKTx]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Effective aesthetic treatment of the platysma muscle can aid in rejuvenating the appearance of the lower face and neck. The platysma originates from the upper chest fascia and proceeds upwards along the neck, crossing over the mandibular border, and inserting into the skin, overlying subcutaneous tissue and muscles of the lower face. – Contraction of the platysma muscle accentuates the appearance of vertical bands on the neck or platysma bands while depressing the skin and muscles of the lower face, resulting in blunting of the jawline contour. During aging, repetitive contraction of the platysma muscle can result in more obvious or pronounced disruptions to the contours of neck and jawline. – These unaesthetic and undesired consequences of platysma contraction are known as platysma prominence (PP). PP severity can vary between patients and within the same patient, with one side presenting more severely than the other, resulting in an asymmetric appearance.

PP can become noticeable during routine activities like speaking or smiling, and adversely affect quality of life on a psychosocial and emotional level. Patients with PP can feel self-conscious and less attractive. In addition, PP can negatively affect facial expressions due to the involvement of the platysma muscle in lower face dynamics. Contraction of this muscle results in expressions of fear, disgust, and other negative emotions. Therefore, PP can cause a disconnection between the patient's emotional state and facial expression. Left untreated, signs of aging in the neck and lower face, including PP, may become more noticeable than those in the upper face, where approved aesthetic treatments are widely used, creating imbalance and increasing the perception of advanced age.

Surgical procedures have been used to treat PP, but they carry safety risks, and can result in persistence or recurrence of platysma bands. Therefore, interest in less invasive treatments for PP is increasing. OnabotulinumtoxinA has not been approved for treating PP. Here we report the results of a placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of high and low doses of onabotulinumtoxinA for reducing the appearance of moderate to severe PP in adults.

### The practical use of abobotulinumtoxinA in aesthetics [^115kf89m]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2017). Low credibility.

An asymmetric smile can be caused by spasm of the ipsilateral depressor labii inferioris muscle of the lower lip or segmental weakness of the levator labii superioris muscle. The number of injection points and total dose should be decided on an individual patient basis.

A dimpled chin is caused by the contraction of the mentalis muscle, and regional loss of collagen and subcutaneous fat. This has been successfully treated with 2 injection points into the mentalis muscle, close to the mandibular bone to avoid asymmetry or lower lip ptosis. Doses should generally be injected deep into the target muscle because of the reasonable amount of fat that exists in the chin area. ABO can be given at 2 injection sites in a paramedian position (5 mm lateral to the midline) overlying the inferior mandibular border.

In patients being treated for a dimpled chin, clinicians should avoid injecting too far laterally into the depressor anguli oris muscle or too far superiorly into the orbicularis oris muscle, as this can lead to oral incompetence and a drooping mouth.

Masseter hypertrophy (enlargement) has also been extensively treated with BoNT-A injections despite being an off-label indication. Injection into the masseter muscle to alter the shape of the jawline is a popular application in patients of Eastern Asian descent. ABO can be used on each side, and is usually administered at 1 to 3 injection sites (Figure 4). Interestingly, there appears to be significant variation in the dosing of patients depending on their ethnicity; a study in Asian patients reported using 100 to 140 U per side, whereas in Caucasians, a lower dose of 30 U per side is more commonly reported.

Botulinum toxin type A is extensively used to treat facial wrinkles and facial asymmetries, with its aesthetic and functional objectives being of interest to many patients. In some situations, although its adverse effects are rare, botulinum toxin can result in undesirable results, depending on the purpose and application technique. On this subject, botulinum toxin reversal is poorly documented in the scientific literature and there are few reports of this process.

### Botulinum toxin treatment for facial palsy: a systematic review [^1175vDaR]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Facial palsy may be complicated by ipsilateral synkinesis or contralateral hyperkinesis. Botulinum toxin is increasingly used in the management of facial palsy; however, the optimum dose, treatment interval, adjunct therapy and performance as compared with alternative treatments have not been well established. This study aimed to systematically review the evidence for the use of botulinum toxin in facial palsy.

Method

The Cochrane central register of controlled trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE(R) (1946 to September 2015) and Embase Classic + Embase (1947 to September 2015) were searched for randomised studies using botulinum toxin in facial palsy.

Results

Forty-seven studies were identified, and three included. Their physical and patient-reported outcomes are described, and observations and cautions are discussed.

Discussion

Facial asymmetry has a strong correlation to subjective domains such as impairment in social interaction and perception of self-image and appearance. Botulinum toxin injections represent a minimally invasive technique that is helpful in restoring facial symmetry at rest and during movement in chronic, and potentially acute, facial palsy. Botulinum toxin in combination with physical therapy may be particularly helpful. Currently, there is a paucity of data; areas for further research are suggested. A strong body of evidence may allow botulinum toxin treatment to be nationally standardised and recommended in the management of facial palsy.

### OnabotulinumtoxinA in resistant depression: a randomized trial comparing two facial injection sites (onaDEP study) [^115wHauk]. Depression and Anxiety (2024). Medium credibility.

5. Conclusions

We conclude that injection of OnaA into the glabella muscles is a new, effective, risk-free, and long-lasting treatment option for resistant depression. Our study confirms previous results regarding the efficacy of botulinum toxin in the treatment of patients with treatment-resistant depression. Further studies are needed with larger scale population. Future research could also benefit from longer follow-ups, more gender-balanced samples, and larger scale population to confirm these preliminary results. Another issue is to find a proper place for this treatment in the pharmacopea of depression. It seems necessary to target endophenotypes of depression susceptible to respond better to OnaA. Patients with a high score at item 9 of HAM-D might be a suitable subpopulation. We also suggest that OnaA may act as a modulator of the activity of the primary motor cortex and then of the amygdala.

### Versatility of onabotulinumtoxinA in aesthetic medicine [^114ZA6gG]. Dermatologic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

OnabotulinumtoxinA is an injectable product that was introduced into medicine in the 1970s and has been the subject of thousands of clinical and nonclinical publications.

Objective

To review the data related to the versatility of onabotulinumtoxinA in medical aesthetics.

Methods

PubMed was searched to identify literature evaluating the effects of onabotulinumtoxinA, with preference given to randomized, placebo-controlled trials and safety meta-analyses.

Results

OnabotulinumtoxinA is effective and safe across multiple facial indications, racial and ethnic groups, age groups, genders, and facial line severities. Patient-reported outcomes have been prioritized in aesthetic clinical trials and indicate high patient satisfaction and appearance-related psychological outcomes. Integrated safety meta-analysis and immunogenicity analyses have documented acceptable adverse event rates and low immunogenicity of onabotulinumtoxinA.

Conclusion

OnabotulinumtoxinA is a versatile aesthetic product supported by a strong literature base and positive physician and patient-reported outcomes that reflect a meaningful impact on patient's quality of life.

For simultaneous treatment with lateral canthal lines, the total dose is 64 Units, comprised of 20 Units for forehead lines, 20 Units for glabellar lines, and 24 Units for lateral canthal lines (see Lateral Canthal Lines Administration and Figures 2 and 3).

Platysma Bands

Using an appropriately sized sterile syringe, needle, and aseptic technique, inject 2 Units (0.05 mL) of reconstituted BOTOX Cosmetic into 4 sites in the upper segment of platysma muscle, below the jawline on each side. For each side, administer the 4 jawline injections to the upper platysma muscle approximately 1 to 2 cm inferior and parallel to the lower mandibular border. Ensure the anterior injection site is in line with the oral commissure, and the posterior injection is slightly anterior to the angle of the mandible. Administer the remaining 2 injections equidistant (approximately 1 to 2 cm apart) between the anterior and posterior injection points (see Figures 5 and 6).

In addition, inject 1 Unit (0.025 mL) of reconstituted BOTOX Cosmetic into 5 sites along each vertical neck band, 1 to 2 vertical neck bands per side. For each vertical neck band identified, 1 to 2 per side, distribute 5 injections vertically approximately 1 to 2 cm apart (see Figures 5 and 6). Ensure the most superior injection site is approximately 1 to 2 cm inferior to the jawline injections.

Depending on platysma band severity, the total dose may be 26 Units (1 band/side), 31 Units (1 band one side, 2 bands other side), or 36 Units (2 bands/side) (see Table 4 and Figures 5 and 6 below).

Administer all platysma muscle injections superficially and intramuscularly with the needle perpendicular to the surface of the skin. For vertical neck band injections, identify each band while the patient is contracting their platysma. Gently pinch the band to isolate the muscle from nearby anatomical structures during administration (see Table 4).

To reduce injection-related complications, administer injection at least 1 cm inferior to the lower mandibular border. Do not inject into structures deep to the platysma muscle, particularly in the anterior region of the neck.

### Botulinum toxin A: a review of 1, 085 oral and maxillofacial patient treatments [^1128QbHZ]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Botulinum toxin A (Botox; Allergan, Inc, Irvine, CA) has been used safely and effectively for the management of rhytids and dynamic lines of the face. Much of the initial anecdotal experience with Botox has changed with experience and is reported by the author.

Patients and Methods

In a 56-month period, 439 vials of Botox were used for primarily cosmetic improvement of facial lines and rhytids. Four hundred seventeen patients underwent 1,085 treatment episodes with an estimated 17,000 injections that were tracked on a database and reviewed.

Results

Botox is a safe and effective treatment for the temporary improvement of facial lines and dynamic rhytids in selected anatomic regions. The techniques of reconstitution, storage, use, dose, and technique may not be as sensitive as originally described.

Conclusion

When following minimal guidelines, the use of Botox for cosmetic facial applications is safe, predictable, and without serious complications and provides generalized patient satisfaction.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

There have been spontaneous reports of death, sometimes associated with dysphagia, pneumonia, and/or other significant debility or anaphylaxis, after treatment with botulinum toxin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.7)].

There have also been reports of adverse events involving the cardiovascular system, including arrhythmia and myocardial infarction, some with fatal outcomes. Some of these patients had risk factors including cardiovascular disease.

New onset or recurrent seizures have also been reported, typically in patients who are predisposed to experiencing these events.

### Key parameters for the use of abobotulinumtoxinA in aesthetics: onset and duration [^117D9kN2]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2017). Low credibility.

An important point to make at the outset is that interpretation and comparison of efficacy evidence for different forms of BoNT-A – and even different uses of the same form of BoNT-A – must be performed with caution. Disagreements on how to define and measure doses or improvements in efficacy (eg, what scales to use, how to measure the scale effects [live or by photographs], the timing of those measurements, and the subjective nature of many of the scales) mean that there is very little standardization in clinical studies. However, during a consensus meeting on the recommendations for treatment with abobotulinumtoxinA (ABO; Dysport; Ipsen Biopharm Limited, Wrexham UK/Galderma LP, Fort Worth, TX), Maas noted that: "Aspects of BoNT-A use were consistent across anatomic areas… suggesting that these personal preferences… are not critical for treatment success". However, the actual concept of "treatment success" is not a constant, and adjusting the dose of BoNT-A based on observed muscle action, mass, facial symmetry, and desired result is considered to be important for nearly all anatomic areas. The original concept of "frozen" muscle has generally, but not exclusively, been replaced with a desire for the "natural look". However, adjusting the dosing to achieve a natural look will directly affect onset and duration.

This paper examines factors that influence time to onset and duration of response with botulinum toxin, with particular reference to ABO.

### Key parameters for the use of abobotulinumtoxinA in aesthetics: onset and duration [^1138KGf2]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The effect of ABO on crow's feet wrinkles, forehead lines, and masseter size seems to follow a similar pattern, with patients reliably experiencing the full effect of the toxin for at least 3 months and some patients continuing to see a good effect for as long as 5 or 6 months after injection. In studies that compared ABO with ONA, the proportion of patients with persistent effect from ONA at 4 months was much lower than with ABO and the effects of treatment with ONA were absent by 5 months. Specifically, in the frontalis, a bilateral comparison of ABO to ONA at a ratio of 2.5:1 showed a statistically significant overall persistence of ABO of approximately 3 weeks.

The masseter is a large, strong muscle in an active area of the face. Doses used to treat this muscle are larger than those typically used to treat the frontalis, for example. Klein et al noted that "significant differences" in the size of the masseter were noted after 2 weeks.

Making direct comparisons between these clinical trials is very difficult, owing to a lack of consistency in dosing and, especially, assessment measures as discussed earlier; however, there are some general trends. What is lacking is a solid explanation for these differences, even in studies in which more than 1 muscle is injected. Consensus guidelines indicate that bigger muscles require larger doses. However, this adaptation does not normalize the time to onset and duration of response – the differences still persist. Lorenc et al suggest that the volume and concentration of individual injections need to be tailored to the muscle and surrounding tissue, rather than simply the dose. Lorenc recommends that small, thick muscles (such as those of the glabellar) receive precisely placed, low volume, high concentration injections, whereas the broad, thin, flat geometry of the frontalis is better suited to high volume, low concentration injections that encourage diffusion across the muscle. For the thin, flat orbicularis oculi, precisely placed low volume, low concentration injections are required to eliminate the risk of ptosis.

### Contralateral botulinum toxin injection to improve facial asymmetry after acute facial paralysis [^112BMiYs]. Otology & Neurotology (2013). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

The application of botulinum toxin to the healthy side of the face in patients with long-standing facial paralysis has been shown to be a minimally invasive technique that improves facial symmetry at rest and during facial motion, but our experience using botulinum toxin therapy for facial sequelae prompted the idea that botulinum toxin might be useful in acute cases of facial paralysis, leading to improve facial asymmetry.

Background

In cases in which medical or surgical treatment options are limited because of existing medical problems or advanced age, most patients with acute facial palsy are advised to await spontaneous recovery or are informed that no effective intervention exists. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of botulinum toxin treatment for facial asymmetry in 18 patients after acute facial palsy who could not be optimally treated by medical or surgical management because of severe medical or other problems.

Methods

From 2009 to 2011, nine patients with Bell's palsy, 5 with herpes zoster oticus and 4 with traumatic facial palsy (10 men and 8 women; age range, 22–82 yr; mean, 50.8 yr) participated in this study. Botulinum toxin A (Botox; Allergan Incorporated, Irvine, CA, USA) was injected using a tuberculin syringe with a 27-gauge needle. The amount injected per site varied from 2.5 to 3 U, and the total dose used per patient was 32 to 68 U (mean, 47.5 ± 8.4 U).

Result

After administration of a single dose of botulinum toxin A on the nonparalyzed side of 18 patients with acute facial paralysis, marked relief of facial asymmetry was observed in 8 patients within 1 month of injection. Decreased facial asymmetry and strengthened facial function on the paralyzed side led to an increased HB and SB grade within 6 months after injection.

Conclusion

Use of botulinum toxin after acute facial palsy cases is of great value. Such therapy decreases the relative hyperkinesis contralateral to the paralysis, leading to greater symmetric function. Especially in patients with medical problems that limit the medical or surgical treatment options, botulinum toxin therapy represents a useful alternative.

### Safety and patient satisfaction of abobotulinumtoxinA for aesthetic use: a systematic review [^113QcfuQ]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Other Areas of the Face (Forehead and Crow's Feet)

Although ABO is commonly used in many facial areas, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval is specifically only for the glabella at this time. The lack of a large pivotal trial to support FDA approval of an indication other than the glabella reflects the limited published safety data available for the use of ABO in other facial areas.

The reported AEs in 20 patients receiving ABO treatment for severe frontalis lines at maximum elevation were bruising and occasional headache. Although the results were based on 20 treated subjects, the use of bilateral frontalis comparisons resulted in a statistical N = 40. However, injection of any BoNT-A into the frontalis muscles (forehead) may worsen brow ptosis, and injecting the lower part of the forehead should be avoided for this reason. This is particularly the case for patients who depend on their lateral frontalis to elevate their brows in an effort to avoid accentuating dermatochalasis.

AEs associated with the use of any of the BoNT-A formulations to soften the appearance of lateral canthal rhytides (crow's feet) have included bruising, diplopia, asymmetric smile, and lid ptosis.

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study including 218 patients, Ascher et al demonstrated the safety of ABO at doses ranging between 15 U and 45 U for the treatment of lateral crow's feet. The findings have been confirmed by more recent open-label and retrospective studies of several hundred patients.

### Eyebrow asymmetry: definition and symmetrical correction using botulinum toxin a… [^114qonp9]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Some degree of eyebrow asymmetry is present in many patients who request periorbital rejuvenation, although patients are often unaware of minor asymmetries. There are few parameters for defining eyebrow asymmetry and its incidence in otherwise healthy patients in the literature.

Objective

We investigated whether bilateral, symmetric chemodenervation of the primary depressors and elevators of the eyebrows results in a symmetrical standstill of the eyebrows in a neutral position.

Methods

Measurements of brow height taken in 683 patients who requested reduction of facial rhytids revealed that the minimal amount of asymmetry noticeable to the patients was 2 mm. Between 2002 and 2005, we performed botulinum toxin A injections in a group of 115 patients with eyebrow asymmetry of more than 2 mm who requested aesthetic periorbital rejuvenation; patients with trauma, facial palsy, or previous surgery in the periorbital area were excluded. A total of 30 to 45 units of Botox (Allergan, Irvine, CA) were injected in all patients bilaterally and symmetrically to both brow regions, regardless of their brow height measurements.

Results

All 115 patients completed the study. Mean pretreatment brow height was 18.59 mm at the right lateral canthus and 18.55 mm at the left lateral canthus. After treatment, the mean brow height was 21.91 mm on the right site and 21.89 mm on the left site. The decrease in discrepancy between the right and left brow heights resulting from symmetrical Botox treatment was statistically significant (P < .01). In 83 of 115 patients (72.1%), treatment was successful, with success defined as posttreatment asymmetry of either 0 or 1 mm.

Conclusions

We propose that bilateral chemodenervation of the primary depressors and elevators of the eyebrows can result in a symmetrical standstill of the eyebrows in the neutral position. The treatment is easy to administer and involves few complications.

### Microtoxin for improving pore size, skin laxity, sebum control, and scars: a roundtable on integrating intradermal botulinum toxin type A microdoses into clinical practice [^113UQAqc]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Like standard BoNT-A, microtoxin does have the ability to cause ptosis. Once injected, toxin can not only diffuse in the X and Y directions, but can also diffuse in the Z direction. Therefore, it is critical to ensure exact intradermal injection and an even superficial distribution of product to avoid affecting underlying muscles and unnatural-looking results. If the microtoxin volume per injection point is too high or is injected too deep, ptosis and asymmetry are possible adverse events. However, if the injection is more superficial and in the dermis, this is unlikely to be an issue. Although the number of individual injections needed is higher than traditional treatment, the authors recommend against the utilization of microneedling devices to deliver BoNT-A, because there is less control over individual injection depth and volume of toxin delivered. With minimal practice, an injector can develop the skills needed to quickly and consistently deliver the amount needed.

### Use of micro botulinum toxin for a face-lifting effect: a systematic review [^114CZKDg]. Dermatologic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Micro-Botox (Micro-btx) was described in 2000 for the paralysis of superficial muscle fibers to address facial rhytides. Increasingly, there are reports of its off-label use for a face-lifting effect.

Objective

To evaluate the literature for such results.

Methods and Methods

A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA; only Level ≥ III evidence from 2000 to 2020 were included. Data extracted include patient demographics, type of botulinum toxin, dilution, dosage, injection sites and spacing, needle size and syringe, follow-up, patient and physician assessment, and complications.

Results

Three hundred seventy-two patients (average 35.2 years) underwent different botulinum toxin injections (average 39 units/hemiface) of varying dilutions with 30- to 32-G needles, typically with 1-mL syringes, by forming 0.2- to 0.5-cm wheals 1 cm apart. Follow-up averaged 10.5 weeks with both subjective and objective assessments. Facial asymmetry and minor bruising were common. Subjective assessment of face-lifting effects between patients and physicians was highly discordant and injection sites reported were highly variable.

Conclusion

Much heterogeneity in dosage, injection sites, definition of "face-lifting", and assessment methods remain, all of which preclude accurate and objective evaluation of the current evidence for micro-btx. Future studies should address these variables, given the growing interest in such nonsurgical options for a face-lifting effect.

### DaxibotulinumtoxinA for injection for the treatment of glabellar lines: results from each of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 studies (SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2) [^111C2NSP]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

That the 0.18-ng dose of DAXI (40 U) produced a significantly greater response and duration than the similar amount of onabotulinumtoxinA suggests that formulation differences between the products, including the presence of the proprietary stabilizing excipient peptide in DAXI, contribute to the observed differences in clinical performance. This underscores the established fact that potency units of botulinum toxin type As are not interchangeable and units of DAXI should not be compared to those of other products. Relative potencies cannot be established, and dosing should be based on the available clinical data for individual products.

Although it has been suggested with other botulinum toxin type A products that increasing dose may lead to increased duration, there are few dose-ranging studies published in this indication. A small study with onabotulinumtoxinA failed to find increased efficacy or duration at doses above 20 U in women. The mean onabotulinumtoxinA dose used for glabellar lines in women in the United States is 17 U. This suggests that in current clinical practice dose is not being increased to attempt to drive increased duration, perhaps because of the risk of increasing adverse events.

In our study, the inclusion of subjects with a history of botulinum toxin type A treatment was novel and the washout period for facial botulinum toxin type A treatment was set at 6 months. As it is possible that a subclinical chemodenervation may persist following the restoration of muscle function, this may be considered to be a confounding factor. Approximately 50 percent of subjects had a history of botulinum toxin type A treatment (roughly comparable between the DAXI and placebo groups) and the mean time since last botulinum toxin type A treatment (for any indication) was 32 and 23 months in SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2, respectively, suggesting that there was little effect of carryover from prior treatments. Additional limitations of the SAKURA studies include a preponderance of women and Caucasians, and it would be interesting to extend this research into other patient populations to ensure widespread applicability. It could also be useful to evaluate satisfaction beyond week 4, as satisfaction could increase further once patients have begun to appreciate the long duration of clinical benefit.

The combined results of these two efficacy studies are presented here. The mean age was 46 years, with 32 subjects (6%) ≥ 65 years of age. Most of the subjects were women (82%), and White (84%). At baseline, 210 subjects (39%) had glabellar line severity scores at rest of moderate or severe.

In these studies, the severity of glabellar lines was reduced for up to 120 days in the BOTOXCosmetic group compared to the placebo group as measured both by investigator rating of glabellar line severity at maximum frown (Table 8), and by subject's global assessment of change in appearance of glabellar lines (Table 9).

In the subset of subjects with resting severity scores of moderate or severe, the investigator assessment of a resting severity of mild or none at Day 30 was also achieved by more BOTOX Cosmetic treated subjects (74%, 119/161) than placebo treated subjects (20%, 10/49).

Analysis of the limited number of subjects 65 years or older suggested a lower treatment-associated response compared to subjects less than 65 years of age (Table 10).

Exploratory analyses by gender suggested that responder rates in the BOTOX Cosmetic treated group were higher for women than for men for both the investigator assessment (Day 30; 85% of 334 women, 59% of 71 men) and the Subject Assessment (Day 30; 93% of women, 72% of men). In the limited number of subjects that identified as other races (n = 64 in the BOTOX Cosmetic treated group) the responder rates were similar to those observed in White subjects.

### Improvement of lower facial shape after treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA: secondary results from a phase 2 dose escalation study [^113bmRWV]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Masseter muscle prominence (MMP) contributes to a widened lower facial shape, considered aesthetically undesirable to some individuals. This study assessed lower facial shaping improvements with onabotulinumtoxinA.

Methods

In a phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled study, onabotulinumtoxinA (24, 48, 72, or 96 U) or placebo was injected intramuscularly (3 sites per masseter) into subjects with bilaterally symmetrical "marked" or "very marked" MMP on the Masseter Muscle Prominence Scale (MMPS). Changes from baseline at day 90 in lower facial width, mandibular facial angle, investigator-rated MMPS response, and subject-perceived symptoms, psychosocial impact of lower face appearance, and satisfaction with lower face on the Lower Facial Shape Questionnaire (LFSQ) were assessed.

Results

Among 187 subjects (mean age, 35.4 years; 81.8% female; 79.7% Asian), significant reductions from baseline in lower facial width and mandibular angle were achieved with all onabotulinumtoxinA doses versus placebo at day 90 (P < 0.001, each parameter), continuing through day 180. At day 90, greater improvements in MMPS grade (all doses) and MMP signs, psychosocial impacts, and satisfaction were observed.

Conclusions

OnabotulinumtoxinA treatment improved lower facial shape in individuals with MMP, producing a more desirable ovoid appearance for at least 6 months, with greater patient satisfaction.

### Key parameters for the use of abobotulinumtoxinA in aesthetics: onset and duration [^11265oEy]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

Time to onset of response and duration of response are key measures of botulinum toxin efficacy that have a considerable influence on patient satisfaction with aesthetic treatment. However, there is no overall accepted definition of efficacy for aesthetic uses of botulinumtoxinA (BoNT-A). Mechanical methods of assessment do not lend themselves to clinical practice and clinicians rely instead on assessment scales such as the Frontalis Activity Measurement Standard, Frontalis Rating Scale, Wrinkle Severity Scale, and Subject Global Assessment Scale, but not all of these have been fully validated. Onset of activity is typically seen within 5 days of injection, but has also been recorded within 12 hours with abobotulinumtoxinA. Duration of effect is more variable, and is influenced by parameters such as muscle mass (including the effects of age and sex) and type of product used. Even when larger muscles are treated with higher doses of BoNT-A, the duration of effect is still shorter than that for smaller muscles. Muscle injection technique, including dilution of the toxin, the volume of solution injected, and the positioning of the injections, can also have an important influence on onset and duration of activity. Comparison of the efficacy of different forms of BoNT-A must be made with the full understanding that the dosing units are not equivalent. Range of equivalence studies for abobotulinumtoxinA (Azzalure; Ipsen Limited, Slough UK/Galderma, Lausanne CH/Dysport, Ipsen Biopharm Limited, Wrexham UK/Galderma LP, Fort Worth, TX) and onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox; Allergan, Parsippany, NJ) have been conducted, and results indicate that the number of units of abobotulinumtoxinA needs to be approximately twice as high as that of onabotulinumtoxinA to achieve the same effect. An appreciation of the potential influence of all of the parameters that influence onset and duration of activity of BoNT-A, along with a thorough understanding of the anatomy of the face and potency of doses, are essential to tailoring treatment to individual patient needs and expectations.

### Aesthetic botulinum A toxin in the mid and lower face and neck [^116nxDZA]. Dermatologic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Botulinum toxin type A (BOTOX formulation) is used extensively for smoothing hyperkinetic lines in the upper face. The use of botulinum toxin for aesthetic indications in the mid and lower face and neck is now becoming increasingly popular.

Objective

To review our current approaches to botulinum toxin treatment for cosmetic indications in the mid and lower face and neck.

Methods

Procedures and outcomes are described for the primary and adjunctive use of botulinum toxin.

Results

Cosmetic treatment with botulinum toxin successfully changes the contour of the palebral aperture; smoothes lines, including "bunny" lines, perioral rhytides, and horizontal neck lines; softens creases, including the mental crease and melomental folds; and alleviates facial asymmetry and nasal flare. The doses of botulinum toxin used in the mid and lower face are generally lower than those used in the upper face. Caution must be used in injecting botulinum toxin in the perioral area to avoid an incompetent mouth.

Conclusion

Botulinum toxin treatment is valuable for aesthetic improvements in the mid and lower face and neck. In some areas, particularly the perioral region, the use of botulinum toxin in combination with other therapeutic modalities provides optimal results.

5.5 Cardiovascular System Adverse Reactions

There have been reports following administration of botulinum toxins of adverse events involving the cardiovascular system, including arrhythmia and myocardial infarction, some with fatal outcomes. Some of these patients had risk factors including pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Use caution when administering to patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease.

5.6 Increased Risk of Clinically Significant Effects with Pre-Existing Neuromuscular Disorders

Patients with neuromuscular disorders may be at increased risk of clinically significant effects including generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, ptosis, dysphonia, dysarthria, severe dysphagia, and respiratory compromise from typical doses of LETYBO. Monitor patients with peripheral motor neuropathic diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or neuromuscular junction disorders (e.g., myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton syndrome) for increased neuromuscular compromise following botulinum toxin treatment.

5.7 Dysphagia and Dyspnea

Treatment with botulinum toxin products, including LETYBO, can result in dysphagia and dyspnea including respiratory failure. These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after injection with botulinum toxin. Patients with preexisting dysphagia and dyspnea may be more susceptible to these complications. In most cases, this has been a consequence of weakening of muscles in the area of injection that are involved in breathing or oropharyngeal muscles that control swallowing or breathing

Deaths as a complication of severe dysphagia have been reported after treatment with botulinum toxin products. Dysphagia may persist for several months. Patients treated with botulinum toxin products, including LETYBO, may require immediate medical attention should they develop problems with swallowing, speech, or breathing. These reactions can occur within hours to weeks after injection with botulinum toxin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

5.8 Pre-existing Conditions at the Injection Site

Use caution when LETYBO treatment is used in the presence of inflammation at the proposed injection site(s) or when excessive weakness or atrophy is present in the target muscle(s).

Use caution when LETYBO treatment is used in patients who have marked facial asymmetry, with surgical alterations to the facial anatomy, pre-existing eyelid or eyebrow ptosis, when excessive weakness or atrophy is present in the target muscles, excessive dermatochalasis, deep dermal scarring, thick sebaceous skin (e.g., the inability to substantially lessen glabellar lines even by physically spreading them apart).

### Treatment of periorbital rhytids with botulinum toxin type A: maximizing safety and results: archives of facial plastic surgery: vol 7, No 3… [^113cPW4F]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

In other words, botulinum toxin type A is a reasonable treatment for rhytids if it is effective and only rarely causes an undesirable outcome. 6 Cosmetic procedures are of course intended to improve the patient's appearance, and so any result that produces a less desirable appearance should rightfully be considered a significant adverse outcome. Malposition of the eyebrow has long been recognized as a potential complication of glabellar botulinum toxin type A treatment, typically resulting in a "confused" appearance due to excessive medial elevation of the brow. That aspect of the muscle superior to a line through the medial and lateral canthi logically has a downward force, which serves in part to balance the upward pull of the frontalis thus maintaining brow position. Release of this inferior force leads to unopposed upward displacement of the lateral skin and a superior displacement of the lateral brow.

When created as part of an intentional treatment, this upward displacement can provide a nonsurgical temporal brow-lift or what some refer to as a "chemical browlift". 10It has been suggested that this complication is most likely to occur in patients who have previously had blepharoplasty or other facial plastic surgery, although these same authors would appear to refute the idea of abnormal anatomy as the primary risk. Rather, the risk is present in all patients owing to the insertion of the zygomaticus major near the lateral aspect of the orbicularis oculi. At 1 cm lateral to the lateral canthus, a widely used landmark for botulinum toxin type A injections in this area, the zygomaticus major muscle interdigitated with the orbicularis oculi an average of 1. 4 cm inferior to the Frankfort horizontal line. However, in 29% of cases, the zygomaticus was less than 1 cm from the Frankfort line in this area.

In the midpupillary dissection, the orbicularis oculi was significantly less than 1 cm superficial to the levator labii superioris.
10. RECOMMENDATIONS It would appear based on anatomic studies that many of the conventionally touted anatomic landmarks for periorbital botulinum toxin type A administration place the toxin in excessively close proximity to muscle groups, which can result in undesired aesthetic outcomes. For example, the malar eminence is frequently considered a useful landmark for periorbital botulinum toxin type A treatments, and the practitioner is cautioned to not go below the malar eminence.

2.1 Instructions for Safe Use

The potency Units of BOTOX (onabotulinumtoxinA) for injection are specific to the preparation and assay method utilized. They are not interchangeable with other preparations of botulinum toxin products and, therefore, units of biological activity of BOTOX cannot be compared to nor converted into units of any other botulinum toxin products assessed with any other specific assay method [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Description (11)].

Indication specific dosage and administration recommendations should be followed. When initiating treatment, the lowest recommended dose should be used. In treating adult patients for one or more indications, the maximum cumulative dose should not exceed 400 Units, in a 3-month interval. In pediatric patients, the total dose should not exceed the lower of 10 Units/kg body weight or 340 Units, in a 3-month interval [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

The safe and effective use of BOTOX depends upon proper storage of the product, selection of the correct dose, and proper reconstitution and administration techniques. An understanding of standard electromyographic techniques is also required for treatment of strabismus, upper or lower limb spasticity, and may be useful for the treatment of cervical dystonia. Physicians administering BOTOX must understand the relevant neuromuscular and structural anatomy of the area involved and any alterations to the anatomy due to prior surgical procedures and disease, especially when injecting near the lungs.

Do not use BOTOX and contact AbbVie (1–800–678–1605) if:

the tamper evident features on the carton appear to be broken or compromised, or
the U.S. License number 1889 is not present on the vial label and carton labeling [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)].

### Comparison of the efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA and abobotulinumtoxinA at the 1: 3 conversion ratio for the treatment of asymmetry after long-term facial paralysis [^113ceLxn]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Botulinum toxin A injection into the nonparalyzed side is used to treat asymmetry resulting from facial palsy. OnabotulinumtoxinA and abobotulinumtoxinA units are not equivalent. The authors compared the conversion ratio of 1:3 in patients with facial palsy.

Methods

Fifty-five patients (age, 16 to 67 years; 43 women) with longstanding facial palsy were randomly treated with either onabotulinumtoxinA (n = 25) or abobotulinumtoxinA (n = 30) injections into the nonparalyzed side. Adverse effects, facial symmetry, subjective satisfaction, and Facial Disability Index were assessed after 1 and 6 months.

Results

The incidence of adverse effects was higher with abobotulinumtoxinA (93.3 percent versus 64.0 percent; p = 0.007). Clinical scores of the nonparalyzed side decreased after 1 month and increased again at 6 months, with no between-group differences. Scores of the paralyzed side were lower in the onabotulinumtoxinA group before treatment, but similar in both groups thereafter. The paralyzed side scores increased after 1 month, and at 6 months were still higher than the pretreatment scores in both groups. Subjective assessment improved at all time points compared with pretreatment scores and differed between the two groups only at 1 month, when the abobotulinumtoxinA group was a bit too paralyzed. The physical function and social/well-being function subscales of the Facial Disability Index did not differ between the two groups.

Conclusions

Both toxins efficiently reduced asymmetry in patients with facial palsy. Adverse effects were higher with abobotulinumtoxinA at an equivalence ratio of 1:3.

### Botulinum toxin in men: review of relevant anatomy and clinical trial data [^114VcfGG]. Dermatologic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Botulinum toxin is widely used for facial aesthetics, and its use in men continues to increase.

Objective

To provide a review of pertinent male anatomic features and updated clinical information on the use of botulinum toxin in men.

Methods

A Medline search was performed for publications on sex differences in facial anatomy and on clinical studies examining the role of sex in botulinum toxin treatment.

Results

There are substantial facial anatomic differences between the sexes, with men having increased cranial size, unique cranial shape, greater skeletal muscle mass, higher density of facial blood vessels, and more-severe facial rhytides. A review of sex and botulinum toxin treatment identified 17 clinical studies with 5,646 total participants, of whom 629 (11.1%) were male. Only two studies accounted for sex in study design or subgroup analysis. Both studies found abobotulinumtoxinA to be less effective in men. An additional study examining onabotulinumtoxinA dosing in men found that higher doses than typically used in women were more efficacious. There were not more adverse events in male participants in any study.

Conclusion

Despite sex differences in facial anatomy, the use of botulinum toxin in men is inadequately studied with regard to dosing, efficacy, and safety.

### PrabotulinumtoxinA for treatment of millennials with moderate to severe glabellar lines: post hoc analyses of the phase III clinical study data [^116cFfp6]. Dermatologic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Limited data comparing outcomes in millennial patients have been published with other botulinum toxins. Of note, our findings are consistent with those from an earlier report of a post hoc analysis of pooled data from 2 placebo-controlled Phase III studies investigating the effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox Cosmetic; Allergan plc, Dublin, Ireland) in patients with moderate to severe forehead lines. In those studies, patients in the active treatment arm received 20U for their forehead lines and 20U for their glabellar lines and, in 1 of the studies, patients also received 24U for their crow's feet lines. For the analysis of responders achieving a ≥ 1-point improvement on the 4-point Facial Wrinkle Scale at maximum eyebrow elevation, millennials had numerically higher responder rates than older patients at each visit from Day 30 through Day 180. Outcomes specific to glabellar lines were not reported in this publication nor did a PubMed literature search generate any other clinical trial data with botulinum toxins in the millennial population.

Given the limited number of millennial patients in any one of the prabotulinumtoxinA Phase III studies, it was necessary to pool prabotulinumtoxinA-treated patients across all 3 similar studies to obtain a millennial population of sufficient size to support these post hoc analyses. It would have been preferable if each study had been intentionally designed to enroll more patients in this demographic and that this type of analysis had been planned a priori. Finally, it should be noted that while all patients in these studies were administered a single dose of 20U prabotulinumtoxinA to treat their glabellar lines and that this dose is in keeping with the approved dosing recommendations, it is not necessarily in keeping with current clinical practice. Based on a single-center retrospective analysis, it may be that millennial patients are more typically administered lower doses of toxin than older patients. This observation is in keeping with recent consensus panel recommendations which indicate that, because the treatment of facial lines for millennials is often preventative in nature, younger patients tend to need lower doses and those doses can be administered less frequently.

Open Eye Technique

Treatment with BoNT-A reduces the inferior wrinkles, increases the palpebral aperture, and thus widens the eyes. The open eye technique is used where there are asymmetries of the eyelids or to treat narrow eyes on smiling and facial palsy. For this technique, the IBA recommended 2 to 3 superficial injection points (1–2 U per point for a total dose of 4–6 U) on the lower lid, close to the lash line in the lateral and tarsal parts of the orbicularis oculi. In some cases, when the patient has small eyes or wants to elevate their eyebrows, an additional 3 injections in the lateral canthus can help improve symmetry.

As with lower eyelid wrinkles, unwanted effects include ectropion and exacerbating dry eye. Patient exclusion criteria are like those for crow's feet. Injectors should ensure patients have sufficient skin elasticity using a snap test (< 2 seconds), and should avoid injecting patients with dry eyes, prominent malar edema, scleral show, or morning eyelid edema.

Bunny Lines

Bunny lines refer to dynamic wrinkles (from the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi and the transverse nasalis muscles, together with the medial portion of the orbicularis oculi muscle) on the side of the nose. In some patients, dynamic wrinkles may extend to the lower eyelids and cheeks. If bunny lines appear in addition to glabellar lines when patients frown, they should be treated together. Weakening of the lateral portion of the orbicularis oculi muscle for reduction of lateral canthal lines often results in compensatory hyperactivity of the medial portion, accentuating the bunny lines. For the treatment of bunny lines, 1 to 3 injection points in the nasalis pars transversa are recommended (Figure 2B). In case of wider lines, additional injections into the alae nasi part of the levator labii alaeque nasi (LLAN) are also recommended. Injections should be deep (close to the periosteum), the orientation of the injection should be perpendicular, with an angle of about 90° to the nasal bone. The consensus recommendation is to use aboBoNT-A RTU 2.5 to 10 U per injection point for a total dose of 10 to 20 U.

14.1 Glabellar Lines

Two randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of identical design were conducted to evaluate BOTOX Cosmetic for use in the temporary improvement of the appearance of moderate to severe glabellar facial lines. The studies enrolled healthy adults (ages 18 to 75) with glabellar lines of at least moderate severity at maximum frown. Subjects were excluded if they had ptosis, deep dermal scarring, or an inability to substantially lessen glabellar lines even by physically spreading them apart. Subjects received a single treatment with BOTOX Cosmetic(N = 405, combined studies) or placebo (N = 132, combined studies). Injection volume was 0.1 mL/injection site, for a dose/injection site in the active treatment groups of 4 Units. Subjects were injected intramuscularly in five sites, 1 in the procerus muscle and 2 in each corrugator supercilii muscle, for a total dose in the active treatment groups of 20 Units.

The co-primary efficacy endpoints were the investigator's rating of glabellar line severity at maximum frown and the subject's global assessment of change in appearance of glabellar lines, both at Day 30 post-injection. For the investigator rating, using a 4-point grading scale (0 = none, 3 = severe) a responder was defined as having a severity grade of 0 or 1. For the subject's global assessment of change, the ratings were from +4 (complete improvement) to -4 (very marked worsening). A responder was defined as having a grade of at least +2 (moderate improvement). After completion of the randomized studies, subjects were offered participation in an open label, repeat treatment study to assess the safety of repeated treatment sessions.

### PrabotulinumtoxinA vs onabotulinumtoxinA for the treatment of adult males with moderate to severe glabellar lines: post-hoc analyses of the phase III clinical study data [^114XD1Sz]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Botulinum toxin injections are not only increasingly popular, but they also continue to be the most common nonsurgical cosmetic procedure performed in both males and females. Among males, a dramatic 381% increase in the number of botulinum toxin injections performed for cosmetic purposes was observed between 2000 and 2018 in the United States. Based on a 2019 global survey, male patients accounted for 13.4% of all botulinum toxin procedures performed by aesthetic plastic surgeons in that year. By a large margin, the top 2 motivating factors among aesthetically oriented men considering a facial aesthetic injectable treatment were the desire to look good for their age, followed by the desire to look more youthful. Glabellar lines were selected by 60% of these male respondents as the facial area of concern most likely to be treated first.

Given that women have long dominated this market, instructions for use of botulinum toxins for cosmetic indications have been based on clinical trial efficacy and safety data collected primarily from female patients. Consequently, when deciding the best approach to botulinum toxin applications in men, it is important to consider the facial anatomic differences between males and females. Briefly, compared with women, men typically exhibit greater skeletal muscle mass, including facial muscles that serve as the target for cosmetic botulinum toxin injections. In tandem with larger facial muscle mass, men exhibit greater facial movement and more severe facial lines/rhytids — rhytids that only become more pronounced with age. Other distinctive male facial features include a higher density of facial blood vessels; greater cranial size; greater forehead height, width, and slope; a more pronounced supraorbital ridge; a greater glabellar projection; and a prominent protruding mandible. In keeping with these differences — particularly those related to the facial musculature, botulinum toxins have proven in clinical studies for aesthetic indications to be somewhat less effective in men than in women; higher doses may be required for male patients and are typically recommended by expert consensus panels to achieve optimal outcomes.

### Efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA in the treatment of unipolar major depression: systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression analyses of double-blind randomised controlled trials [^1147T5BQ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Major depression is a common condition worldwide, reaching a life prevalence of 15% in high-income countries (in 2002). Up to 65% of individuals treated for a depressive episode do not fully respond to interventions or achieve full remission. The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression trial (STAR*D), the largest community study to date evaluating treatment response in major depression, suggested that approximately 31% of individuals tend to achieve remission after two treatment steps. Full remission becomes less likely with successive steps, contributing to the chronicity of the condition. Frequency and chronicity of the disorder are responsible for the vast societal and financial impact of major depression. This hereby deprives affected individuals of quality of life in lieu of the high number of years lived with a disability and premature death. Furthermore, especially in refractory cases, more aggressive use of pharmacology and polypharmacy increase the risk of adverse effects, with a negative impact on adherence to treatment and ultimately on clinical outcome. There is undoubtedly a need for novel approaches to treat major depression, especially in cases of inadequate response to antidepressant treatment. Novel therapeutic interventions with minimum side effects would be ideal for future treatment options in order to maximise adherence and minimise the occurrence of pharmacological interactions. Several studies have shown that the single injection of onabotulinumtoxinA into the facial muscles of the glabellar region is an effective, novel and well-tolerated treatment for major depression. OnabotulinumtoxinA is a neurotoxin, which induces transitory muscle paralysis by blocking the release of acetylcholine from the nerve endings. It is primarily indicated to treat conditions caused by excessive or spasmodic muscle contractions. In 2002, the Food and Drug Administration approved Botox® Cosmetic (onabotulinumtoxinA) to treat moderate to severe frown lines caused by glabellar contraction. The putative mechanism of action postulates that facial expressions, including frowning, produce sensory feedback, which can negatively influence emotions. When injected for such an indication in individuals with major depression, onabotulinumtoxinA is believed to modify ongoing emotional responses by providing a positive cue which reduces 'facial negative feedback', resulting in measurable beneficial clinical response without any major side effects. This work appraises the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for the use of onabotulinumtoxinA in major depression. Previous work has indicated that onabotulinumtoxinA is efficacious in treating major depression. The aim of this meta-analysis was to review systematically all of the available data, primarily extracted from randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, on the use of onabotulinumtoxinA for the treatment of major depression.

### Chemodenervation for the treatment of facial dystonia: a report by the American Academy of Ophthalmology [^113sHaef]. Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review the medical literature on the outcomes and complications of various Food and Drug Administration-approved botulinum toxins for benign essential blepharospasm (BEB) and hemifacial spasm (HFS).

Methods

Literature searches were last conducted in February 2017 in PubMed for articles published in English and in the Cochrane Library database without language limitations; studies published before 2000 were excluded. The combined searches yielded 127 citations. Of these, 13 articles were deemed appropriate for inclusion in this assessment, and the panel methodologist assigned ratings to them according to the level of evidence.

Results

A combined total of 1523 patients (1143 with BEB and 380 with HFS) were included in the 13 studies. Five studies provided level I evidence, 2 studies provided level II evidence, and 6 studies provided level III evidence. Pretarsal injections were more efficacious than preseptal injections (96% vs. 86%, respectively). Pretarsal injections also resulted in a higher response rate on clinical scales (P < 0.05) and a longer duration of maximum response for both HFS and BEB. Patients with HFS require lower overall doses of onabotulinumtoxinA than patients with BEB for a similar duration of effect. Adverse events were dose related, and they occurred more frequently in patients who were given more units.

Conclusions

Level I evidence supports the efficacy of Botox (Allergan Corp, Irvine, CA), Meditoxin, and Xeomin (Merz Pharmaceuticals, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) for the treatment of BEB. Meditoxin and Botox have equivalent effectiveness and incidence of adverse events for BEB and HFS. Dysport (Ipsen Biopharmaceuticals, Inc, Paris, France) seems to have efficacy similar to Botox and Meditoxin for BEB and HFS, but any definitive conclusions from the 2 level II studies in this review are limited by differences in the methodologies used. Higher doses of Botox and Dysport result in more adverse events. Repeated treatments using Botox seem to maintain efficacy for treatment of facial dystonias over a follow-up period of at least 10 years, based on level III evidence.

At Day 90, lower facial volume was significantly reduced for both dose groups vs placebo (P < .0001; Figure 3A). The least squares mean change from baseline in lower facial volume peaked at Day 90, with a decrease of 0.33 cm 3 in the placebo group compared with decreases of 6.15 and 6.14 cm 3 in the onabotA 48 U and onabotA 72 U groups, respectively (P < .0001 vs placebo).

In addition, at Day 90, significant improvements from baseline in the mandibular facial angle 1C (indicating a more ovoid facial shape) were observed with both doses of onabotA (3.3° and 2.9° for 48 and 72 U, respectively) compared with placebo (0.4°; P < .0001 vs placebo; Figure 3C–H; see Video).

Dynamic and Static Periorbital Wrinkles (Crow's Feet)

Lateral canthal rhytids (crow's feet) are a common indication where injections are used to compensate for overactivation of orbicularis oculi during animation. The injection technique may also be part of a nonsurgical brow lift. For the treatment of crow's feet, the IBA recommended injecting 3 points per side (ie, 6 points in total) surrounding the canthal region (Figure 1B). For some patients with long and severe crow's feet the number of injections can be increased to 6 points per side adapted to the location of the wrinkles. All points should be at the lateral part of the orbicularis oculi, 1 to 2 cm from the external orbital rim. Some board members recommended that the inferior point should be a bit more internal and/or a lower dose to avoid any diffusion to the zygomatic muscles. Injections should be slow and controlled, lateral (30–45° angle to the skin), and superficially into the dermal plane. It is recommended that the needle always points away from the patient's eyes. The injector should stretch the skin slightly to visualize superficial veins and avoid bruising. A total aboBoNT-A RTU dose of 30 to 60 U is recommended, with 5 to 10 U per point (15–30 U per side); dosage considerations include the strength of the muscle, depth of wrinkles, and the thickness/firmness of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Doses should be reduced (mainly in the inferior part) for patients with signs of malar edema. As with previous aboBoNT-A formulations, the minimal injection dose should be adopted to avoid a frozen look when smiling.

Unwanted effects include pain, aggravation of malar edema and under-eye wrinkles, and effects on neighboring muscles such as the inferior region of the zygomaticus major, which can lead to drooping mouth corners and asymmetry if injected. To avoid these problems, the IBA recommended performing a snap test to confirm the patient has adequate skin elasticity and to avoid injecting the canthal region in patients with prominent malar edema. Treatment of crow's feet can be combined with lower eyelid wrinkles if they are present. In this case, the same injection points should be used with a slightly lower dose per point. Eyelid ptosis is avoided by injecting superficially with posterior directionality.

The duration of effect of BOTOX Cosmeticfor glabellar lines is approximately 3–4 months.

Figure 1:

Lateral Canthal Lines

Give injections with the needle bevel tip up and oriented away from the eye. Inject 4 Units (0.1 mL) of reconstituted BOTOX Cosmetic into 3 sites per side (6 total injection points) in the lateral orbicularis oculi muscle for a total of 24 Units (0.6 mL) (12 Units per side). Administer the first injection (A) approximately 1.5–2.0 cm temporal to the lateral canthus and just temporal to the orbital rim. If the lines in the lateral canthal region are above and below the lateral canthus, inject per Figure 2. Alternatively, if the lines in the lateral canthal region are primarily below the lateral canthus, inject per Figure 3.

For simultaneous treatment with glabellar lines, the dose is 24 Units for lateral canthal lines and 20 Units for glabellar lines (see Glabellar Lines Administration and Figure 1), with a total dose of 44 Units.

Forehead Lines in Conjunction with Glabellar Lines

Treat forehead lines in conjunction with glabellar lines (see Glabellar Lines Administration and Figure 1) to minimize the potential for brow ptosis. The recommended total dose for treatment of forehead lines (20 Units [0.5 mL]) in conjunction with glabellar lines (20 Units [0.5 mL]) is 40 Units (1 mL).

### Key parameters for the use of abobotulinumtoxinA in aesthetics: onset and duration [^114n21nA]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2017). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Onset and duration of effect are markers of the overall response to treatment with ABO. Significantly, they are important drivers of patient satisfaction because patients want to see both early benefits of treatment and for those benefits to last as long as possible before retreatment is required.

Factors influencing onset and duration include, for example, the product, the dose the target muscle, and the patient's sex and age. Some of these may be inter-related and may not be universal. There is much that still needs to be elucidated about exactly how these factors exert their influence. As the literature for aesthetic uses of BoNT-A continues to grow, and more is understood about the mechanism of action in the muscles treated and about the differences between different BoNT-A products, treatment protocols can be refined to provide the best reconstitution and dosing for optimal results in individual patients. In the meantime, every patient must be treated as an individual and care must be taken to discuss all aspects of the procedure in order to manage the patient's expectations.

Primary Axillary Hyperhidrosis

The most frequently reported adverse reactions (3–10% of adult patients) following injection of BOTOX in double-blind studies included injection site pain and hemorrhage, non-axillary sweating, infection, pharyngitis, flu syndrome, headache, fever, neck or back pain, pruritus, and anxiety.

The data reflect 346 patients exposed to BOTOX 50 Units and 110 patients exposed to BOTOX 75 Units in each axilla.

Blepharospasm

In a study of blepharospasm patients who received an average dose per eye of 33 Units (injected at 3 to 5 sites) of the currently manufactured BOTOX, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were ptosis (21%), superficial punctate keratitis (6%), and eye dryness (6%).

Other events reported in prior clinical studies in decreasing order of incidence include: irritation, tearing, lagophthalmos, photophobia, ectropion, keratitis, diplopia, entropion, diffuse skin rash, and local swelling of the eyelid skin lasting for several days following eyelid injection.

In two cases of VII nerve disorder, reduced blinking from BOTOX injection of the orbicularis muscle led to serious corneal exposure, persistent epithelial defect, corneal ulceration and a case of corneal perforation. Focal facial paralysis, syncope, and exacerbation of myasthenia gravis have also been reported after treatment of blepharospasm.

Strabismus

Extraocular muscles adjacent to the injection site can be affected, causing vertical deviation, especially with higher doses of BOTOX. The incidence rates of these adverse effects in 2058 adults who received a total of 3650 injections for horizontal strabismus was 17%.

The incidence of ptosis has been reported to be dependent on the location of the injected muscles, 1% after inferior rectus injections, 16% after horizontal rectus injections and 38% after superior rectus injections.

In a series of 5587 injections, retrobulbar hemorrhage occurred in 0.3% of cases.

Additionally, Severt and Proffit reported frequencies of facial laterality of 5, 36 and 74% in the upper, middle and lower thirds of the face.

Paying special attention to facial asymmetry provides an important reference point in the patient face, because it allows to compare the wide/full and short facial side versus the narrow one and long.

Because less invasive aesthetic procedures for facial beautification and enhancement are evolving continuously, it is necessary to standardize their management providing strategies that prevent or reduce the incidence of complications.

Although hyaluronic acid implants and BoNTA treatments are generally regarded as safe, unanticipated events and adverse outcomes can occur with these agents. A careful patient selection, an adequate product and technique, correct aseptic approach, an exhaustive knowledge of facial anatomy coupled with constant awareness of the early signs of vascular compromise are required for proper patient management.

The incidence and type of complications found with these approaches did not differ from those previously reported. In all the cases, the adverse events were mild and were successfully resolved.

### Complications of cosmetic botulinum toxin A injections to the upper face: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115WoXAK]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In a systematic analysis of the available literature, we found that the incidence of adverse events related to glabellar and forehead BoNT-A injection is approximately 16%, and only a very few severe complications possibly or probably related to the BoNT-A treatment occurred. Headache and local skin reactions were the most frequently reported complications in BoNT-A patients as well as in patients receiving placebo. In BoNT-A injections, facial neuromuscular symptoms and facial asymmetry occurred more often compared with placebo treatment. This implies that local skin reactions and headache might be unrelated to the botulinum toxin itself but more likely caused by the syringe injection, whereas asymmetry and neuromuscular effects are attributable to the toxin. The placebo had a lower complication rate compared with BoNT-A injections, although results were not significant. There were very few severe treatment-related complications in both placebo injections and BoNT-A injections in this review.

Nevertheless, complication rates must be interpreted with caution. The included studies in our systematic review utilized different definitions for complications, which may result in difficulties in the interpretation and analysis of the safety profile. Furthermore, in many of the included studies, treatment-related and non-related complications are not consistently defined or even not distinguished between. For example, Carruthers et al and De Boulle showed high complication rates of 27% to 43% because final complication rates also included non-related treatment complications. By contrast, Sattler et al distinguished between treatment-related and non-related complications and reported them separately. This leads to difficulties in the comparison of complication rates. In addition, an analysis of complications reported to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom showed a lack of a standardized reporting system for adverse events from a procedure or medication. Incorrect and non-standardized reporting of adverse events can lead to an overestimation of a medical product's safety profile. For this reason, it is crucial to create a uniform complication reporting system with guidelines to ensure the capture of all complications in the context of a specific treatment and enable comparison of complication rates of future studies.

### A controlled phase 2b trial to assess the efficacy and safety of a single intervention of onabotulinumtoxinA for treating masseter muscle prominence [^111NS22o]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The results of this study were consistent with the results of a prior Phase 2 dose-escalation studyand suggest that treatments with onabotA 48 and 72 U are similarly well tolerated and effective in reducing MMP severity, as assessed by both clinicians and patients, for at least 6 months. OnabotA treatment significantly reduced lower facial volume and width, giving the face a more desirable ovoid shape, supported by an increased angle, and patients reported greater treatment satisfaction with both doses of onabotA compared with placebo at all time points. OnabotA provides an effective, nonsurgical, minimally invasive, well-tolerated treatment for the reduction of MMP.

### Safety and patient satisfaction of abobotulinumtoxinA for aesthetic use: a systematic review [^1139XyzV]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2017). Low credibility.

RESULTS

What is the Clinical Evidence for the Safety of AbobotulinumtoxinA in Aesthetic Procedures?

Many studies have investigated the safety of BoNT-A as a class. In 2014, a systematic review on the safety of BoNT-A (ABO, incobotulinumtoxinA [INCO], and onabotulinumtoxinA [ONA]) for aesthetic use was performed, which included data from 35 clinical studies including 8787 individuals. Of these studies, 13 (37%) assessed ABO, 1 (3%) assessed INCO, and 21 (60%) assessed ONA. The overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) for all botulinum toxin preparations was not found to be significantly different between experimental and placebo groups, and AEs were reported as being mostly mild and transient in nature. The most common AEs were blepharoptosis (2.5%), brow ptosis (3.1%), and eye sensory disorders (3%) in the upper face, and lip asymmetries and imbalances in the lower face (6.9%). In a 2015 systematic review, eyelid edema was also reported in 1.4% of patients, with a greater risk for BoNT-A-induced eyelid edema reported in Asian populations than Caucasian populations (3.1% vs 0.7%).

Headache, injection site pain, edema, and bruising have been reported and occur independently of the area being treated, with no statistical difference compared with placebo injection. This suggests that these AEs may be related to the injection procedure and could be avoided by improving injection technique.

There are no reported long-term AEs related to the aesthetic use of ABO, INCO, or ONA.

Studies that specifically investigated ABO have reported a good overall safety profile, with most AEs being minor and related to the trauma of injection. There are substantial safety data relating to the treatment of glabellar lines. However, safety data relating to the treatment of the forehead, lateral canthal lines ("crow's feet"), and other anatomical areas are less well documented.

### Safety, pharmacodynamic response, and treatment satisfaction with onabotulinumtoxinA 40 U, 60 U, and 80 U in subjects with moderate to severe dynamic glabellar lines [^116sAxGv]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The median duration of response (time to return to baseline GL severity), which was approximately 6 months in the onabotulinumtoxinA 40-, 60-, and 80-U groups compared with approximately 5 months in the onabotulinumtoxinA 20-U group, favored the higher onabotulinumtoxinA doses over 20 U at Week 24 (P < 0.05, all comparisons). Phase 3 clinical trial data for daxibotulinumtoxinA in the treatment of moderate to severe GLs at a dose of 40 U showed a duration of response (median time until none or mild GL severity was lost) of 24 weeks. In the Phase 2 BELMONT clinical trial, there were no statistical differences in clinical efficacy measures (ie, 1- and 2-point improvements on the FWS scales) between the 20-U doses of daxibotulinumtoxinA and onabotulinumtoxinA at any time point (Weeks 4, 16, or 24) as assessed by investigators as well as by subjects; significant differences over onabotulinumtoxinA 20 U were only achieved for the higher daxibotulinumtoxinA doses (ie, 40 or 60 U). The median duration of response reported in the BELMONT study for daxibotulinumtoxinA was 20.0 weeks for 20 U, 23.6 weeks for 40 U, and 20.9 weeks for 60 U. These findings, coupled with the current data, suggest that longer duration is largely a factor of higher dose, as the median duration of response in our study was also longer for the 40-U and higher onabotulinumtoxinA doses when compared with onabotulinumtoxinA 20 U (≥ 24.0 weeks for 40, 60, and 80 U vs 19.7 weeks for the approved 20 U for GLs). Other studies conducted with onabotulinumtoxinA, as well as studies conducted with other botulinum toxins for treatment of GL severity (abobotulinumtoxinA and incobotulinumtoxinA), also support extended duration of responses with escalating doses. However, units of onabotulinumtoxinA are not interchangeable with those of any other botulinum toxin preparation and cannot be compared to or converted into units of any other product. In addition, the facial wrinkle photonumeric scales used across the various referenced botulinum toxin A studies are proprietary to each manufacturer and also render direct comparisons of duration not possible.

### The use of botulinum toxin to improve cosmesis in patients with facial asymmetry following facial palsy / synkinesis – A literature review [^113bxR93]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Facial palsy (FP) is a common debilitating condition with many etiologies. FP causes unilateral paralysis, functional impairments, and asymmetry, reducing aesthetics overall. Secondary complications such as hyperkinesis or synkinesis can result in reduced quality of life (QoL), including social isolation and deteriorating mental health. Treatments, including botulinum toxin injections, aim to correct this asymmetry. This review assessed the efficacy, safety, and cost effectiveness of botulinum for enhancing facial symmetry in FP. A PubMed search was conducted for studies from 2010 to 2023. Studies that analyzed the effects of botulinum on patients with FP and its resulting complications were selected. A total of 16 studies were included. These studies proved botulinum to be beneficial in the long-term treatment of individuals with FP. It reduces facial asymmetry, leading to improved facial aesthetics and overall QoL. Limited evidence was found to suggest botulinum's potential in acute FP. Therapeutic effects were observed within 1 to 21 days, lasting ∼4 months, requiring safe, periodic repetition. Adverse effects were mild, transient, and rare, with no reported severe complications or cases of toxin resistance. Botulinum can be considered safe and effective when used to improve facial symmetry and overall cosmesis in the long-term management of patients with FP. However, there is a lack of studies, especially on those with higher levels of evidence on the use of botulinum in acute FP treatment. Therefore, further research is required to standardize the ideal timing, optimum dosage, and treatment interval.

The primary efficacy measure was the assessment of FHL severity at maximum eyebrow elevation using the 4-point Facial Wrinkle Scale with Photonumeric Guide (FWS; 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). The FWS assessment was performed independently by both investigators and subjects. The primary timepoint was Day 30 following the first treatment.

The primary efficacy response definition was a composite ≥ 2-grade improvement from baseline in FHL severity at maximum eyebrow elevation, assessed by both investigator and subject on a per-subject basis. For Studies 1 and 2, the proportion of responders was greater in the BOTOX Cosmetic arms compared to placebo at Day 30 (p < 0.0001 for Studies 1 and 2) (Table 12).

A total of 165 and 197 subjects received 3 cycles over 1 year of BOTOX Cosmetic 40 Units (20 Units FHL with 20 Units GL) and 64 Units (20 Units FHL, 20 Units GL, and 24 Units LCL), respectively. The response rate for FHL was similar across all treatment cycles.

The results for a key secondary endpoint of responders achieving a grade of none or mild on investigator ratings at maximum eyebrow elevation of FHL severity are presented below for Studies 1 and 2.

Chemodenervation with botulinum toxin has become an integral part of the facial plastic armamentarium. Although eyebrow and eyelid cosmetic deformities and asymmetries have traditionally been treated by surgical intervention, Botox can now be incorporated effectively into the treatment plan. When the surgeon has a complete understanding of facial anatomy and muscular interactions, Botox can be used as a primary treatment of the periorbital region or as an adjunct to surgical procedures of the periorbital region.

### Botulinum toxin in aesthetic medicine: myths and realities [^11777ajf]. Dermatologic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Myth 1: Different Products Yield Different Results

Relatively few well-designed, suitably powered and controlled, randomized studies compare BoNT-A products in "routine" clinical settings. Many clinical trials of BoNT were performed in "artificial" settings, e.g. using fixed doses at fixed intervals in fixed positions on the face. These studies do not reflect normal clinical use, which varies widely depending on patient-related factors. Comparative studies are potentially compromised by the lack of consensus on any conversion ratioand the need to address a plethora of potentially confounding variables, including dilution/concentration, placement, and patient selection. Current claims of dose equivalence are based on preclinical and clinical data. However, there are no randomized controlled human clinical studies in which the different preparations are titrated to the same effect and tolerability. To date, the small number of methodologically weak studies report mixed results as exemplified by comparisons of Botox and Dysport for glabellar lines.

Some studies, for example, suggest Botox is superior to Dysport. In a pilot study, Botox 20 units provided better and more prolonged efficacy than Dysport 50 units for glabellar lines, assessed by a blinded investigator evaluating photographs. Nevertheless, the authors comment that differences in diffusion and electrophysiological characteristics preclude the proposal of a single dose conversion ratio. In another study, patients receiving Botox 20 units were more likely to show a 1-grade or better improvement in glabellar line severity than those treated with Dysport 50 units: 77% versus 59% at week 12; and 53% versus 28% at Week 16. However, this study has been criticized for being underpowered and inadequately randomized with respect to age (younger patients often have stronger muscles and require higher doses). In addition, the effect of Botox apparently increases over time in the study, which is not seen in any other study or in clinical practice.

### Microbotox of the lower face and neck: evolution of a personal technique and its clinical effects [^1135JZwC]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Microbotox is the injection of multiple microdroplets of diluted onabotulinumtoxinA into the dermis or the interface between the dermis and the superficial layer of facial muscles. The intention is to decrease sweat and sebaceous gland activity to improve skin texture and sheen and to target the superficial layer of muscles that find attachment to the undersurface of the dermis causing visible rhytides. For treatment of the lower face and neck, hundreds of microdroplets of diluted Botox are injected into the dermis or immediate subdermal plane to improve skin texture, smoothen horizontal creases, and decrease vertical banding of the neck, as well as to achieve better apposition of the platysma to the jawline and neck, improving contouring of the cervicomental angle. The Microbotox solution is mixed in the syringe by adding a small volume of lidocaine to the calculated dose of onabotulinumtoxinA drawn from a standard bottle of Botox prepared with 2.5 mL saline. Each 1 mL syringe of Microbotox solution contains 20–28 units of onabotulinumtoxinA per mL of solution and is used to deliver 100–120 injections. The lower face and neck will usually require 1 mL per side. The injections are delivered intradermally using a 30- or 32-G needle raising a tiny blanched weal at each point. The author has over 1867 documented cases of Microbotox in various parts of the face (forehead, glabellar, crow's-feet, infraorbital, and cheeks) and neck, the majority of these patients being treated in forehead or the lower face and neck as described in this article.

### Treatment of blepharospasm and meige's syndrome with abo-and onabotulinumtoxinA: long-term safety and efficacy in daily clinical practice [^115wqMge]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thirty years after their approval, botulinum toxin injections still are the first-line therapy for blepharospasm. The aim of our study was to analyze long-term data concerning safety and efficacy in a large cohort over decades.

Methods

Treatment data of all patients with blepharospasm and Meige´s syndrome in our outpatient clinic having undergone at least three subsequent treatment sessions with current onabotulinumtoxinA or abobotulinumtoxin A were analyzed with respect to the course of dose, effect duration, side effects, patients´ satisfaction and occurrence/reasons for treatment discontinuation.

Results

The observation period was up to 18 years for onabotulinumtoxinA and 29 years for abobotulinumtoxinA with a total of 1778 and 9319 treatment sessions in 69 patients with onabotulinumtoxinA, 281 with abobotulinumtoxin A and 2 of these having used both products. The dose increased in the first years followed by a stable dose in the following years. The mean dose was 39.1/198.7 mouse units (onabotulinumtoxinA/abobotulinumtoxinA). In over 25% of all sessions, inhibition of the eyelid opening was effectively treated with pretarsal injections. The most common adverse events included ptosis (4%/5%), epiphora/sicca (4%/5%), double vision (1%/1%) and facial asymmetry (1%/1%). Reasons for therapy discontinuation were change to a nearby doctor, age, other diseases, spontaneous improvement, side effects or possible treatment failure. Only one patient was tested positive for neutralizing antibodies against botulinum toxin A.

Conclusion

The treatment of blepharospasm and Meige's syndrome with onabotulinumtoxinA and abobotulinumtoxinA is safe and effective, also over a long observation period of up to 29 years.

### Onabotulinumtoxina (Botox) [^114ojvzr]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.000000000000000e+00 1 1 Strabismus

BOTOX is intended for injection into extraocular muscles utilizing the electrical activity recorded from the tip of the injection needle as a guide to placement within the target muscle. Injection without surgical exposure or electromyographic guidance should not be attempted. Physicians should be familiar with electromyographic technique.

To prepare the eye for BOTOX injection, it is recommended that several drops of a local anesthetic and an ocular decongestant be given several minutes prior to injection.

The volume of BOTOX injected for treatment of strabismus should be between 0.05–0.15 mL per muscle.

The initial listed doses of the reconstituted BOTOX [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] typically create paralysis of the injected muscles beginning one to two days after injection and increasing in intensity during the first week. The paralysis lasts for 2–6 weeks and gradually resolves over a similar time period. Overcorrections lasting over six months have been rare. About one half of patients will require subsequent doses because of inadequate paralytic response of the muscle to the initial dose, or because of mechanical factors such as large deviations or restrictions, or because of the lack of binocular motor fusion to stabilize the alignment.

### Improving neck and jawline aesthetics with onabotulinumtoxinA by minimizing platysma muscle contraction effects: efficacy and safety results in a phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled study [^113S3SuM]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

A well-defined lower face and neck signal a youthful facial appearance. The platysma muscle plays a crucial role in lower facial and neck aesthetics by smoothly draping the area from the upper thoracic region to the lower face and above the mandible. However, as the platysma muscle ages, it can contribute to a less defined jawline, accentuating jowling and visible vertical neck bands. This condition is referred to as platysma prominence (PP) and is commonly associated with aging, although it can also affect younger individuals.PP presentation can vary anatomically within the same individual, leading to an asymmetrical presentation of PP.

PP is caused by the contraction of the platysma muscle over time, which leads to shortening of the muscle fibers and may result in a more pronounced appearance. As a result, the platysma muscle may contract noticeably during normal activities like smiling or talking, becoming visible and potentially bothersome in appearance. Other age-related changes, such as cervical skin laxity, platysma muscle diastasis, or cervical fat loss, can further exacerbate PP. The changes in the lower face and neck contours caused by PP can negatively impact an individual's psychological well-being and self-esteem. Moreover, PP can interfere with facial expressions, resulting in an unattractive appearance that does not accurately portray the person's emotional state.

OnabotulinumtoxinA (onabotA; BOTOX Cosmetic, Vistabel, Allergan Aesthetics, an AbbVie company, Irvine, CA) demonstrated efficacy in improving moderate-to-severe PP at various doses (26, 31, and 36 U, or 52, 62, and 72 U) in a recent phase 2 dose-escalating study, with the 26, 31, and 36 U dose group showing a more favorable safety profile. Additionally, a pivotal phase 3 study conducted in the United States and Canada confirmed the safety of onabotA dosages of 26, 31, and 36 U and showed significant and clinically meaningful improvements in PP. In this phase 3 study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of onabotA (26, 31, and 36 U) compared to placebo in participants from multiple countries, consisting of the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, the United States, and Canada.

### Safety of botulinum toxin A in aesthetic treatments: a systematic review of clinical studies [^115H1SP9]. Dermatologic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The use of botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) for aesthetic treatments is growing steadily, and new safety data have been reported in recently published studies.

Objective

To investigate the safety data on the use of the three BoNT-A formulations approved for facial aesthetics from recent studies and to confirm their safety profiles.

Methods

The literature search was conducted using three online databases restricted to the timeframe from January 2000 to June 2012. Only clinical trials, randomized or open label, with safety as the primary or secondary endpoint, were included.

Results

Thirty-five papers were selected, with a total of subjects 8,787 studied. OnabotulinumtoxinA was used in 60.0% of the studies, abobotulinumtoxinA in 37.1%, and incobotulinumtoxinA in 2.8%. The glabella was the most investigated area (51.4%), followed by the upper face (25.7%), crow's feet (11.4%), and lower face (11.4%). Treatment-related adverse events were blepharoptosis (2.5%), brow ptosis (3.1%), and eye sensory disorders (3%) in the upper face and lip asymmetries and imbalances in the lower face (6.9%). All of these events resolved spontaneously.

Conclusion

The short-term safety profile of BoNT-A in cosmetic nonsurgical procedures was confirmed for all the three commercial formulations.

### Complications of botulinum toxin A use in facial rejuvenation [^115yyZtD]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The esthetic application of botulinum toxin type A is a safe treatment modality; nevertheless, complications can occur as a result of patient- and physician-related factors. Fortunately, adverse effects and undesirable sequelae after Botox injections are temporary. Complications may be more serious in patients who have more severe rhytids (which require more Botox), have undergone previous facial plastic surgery (altered anatomy), and those who have preexisting neuromuscular disease. The physician can reduce complications by using proper injection techniques, appropriate regional Botox dosing, and by being conservative in the overall approach to Botox-mediated facial rejuvenation.

In addition, there is little evidence of clinically relevant differences in diffusion (by inference, the field of effect) between BoNT-A formulations.– These studies show that dose, not product, is the driver of the field of effect. For instance, a direct comparison of equal labeled doses (2 units) in the same injection volume (isovolumetric) found that the horizontal and vertical diameters and the areas of the fields of effect were significantly larger for Botox than those obtained for Dysport indicating an underdose of Dysport/more potent dose of Botox. This finding emphasizes that units of each product are specific to that product family and are not readily interchangeable. No significant differences emerged in the Wrinkle Severity Scale scores and evoked compound muscle action potentials. Therefore, these findings confirm that diffusion is dose dependent and the higher dose tested diffuses more.

Carli and colleaguescompared the diffusion of Botox (0.25 units), Dysport (1.0 unit), and Xeomin (0.25 units) using a mouse model of neural cell adhesion molecule expression. No significant difference emerged between the 3 products in terms of the diffusion results obtained and the BoNT-A formulations did not differ in the extent of their "spread" into adjacent muscles. Furthermore, a comparison of Dysport and Botox in 59 women with forehead wrinkles reported that a 2:1 dose ratio (Dysport:Botox units) was associated with statistically equivalent fields for muscle effects and anhidrosis. At a dose ratio of 2.5:1, Dysport showed greater area and larger horizontal diameter in the field of anhidrotic effect at both 28 and 112 days compared to Botox. These results further support the hypothesis that dose is the most important factor influencing the size of the field of effect.

Against this background, careful placement of the correct dosing of BoNT-A offers the best chance of good patient outcomes. Further studies are warranted to characterize the relative importance of the numerous factors that influence comparative data on efficacy, diffusion, and spread. In the meantime, the lack of definitive data on the conversion rate between the various formulations of BoNT-A means that individual studies might have used suboptimal doses and counsels against drawing "too firm a conclusion from any 1 trial". Moreover, different areas of the body may require different doses of BoNT-A for a clinical effect, reflecting differences in muscular structure and function.

### Facial contouring by using dermal fillers and botulinum toxin A: a practical approach [^111QoV53]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The number of patients asking for aesthetic procedures has been exponentially increased over the last several years. In most cases, these aesthetic procedures are elective and, therefore, the patient's satisfaction is first and foremost. However, once the patient's treatment goals have been discussed and agreed, the specialist has the responsibility to discuss in depth which treatment approach is best suited to the patient's needs, as well as the limitations of such approach in general.

Because beauty is not an exact science and critically depends on social, cultural and ethnic factors, the aesthetic treatment approach should not be focused on producing "common perfect faces", but rather to enhance those features that define the patient's face. To offer the best possible outcomes, the aesthetic specialist should think about comprehensive approaches looking at the whole face and at different tissue depths to determine the appropriate treatment approach.

Our strategies provide a whole treatment approach based on a specific diagnostic methodology that pays special attention to facial morphology. As was stated in Methods, these strategies are based on The MD codes ®, which favors the use of a methodical technique in all treatment settings and for all facial areas.

The goal of our treatment strategies is to enhance those features of the face personality that may give it an individualized touch of beauty or distinction, as well as to soften or cover up those aspects that can be considered as unattractive. However, it is essential to be careful to avoid creating "standard faces" that might remove important aspects of the patient personality.

Although with these approaches we also try to minimize the impact of slight asymmetries on the final outcome, they have not been designed for correcting moderate to severe asymmetries. The current literature has highlighted different causal factors as responsible for the development of facial asymmetries, including congenital, pathological, traumatic, functional or developmental causal factors. Haraguchi et al. reported that in minor facial asymmetry, the right hemiface is wider than the left hemiface with a chin deviation to the left side.

BTX-A Injection

BTX-A injections were administered by experienced neurologists, with the choice between lanbotulinumtoxinA (Hengli; Lanzhou Institute of Biological Products, Lanzhou, China) and onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox, Abbvie, Chicago, IL) based on patient preference. The dose conversion ratio between these two types of BTX-A was 1:1. Each 100 U vial was diluted with 4.0 mL of physiological saline, resulting in a concentration of 2.5 U per 0.1 mL. Injections were performed using a 30-gauge needle attached to a 1-mL syringe. For routine injections, BTX-A was administered into muscles on the affected side, including orbicularis oculi, corrugator supercilii, zygomaticus major, zygomaticus minor, levator labii superioris alaeque nasi, risorius, orbicularis oris, mentalis, depressor anguli oris, and platysma. The dose per injection site ranged from 2.5 to 3.75 U, tailored to the individual manifestation and severity of HFS. To address facial asymmetry, BTX-A was also injected into corresponding muscles on the non-affected contralateral side, with a reduced dose per injection site of 1.25 U, as reported previously. Injections were typically repeated every 3 to 4 months based on the duration of the therapeutic effect and the recurrence of HFS symptoms.

### Use of letibotulinumtoxinA for aesthetic treatment of Asians: a consensus [^113VQ6yv]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Nasal Oblique Lines (Bunny Lines)

The nasalis muscle is the main muscle responsible for bunny lines. However, the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi, procerus, and depressor supercilli muscles are also sometimes involved. Asians usually have a stronger nasalis than Caucasians; therefore the total injection dose for Asians is higher than that described in previous studies focusing on Caucasians.

Anatomy

The nasalis muscle is a wide paired muscle on the nasal dorsum and ala. The transverse part is C-shaped, originating from the maxilla, thin and flat with a triangular shape, and covers and compresses the nasal dorsum. It is located deep in the alar region, ascends to the dorsum of the nose, and contracts to form bunny lines.

Injection Technique

The total recommended dose for the nasalis in Asians is approximately 2 to 4 units per side. Synergistic muscles (levator labii superioris alaeque nasi, or LLSAN) should be treated simultaneously if needed.

Perioral Wrinkles

Movements of the orbicularis oris contribute to radial perioral rhytids. The minimum dose is recommended because the perioral area is highly delicate, and unwanted diffusion of the toxin can lead to functional impairment of the lips. Deeper rhytids should be treated in combination with injectable fillers or laser resurfacing.

Anatomy

The orbicularis oris, a constrictor of the mouth, is a layered sphincter muscle that encircles the mouth and is located in the upper and lower lips. Most muscle fibers originate from other facial muscles that converge in the mouth. Anatomically, the orbicularis oris is divided into 4 quadrants, which are further divided into the pars peripheralis and pars marginalis. When contracted, the orbicularis oris muscle closes the mouth and puckers the lips in the manner of a sphincter.

Injection Technique

Nonmicrodroplet injection involves 4 to 12 intradermal injection sites within 5 mm of the vermilion border. It is important to ensure symmetry and avoid philtral ridges and oral commissures. Fine lines can be treated with microdroplet injections, which involve evenly distributed intradermal injection sites around the mouth with a total dose of no more than 6 units.

### OnabotulinumtoxinA in resistant depression: a randomized trial comparing two facial injection sites (onaDEP study) [^112Tyq76]. Depression and Anxiety (2024). Medium credibility.

2.3. Study Treatment

In the present study, we sought a procedure that would result in the best control group. The injection of OnaA in the OO muscle is used in aesthetics to reduce crow's feet wrinkles located on the outer part of the eyes. The OO injections seemed to us a satisfying control group. It has, like glabellar injections, a positive cosmetic effect by reducing wrinkles in the corner of the eyes. The lateral part of the OO is not involved in the facial expression of sadness but rather in the facial expression of joy since it contracts during the "true" smile, or Duchenne smile, which involves both the mouth and the eyes. We could therefore expect that by weakening this muscle, there would be no confounding antidepressant effect.

In the present study, all patients received the active product (OnaA), thus the randomization related to the injection site (glabella area versus crow's feet area), the patient being blind to which area was thought to be effective in resistant depression. The examiner (CCM) did not know which area had been injected, the patient was asked not to tell her where he/she had been injected.

A vial of 50 Botox units was diluted in 0.5 mL of 0.9% NaCl solution. This concentration (10 U/0.1 ml) was chosen to avoid as many local side effects, such as ptosis, as possible. Indeed, these side effects are linked to diffusion to adjacent muscles, which is proportional to the employed dilution. Injections were performed using a 30-gauge needle. Depending on the randomization botulinum toxin was injected:
– In the glabella region: 5 units (U) in the procerus muscle, 5 units in each corrugator muscle.
– In the crow's feet region: 15 units in the OO muscle, in three sites bilaterally.

Safety was assessed through the study.

The primary outcome measure was the proportion of responders in glabella group versus crow's feet group at 6 weeks after OnaA injection. Response was characterized as a 50% or greater decrease in MADRS score from baseline.

### Complications of botulinum toxin A use in facial rejuvenation [^113E3xEc]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

The esthetic application of botulinum toxin type A (Botox) is a safe treatment modality; nevertheless complications can occur as a result of patient-and physician-related factors. Fortunately, adverse effects and undesirable sequelae after Botox injections are temporary. Complications may be more serious in patients who have more severe rhytids (which require more Botox), previous facial plastic surgery (altered anatomy), and those who have pre-existing neuromuscular disease. The physician can reduce complications by using proper injection techniques, appropriate regional Botox dosing, and by being conservative in the overall approach to Botox-mediated facial rejuvenation.
