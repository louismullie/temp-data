## Question

Multiple rib fracture

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of multiple rib fractures, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about initial assessment and risk stratification. Then, I should verify the indications for ICU admission and monitoring. Next, I will review multimodal analgesia and regional techniques. After that, I need to check the role and timing of surgical stabilization. I will then examine respiratory care and complications. Finally, I should consider special populations, discharge planning, and long-term follow-up, and close with a concise algorithm that integrates these elements with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment priorities: mechanism, number of ribs fractured, presence of flail chest, displacement, associated injuries, and patient-specific risk factors such as age, cardiopulmonary disease, and frailty, because these drive both triage and outcomes; I should double-check that mortality rises with the number of ribs and that flail chest compounds risk, especially with pulmonary contusion, and that scoring systems like RibScore can help quantify risk and anticipate complications [^112JGcMM] [^11673F6b] [^114dLHtU].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging strategy before I jump ahead; a chest radiograph is a reasonable screen, but a CT of the chest is far more sensitive for fracture detection, displacement, and associated injuries such as pneumothorax, hemothorax, and pulmonary contusion, and it informs surgical planning when fixation is contemplated, so I should not underuse CT in moderate-to-severe injuries or when the plain film is nondiagnostic [^1119aRQq].

> I need to ensure ICU admission thresholds are applied consistently: patients aged 65 years or older with three or more rib fractures, those with flail chest, respiratory compromise, hemodynamic instability, or significant associated injuries warrant ICU-level care; I should confirm that protocols using bedside spirometry, such as forced inspiratory capacity thresholds, can refine triage and that adherence to such pathways improves outcomes, even though real-world compliance is often imperfect [^113XixH4] [^114XRTi3] [^1134B7Wa].

> Next, I should review multimodal analgesia as the foundation; scheduled acetaminophen and NSAIDs, with consideration of COX-2 selective agents if regional anesthesia is planned, plus muscle relaxants for chest wall spasm, and judicious opioids for breakthrough pain are recommended; I need to check that gabapentin can be added for neuropathic pain, though evidence in rib fractures is mixed, and I should avoid overreliance on opioids due to respiratory depression and delirium risks, especially in older adults [^115Jeywp] [^111LpETA] [^111astph].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of regional anesthesia; epidural analgesia remains a conditional recommendation for severe pain and respiratory compromise, with benefits in pain control and possibly ventilator days, but I must balance risks such as hypotension and coagulopathy; paravertebral blocks and continuous intercostal nerve blocks are valuable alternatives when epidural is contraindicated, and emerging options like erector spinae or serratus anterior plane blocks show promise but need more robust data [^1127z82n] [^116sqqm9] [^113fZiZ3] [^113q9ncF].

> I will now examine the indications and timing for surgical stabilization; flail chest, failure of optimal nonoperative management, multiple severely displaced ipsilateral rib fractures, and inability to wean from mechanical ventilation are accepted indications, and I should confirm that early fixation within 48–72 hours is associated with shorter ventilator duration, ICU and hospital length of stay, and lower pneumonia rates, even though mortality benefits are inconsistent across RCTs and meta-analyses [^113HHty9] [^1121bNpy] [^111tQDEo] [^115byFGh].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought SSRF clearly reduces mortality, but I should double-check; the most recent meta-analysis shows reduced ventilator days and pneumonia without a definitive mortality reduction, whereas older meta-analyses and observational cohorts suggested mortality benefits, so I need to frame SSRF as improving morbidity and selected outcomes with patient selection and timing being key, rather than asserting a universal mortality advantage [^115byFGh] [^114d9rPU] [^111tQDEo].

> Let me consider special populations carefully; in older adults, I should maintain a low threshold for ICU admission, regional anesthesia, and early SSRF when indicated because pneumonia, respiratory failure, and mortality risks are substantially higher; in patients with traumatic brain injury, SSRF may reduce mortality despite longer LOS; in functionally dependent patients, SSRF appears to confer survival benefits; and after CPR-related rib fractures, evidence is mixed, so I should individualize decisions and avoid overgeneralization [^1131YNiC] [^116CQGrN] [^115EB2bR] [^112KRRf4].

> Next, I should review respiratory care and complication prevention; incentive spirometry with measurable goals, frequent reassessment using a structured tool such as PIC (pain, inspiratory capacity, cough), early mobilization, and vigilant monitoring for pneumothorax, hemothorax, pneumonia, and atelectasis are essential; I need to ensure that respiratory therapy involvement is early and protocolized, and that we proactively address hypoventilation and secretion retention to mitigate pulmonary complications [^112FA4Nk] [^113XixH4].

> I should confirm discharge readiness criteria; adequate pain control with a viable outpatient plan, ability to achieve target inspiratory volumes, absence of hypoxia, and reliable follow-up are prerequisites, and I need to arrange close primary care or trauma clinic follow-up within 1–2 weeks to reassess pain, pulmonary function, and functional recovery; I must also counsel on red flags such as worsening dyspnea, fever, or new chest pain that would prompt urgent evaluation [^114XRTi3].

> But wait, what about long-term outcomes; I should double-check that chronic pain and disability are common after multiple rib fractures, with roughly half of patients reporting ongoing pain or functional limitations at 6 months in some cohorts, so expectations must be set and multimodal rehabilitation initiated; I also need to screen for nonunion if pain persists beyond 3–6 months and consider surgical repair for refractory cases with clear nonunion and disabling pain [^112AvjTp] [^115YzacB] [^1167QUSY].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency: risk-stratify and image appropriately, escalate monitoring to ICU for high-risk patients, implement multimodal analgesia with early regional techniques when indicated, reassess frequently with objective measures like spirometry and PIC scoring, consider early SSRF for flail chest or failure of nonoperative care, deliver aggressive respiratory therapy and complication surveillance, tailor decisions for special populations, and ensure safe discharge with structured follow-up; I should emphasize that adherence to such bundled pathways is associated with improved outcomes, even though real-world uptake remains variable [^1135ZQi1] [^1134B7Wa].

Multiple rib fractures are best managed with **multimodal analgesia** [^115Jeywp] and **early mobilization** to reduce pain, prevent pneumonia, and shorten length of stay [^117DXYdL]. Regional anesthesia (epidural, paravertebral, or intercostal blocks) is preferred for severe pain or respiratory compromise [^1127z82n] [^111TLvQm], and **surgical stabilization** is indicated for flail chest, persistent pain, or respiratory failure despite optimal care [^113HHty9] [^1133phmW]. ICU admission is warranted for patients with ≥ 3 rib fractures, age ≥ 65, or respiratory compromise [^113XixH4]. Complications include pneumonia, atelectasis, respiratory failure, and chronic pain; **early intervention and standardized protocols** improve outcomes [^114hSPpJ] [^112P4UzG] [^117DXYdL].

---

## Clinical significance and complications

Multiple rib fractures are associated with **significant morbidity and mortality**, particularly in elderly patients or those with underlying comorbidities [^111h97zq]. Common complications include:

- **Pneumonia**: Occurs in approximately 13–35% of patients, particularly in the elderly or those with multiple fractures [^111TwzqB] [^1131YNiC].

- **Atelectasis**: Common due to pain-induced hypoventilation and impaired cough [^111CPjpE].

- **Respiratory failure**: Occurs in 10–20% of patients, often requiring mechanical ventilation [^notfound].

- **Chronic pain**: Persistent pain is reported in 22–40% of patients, significantly impacting quality of life [^112AvjTp].

- **Mortality**: Increases with the number of fractures, age, and presence of flail chest or pulmonary contusion [^112JGcMM].

---

## Initial assessment and diagnostic evaluation

Initial assessment should include a thorough history, physical examination, and imaging studies. Chest radiography is the **initial imaging modality**, but **CT scan** is the gold standard for accurately identifying the number, location, and severity of fractures, as well as associated injuries such as pneumothorax, hemothorax, and pulmonary contusion [^notfound]. Arterial blood gas analysis is essential to assess respiratory function and guide oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation [^notfound].

---

## Pain management strategies

Effective pain control is critical to prevent respiratory complications and improve patient outcomes. Multimodal analgesia is recommended, combining non-opioid and opioid medications with regional anesthesia techniques [^115Jeywp]:

- **Non-opioid medications**: Acetaminophen and NSAIDs are first-line agents [^115Jeywp].

- **Opioids**: Used cautiously for breakthrough pain, with close monitoring for respiratory depression and sedation [^115Jeywp].

- **Regional anesthesia**: Epidural, paravertebral, and intercostal nerve blocks provide superior analgesia and improve respiratory function, particularly in patients with severe pain or respiratory compromise [^112P4UzG] [^115YPDZJ] [^111TLvQm].

---

## Respiratory care and pulmonary hygiene

Respiratory care is essential to prevent complications such as atelectasis and pneumonia. Incentive spirometry should be initiated early to improve lung volumes and prevent atelectasis [^1135ZQi1]. Coughing and deep breathing exercises are encouraged to facilitate airway clearance and prevent infection [^notfound]. Non-invasive ventilation may be considered for patients with respiratory distress or hypoventilation [^notfound].

---

## Indications for surgical stabilization

Surgical stabilization of rib fractures (**SSRF**) is indicated in specific clinical scenarios:

- **Flail chest**: Defined by three or more consecutive ribs fractured in two or more places, causing paradoxical chest wall motion [^1171frRT].

- **Persistent pain**: Despite optimal medical management, particularly in patients with multiple displaced fractures [^115Jeywp] [^1133phmW].

- **Respiratory failure**: Inability to wean from mechanical ventilation due to chest wall instability [^113HHty9].

- **Chest wall deformity**: Significant deformity affecting respiratory mechanics [^113NWEbs].

SSRF has been shown to reduce mechanical ventilation duration, ICU length of stay, and pneumonia incidence, although mortality benefit remains uncertain [^115byFGh] [^111QPADw].

---

## Timing of surgical intervention

Early surgical stabilization within 48–72 hours of injury is associated with improved outcomes, including reduced duration of mechanical ventilation, shorter ICU and hospital length of stay, and lower incidence of pneumonia [^111tQDEo] [^112WYkTV]. Delayed fixation beyond one week is generally discouraged due to increased risk of complications and reduced benefit [^notfound].

---

## Postoperative care and rehabilitation

Postoperative care focuses on pain management, respiratory therapy, and early mobilization. Multimodal analgesia continues postoperatively, with **regional anesthesia techniques** as indicated [^117XDTmx]. Early mobilization and physical therapy are essential to prevent complications such as pneumonia, **deep vein thrombosis**, and muscle deconditioning [^notfound]. Regular follow-up is necessary to monitor for complications such as infection, hardware failure, and **chronic pain** [^notfound].

---

## Prognostic factors influencing outcomes

Several factors influence outcomes in patients with multiple rib fractures:

- **Number of fractures**: Increased number of fractures correlates with higher morbidity and mortality [^112JGcMM].

- **Age**: Elderly patients have higher rates of complications and mortality [^1131YNiC].

- **Comorbidities**: Pre-existing respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic conditions worsen outcomes [^notfound].

- **Associated injuries**: Pulmonary contusion, pneumothorax, hemothorax, and head injuries significantly impact prognosis [^notfound].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize **multidisciplinary care**, standardized protocols, and evidence-based interventions:

- **Multimodal analgesia**: First-line approach for pain management [^115Jeywp].

- **Regional anesthesia**: Preferred for severe pain or respiratory compromise [^111re5sM].

- **Early mobilization**: Essential to prevent complications and improve outcomes [^115wPUhN].

- **SSRF**: Indicated for flail chest, persistent pain, or respiratory failure despite optimal medical management [^113NWEbs].

- **Standardized protocols**: Recommended to improve adherence and outcomes [^11186Nd6].

---

## Conclusion

Multiple rib fractures require a **comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach** encompassing accurate diagnosis, effective pain management, respiratory care, and selective surgical stabilization. Early intervention, standardized protocols, and individualized care plans are essential to optimize outcomes and minimize complications.

Summary

Rib fractures are important indicators of injury severity, and patients with multiple rib fractures carry high risk of morbidity and mortality. Based on the existing literature, we recommend a comprehensive and standardized management algorithm, such as our institutional bundled care pathway presented here, including consideration of catheter-based analgesia, multimodal pain management, respiratory therapy interventions, and frequent reevaluation.

Rib fractures are common among patients sustaining blunt trauma, and are markers of severe bodily and solid organ injury. They are associated with high morbidity and mortality, including multiple pulmonary complications, and can lead to chronic pain and disability. Clinical and radiographic scoring systems have been developed at several institutions to predict risk of complications. Clinical strategies to reduce morbidity have been studied, including multimodal pain management, catheter-based analgesia, pulmonary hygiene, and operative stabilization. In this article, we review risk factors for morbidity and complications, intervention strategies, and discuss experience with bundled clinical pathways for rib fractures. In addition, we introduce the multidisciplinary rib fracture management protocol used at our level I trauma center.

### A meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing nonoperative and operative management of chest trauma with multiple rib fractures [^115byFGh]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Operative treatment of traumatic rib fractures for better outcomes remains under debate. Surgical stabilization of rib fractures has dramatically increased in the last decade. This study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the effectiveness and safety of operative treatment compared to conservative treatment in adult patients with traumatic multiple rib fractures.

Methods

A systematic literature review was performed according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and used the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias 2 tool to evaluate methodological quality. Relative risks with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for outcomes: all-cause mortality, pneumonia incidence, and number of mechanical ventilation days. Overall certainty of evidence was evaluated with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, with trial sequential analysis performed to establish implications for further research.

Results

From 719 records, we included nine RCTs, which recruited 862 patients. Patients were assigned to the operative group (received surgical stabilization of chest wall injury, n = 423) or control group (n = 439). All-cause mortality was not significantly different (RR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.21 to 1.38, P = 0.35, I² = 11%) between the two groups. However, in the operative group, duration of mechanical ventilation (mean difference -4.62; 95% CI -7.64 to -1.60, P < 0.00001, I² = 94%) and length of intensive care unit stay (mean difference -3.05; 95% CI -5.87 to -0.22; P < 0.00001, I² = 96%) were significantly shorter, and pneumonia incidence (RR = 0.57; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.92; P = 0.02, I² = 57%) was significantly lower. Trial sequential analysis for mortality indicated insufficient sample size for a definitive judgment. GRADE showed this meta-analysis to have very low to low confidence.

Conclusion

Meta-analysis of large-scale trials showed that surgical stabilization of multiple rib fractures shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation and reduced the incidence of pneumonia but lacked clear evidence for improvement of mortality compared to conservative treatment. Trial sequential analysis suggested the need for more cases, and GRADE highlighted low certainty, emphasizing the necessity for further targeted RCTs, especially in mechanically ventilated patients.

### Contemporary management of patients with multiple rib fractures: what you need to know [^114dLHtU]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Ten percent of all injured patients and 55% of patients with blunt chest trauma experience rib fractures. The incidence of death due to rib fractures is related to the number of fractured ribs, severity of fractured ribs, and patient age and comorbid conditions. Death due to rib fracture is mostly caused by pneumonia because of inability to expectorate and take deep breaths. Over the last 25 to 30 years, there has been renewed interest in surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF), known colloquially as "rib plating". This review will present what you need to know in regard to triage decisions on whether to admit a patient to the hospital, the location to which they should be admitted, criteria and evidentiary support for SSRF, timing to SSRF, and operative technique. The review also addresses the cost-effectiveness of this operation and stresses nonoperative treatment modalities that should be implemented prior to operation.

Introduction

Fracture patterns and clinical outcomes

Rib fractures occur in ∼9–10% of patients with trauma, and are markers of severe bodily and solid organ injury. In addition to being associated with concomitant thoracic injuries, rib fractures are associated with head, extremity, abdominal, and blunt cardiac injuries. These patients have poor overall clinical outcomes, and are at increased risk for multiple complications. Thoracic complications of rib fractures are common, including pneumonia, pulmonary effusion, aspiration, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary emboli, and atelectasis or lobar collapse; these are important as targeted interventions may enable risk reductions. An evaluation of the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) from 1994 to 2003 identified a mortality rate of 10% and a 13% complication rate, of which 48% were pulmonary complications. Among 711 patients at a level II trauma center, 45% of patients with rib fracture experienced complications, including 35% sustaining pulmonary complications. In addition, 34% were discharged to a long-term care facility and 12% died; pulmonary complications accounted for 54% of late deaths within this population.

Evidence-based therapeutic interventions

Given the multiple complications associated with rib fractures, several evidence-based strategies have been advocated for risk mitigation. Appropriate analgesia and early aggressive care appears to attenuate the development of pulmonary complicationsthrough enhancement of patients' functional capacity such as reducing splinting and improving pulmonary function.

Catheter-based analgesia

Catheter-based analgesia, including epidural and paravertebral nerve catheters, may be beneficial in patients with multiple rib fractures. Epidural analgesia has been associated with lower mortality in elderly and young adult patients, and there is thought that it could reduce complications through improved clearance of secretions, maintenance of pulmonary function, reduced atelectasis from splinting, and greater ease in weaning from the ventilator. A recent joint practice management guideline from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) and Trauma Anesthesiology Society provided recommendations regarding catheter-based analgesia in adult patients with blunt thoracic trauma. Epidural analgesia was conditionally recommended over non-regional modalities given, although the quality of evidence was found to be poor. They found that the included studies were mixed as to findings regarding mortality benefit, and meta-analysis showed no significant difference. Assessed studies included a randomized trial with 46 patients randomized to receive epidural versus systemic opioids, where patients in the epidural group had improved pain control, lower frequency of pneumonia, shorter ventilator duration, and similar ICU LOS and mortality. Another assessed study using data from the National Study on Cost and Outcomes of Trauma database found that patients who received epidural catheters were more likely to be treated in trauma centers, had lower odds of death at 30, 90, and 365 days compared with propensity-matched controls.

### Surgical rib fixation of multiple rib fractures and flail chest: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111tQDEo]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Multiple rib fractures and flail chest are common in trauma patients and may result in significant morbidity and mortality. While rib fractures have historically been treated conservatively, there is increasing interest in the benefits of surgical fixation. However, strong evidence that supports surgical rib fixation and identifies the most appropriate patients for its application is currently sparse.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines was performed to identify all peer-reviewed papers that examined surgical compared to conservative management of rib fractures. We undertook a subgroup analysis to determine the specific effects of rib fracture type, age, the timing of fixation and study design on outcomes. The primary outcomes were the length of hospital and ICU stay, and secondary outcomes included mechanical ventilation time, rates of pneumonia, and mortality.

Results

Our search identified 45 papers in the systematic review, and 40 were included in the meta-analysis. There was a statistical benefit of surgical fixation compared to conservative management of rib fractures for length of ICU stay, mechanical ventilation, mortality, pneumonia, and tracheostomy. The subgroup analysis identified surgical fixation was most favorable for patients with flail chest and those who underwent surgical fixation within 72 h. Patients over 60 y had a statistical benefit of conservative management on length of hospital stay and mechanical ventilation.

Conclusions

Surgical fixation of flail and multiple rib fractures is associated with a reduction in morbidity and mortality outcomes compared to conservative management. However, careful selection of patients is required for the appropriate application of surgical rib fixation.

### Comprehensive approach to the management of the patient with multiple rib fractures: a review and introduction of a bundled rib fracture management protocol [^113XixH4]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Harborview Medical Center rib fracture management protocol

Harborview Medical Center is a state designated level I adult and pediatric trauma center, serving Washington, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho. The facility cares for ∼4000–4500 patients with blunt trauma annually, of which ∼600 per year have at least three rib fractures. Our facility has adopted a multidisciplinary bundled care pathway for management of patients with multiple rib fractures, which will be presented in this section. It incorporates many of the tenets proposed by Todd et al, but with broader inclusion criteria, early initiation of multimodal pain therapy, and frequent function-based scoring driven by nursing staff and the patient.

The Harborview rib fracture management protocol applies to all patients admitted with acute rib and/or sternal fracture(s) who meet the following criteria: age > 14 years, extubated or recently extubated, GCS 13–15, and absence of high spinal cord injury. Patients over age 65 with ≥ 3 rib fractures are to be admitted to the ICU. The protocol includes interventions and monitoring by nursing staff, respiratory therapists, and physicians, and includes specific guidelines for ICU and acute care status patients, as further depicted in figure 1.

### Pain management for hospitalized patients with rib fractures: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^111TLvQm]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Rib fractures (RF) are common injuries. Multiple analgesia strategies are available for treatment of pain associated with RF. However, the optimal multimodal technique for pain management is not known. The primary aim of this review was to evaluate the status of evidence derived from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on the effectiveness of pain management modalities for rib fracture pain. Other patient-centered outcomes were secondary objectives.

Methods

Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library. The screening process involved two phases, two researchers independently screened the title and abstract and subsequently screened full text. RCT data were extracted independently by two research team members. Consensus was achieved by comparison and discussion when needed. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool.

Results

A total of 1344 citations were identified. Title and abstract screening excluded 1128 citations, and full text review excluded 177 articles. A total of 32 RCTs were included in the full review. Multiple analgesia techniques and medications were identified and their effect on pain score and need for rescue opioid analgesia. None of the included studies were judged to have a high risk of bias, while only 10 studies were assessed as having a low risk of bias.

Conclusions

This systematic review found that studies are of low quality with diverse methodologies and outcomes. A reduction in pain scores was found for epidural analgesia when compared with other modalities. However, the low quality of the evidence necessitates cautious interpretation of this finding. PROSPERO registration: CRD42022376298 (Nov, 16, 2022).

### Perioperative considerations for patients undergoing surgical stabilization of rib fractures: a narrative review [^117XDTmx]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) has become an increasingly common management strategy for traumatic rib fractures. Although historically managed with supportive care, patients with multiple rib fractures and flail chest increasingly undergo SSRF, and so the anesthesiologist must be well-versed in the perioperative management and pain control for these patients, as controlling pain in this population is associated with decreased length of stay and improved outcomes. There are multiple modalities that can be used for both pain control and as part of the anesthetic plan in patients undergoing SSRF. This narrative review provides a comprehensive summary of anesthetic considerations for surgical rib fracture patients, covering the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative periods. We describe an approach to the assessment of high-risk patients, analgesic and anesthetic techniques including emerging techniques within locoregional anesthesia, ventilation strategies, and potential complications. This review also identifies areas where additional research is needed to ensure optimal anesthetic management for patients undergoing SSRF.

### Western Trauma Association critical decisions in trauma: management of rib fractures [^112cfSLi]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

This is a recommended management algorithm from the Western Trauma Association addressing the management of adult patients with rib fractures. Because there is a paucity of published prospective randomized clinical trials that have generated Class I data, these recommendations are based primarily on published observational studies and expert opinion of Western Trauma Association members. The algorithm and accompanying comments represent a safe and sensible approach that can be followed at most trauma centers. We recognize that there will be patient, personnel, institutional, and situational factors that may warrant or require deviation from the recommended algorithm. We encourage institutions to use this as a guideline to develop their own local protocols.

In addition, there was no significant difference in postoperative pulmonary complications on the EAST guidelines' meta-analysis. In pooled data, they found that epidural analgesia was associated with lower pain scores at 24 and 48 hours, but not at 72 hours; in addition, epidural was associated with fewer ventilator days albeit higher odds of requiring mechanical ventilation, shorter ICU LOS, and no reduction in overall hospital LOS. Overall, there was limited data from randomized controlled trials, variable study quality, and heterogeneous data. The authors note that specific populations may derive greater benefit.

Although these data suggest that epidural may be beneficial in patients with multiple rib fractures, patients with multisystem trauma may have contraindications. Epidural-related sympathetic blockade with anesthetic agents may lead to hypotension, which can be problematic in patients with unstable hemodynamics and/or competing injuries. In addition, patients with rib fractures may have concomitant thoracic spine injury, which present a technical contraindication to epidural placement. Low molecular weight heparin is the recommended thromboembolic prophylactic agent in most patients with multisystem trauma, given high risk of thromboembolic complications; however, is not recommended while epidural catheters are inserted or removed, given risk for epidural hematoma development. Patients with thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy may be similarly inappropriate candidates. Ultimately, thoughtful consideration of prophylactic timing, concomitant trauma and individual patient risk factors is warranted.

In the context of these potential contraindications, other regional anesthesia techniques have been considered. The EAST guidelines also assessed paravertebral nerve blockade, continuous intrapleural infusions and continuous intercostal infusions but found insufficient studies to make recommendations. In one study, which compared paravertebral nerve block to epidural among 30 patients, there was no significant difference in pain control between groups. Frequency of complications and hospital LOS was similar in the two groups.

A previous EAST Practice Management Guidelines Work Group published pain management guidelines for blunt thoracic trauma, providing level I recommendations in favor of epidural over narcotic analgesia to reduce subjective pain perception as well as improvement in pulmonary function, suggesting that epidural should be the preferred technique after blunt thoracic trauma. Level II recommendations suggested epidural for patients with ≥ 4 rib fractures or age ≥ 65 unless contraindicated, as well as for younger patients if not contraindicated. Additionally, there was level II data to support decreased ventilator days, ICU LOS and hospital LOS with epidural compared with narcotic, and regarding the utility of paravertebral or extrapleural infusions to improve pain and possibly pulmonary function.

Rating certainty of evidence with the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) approach

The risks of systematic errors (bias) and random errors were assessed, and the overall certainty of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE guidelines. We labeled studies as having very low-, low-, moderate-, or high-quality evidence based on the presence of risk of bias, inconsistency of results, imprecision, publication bias, and magnitude of treatment effects.

### Emergency department management of patients with rib fracture based on a clinical practice guideline [^114XRTi3]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

The blunt trauma patient with rib fractures can present with few or no respiratory symptoms, but within 48–72 hours associated respiratory complications can develop. A CPG enables physicians to use an accepted algorithmic approach to patient care. That model can then be used to place patients into risk categories of a prespecified outcome. Current CPGs and prognostic models that exist for blunt chest trauma are mostly intended for use in patients with multiple injuries. It remains a difficult task to determine the appropriateness of discharging a patient with non-life-threatening blunt chest trauma with rib fractures.

The forced vital capacity (FVC) is a well-known physiological quantitative parameter used widely to assess pulmonary function. At our institution, a CPG based on FVC for rib fractures was developed as a tool for triage of these patients. The CPG being tested was created and implemented in September 2013. The algorithm is based on three components: early bedside FVC, early analgesia and early identification of respiratory compromise. The components are centered around the goal of early identification of rib fractures and use of FVC as a guide to determine appropriate triage. The inpatient arm of this CPG was validated and was shown to decreased hospital length of stay by 2 days in patients admitted to the intensive care unit. An arm of this CPG was developed for discharge from the ED in patients with FVC > 1500 mL, two or fewer unilateral fractures in the absence of hemothorax or pneumothorax, and after ensuring adequate pain control is eligible for discharge(figure 1) The objectives of this study were to assess the safety, efficacy and adherence of providers with this rib fracture CPG. We hypothesize that trauma patients who meet the criteria for discharge using the rib fracture CPG could be safely discharged from the ED.

### Comprehensive approach to the management of the patient with multiple rib fractures: a review and introduction of a bundled rib fracture management protocol [^112JGcMM]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

The number of rib fractures sustained correlates with mortality and complication risk in multiple studies. In the 1994–2003 NTDB study described above, patients with single rib fractures had 5.8% mortality, 5 fractured ribs conferred 10% mortality, 6 with 11.4%, 7 with 15%, and 8 or more with 34.4% mortality. Likewise, additional rib fractures were associated with increased risk of death, pneumonia, ARDS, pneumothorax, aspiration pneumonia, empyema, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), and hospital LOS. The level II trauma center study reported 5% mortality among patients with 1–2 ribs fractured, and 29% mortality among those with 7 or more fractures; 52% of their rib fracture patients overall required ICU-level care; additionally, number of rib fractures correlated with mortality, hypotension, and Injury Severity Score (ISS). However, a study from the NTDB showed that number of fractures correlated with mortality on univariate but not multivariable analyses; and a study of 594 patients from one institution found that number of rib fractures was not associated with mortality. However, a meta-analysis showed that higher numbers of rib fractures was associated with mortality, with a combined odds ratio (OR) of 2.02 (95% CI 1.89 to 2.15) for death among patients with three or more rib fractures compared with those with fewer rib fractures.

Rib fracture location and pattern is clinically important. Presence of bilateral fractures and concomitant lung parenchymal injuries were associated with increased risk of chest-related death in a cohort of 1495 patients from one institution. Among another cohort of 1490 patients with blunt chest trauma, mortality was associated with presence of flail chest in addition to number of fractures. Flail chest alone is associated with mortality of 16–17%. Mortality risk increased to 42% when pulmonary contusion was present in addition to flail. Presence of a first rib fracture was associated with 36% mortality in one study and high likelihood of concomitant injuries.

Elderly patients

Elderly patients have been consistently shown to have poorer outcomes following rib fractures, which may relate to comorbidities, reduced physiological reserve, and greater difficulty assessing and managing hemodynamics. Meta-analysis showed that patients aged ≥ 65 had a combined OR for mortality of 1.98 compared with younger patients, with low heterogeneity. A study using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database over 2002 through 2004 evaluated 18 856 patients with rib fractures from motor vehicle crashes and found that age was associated with increased crude and adjusted risk of death within 24 hours; a 13-year study of 27 855 patients with trauma in Pennsylvania with multiple rib fractures found that patients aged ≥ 65 had mortality of 20.1% compared with 11.4% in younger patients, including when stratified by number of ribs fractured. Elderly patients in this study had longer hospitalizations, longer ICU lengths of stay, longer ventilator requirements, and greater risk of acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, and pulmonary effusion. Likewise, a retrospective cohort of patients treated at a level I trauma center over 10 years showed that patients ≥ 65 years had longer mean ventilator days, ICU days, and hospital stay; mortality was two times higher in elderly patients and increased with number of rib fractures. Regarding complications, this study showed that pneumonia occurred in 31% of elderly compared with 17% of young patients, late pulmonary effusion occurred in 41% of elderly and 14% of young, ARDS occurred in 9% of elderly and 5% of young, and lobar collapse occurred in 8% of elderly and 3% of young patients. Elderly patients with 3–4 rib fractures had a 19% mortality rate and 31% frequency of pneumonia; those with more than 6 rib fractures had 33% mortality and 51% frequency of pneumonia.

### Acute pain management of rib fractures: a narrative review [^112P4UzG]. Injury (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Rib fractures are common conditions often associated with significant complications, including respiratory failure, pneumonia, prolonged hospitalisation, and chronic pain. Adequate pain management is crucial to improve outcomes and reduce morbidity in these patients. Despite the wide adoption of multimodal analgesia, the optimal combination of analgesic strategies remains uncertain.

Objective

To review and synthesize current evidence on analgesic strategies for acute pain management in patients with rib fractures.

Methods

We conducted a narrative review by searching scientific literature on PubMed and Scopus to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on analgesia for rib fractures from blunt trauma. Included studies assessed pharmacologic, non-pharmacologic and regional anaesthesia interventions. Studies describing surgical treatment of multiple rib fractures or addressing analgesia for non-traumatic causes of rib fractures (e.g. neoplasms) or study design other than RCTs were excluded. Forty-seven RCTs met the inclusion criteria.

Results

Opioids remain the most studied class of analgesics in the context of rib fracture. While effective for acute pain relief, they pose significant risks, especially in the elderly population. Non-opioid agents - especially non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol -are effective components of opioid-sparing strategies. Thoracic epidural and paravertebral blocks offer superior analgesia and respiratory benefits but are associated with a steep learning curve, are time-consuming, and carry a significant risk of procedural complications. Emerging regional anaesthesia techniques, such as the erector spinae plane (ESP) and serratus anterior plane (SAP) blocks, demonstrated promising results due to their ease of administration and favourable safety profiles. Non-pharmacologic approaches, including cryotherapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and kinesiotaping, represent additional pain relief options, although evidence remains limited.

Conclusions

Multimodal analgesia - combining pharmacologic, non-pharmacologic and regional anaesthesia approaches -is considered the most effective strategy to guarantee pain relief in patients with multiple rib fractures. However, substantial heterogeneity remains in the regimens employed. Further research is needed to standardize multimodal analgesic protocols and to assess their impact on long-term, patient-centred outcomes.

### Prognostic factors for outcomes following surgical stabilization of rib fractures: a review of the literature [^1145WcQa]. Injury (2024). Medium credibility.

Rib fractures are a common injury following blunt thoracic trauma, often resulting in high levels of morbidity and mortality. With the ageing global population, the incidence of rib fractures is expected to increase, posing a significant burden on healthcare systems worldwide. With advancements in surgical techniques and pioneering research on the topic the use of surgical stabilisation of rib fractures (SSRF) has increased significantly over the past two decades. However, the relationship between certain prognostic factors and patient outcomes following surgery is still contested and there lacks a consensus on definitive indications for the operation. This literature review presents the current research on SSRF outcomes for; patients with flail chest injuries and multiple-non flail rib fractures, optimal timing between injury and operation, and patient age. This article contributes to the ongoing dialogue surrounding chest wall trauma management and may be drawn upon to aid future research and develop clinical practice guidelines.

Long-term outcomes

With regard to long-term outcomes, Marasco and colleagues assessed patients with trauma admitted to their institution with multiple rib fractures, including patients with isolated thoracic injuries as well as patients with polytrauma. They found that at 6 months, only 36% of isolated thoracic injury and 23% of patients with polytrauma had Glasgow Outcome Score Extended (GOS-E) scores of 7–8, and at 24 months only 44% of isolated thoracic injury patients and 30% of patients with polytrauma had GOS-E scores of 7–8. The GOS-E is an interview-based functional assessment scored from 1 to 8, where 7 and 8 indicate good recovery (upper and lower), 5 and 6 indicate moderate disability (upper and lower), 3 and 4 indicate severe disability (upper and lower), 2 indicates vegetative state, and 1 indicates death. Patients scoring 7 have returned to preinjury work status though may have impairments in social and extracurricular activities; patients scoring 8 have minimal to no sequelae from their injury affecting their daily lives.

A prospective study following 203 individuals at one institution showed similar trends toward long-term pain and disability following rib fractures. One hundred and eighty-seven of the 203 enrolled patients were followed to 2 months postinjury, at which time 76% had persistent disability defined based on decreased work or functional status, and 59% had ongoing chest pain based on McGill Pain Questionnaire and Present Pain Intensity scores. One hundred and sixty-one of the 203 enrolled patients were followed to 6 months postinjury, at which time 53% had chronic disability and 22% had chronic pain. Of 89 patients with isolated rib fractures, 40% had chronic disability and 28% had chronic pain.

### The effectiveness of early surgical stabilization for multiple rib fractures: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^113sKLgS]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple rib fractures are severe chest traumas caused by falls, motor vehicles, and deceleration events that often lead to chest wall collapse, abnormal breathing, and other complications and even endanger the patient's life. A rib fracture occurs in 10–15% of patients who sustain blunt trauma, and it is associated with a morbidity and mortality rate of up to 25%. Multiple rib fracture-associated complications included atelectasis, pain, pneumonia, and respiratory failure, which worsened patients' pulmonary function and long-term recovery and prolonged the intensive care unit (ICU) stay and hospital length of stay. Kent reported that rib fractures are the most serious injury in more than half of elderly patients who died of chest injuries. Thus, appropriate clinical evaluation, management strategies, and treatment play a very important role in MRF patients.

Traditionally, multiple rib fractures are managed conservatively with mainly supportive agents, such as analgesia, mechanical ventilation, and pulmonary hygiene. It remains controversial whether multiple rib fractures should be surgically treated to achieve stability, and the clinical efficacy and surgical stabilization timing are also controversial. Pieracci reported a prospective, controlled clinical evaluation and found that surgical stabilization of multiple rib fractures can improve acute outcomes compared with the best medical management. Additionally, many recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have found the benefit of surgical rib fixation for outcomes compared to conservative management, which is highly recommended as the first choice for multiple rib fractures. To our knowledge, the timing of surgical rib fixation is unclear. Becker reported that most MRF patients presented rib fracture fixation for more than 48 h, while there may be an increased rate of complications with longer intensive care units (ICUs) and hospital times. Recently, a matched-pairs analysis of the German trauma registry showed that early rib fracture fixation can decrease ICU stay and shorten the duration of ventilator use. Regrettably, almost all of the studies had small sample sizes or were retrospective studies. Hence, a larger, multicenter, controlled study with the best design is needed to clarify whether early rib fracture fixation can improve MRF patient prognosis.

Thus, we suppose that early rib fracture fixation can decrease the length of stay in the ICU and overall hospital stays, thereby decreasing the inflammatory response and protecting against infection. The present study aimed to test whether the timing of surgical rib fixation affected postoperative outcomes in a multicenter randomized controlled trial.

Regarding medical management for thoracic trauma, more specifically with respect to management of rib fractures, AAST/WSES 2025 guidelines recommend to consider performing SSRFs in patients with multiple (≥ 3) rib fractures (ribs 3rd to 10th) if they are ipsilateral and severely displaced, and/or if there is a poor response to or impossibility to wean from mechanical ventilation.

### Does surgery reduce the risk of complications among patients with multiple rib fractures? A meta-analysis [^114d9rPU]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Multiple rib fractures are common in trauma patients, who are prone to trauma-associated complications. Surgical or nonsurgical interventions for the aforementioned conditions remain controversial.

Questions/Purposes

The purpose of our study was to perform a meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical prognosis of surgical fixation of multiple rib fractures in terms of (1) hospital-related endpoints (including duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay [LOS] and hospital LOS), (2) complications, (3) pulmonary function, and (4) pain scores.

Methods

We screened PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases for randomized and prospective studies published before January 2018. Individual effect sizes were standardized; the pooled effect size was calculated using a random-effects model. Primary outcomes were duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit length of stay (ICU LOS), and hospital LOS. Moreover, complications, pulmonary function, and pain were assessed.

Results

The surgical group had a reduced duration of mechanical ventilation (weighted mean difference [WMD], -4.95 days; 95% confidence interval, -7.97 to -1.94; p = 0.001), ICU LOS (WMD, -4.81 days; 95% CI, -6.22 to -3.39; p < 0.001), and hospital LOS (WMD, -8.26 days; 95% CI, -11.73 to -4.79; p < 0.001) compared with the nonsurgical group. Complications likewise were less common in the surgical group, including pneumonia (odds ratio [OR], 0.41; 95% CI, 0.27–0.64; p < 0.001), mortality (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.07–0.87; p = 0.030), chest wall deformity (OR, 0.02; 95% CI. 0.00–0.12; p < 0.001), dyspnea (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.09–0.54; p < 0.001), chest wall tightness (OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.05–0.22; p < 0.001) and incidence of tracheostomy (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.20–0.57; p < 0.001). There were no differences between the surgical and nonsurgical groups in terms of pulmonary function, such as forced vital capacity (WMD, 6.81%; 95% CI: -8.86 to 22.48; p = 0.390) and pain scores (WMD, -11.41; 95% CI: -42.09 to 19.26; p = 0.470).

Conclusions

This meta-analysis lends stronger support to surgical fixation, rather than conservative treatment, for multiple rib fractures. Nevertheless, additional trials should be conducted to investigate surgical indications, timing, and followup for quality of life.

Bundled clinical care pathways

Standardized clinical pathways have been used across a variety of disciplines to streamline and improve care. Several have been presented in the literature which include or focus on patients with multiple rib fractures.

Sesperez et al reported on implementation of several trauma-related clinical pathways, including one for patients with rib or sternal fractures, at their institution in 1998–1999. While protocol details were not provided, the authors state that this and the other four trauma protocols (severe head injury, pelvic fracture, blunt abdominal trauma, femur fracture) included assessment, treatment, investigations, nutrition/hydration, elimination, pain management, medications, activity, skin integrity, physiotherapy, consultation, education, and patient discharge. Pathway adherence was assessed based on number of observed versus expected variance over the course of implementation; outcome achievement for the rib fracture pathway was 93–96% across the timeframe of the study indicating feasibility. Patient outcomes were not assessed; however, subsequent studies of other rib fracture clinical pathways do include outcomes data.

### Is severe traumatic brain injury no longer a contraindication for surgical stabilization of rib fractures in patients with multiple rib fractures? A propensity-matched analysis [^116CQGrN]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is often considered a contraindication to surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF). In this study, we hypothesized that, compared with nonoperative management, SSRF is associated with improved outcomes in TBI patients.

Methods

Using the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program 2016–2019, we performed a retrospective analysis of patients with concurrent TBI and multiple rib fractures. Following propensity score matching, we compared patients who underwent SSRF with those who were managed nonoperatively. Our primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included ventilator-associated pneumonia, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), ventilator days, tracheostomy rate, and hospital discharge disposition. In a subgroup analysis, we stratified patients into mild and moderate TBI (GCS score > 8) and severe TBI (GCS score ≤ 8).

Results

Of 36,088 patients included in this study, 879 (2.4%) underwent SSRF. After propensity-score matching, compared with nonoperative management, SSRF was associated with decreased mortality (5.4% vs. 14.5%, p < 0.001), increased hospital LOS (15 days vs. 9 days, p < 0.001), increased ICU LOS (12 days vs. 8 days, p < 0.001), and increased ventilator days (7 days vs. 4 days, p < 0.001). In the subgroup analyses, in mild and moderate TBI, SSRF was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality (5.0% vs. 9.9%, p = 0.006), increased hospital LOS (13 days vs. 9 days, p < 0.001), ICU LOS (10 days vs. 7 days, p < 0.001), and ventilator days (5 days vs. 2 days, p < 0.001). In patients with severe TBI, SSRF was associated with decreased mortality (6.2% vs. 18%, p < 0.001), increased hospital LOS (20 days vs. 14 days, p = 0.001), and increased ICU LOS (16 days vs. 13 days, p = 0.004).

Conclusion

In patients with TBI and multiple rib fractures, SSRF is associated with a significant decrease in in-hospital mortality and with longer hospital and ICU LOSs. These findings suggest that SSRF should be considered in patients with TBI and multiple rib fractures.

### Surgical stabilization of rib fractures improves survival in functionally dependent trauma patients [^113NWEbs]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Rib fractures are common injuries in cases of multiple trauma, particularly among elderly and functionally dependent patients, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. These fractures can cause severe pain, impaired ventilation, and increased risk of pneumonia or respiratory failure, especially in patients with pre-existing comorbidities. Traditional management primarily involves pain control and supportive care; however, conservative treatment may be inadequate for frail individuals. Studies have shown that in patients over 65 years old with rib fractures, conservative management is associated with mortality rates of up to 20% and complication rates as high as 30%.

In recent years, surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) has gained attention as a method for stabilizing fractured ribs, improving pulmonary mechanics, and reducing complications. Several studies have demonstrated that SSRF can shorten hospital length of stays (LOS), reduce ventilator dependence, and improve long-term functional outcomes. Current consensus guidelines recommend SSRF for all patients with flail chest injuries. Beyond flail chest, SSRF should also be considered in non-flail chest patients with multiple (≥ 3) ipsilateral severely displaced rib fractures, or in those with ribs 3–10 fractures accompanied by respiratory failure despite mechanical ventilation, or pulmonary derangements in non-ventilated patients despite adequate analgesia. Additional indications include chest wall deformities affecting lung function, flail segments with displacement (particularly antero-lateral), and severe pain unresponsive to conservative treatment. SSRF should ideally be performed in specialized centers with multidisciplinary teams and standardized care protocols to ensure optimal outcomes. Most existing research and clinical guidelines have focused on younger or physically independent populations, leaving the benefits of SSRF in functionally dependent patients largely unexplored.

### A meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing nonoperative and operative management of chest trauma with multiple rib fractures [^111QPADw]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although this meta-analysis including large-scale RCTs demonstrated a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation and the incidence of pneumonia, improvement in mortality rates was challenging to establish. TSA indicated the need for a larger number of cases, and the low certainty observed in the GRADE system assessment highlights the necessity for more focused RCTs, particularly among patients requiring mechanical ventilation.

### Outcomes of surgical versus nonsurgical treatment for multiple rib fractures: a US hospital matched cohort database analysis [^1126Z2gG]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with rib fracture injuries can be treated with nonoperative management (NOM) or surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF). Pain management is the main component of NOM. Patients with severe rib fracture and flail chest injuries can be treated with SSRF, which has been shown to be very effective for relieving pain and is associated with favorable postoperative outcomes. Patients treated with SSRF have been shown to present with lower incidence of posttreatment complications, such as pneumonia, chest wall deformity, respiratory failure, and mortality. – In addition, SSRF has also been associated with reduced length of intensive care unit stay, length of hospital stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation.

Despite favorable outcomes, SSRF is still used infrequently and, when used, usually on the most severely injured patients, such as patients with multiple rib fractures and flail chest. The overall effectiveness of SSRF in patients with multiple rib fractures, with or without flail chest, is not well documented. In addition, the main available evidence evaluating the efficacy of SSRF versus NOM comes from meta-analyses of clinical studies, most of which have relatively small sample sizes.– This is due to the inherent complexity of running controlled clinical trials in trauma research, where none of the typical research variables such as patient characteristics and timing of interventions can be scheduled ahead of time. Long et al.published a meta-analysis comparing rib fixation versus conservative care in randomized controlled trial; none of the included studies had more than 75 surgically treated patients.

Our study was therefore designed to evaluate the postsurgical outcomes of patients with multiple rib fractures with SSRF versus NOM in a nationwide database that includes 20% of all inpatient admission and is representative of the entire US population, thus creating a large population for analysis.

Pulmonary hygiene

Pulmonary hygiene methods have been advocated to reduce the development of complications following rib fractures or thoracic trauma. Incentive spirometry is an easily implemented measure, and can be guided by bedside nurses. Bakhos and colleagues reported that in 38 patients aged ≥ 65 with rib fractures from blunt chest trauma, bedside measurement of vital capacity by a respiratory therapist within 48 hours of admission correlated with hospital LOS, ICU LOS, and discharge to extended care facility, although no correlation with subsequent development of pulmonary complications in this small sample. In an emergency department setting, spirometry-derived inspiratory capacity was lower among patients with torso injury, although patient outcomes were not assessed.

Operative stabilization

Surgical stabilization may be indicated for some patients with severe rib fractures, although there are no published practice management guidelines relating to this topic at present.

In the setting of flail chest, two meta-analyses have shown benefit to surgical fixation on pooled analyses. The first identified 11 studies comparing fixation to non-operative management of which two were randomized trials; pooled analysis showed that surgical fixation was associated with shorter ventilator duration, ICU LOS, and hospital LOS, as well as reduced odds of pneumonia, septicemia, tracheostomy, chest deformity, and even mortality. The second meta-analysis included nine studies, of which seven were also in the prior study. They drew similar conclusions, finding that fixation was associated with shorter ventilator duration, ICU LOS, and hospital LOS, as well as decreased risk of pneumonia, tracheostomy, and mortality. Still, surgical fixation of flail chest is uncommon nationwide: a study from the NTDB found that just 0.7% of 3467 adults with flail chest from blunt trauma who were treated at levels I and II trauma centers underwent surgical fixation. An additional prospective randomized controlled trial published after these meta-analyses studied 23 patients treated operatively and 23 treated non-operatively in Australia; they observed that the operative group had shorter ICU LOS and lower risk for receiving noninvasive ventilation after extubation, or receiving tracheostomy. There was a trend toward lower frequency of pneumonia, and no significant difference in failure of extubation, ICU readmission, hospital LOS, or mortality. Quality of life assessment at 6 months demonstrated no difference in Short Form-36 items. Cost analysis demonstrated savings among the operatively managed group given the reduction in ICU needs, despite the cost of the operation.

Among patients with multiple rib fractures without flail, several studies have reported successful institutional use of the surgical stabilization with encouraging outcomes; however, prospective studies are needed.

Scoring systems

Clinical and radiographic scoring systems have been developed for patients with thoracic trauma and rib fractures for risk assessment. Pape et al reported a scoring system with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.916–0.924 for chest-related complications or death based on number of rib fractures, arterial oxygen tension:fractional inspired oxygen ratio, presence of lung contusions, pleural involvement and patient age. Chapman and colleagues established RibScore, a radiographic scoring system assessing presence of ≥ 6 rib fractures, bilateral fractures, flail chest, ≥ 3 severely displaced fractures, first rib fracture, and presence of fractures in the anterior, lateral and posterior regions. This scoring system was associated with development of pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, and tracheostomy with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.71–0.75. Patients who developed pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, or who required tracheostomy had higher summed RibScores than those who did not develop such complications. Likewise, bivariate analyses showed that each of the variables in the RibScore correlated with the same complications.

### Comparative effectiveness analysis of two regional analgesia techniques for the pain management of isolated multiple rib fractures [^116sqqm9]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 10% of the patients with blunt traumatic injury show evidence of rib fractures. In this population, about one-third of patients face significant complications as a result of pulmonary distress, with a mortality of 10% overall and 20% in the elderly.–As the number of rib fractures increases, rates of mortality and morbidity exponentially increase.

Adequate analgesia and pulmonary care are associated with enhanced functional capacity, improved respiratory mechanics, and the prevention of pulmonary complications.–Multimodal analgesia strategies are utilized for pain control, typically systemic pharmacologic agents including acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with escalation to demand-only opioid analgesia.

Regional techniques have been shown to be associated with fewer side effects and greater efficacy when compared to systemic therapy, especially in patients with multiple rib fractures (MRF). The quality of evidence for other regional analgesia techniques is variable. The most frequently studied regional technique is epidural (EPI) catheter analgesia. Additional regional analgesia techniques that have shown promise include thoracic paravertebral blocks and continuous intercostal nerve blocks (CINB).–The current joint practice management guideline for blunt thoracic trauma published by the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma and Trauma Anesthesiology society found studies of poor quality and thus conditionally recommended epidural analgesia over non-regional modalities, with insufficient studies to make recommendations for CINB and other regional techniques.

Given the promising, yet limited, literature regarding the effectiveness of regional catheter-based analgesia, we sought to compare the efficacy of regional analgesia techniques for decreasing pain and improving clinical outcomes.

### Investigating the link between frailty and outcomes in geriatric patients with isolated rib fractures [^1169MGdZ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the fact that older patients with rib fractures are often frail and have multiple chronic conditions, they are not frequently treated by specialized teams with geriatric and trauma competence, unlike patients who sustain fractures in the femoral neck with comparable demographic characteristics. In the UK, the British Orthopedic Association has acknowledged the need for coordinated and multidisciplinary care for frail trauma patients, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive geriatric assessment, including a frailty assessment, among other components. Many guidelines recommend higher levels of care (eg, ICU admission) for geriatric patients with rib fractures. However, the adherence to such guidelines in clinical practice may be difficult due to limited resources. Of the 87 geriatric patients with more than one rib fracture who should have been directly admitted to ICU from the emergency department for the first 24 hours of admission per one level 1 trauma center's guideline, 59 (68%) were not. Of these 59 patients, 6 (9%) were later transferred to the ICU of whom two expired. By conducting an early evaluation of frailty, it may be possible to identify individuals who are at a disproportionate risk of experiencing negative outcomes in order to prioritize them for admission to higher levels of care in hospitals that may have limited resources. An easy tool/scoring system is needed in the clinical setting in order to achieve this goal. The most recent Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma guidelines for non-surgical management and analgesia strategies for older adults with multiple rib fractures refrained from recommending ICU admission for all patients older than 65 years of age; however, they did recommend considering this for patients with specific conditions. These conditions include frailty, hypoxemia (room air oxygen saturation < 93%), more severe chest injury (chest AIS score > 3), use of a walker, and smoking.

Multimodal systemic analgesia

Under the rib fracture management protocol, patients receive multimodal systemic pain management on admission. Unless contraindications apply, patients should receive any home pain medications (including psychoactive medications and opioids), oral gabapentin (dose adjusted for age and renal function when indicated), oral or IV acetaminophen (except in geriatric patients or those with liver dysfunction), and either IV ketorolac or oral celecoxib. In addition, patients are prescribed oral opioids or patient-controlled opioid analgesia, titrated to effect or side effects.

When initial multimodal systemic analgesia is ineffective, our institution's Acute Pain Service is consulted for consideration of neuraxial catheter placement.

Nursing, respiratory therapy, and physician components

The primary physician places electronic orders for the protocol with admission orders, or at the time of extubation if patients are initially intubated. This includes hourly pulmonary hygiene, minimization of IV fluids as possible, frequent mobilization, elevation of head of bed, respiratory therapy, and multimodal analgesia. PIC scores and spirometry volumes are incorporated into daily team rounds, and are used to guide care decisions.

Nursing-based interventions include assessment and charting of PIC scores, patient and family education, encouragement of frequent pulmonary hygiene and early mobilization. A patient and family education brochure is provided and family members are encouraged to support the patient in incentive spirometry use to improve their scores.

Respiratory therapists evaluate all ICU patients within 1 hour of admission, and all acute care floor patients within 6 hours of admission. Therapists set the goal and alert inspiratory spirometry levels as described above, and perform frequent monitoring and care. ICU patients on the protocol receive respiratory therapy every 4 hours; acute care patients receive therapy every 6 hours.

For patients without improved pain scores and respiratory parameters despite 6–8 hours of multimodal analgesia, our hospital's Anesthesiology Acute Pain Service is consulted for consideration of neuraxial catheter placement. Decision for neuraxial catheter placement is made on an individual patient basis, with consideration to pain level, respiratory capacity, coagulation status, mental status, spine injuries and positioning limitations, sepsis or infection, allergies, comorbidities and hemodynamics.

Early surgical rib stabilization (within 72 hours following trauma admission) is considered for patients meeting any of the following anatomical criteria: 3 or more displaced rib fractures, flail segment, patients who require video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or thoracotomy, or patients who have marked sternal flail and overlapping sternal fractures. Likewise, surgical rib stabilization is considered for patients who fail extubation attempts due to mechanical instability or pain.

### Use of continuous intercostal nerve blockade is associated with improved outcomes in patients with multiple rib fractures [^111CPjpE]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rib fractures are among the most commonly encountered injuries in the trauma population. Poorly controlled pain, altered respiratory mechanics, and underlying pulmonary injury combine to present the clinician with complex management decisions. Failure to control pain can result in low tidal volume ventilation, inadequate clearance of bronchial secretions, obstructive atelectasis, and progressive respiratory dysfunction. As a result, multiple rib fractures are associated with significant increase in length of stay and ventilator requirements. Furthermore, each additional rib fracture has been correlated with subsequent increase in mortality, with approximately 10% of all patients suffering death prior to hospital discharge. With appropriate analgesia at the forefront of management, a multitude of techniques and approaches have been investigated. Most treatment algorithms employ a combination of narcotic and non-narcotic analgesia, but opioids typically serve as the bedrock and carry many negative side effects and potential dependency issues.

Management of multiple rib fractures should seek to maintain normal respiratory mechanics and pulmonary toilet through adequate analgesia. Epidural analgesia is often a recommended adjunct in the management of multiple rib fractures. However, its use may be limited in this population due to a variety of reasons, including need for interruption of thromboembolic chemoprophylaxis or lack of trained personnel available for catheter placement. An alternative to epidural analgesia is subparaspinous continuous intercostal nerve blockade (CINB) via an extrathoracic catheter inserted below the vertebral paraspinous muscles just above and along the ribs. In the elective setting, CINB has been shown to provide equivalent pain relief compared with thoracic epidural after thoracotomy. Specific to trauma patients, prospective studies have demonstrated equivocal or even superior pain control between thoracic epidural and thoracic paravertebral infusions of local anesthetic following multiple rib fractures.

There is limited information available regarding the impact that management with CINB has on outcomes among trauma patients. Although CINB may improve pain scores and lung volumes among trauma patients, further information is still needed to determine if this limits associated morbidity and mortality in patients with multiple rib fractures. We hypothesized that use of these catheters in the treatment of trauma patients with multiple rib fractures will result in improved outcomes and increased 30-day hospital-free days compared with patients undergoing standard management.

### Comprehensive approach to the management of the patient with multiple rib fractures: a review and introduction of a bundled rib fracture management protocol [^117DXYdL]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Sahr and colleagues reported on an emergency department (ED) triage protocol for patients ages ≥ 65 evaluated at their level I trauma center, such that patients with ≥ 3 rib fractures, hemodynamic abnormality or hemothorax were automatically referred to the trauma service, as well as those sustaining falls from higher than ground level or with recent use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs. These patients who were automatically referred to the trauma service, compared with patients meeting the same clinical criteria preprotocol, had shorter hospital LOS and ICU LOS on univariate analysis. While this study evaluated a small cohort and had the inherent limitations of a before–after study, it supports the concept that a simple process-focused intervention may improve outcomes.

Todd et al reported on their multidisciplinary clinical pathway at their level I trauma center, enrolling patients aged > 45 with ≥ 4 rib fractures, excluding patients with Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) < 8 and abnormal brain CT. Eligible patients were admitted to monitored beds, were taught incentive spirometry, and received patient-controlled analgesia. During the first 3 days, patients' pain (scored 1–10), inspiratory volume, and cough were evaluated by nursing staff. Patients pain score > 6, incentive spirometry volume < 15 mL/kg, or weak cough were entered into a pathway with respiratory therapy interventions, pain service consultation (with consideration of epidural analgesia or other modes), physical therapy for strength and mobility, and nutritional optimization. Institutional trauma registry data were used to analyze patients, injuries, and outcomes after pathway implementation as compared with a historical control prior to implementation. The authors found that after implementation, patient-controlled analgesia was used more often and there was greater usage of epidural catheters. Multivariate analysis showed that postpathway implementation patients had significantly decreased ICU LOS, hospital LOS, pneumonia, and mortality.

Ultimately, these studies suggest that interventions focusing on processes-of-care for patients with rib fractures are feasible and have potential to improve patient outcomes.

### Early fixation versus conservative therapy of multiple, simple rib fractures (fixCon): protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^111seLX8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Multiple rib fractures are common injuries in both the young and elderly. Rib fractures account for 10% of all trauma admissions and are seen in up to 39% of patients after thoracic trauma. With morbidity and mortality rates increasing with the number of rib fractures as well as poor quality of life at long-term follow-up, multiple rib fractures pose a serious health hazard. Operative fixation of flail chest is beneficial over nonoperative treatment regarding, among others, pneumonia and both intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay. With no high-quality evidence on the effects of multiple simple rib fracture treatment, the optimal treatment modality remains unknown. This study sets out to investigate outcome of operative fixation versus nonoperative treatment of multiple simple rib fractures.

Methods

The proposed study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Patients will be eligible if they have three or more multiple simple rib fractures of which at least one is dislocated over one shaft width or with unbearable pain (visual analog scale (VAS) or numeric rating scale (NRS) > 6). Patients in the intervention group will be treated with open reduction and internal fixation. Pre- and postoperative care equals treatment in the control group. The control group will receive nonoperative treatment, consisting of pain management, bronchodilator inhalers, oxygen support or mechanical ventilation if needed, and pulmonary physical therapy. The primary outcome measure will be occurrence of pneumonia within 30 days after trauma. Secondary outcome measures are the need and duration of mechanical ventilation, thoracic pain and analgesics use, (recovery of) pulmonary function, hospital and ICU length of stay, thoracic injury-related and surgery-related complications and mortality, secondary interventions, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness comprising health care consumption and productivity loss. Follow-up visits will be standardized and daily during hospital admission, at 14 days and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.

Discussion

With favorable results in flail chest patients, operative treatment may also be beneficial in patients with multiple simple rib fractures. The FixCon trial will be the first study to compare clinical, functional, and economic outcome between operative fixation and nonoperative treatment for multiple simple rib fractures.

### Outcomes of surgical versus nonsurgical treatment for multiple rib fractures: a US hospital matched cohort database analysis [^111h9gVQ]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment for multiple rib fractures includes surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) or nonoperative management (NOM). Meta-analyses have demonstrated that SSRF results in faster recovery and lower long-term complication rates versus NOM. Our study evaluated postoperative outcomes for multiple rib fracture patients following SSRF versus NOM in a real-world, all-comer study design.

Methods

Multiple rib fracture patients with inpatient admissions in the PREMIER hospital database from October 1, 2015, to September 30, 2020, were identified. Outcomes included discharge disposition, and 3- and 12-month lung-related readmissions. Demographics, comorbidities, concurrent injuries at index, Abbreviated Injury Scale and Injury Severity Scores, and provider characteristics were determined for all patients. Patients were excluded from the cohort if they had a thorax Abbreviated Injury Scale score of < 2 (low severity patient) or a Glasgow Coma Scale score of ≤ 8 (extreme high severity patient). Stratum matching between SSRF and NOM patients was performed using fine stratification and weighting so that all patient data were kept in the final analysis. Outcomes were analyzed using generalized linear models with quasinormal distribution and logit links.

Results

A total of 203,450 patients were included, of which 200,580 were treated with NOM and 2,870 with SSRF. Compared to NOM, patients with SSRF had higher rates of home discharge (62% SSRF vs. 58% NOM) and lower rates of lung-related readmissions (3 months, 3.1% SSRF vs. 4.0% NOM; 12 months, 6.2% SSRF vs. 7.6% NOM). The odds ratio (OR) for home or home health discharge in patients with SSRF versus NOM was 1.166 (95% confidence interval, 1.073–1.266; p = 0.0002). Similarly, ORs for lung-related readmission at 3- and 12-month were statistically lower in the patients treated with SSRF versus NOM (OR [3 months], 0.764 [95% CI, 0.606–0.963]; p = 0.0227 and OR [12 months], 0.799 [95% CI, 0.657–0.971]; p = 0.0245).

Conclusion

Surgical stabilization of rib fractures results in greater odds of home discharge and lower rates of lung-related readmissions compared with NOM at 12 months of follow-up.

### No benefit from the addition of low-dose ketamine infusion to standard evidence-based care of patients with multiple rib fractures [^1172yAJe]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Multiple rib fractures from blunt thoracic trauma cause significant morbidity. Optimal current management includes multimodal analgesia, pulmonary hygiene, and early mobilization. Low-dose ketamine infusion (LDKI) has been proposed as an adjunctive analgesic in this setting. A prior study reported decreased pain scores with LDKI in patients with multiple rib fractures. We hypothesized that LDKI would decrease morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) in patients with multiple rib fractures.

Methods

A prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial was performed in adult (18 years or older) patients with three or more rib fractures. A prestudy power analysis calculated an 80% chance of identifying a 15% decrease in MMEs with 50 subjects. The study was approved by the institutional review board and informed consent obtained in all subjects. Demographic (age, sex) and injury specific information (Injury Severity Score, number of rib fractures) were obtained. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive continuous LDKI (0.1 mg/kg/h) or placebo infusion (0.9% NaCl) for ≤ 48 hours. All patients received a standard evidence-based multidisciplinary protocol for rib fractures management. Primary outcome measure was MME use or pulmonary complications. Statistical comparison of LDKI versus placebo was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test.

Results

All 50 enrolled subjects (placebo, 25; LDKI, 25) received study drug infusion. The two groups were well matched for age, Injury Severity Score, and number of rib fractures. We observed no differences in the Day 1 (p = 0.961), Day 2 (p = 0.373), or total MMEs (p = 0.946) between groups. Similar total MME use was observed when subjects who received ≥ 40 hours of study drug and were compared (p = 0.924). Use of LDKI did not alter subsequent need for opiate analgesics postinfusion, hospital length of stay, pulmonary complications, or need for readmission.

Conclusion

The addition of LDKI to an established multimodal, evidence-based protocol for management of multiple rib fractures did not decrease opiate usage or impact pulmonary complications.

### Thoracic trauma WSES-AAST guidelines [^111VM7qk]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for rib fracture, more specifically with respect to surgical stabilization, indications, AAST/WSES 2025 guidelines recommend to consider performing SSRFs in patients with multiple (≥ 3) rib fractures (ribs 3rd to 10th) if they are ipsilateral and severely displaced, and/or if there is a poor response to or impossibility to wean from mechanical ventilation.

### Emergency department management of patients with rib fracture based on a clinical practice guideline [^115HgwEW]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

This study found that the most common reason for return was inadequate pain control. Due to the current opioid epidemic, there is likely hesitancy among providers to prescribe large amounts of opioid medications for pain control in any patient populations including patients with rib fracture. Including a pain control protocol in our CPG may increase provider comfort with prescribing appropriate amounts of opiates or alternatives to patients with rib fractures and further reduce return visits to the ED.

Pain control in patients with rib fracture has been shown to improve pulmonary function and prevent complications. Rib fractures lead to somatic chest pain that is associated with self-imposed limitation of tidal volume during inspiration and decrease in forceful exhalation to remove secretions. This impairs pulmonary mechanics leading to atelectasis and pneumonia. For hospitalized patients, epidural anesthetics and intercostal nerve blockade have been shown to be equal in reduction of pain and improve patient outcome after rib fractures. Generally, multimodal pain management is preferred. There is scarce research concerning pain management in patients with rib fracture who are discharged from the ED. There have been case reports of treating patients with multiple rib fractures with a paravertebral catheter in an outpatient setting, but there is no current practice guideline or recommendation.

### Beyond guidelines: surgical stabilization of rib fractures in patients with chronic pain [^1143GmZn]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case presents a unique scenario where a patient with chronic pain and complex rib fractures, initially deemed ineligible for surgical intervention based solely on adherence to national guidelines, ultimately required emergent surgical stabilization on hospital 5 due to an escalating pain crisis and worsening respiratory mechanics. This patient failed maximum conservative management of their rib fractures and our team thought they required delayed surgical stabilization of their rib fractures. Ideally, rib fractures should be stabilized within 72 hours of presentation.

While conventional recommendations dictate surgical intervention for patients with specific fracture patterns (ie, flail chest or multiple bicortical offset fractures), severe displacement in several ribs or evidence of paradoxical chest motion, this patient initially fell outside these criteria, with only one rib displaying greater than 50% displacement. This case demonstrates the need in select patient populations (ie, with severe chronic pain) to consider early rib stabilization when they possess pulmonary physiologic derangements despite locoregional anesthesia and multimodal pain therapy (but do not meet the displacement or fracture pattern guidelines).

This case reminds us that evolving clinical presentations necessitate continuous re-evaluation by the trauma team of the treatment approach that may not align with current guidelines. Given this changing clinical picture and the urgency of the patient's pain crisis, a tailored approach was necessary, irrespective of the conventional guidelines. This decision underscored the commitment to prioritizing the patient's individual circumstances and adapting to their changing clinical needs.

### In patients with combined clavicle and multiple rib fractures, does fracture fixation of the clavicle improve clinical outcomes? A multicenter prospective cohort study of 232 patients [^117QdExF]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Thoracic injuries are common, occurring as both isolated chest injuries and multiple injuries in patients. In multiple injury patients who sustained blunt chest trauma, the most prevalent fractures include rib (86%), clavicle fractures (19%), or a combination of these injuries (19%). Both injuries are considered indicators of the severity of thoracic trauma and may independently increase the risk of mortality. – The combination of multiple rib and clavicle fractures could result in decreased stability, compliance, and respiratory support of the chest wall. Therefore, patients with these combined injuries after blunt thorax trauma seem prone to (respiratory) complications and longer hospitalization. There is an ongoing debate whether fixation of the clavicle fracture in patients with multiple concomitant rib fractures could be beneficial to provide additional stability to the chest wall and thereby improve clinical outcomes.

Despite the vast amount of literature describing rib fractures and clavicle fractures as individual entities, the mutual impact and subsequent management of these combined injuries remain unclear. So far, only three studies reported on treatment outcomes in patients with both clavicle and rib fractures. Graf et al.reported on a chart review of 60 patients with blunt chest trauma and concomitant clavicle fractures, and they did not find any differences between early clavicle fixation versus nonoperative treatment of clavicle fractures. Langenbach et al.reported on 11 patients with flail chest injuries and clavicle fractures, all of whom underwent operative treatment for both fractures and recovered uneventfully. Solberg et al.presented a retrospective case series of blunt chest trauma patients with combined clavicle and multiple rib fractures, comparing operative (n = 9) versus nonoperative (n = 7) treatment of the rib fractures. However, no definitive conclusion could be drawn from these results because of the small number of included patients. In conclusion, the available literature is insufficient to determine whether clavicle fixation improves outcomes in patients with concomitant clavicle and rib fractures.

We, therefore, performed this study with the following research question: does clavicle fixation in patients with combined rib and clavicle fractures affect hospital length of stay (HLOS), quality of life, and other in-hospital outcomes?

### Rib fixation for multiple rib fractures: healthcare professionals perceived barriers and facilitators to clinical implementation [^115hEHnT]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rib fractures occur in 10–39% of patients with blunt chest trauma, accounting for 10% of all trauma admissions. Rib fractures are associated with morbidity and long-term impaired quality of life. A typical pattern of multiple fractures is a flail chest, which is defined as three or more consecutive ribs fractured in at least two places. Other fracture patterns with three or more fractured ribs are often called multiple rib fractures.

Increasingly, surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) of a flail chest shows superior results over nonoperative treatment. For patients with multiple rib fractures without a flail chest, particularly low-level evidence suggests that SSRF results in shorter Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and hospital stays, lower rates of pneumonia and empyema, reduced need for opioid analgesics and mechanical ventilation, and earlier return to work and social activities. Currently, a multicenter randomized controlled trial investigates the effects of SSRF versus nonoperative treatment of multiple rib fractures in patients without a flail chest (FixCon trial).

Concomitantly to growing evidence, an implementation strategy should be developed to successfully implement SSRF as a treatment for multiple rib fractures. Barriers and facilitators possibly influencing the implementation of SSRF should be identified, such as experience, knowledge, and available resources, to ensure that the implementation strategy includes relevant determinants, is feasible, and is tailored to the context. Therefore, this study identified barriers and facilitators of healthcare professionals (HCPs) to SSRF for treatment of trauma patients with multiple rib fractures. The secondary aim was to compare barriers and facilitators between groups of HCPs.

Summary

Although nonoperative management is the mainstay for rib fracture treatment, surgical stabilization of rib fractures is becoming more common. Recently, the number of high-quality studies on management of rib fractures has also increased. The primary purpose of this review is to analyze the currently available prospective randomized studies on the management of rib fractures. In addition, we will summarize both short-term and long-term outcomes of patients with rib fractures.

### Challenges experienced during rehabilitation after traumatic multiple rib fractures: a qualitative study [^115dqLEz]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

People with multiple rib fractures rarely receive rehabilitation aimed specifically at their chest wall injuries. This research explores patient perceptions of rehabilitation and recovery.

Materials and Methods

A qualitative study exploring how a purposive sample of 15 people with traumatic multiple rib fractures at a Major Trauma Centre in the United Kingdom make sense of their recovery. Data collected during one-to-one interviews 4 to 9 months after injury. Transcripts analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis.

Results

Struggling with breathing and pain: Difficulties with breathing and pain were initially so severe ?it takes your breath away? and people felt scared they may not survive. These symptoms gradually improved but feeling "out of puff" often persisted. Life on hold: Healing was considered a natural process which people couldn't influence, creating frustration whilst waiting for injuries to heal. Many believed they would never fully recover and accepted limitations. Lucky to be alive: All participants expressed a sense of feeling lucky to be alive. The seriousness of injury prompted a change in attitude to make the most of life.

Conclusion

Rib fractures can be painful, but also frightening. A rehabilitation intervention promoting pain management, normalises trauma and restores physical activity may improve recovery. Implications for Rehabilitation Patients identified challenges with rehabilitation throughout the entire recovery journey, and their rehabilitation needs evolved with time. People find it difficult to regain pre-injury fitness even after their fractures heal and pain subsides. A belief there is nothing that can be done to help rib fractures contributed to people lowering their expectations of achieving a full recovery and developing a sense of "making do". Rehabilitation and patient education after traumatic multiple rib fractures should focus on improving pain management, respiratory fitness and emotional well-being.

### Challenges in plate fixation of chest wall injuries [^116kh5iD]. Injury (2018). Low credibility.

Unstable chest wall injuries can result from multiple rib fractures or a flail chest, and are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Traditionally such injuries have been treated non-operatively, with mechanical ventilation when required, and pain management. Surgical treatment of these fractures is technically possible, and studies suggest improved outcomes, such as lower time on mechanical ventilation and length of time in the intensive care unit, compared to non-operative treatment. However, there are many challenges and controversies regarding indications for surgical fixation, patient selection, outcomes, and fixation strategy. Further research in this area is warranted to better answer these questions.

### Nonoperative treatment of multiple rib fractures, the results to beat: international multicenter prospective cohort study among 845 patients [^111TwzqB]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Optimal treatment (i.e., nonoperative or operative) for patients with multiple rib fractures remains debated. Studies that compare treatments are rationalized by the alleged poor outcomes of nonoperative treatment.

Methods

The aim of this prospective international multicenter cohort study (between January 2018 and March 2021) with 1-year follow-up, was to report contemporary outcomes of nonoperatively treated patients with multiple rib fractures. Including 845 patients with three or more rib fractures. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay (HLOS), (pulmonary) complications, and quality of life.

Results

Mean age was 57.7 ± 17.0 years, median Injury Severity Score was 17 (13–22) and the median number of rib fractures was 6 (4–8). In-hospital mortality rate was 1.5% (n = 13), 112 (13.3%) patients had pneumonia and four (0.5%) patients developed a symptomatic nonunion. The median HLOS was 7 days (4–13 days), and median intensive care unit length of stay was 2 days (1–5 days). Mean 5-Level Quality of Life Questionnaire index value was 0.83 ± 0.18 1 year after trauma. Polytrauma patients had a median HLOS of 10 days (6–18 days), a pneumonia rate of 17.6% (n = 77) and mortality rate of 1.7% (n = 7). Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) had a median HLOS of 9 days (5–15 days), a pneumonia rate of 19.7% (n = 57) and mortality rate of 4.1% (n = 12).

Conclusion

Overall, nonoperative treatment of patients with multiple rib fractures shows low mortality and morbidity rate and good quality of life after 1 year. Future studies evaluating the benefit of operative stabilization should use contemporary outcomes to establish the therapeutic margin of rib fixation.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^115Jeywp]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Rib fracture pain management — Management of rib fracture pain requires a multimodal approach; begin scheduled acetaminophen and NSAIDS as soon as possible. If a regional block is likely, select a COX-2 inhibitor to avoid platelet inhibition. Muscle relaxants, if not contraindicated, may help relieve chest wall muscle spasm, and evidence suggests they reduce length of stay and respiratory complications in rib fracture patients. Consider the early use of regional analgesia to avoid the potential complications of opioids. An epidural is preferred for treatment of patients with bilateral rib fractures, but paravertebral blocks can be used when an epidural is contraindicated. Intercostal blocks with liposomal bupivacaine are another option when patients may have contraindications to paravertebral or epidural blocks such as coagulopathy or spine fractures. The addition of opioids begins with oral administration and may include breakthrough rescue doses of intermittent IV opioids with escalation to a PCA if multiple rescue IV doses are required. For continued rib pain, consider operative rib fixation.

### Outcomes of surgical versus nonsurgical treatment for multiple rib fractures: a US hospital matched cohort database analysis [^112VQC8o]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Thoracic injuries with severe rib fractures are one of the leading causes of injury-related deaths, following trauma with a head injury. Usually, multiple displaced rib fractures cause damage to surrounding tissues and generate severe pain that affects inspiration or cough; respiratory functions are therefore impaired, leading to increased risk for further pulmonary or respiratory conditions such as infections, distress, or failure. All of these acute complications further contribute to chronic conditions, such as prolonged pain, loss of productivity and disability. The cutting ends of the fractured ribs may also perforate the lung, producing air, blood or air and blood presence between the chest wall and the lung (hemothorax, pneumothorax, or hemopneumothorax), which is a life-threatening condition.

The mortality rate following traumatic rib fractures varies widely from 5% to 35% and is strongly associated with the number of broken ribs. – Patients with up to five fractured ribs experience between 5.8% and 10% mortality, whereas patients with eight or more fractured ribs may have a mortality risk of nearly 35%. The higher mortality rates in patients with multiple rib fracture may be, in part, explained by concurrent thorax and nonthoracic organ system injuries but also increased risk of pulmonary diseases such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Older age, multiple injury, preexisting diseases, and pneumonia, along with flail chest, are predictive of mortality in patients suffering from multiple rib fractures.

### Early fixation versus conservative therapy of multiple, simple rib fractures (fixCon): protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^112QjmoL]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Rib fractures are common injuries in both trauma and non-trauma centers, occurring in up to 10–39% of patients with blunt chest trauma and accounting for 10% of all trauma admissions. With an estimated 25% of all traumatic deaths, chest trauma ranks second after head injury. Rib fractures are caused by high-energy trauma (HET) in the younger patients, often with concomitant injuries, and in the elderly as a result of low energy trauma (LET). Sustaining multiple rib fractures can result in a flail chest, defined as fracture of three or more consecutive ribs in two or more places, creating a flail segment. Patients may also have multiple simple rib fractures or a combination of both.

While open surgical fixation of rib fractures dates back to the 1940s, multiple rib fractures are routinely treated nonoperatively. Nonoperative treatment includes pain management, oxygen support or mechanical ventilation, bronchodilator inhalers, and pulmonary physical therapy. Despite this treatment strategy, mortality and complications such as pulmonary contusion, hemopneumothorax, and pneumonia are seen in up to 34% and in 35–77% of patients, respectively. Various studies have identified risk factors that increase mortality such as age and number of rib fractures.

Furthermore, at 2 years post-injury, up to 29% of patients have not yet returned full time to their pre-injury job and 64% of patients with isolated multiple rib fractures still experience chest wall pain. With incapacitating pain often accompanying traumatic rib fractures, epidural analgesics are suggested as the optimal analgesic for patients with multiple rib fractures. Two meta-analyses have shown that epidural use results in significant less pain but has no benefit regarding the length of both intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay, mortality, and complication rate, indicating the necessity of an optimized analgesic modality for rib fracture patients.

Rib fractures may show the same pattern as a restrictive pulmonary disease, resulting in loss of total lung capacity which precipitates inadequate oxygenation and ventilation. Patients with rib fractures and reduced pulmonary function are more susceptible to pulmonary complications and longer length of hospital stay. With contradicting studies on the difference in spirometry between operatively and nonoperatively treated patients with rib fractures, additional research is needed. While surgical treatment of flail chest patients appears to be cost-effective over nonoperative treatment, but for multiple simple rib fractures, the most cost-effective treatment modality is still unknown.

### Surgical treatment of multiple rib fractures and flail chest in trauma: a one-year follow-up study [^115WT5TQ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple rib fractures occur in 10% of poly-traumatized patients due to blunt, high-energy trauma and can lead to unstable thoracic cage injuries or flail chest with respiratory insufficiency. Whilst conservative management with analgesics and ventilator support has been the conventional treatment for flail chest, this can entail long hospitalization with immobilization, which leads to complications, such as pulmonary infections and long-term disability with chronic pain. Recently, a number of new fixation devices and better techniques have been developed for surgical treatment of rib fractures. Three small, prospective, Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) suggest that surgical management of flail chest may decrease the need for ventilator support and intensive care. In our clinical setting, we have found plate fixation of rib fractures to be a safe method with a low rate of complications and a reduced time and need for ventilator treatment in comparison to conservatively-managed, historical controls. Our patients were reported to have experienced mild disability, decreased range of motion and lung function, and 35% of patients had enduring pain after 6 months. Long-term studies concerning lung function, mobility, pain and Quality of Life (QoL) after surgery are lacking. Two studies have reported significantly better lung function in surgically-managed patients 1 month after surgery, whereas Marasco et al. found no significant difference between operated and conservatively-managed patients after 3 months. There is a disparity in the surgical techniques used in these studies, which makes comparison difficult.

The aim of this prospective study was to examine the long-term patient outcomes associated with pain, physical function, QoL and lung function after surgical stabilization of multiple rib fractures or flail chest.

Multimodal pain therapy

Multimodal systemic analgesia, which combines opioids with non-opioid adjuncts, has been advocated in some studies albeit data are also limited. The recent EAST and Trauma Anesthesiology Society guidelines make a conditional recommendation in favor of multimodal therapy, given some data on improved analgesia and in the setting of known side effects of opioids. Administration of intravenous (IV) ibuprofen to patients with traumatic rib fractures was associated with lower opioid requirement and improved pain scores compared with patients who did not receive intravenous ibuprofen in a small study. In a retrospective study of patients with multiple rib fractures receiving ketorolac versus patients who did not, ketorolac was associated with decreased frequency of pneumonia, more ventilator-free days, and more ICU-free days. Complications from ketorolac use were uncommon in their cohort.

Multimodal therapy has been advocated following ambulatory surgeryand cardiac surgery via sternotomy. A study of 86 patients requiring thoracotomy for lobectomy showed that administration of parecoxib compared with placebo, in addition to patient-controlled thoracic epidural, was associated with improved pain scores and lower serum cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels.

Data regarding gabapentin are more common; however, most studies have assessed preoperative use. In a prospective, randomized study of elective thoracotomy patients receiving a single 600 mg dose of preoperative gabapentin versus placebo as an adjunct to standard epidural, ketorolac, acetaminophen, and IV patient-controlled analgesia, there was no difference between groups for pain scores, nausea/vomiting, respiratory depression, or chronic pain 3 months postsurgery. In contrast, a meta-analysis of preoperative gabapentin administration (as well as postoperative gabapentin in some studies) among surgical patients (abdominal, spine, orthopedic, gynecological, breast, and ear, nose, and throat) showed improved pain scores and reduced 24-hour opioid consumption among gabapentin recipients compared with control. Another meta-analysis of surgical patients (abdominal, orthopedic, gynecological, thyroid, breast, prostatectomy, caesarean section and thoracotomy) showed preoperative gabapentin to be associated with lower postoperative opioid use, though increase in postoperative somnolence. Thus, although there are limited data regarding multimodal therapy in patients with rib fractures specifically, data in these other settings support its potential utility.

Pain is scored on a scale of 1–3, representing patient-reported pain score on the subjective 0–10 scale: 3 points if controlled (subjective numeric scale 0–4), 2 points if moderately controlled (subjective numeric scale 5–7), or 1 point if severe (subjective numeric scale 8–10). Inspiratory capacity is scored on a scale of 1–4, relating to 'goal' and 'alert' levels for inspiratory spirometry based on sex-specific predictive normograms for age and height as available in the spirometer product inserts (goal is set at 80% of expected inspiratory capacity, alert level is 15 mL/kg or a maximum of 1500 mL). Patients receive four points if able to achieve at least goal inspiratory spirometry volume, three if between goal and alert levels, two if less than alert volume, and one point if unable to perform inspiratory spirometry. Finally, cough is subjectively assessed by the bedside nurse and assigned three points if strong, two points if weak, and one point if absent.

### Use of continuous intercostal nerve blockade is associated with improved outcomes in patients with multiple rib fractures [^113fZiZ3]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Rib fractures are common among trauma patients and may result in significant morbidity and mortality. There are numerous treatment options, but ideal management is unclear. Delivery of local anesthetic via an analgesia catheter for continuous intercostal nerve blockade offers an attractive potential option for management of patients with rib fractures.

Methods

We performed a single-center, retrospective case-control analysis of trauma patients with multiple rib fractures from 2016 to 2018, comparing patients managed with continuous intercostal nerve blockade with standard care. Matching was performed in a 2:1 ratio by Injury Severity Score, age, and gender. Respiratory morbidity potentially secondary to rib fractures, including unplanned intubation, failure of extubation, need for tracheostomy, pneumonia, or mortality, were all identified and included. Potential complications due to catheter insertion were identified to be recorded. The primary outcome of interest was 30-day hospital-free days.

Results

Nine hundred and thirty-three patients were eligible for analysis, with 48 managed using intercostal blockade compared with 96 matching controls. No complications of intercostal blockade were identified during the study period. Controls demonstrated fewer rib fractures (6.60 ± 4.11 vs. 9.3 ± 3.73, p = 0.001) and fewer flail segments (0.8 ± 1.76 vs. 2.0 ± 2.94, p = 0.02). Those managed with intercostal blockade demonstrated significantly more 30-day hospital-free days (15.9 ± 6.43 vs. 13.2 ± 9.94, p = 0.048), less incidence of pneumonia (4.2% vs. 16.7%, p = 0.03), and lower hospital mortality (2.1% vs. 13.5%, p = 0.03). When adjusting for number of rib fractures and number of flail segments, use of continuous intercostal nerve blockade was significantly associated with lower hospital mortality (OR 0.10; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.91), pneumonia (OR 0.15; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.76), or need for tracheostomy (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.83).

Discussion

The addition of continuous intercostal nerve blockade may help to improve outcomes in patients with multiple rib fractures compared with standard care alone.

### Surgical management of multiple rib fractures reduces the hospital length of stay and the mortality rate in major trauma patients: a comparative study in a UK major trauma center [^112nny6f]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate and assess the effectiveness of surgical fixation of rib fractures in complex traumatic chest injuries compared with traditional nonoperative management.

Design

Retrospective observational comparative study.

Setting

Level 1 Major Trauma Centre in North West England.

Patients/Participants

A total of 83 patients who were admitted urgently to our hospital after major trauma, between August 2012 and March 2015, and fulfilled the criteria for surgical fixation of their multiple rib fractures. Patients who had concomitant nonsurvivable injuries or did not consent for surgery were excluded.

Intervention

Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of multiple rib fractures and flail chest segments versus traditional nonoperative management.

Main Outcome Measurements

The primary outcome of interest was the total hospital length of stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes included the incidence of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and the incidence of respiratory complications such as hospital-acquired pneumonia, need for mechanical ventilation, and/or tracheotomy. The mortality rate was also investigated.

Results

A total of 83 patients were included, 47 of these in the ORIF group and 36 in the non-ORIF group. The mean hospital LOS for patients in the non-ORIF group was 30.41 days (SD 30.1). This was markedly reduced in the ORIF group to a mean of 14.53 days (SD 11.7), with the difference being statistically significant (P < 0.01). Twenty-eight patients (77.7%) in the nonoperatively managed group required admission to the ICU compared with a significantly lower 48.9% (23 patients) in the ORIF group (P < 0.01). The incidence of respiratory complications was lower in the ORIF group but this difference was not statistically significant. The mortality rate was 2.1% for the group that was treated surgically compared with 13.9% for the conservative group (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Surgical fixation of multiple displaced rib fractures reduced the total hospital LOS and the overall mortality in our major trauma patients and decreased the incidence of ICU admission.

Level Of Evidence

Therapeutic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

### Outcomes of surgical versus nonsurgical treatment for multiple rib fractures: a US hospital matched cohort database analysis [^115M1Cdv]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment for multiple rib fractures include surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) or non-operative management (NOM). Our study showed that SSRF had greater odds of home discharge and lower rates of lung-related readmissions compared to NOM at 12 months follow-up.

### Long-term outcomes of surgical rib fixation in patients with flail chest and multiple rib fractures [^114ARShW]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We conclude that in patients with flail chest or multiple rib fractures, rib fixation offers good long-term benefits for return to their premorbid state. Older patients, especially those with thin, soft tissue, may complain of irritation caused by the rib plate and should be informed of this prior to surgery.

### Surgical rib fixation is associated with lower mortality in patients with traumatic rib fractures [^116UVqRr]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nonoperative management (NOM) along with supportive care has been the adopted approach for traumatic rib fractures; however, surgical approaches have emerged recently to treat this common pathology. Despite this, there are no guidelines for surgical rib fixation in patients with traumatic rib fractures.

Methods

An institutional review board-approved retrospective cohort study was performed at the Puerto Rico Trauma Hospital aiming to compare the outcomes and complications between patients with traumatic rib fractures who undergo surgical fixation and their counterparts with NOM. The study period comprised from January 2016 through July 2020. Outcomes were evaluated with negative binomial and logistic regressions.

Results

Fifty patients were identified for the surgical rib fixation group, who were matched to 150 patients who received NOM. The majority of patients were male (91.5%), with a median (interquartile range) age of 53 (29) years. Concomitant chest injuries were significantly more prevalent in the operative group, such as flail segment (P < 0.001), number of fractures (P < 0.001), and displaced rib fractures (P < 0.001). Although hospital length of stay was 25% (95% confidence interval: 1.02–1.54) longer in the surgical group, this intervention was associated with an 85% (95% confidence interval: 0.03–0.70) lower mortality rate when compared to conservative management.

Conclusions

Rib fixation may offer some benefits in selected patients with traumatic rib fractures, such as those with bilateral rib fractures, multiple displaced rib fractures, flail segment, and concomitant thoracic injuries. This study may serve as a guide for treatment strategy and patient selection regarding the surgical management of traumatic rib fractures.

### Surgical stabilization of rib fractures versus nonoperative treatment in patients with multiple rib fractures following cardiopulmonary resuscitation: an international, retrospective matched case-control study [^112KRRf4]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The presence of six or more rib fractures or a displaced rib fracture due to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has been associated with longer hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS). Evidence on the effect of surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) following CPR is limited. This study aimed to evaluate outcomes after SSRF versus nonoperative management in patients with multiple rib fractures after CPR.

Methods

An international, retrospective study was performed in patients who underwent SSRF or nonoperative management for multiple rib fractures following CPR between January 1, 2012, and July 31, 2020. Patients who underwent SSRF were matched to nonoperative controls by cardiac arrest location and cause, rib fracture pattern, and age. The primary outcome was ICU LOS.

Results

Thirty-nine operatively treated patient were matched to 66 nonoperatively managed controls with comparable CPR-related characteristics. Patients who underwent SSRF more often had displaced rib fractures (n = 28 [72%] vs. n = 31 [47%]; p = 0.015) and a higher median number of displaced ribs (2 [P 25 -P 75, 0–3] vs. 0 [P 25 -P 75, 0–3]; p = 0.014). Surgical stabilization of rib fractures was performed at a median of 5 days (P 25 -P 75, 3–8 days) after CPR. In the nonoperative group, a rib fixation specialist was consulted in 14 patients (21%). The ICU LOS was longer in the SSRF group (13 days [P 25 -P 75, 9–23 days] vs. 9 days [P 25 -P 75, 5–15 days]; p = 0.004). Mechanical ventilator-free days, hospital LOS, thoracic complications, and mortality were similar.

Conclusion

Despite matching, those who underwent SSRF over nonoperative management for multiple rib fractures following CPR had more severe consequential chest wall injury and a longer ICU LOS. A benefit of SSRF on in-hospital outcomes could not be demonstrated. A low consultation rate for rib fixation in the nonoperative group indicates that the consideration to perform SSRF in this population might be associated with other nonradiographic or injury-related variables.

### Effects of mechanism of injury and patient age on outcomes in geriatric rib fracture patients [^111vFpbQ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

With an aging population, trauma in the elderly will continue to increase most likely with a high volume of rib fractures. Thus, it is critical to understand the best course of triage and management for this high-risk population. In the early 2000s, several studies were published showing that elderly patients with ≥ 2 rib fractures had higher rates of pulmonary complications, mean number of ventilator days, mean ICU LOS, mean hospital LOS and mortality, leading to the recommendation that patients aged 65 years or more with at least two rib fractures be immediately admitted to the ICU. Our institutional guidelines recommend that patients ≥ 65 years of age with ≥ 2 rib fractures be admitted to the ICU for the first 24 hours to achieve adequate pain control and assistance with pulmonary hygiene. The intention behind this guideline is to admit all patients who fit this criteria to the ICU regardless of subjective evaluation of the patient's state of health. However, we found in this study that the majority of the patients who fit this criteria (68%) were not admitted directly to the ICU as per the recommendation of the guideline. Despite not following the recommendation, mortality attributable to rib fractures was 4% over the 7-year period of this study. One of these four patients had closed fracture of multiple ribs, unspecified (ICD9 807.09 2 3), another had closed fracture of two ribs (ICD9 807.02 2 3), yet another had closed fracture of five ribs (ICD9 807.05 3 3) and the last patient had closed fracture of four ribs (ICD9 807.04 3 3). All four of these patients did not have a flail chest, and their other injuries listed are external abrasions or contusions. The patient with the unspecified number of rib fractures and the one with the closed fracture of two ribs had originally been admitted to the observation unit and the floor from the ED while the patients with four and five rib fractures were admitted directly to the ICU. Six patients who were originally admitted to the floor, observation unit or telemetry subsequently required transfer to the ICU. This group of patients tended to have a lower median of fractured ribs but longer median hospital LOS compared to patients who were directly admitted to the ICU, though both had a similar median ICU LOS.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^111LpETA]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Multimodal rib fracture pain management — listed components and risk stratification are provided. Recommended components include scheduled acetaminophen, scheduled NSAIDs, muscle relaxants (if not contraindicated), paravertebral block/epidural/intercostal block, consideration of a lidocaine patch if regional analgesia cannot be administered, oral opioids with breakthrough intermittent IV doses, and operative rib fixation. The text links poorly controlled pain and splinting to altered breathing mechanics, hypoventilation, and impaired gas exchange, and states that poorly controlled pain increases risk of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure. Patients who are older than 65 years, have three or more rib fractures, or with underlying cardiopulmonary disease are identified as at greatest risk of morbidity and mortality.

### Ketamine infusion for pain control in adult patients with multiple rib fractures: results of a randomized control trial [^115XYk4p]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Rib fractures occur in up to 40% of trauma patients and are associated with increased mortality. Opiate-based pain regimens remain the cornerstone of rib fracture management; however, concerns around opioids have fostered interest in alternative analgesics. Ketamine is currently being used in lieu of opioids, but little evidence exists supporting its use within the trauma population.

Methods

A prospective, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of adult patients with three or more rib fractures admitted to a Level I trauma center was conducted. Exclusion criteria included age older than 64 years, Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 13, and chronic opiate use. The experimental arm received low-dose ketamine (LDK) at 2.5 μg·kg·min while the placebo cohort received an equivalent rate of 0.9% normal saline. All infusions were continued for 48 hours. The primary outcome was reduction in numeric pain score (NPS) during the first 24 hours. Secondary outcomes studied included oral morphine equivalent (OME) utilization, length of stay, epidural rates, pulmonary complications, and adverse events.

Results

Forty-five (49%) of 91 patients were randomized to the experimental arm. Both groups were similar in makeup. Overall, 74.7% were male, had a median age of 49 years, and an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 14. Low-dose ketamine was not associated with a significant reduction in 24-hour NPS or OME totals. Subgroup analysis of 45 severely injured patients (ISS, > 15) demonstrated that LDK was associated with a significant reduction in OME utilization during the first 24 hours (35.7 vs. 68, p = 0.03), 24 hours to 48 hours (64.2 vs. 96, p = 0.03), and overall (152.1 vs. 198, p = 0.048). No difference in other secondary outcomes or adverse events was noted.

Conclusion

Low-dose ketamine failed to decrease NPS or OME within the overall cohort, but a decrease in OME was observed among patients with an ISS greater than 15. Confirmatory studies are necessary to determine if LDK is a useful adjunct among severely injured patients.

### Rib fixation: who, what, when? [^1171frRT]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Rib fractures are among the most common traumatic injury found in ∼20% of all patients who suffer thoracic trauma. The majority of these are a result of a blunt mechanism and are often associated with other traumatic injuries. The most common associated injury is lung contusion. Rib fractures impart an increased morbidity and mortality with the highest mortality associated with a flail chest in the elderly population. Flail chest is defined radiographically as 3 or more consecutive ribs fractured in 2 or more places. This often translates to a clinical flail which is associated with paradoxical chest wall movement during respiratory cycles. The mainstay of treatment has been pain control and respiratory support with positive pressure ventilation. However, over the past 2 decades, there has been mounting evidence to suggest that open reduction and internal fixation of ribs benefits patients. The indications remain confined to the most severely injured patients with flail chest or chronic non-unions; however, there remains debate whether or not less severely injured patients would benefit as well. This article will review the current evidence and provide proposed indications based on available evidence and current expert opinion.

### Ketamine infusion for pain control in elderly patients with multiple rib fractures: results of a randomized controlled trial [^111ECXW9]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Rib fractures are associated with increased mortality, particularly in the elderly. While opiate-based pain regimens remain the cornerstone of rib fracture management, issues related to opioids have driven research into alternative analgesics. Adjunctive ketamine use in lieu of opioids continues to increase but little evidence exists to support its efficacy or safety within the elderly trauma population.

Methods

A prospective, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of elderly patients (age, ≥ 65 years) with three or more rib fractures admitted to a Level I trauma center was conducted. Exclusion criteria included Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 14, and chronic opiate use. Groups were randomized to either low-dose ketamine (LDK) at 2 μg·kg·min or an equivalent rate of 0.9% normal saline. The primary outcome was reduction in numeric pain scores (NPS). Secondary outcomes included oral morphine equivalent (OME) utilization, epidural rates, pulmonary complications, and adverse events.

Results

Thirty (50.8%) of 59 were randomized to the experimental arm. Groups were similar in makeup. Low-dose ketamine failed to reduce 24-hour NPS or OME totals. Subgroup analysis of 24 patients with Injury Severity Score greater than 15 demonstrated that LDK was associated with a reduction in OME utilization the first 24-hours (25.6 mg vs. 42.6 mg, p = 0.04) but at no other time points. No difference in other secondary outcomes or adverse events was noted.

Conclusion

Low-dose ketamine failed to affect NPS or OME within the overall cohort, but a decrease in OME was observed in those with an Injury Severity Score greater than 15. Additional studies are necessary to confirm whether LDK benefits severely injured elderly patients.

Level Of Evidence

Therapeutic, level I.

### It takes a village and a multimodal toolbox: pain control after multiple rib fractures [^113q9ncF]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

The article by Sadauskas et al is a prospective observational cohort study comparing adults with multiple unilateral rib fractures receiving multimodal pain management with or without ultrasound-guided serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) by emergency physicians.SAPB patients had more fractures (4.2 ± 1.7 vs. 3.2 ± 1.2, p = 0.05), higher baseline pain scores (8.5 ± 1.1 vs. 5.6 ± 2.6, p = 0.0001), more reduction in pain scores (3.7 vs. 0.9 at 3 hours, p = 0.003, 5.1 vs. 2.0 at 24 hours, p = 0.02), and improved incentive spirometry volume (+11% (95% CI 1.5%, 17% vs. −3% (−9.1%, +2.7%), p = 0.008). These benefits dissipated after 24 hours. There was no difference in morphine equivalents, length of stay, need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or adverse events.

This study offers promise of a new, rapidly available tool in our toolbox of rib fracture management. However, it is also a reminder that the whole toolbox is necessary. For example, the authors note that SAPB has not been validated for bilateral or posterior rib fractures. A recent practice management guideline from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma and the Chest Wall Injury Society on non-operative rib fracture management in elderly patients could not recommend for or against ketamine, epidural catheters, or other locoregional analgesia modalities as compared with multimodal pain management, instead advocating 'a multifaceted pain management strategy based on multimodal analgesia and other techniques according to provider judgment and institutional resources'.
This study also reminds us that emergency physicians, with their ultrasound expertise, have a critical role to play in rib fracture management along with trauma surgeons, intensivists, anesthesiologists, internists and geriatricians, respiratory and physical therapists, and others. Emergency physicians, as demonstrated here, are the first to see chest trauma patients in many centers and may be able to offer advanced therapies; a separate emergency physician-directed randomized trial demonstrated reduction of pain and morphine equivalents when ultrasound-guided erector spinae blocks were used for rescue analgesia. Locoregional analgesia also has critical care implications due to potential reduction of delirium in elderly patients with rib fractures.

### Multiple rib fractures: does flail chest matter? [^114mZRpD]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent studies have reported significant morbidity and mortality in patients with multiple rib fractures, even without flail chest. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcome and incidence of associated chest injuries between patients with and without flail chest, with three or more rib fractures.

Methods

This study included patients with blunt trauma with at least three rib fractures, hospitalised during 2010–2019 in the Hillel Yaffe Medical Center in central Israel (level II trauma centre). Patients with and without radiologically defined flail chest were compared with regard to demographics, Injury Severity Score (ISS), GCS, systolic blood pressure (SBP) on admission, radiological evidence of flail chest, associated chest injuries, length of stay in intensive care unit, length of hospitalisation and mortality.

Results

The study included 407 patients, of which 79 (19.4%) had flail chest. Overall, pneumothorax and haemothorax were more common among patients with flail chest (p < 0.05). When comparing patients with three to five rib fractures, there was no difference in length of intensive care and length of hospitalisation or mortality; however, there was a higher incidence of pneumothorax (24.6% vs 50.0%, p < 0.05). When comparing patients with six or more rib fractures, no difference was found between patients with and without flail chest.

Conclusion

In patients with three to five rib fractures, pneumothorax is more common among patients with flail chest. Clinical significance of flail chest in patients with more than six rib fractures is questionable and flail chest may not be a reliable marker for severity of chest injury in patients with more than six fractures.

### Rib fracture map in high-energy injuries [^112uMVSV]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To use a novel rib unfurling technology to investigate the locations of multiple rib fractures occurring from high-energy trauma to discern if there are reproducible rib fracture patterns.

Methods

Patients between the ages of 18 and 48 years presenting to a Level 1 academic trauma center with ≥ 2 rib fractures after a high-energy mechanism of injury between 2017 and 2019 were identified. Curved planar reformatting of CT scans was used to create two-dimensional unfurled rib images by flattening out the view of the ribs from a CT scan. Rib fractures were placed on a template map using a standardized measurement method, and subsequent frequency and heat maps were created.

Results

Among 100 consecutive patients, 534 fractures on 454 ribs were identified. The most common high-energy mechanism of injury was motor vehicle accidents (41%). Flail chest occurred in 8% of patients. The mean number of ribs fractured per patient was 4.54 ± 3.14 and included a mean of 5.34 ± 4.38 total fractures. Among all fractures, 50.9% were located on ribs 4 through 7. The most common fracture location was located in the lateral or anterolateral zone of the rib cage.

Conclusions

Patients with multiple rib fractures from high-energy trauma have rib fractures with locations of common occurrence. An understanding of location and frequency of rib fractures can help inform surgical approaches, prognosis, indications, classifications, and implant design in the management of a complex population of patients with chest wall injury after trauma.

### Remote spirometry in rib fracture rehabilitation: a step toward personalized recovery monitoring [^11454sJw]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

The management of multiple rib fractures remains a critical challenge in trauma care. These injuries frequently lead to prolonged pulmonary impairment, increasing the risk of complications such as pneumonia, prolonged hospital stays, and delayed return to normal function. Traditional pulmonary rehabilitation relies on in-hospital assessments and subjective symptom reporting, often limiting timely interventions. In this context, the study by Liao et al presents an innovative approach — remote spirometry — to enable continuous pulmonary function monitoring after hospital discharge for acute rib fractures.

This prospective pilot study conducted at a tertiary trauma center demonstrates the feasibility of a wireless spirometry system integrated with a mobile health application. Among 113 eligible patients with multiple rib fractures, 21 were ultimately enrolled. The study highlights that while both younger and older patients successfully adopted the device, younger patients showed significantly greater improvements in pulmonary function. Specifically, younger patients demonstrated notable increases in forced vital capacity (110% vs. 10%, p = 0.032) and peak expiratory flow (64.2% vs. 11.9%, p = 0.003). However, system adherence varied, with a declining trend in engagement over time. Interestingly, geriatric patient adoption was found to be higher than that of younger patients (80% vs. 43.8%).

The findings align with previous research on remote monitoring via spirometry in other pulmonary disease processes. Prior studies have demonstrated the benefits of remote pulmonary monitoring in conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial lung disease. The application of at-home spirometry in rib fracture patients represents an important step toward personalized rehabilitation strategies.

Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is gaining traction as an essential tool in managing rib fracture patients. The study by Jones et al implemented a mobile application and handheld incentive spirometry to track respiratory function and other aspects of recovery at home. Their findings suggest that integrating RPM into standard post-discharge care may reduce patient complications and hospital readmission. This aligns with broader efforts to leverage digital health tools in trauma recovery, reducing the need for in-person visits while maintaining high-quality patient monitoring. The ability to collect real-time pulmonary function data remotely provides an opportunity for early detection of respiratory decline, potentially reducing hospital readmissions and improving outcomes.

### In patients with combined clavicle and multiple rib fractures, does fracture fixation of the clavicle improve clinical outcomes? A multicenter prospective cohort study of 232 patients [^115imkQb]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Study Design

Data for the current study on combined multiple rib and clavicle fractures were gathered from the database of the OPVENT study. The OPVENT study is an international multicenter prospective cohort study consisting of 1,014 patients with multiple rib fractures and/or flail chest and compared nonoperative treatment with rib fixation. This study was performed in six level 1 trauma centers between January 2018 and March 2021. The study protocol and results on operative versus nonoperative treatment of multiple rib fractures have been published.

In the current study, we focus solely on patients with rib fractures in combination with a clavicle fracture. All consecutive patients of 18 years and older with computed tomography confirmed that multiple rib fractures (defined as three or more ipsilateral rib fractures) combined with an ipsilateral clavicle fracture were eligible for inclusion. The exclusion criteria were cognitive impairment, nontraumatic rib fractures, and rib fractures due to cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This study adhered to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines (Supplemental Digital Content, Supplementary Data 1).

Study Population

Patient characteristics measured at hospital admission included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesia score, presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking status, trauma mechanism, Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score, Injury Severity Score (ISS), number of fractured ribs, clinical or radiological flail chest (defined as three or more sequential rib fractures in two or more places with [clinical] or without [radiological] paradoxical movement of the chest wall), concomitant injuries (i.e. pulmonary contusion, pneumothorax, hemothorax, and sternum fracture), and laboratory results (specifically pH and base excess).

### New horizons in rib fracture management in the older adult [^111h97zq]. Age and Ageing (2020). Medium credibility.

Adults aged ≥ 60 years now represent the majority of patients presenting with major trauma. Falls are the most common cause of injury, accounting for nearly three-quarters of all traumas in this population. Trauma to the thorax represents the second most common site of injury in this population, and is often associated with other serious injuries. Mortality rates are 2–5 times higher in older adults compared to their younger counterparts, often despite equivalent injury severity scores. Risk scoring systems have been developed to identify rib fracture patients at high risk of deterioration. Overall mortality from rib fractures is high, at approximately 10% for all ages. Mortality and morbidity from rib fractures primarily derive from pain-induced hypoventilation, pneumonia and respiratory failure. The main goal of care is therefore to provide sufficient analgesia to allow respiratory rehabilitation and prevent pulmonary complications. The provision of analgesia has evolved to incorporate novel regional anaesthesia techniques into conventional multimodal analgesia. Analgesia algorithms may aid early aggressive management and escalation of pain control. The current role for surgical fixation of rib fractures remains unclear for older adults who have been underrepresented in the research literature. Older adults with rib fractures often have multi-morbidity and frailty which complicate their injuries. Trauma services are evolving, and increasingly geriatricians will be embedded into trauma services to deliver comprehensive geriatric assessment. This review aims to provide an evidence-based overview of the management of rib fractures for the physician treating older patients who have sustained trauma.

### Rib fixation in non-ventilator-dependent chest wall injuries: a prospective randomized trial [^1131j692]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to assess pain and quality of life (QoL) outcomes in patients with multiple painful displaced fractured ribs with and without operative fixation. Rib fractures are common and can lead to significant pain and disability. There is minimal level 1 evidence for rib fixation in non-ventilator-dependent patients with chest wall injuries. We hypothesized that surgical stabilization of rib fractures would reduce pain and improve QoL during 6 months.

Methods

A prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing rib fixation to nonoperative management of nonventilated patients with at least three consecutive rib fractures was conducted. Inclusion criteria were rib fracture displacement and/or ongoing pain. Pain (McGill Pain Questionnaire) and QoL (Short Form 12) at 3 and 6 months postinjury were assessed. Surgeons enrolled patients in whom they felt there was clinical equipoise. Patients who were deemed to need surgical fixation or who were deemed to be too well to be randomized to rib fixation were not enrolled.

Results

A total of 124 patients were enrolled at four sites between 2017 and 2020. Sixty-one patients were randomized to operative management and 63 to nonoperative management. No differences were seen in the primary endpoint of Pain Rating Index at 3 months or in the QoL measures. Return-to-work rates improved between 3 and 6 months, favoring the operative group.

Conclusion

In this study, no improvements in pain or QoL at 3 and 6 months in patients undergoing rib fixation for nonflail, non-ventilator-dependent rib fractures have been demonstrated.

Rib fractures are the most common form of blunt thoracic injury. Multiple rib fractures are an important indicator of trauma severity, with increased morbidity and mortality occurring with increasing numbers of rib fractures, especially in the elderly. Thoracic cage injuries may be associated with concomitant and potentially life-threating injuries. In the acute setting, correct recognition of the pattern, extent and severity of thoracic cage injuries, may aid in more accurate delineation of concomitant injuries.

### Comparative effectiveness analysis of two regional analgesia techniques for the pain management of isolated multiple rib fractures [^114eViwo]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Plain language summary

Given the promising, yet limited, literature regarding the effectiveness of regional catheter-based analgesia, this study sought to compare the efficacy of regional analgesia techniques for decreasing pain and improving clinical outcomes. Two techniques were compared: continuous intercostal nerve blocks and epidural catheter analgesia. The results of this study demonstrated that patients with continuous intercostal nerve blocks reported similar self-reported pain scores compared to patients receiving epidural analgesia, but they had shorter hospital and ICU length of stay and better pulmonary function. Continuous intercostal nerve blocks offer a viable alternative for pain control in patients with multiple rib fractures, resulting in well controlled pain and favorable outcomes.

### Surgical stabilization of rib fractures improves survival in functionally dependent trauma patients [^115EB2bR]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Rib fractures are frequently encountered in trauma care and are particularly hazardous for functionally dependent patients, leading to increased morbidity and mortality rates. Surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) improves outcomes in selected populations; however, its role in functionally dependent individuals remains underexplored.

Methods

A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using the American College of Surgeons-Trauma Quality Improvement Program dataset from 2020 to 2022. Patients with three or more rib fractures and AIS (Abbreviated Injury Scale) greater than 3 for the rib and thoracic wall, along with documented functional dependency, were included. Propensity score matching (3:1) was applied to reduce the selection bias between patients receiving SSRF and those managed conservatively. The main outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality, acute respiratory distress syndrome, unplanned intensive care unit (ICU) admission, unplanned intubation, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). A subgroup analysis compared early (≤ 72 h) versus late SSRF.

Results

Among 18,643 eligible patients, 359 (1.9%) underwent SSRF. Before matching, patients with SSRF had higher Injury Severity Scores (ISS), ICU admissions, and complication rates. After matching (294 SSRF vs. 883 conservative patients), SSRF was associated with significantly lower mortality (4.8% vs. 8.7%, p = 0.038) despite higher rates of unplanned ICU admission (11.2% vs. 7.0%, p = 0.031), unplanned intubation (10.2% vs. 6.1%, p = 0.026), and VAP (3.1% vs. 0.6%, p = 0.002). In the subgroup analysis, early SSRF led to fewer ventilator days (p = 0.013), and shorter ICU (p < 0.001), and hospital length of stays (LOS, p < 0.001), with no difference in mortality compared with late SSRF. However, the late SSRF group still had significantly lower in-hospital mortality compared to the conservative treatment group (3.8% vs. 10.9%, p = 0.023).

Conclusion

SSRF in functionally dependent trauma patients with multiple rib fractures and significant chest wall injury (AIS ≥ 3) is associated with a significant reduction in in-hospital mortality compared to conservative management, despite a higher incidence of complications and prolonged ICU LOS. Early SSRF further improves clinical outcomes by decreasing ventilator duration and overall hospital LOS. These findings support the consideration of SSRF-particularly when performed early-as a beneficial strategy for managing rib fractures in functionally dependent patients. Even when performed at a later stage, SSRF still offers advantages over conservative treatment in reducing mortality. prospective studies are warranted to validate these results and establish clear patient selection criteria.

### The effectiveness of early surgical stabilization for multiple rib fractures: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^112WYkTV]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple rib fractures (≥ 3 displaced rib fractures and/or flail chest) are severe chest trauma with high morbidity and mortality. Rib fixation has become the first choice for multiple rib fracture treatment. However, the timing of surgical rib fixation is unclear.

Materials and Methods

The present study explored whether early rib fracture fixation can improve the outcome of multiple rib fractures. The present research included patients who were hospitalized in three Jiangsu hospitals following diagnosis with multiple rib fractures. Patients received early rib fracture fixation (≤ 48 h) or delayed rib fracture fixation (> 48 h) utilizing computer-based random sequencing (in a 1:1 ratio). The primary outcome measures included hospital length of stay, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, mechanical ventilation, inflammatory cytokine levels, infection marker levels, infection, and mortality.

Results

A total of 403 individuals were classified into two groups, namely, the early group (n = 201) and the delayed group (n = 202). Patients belonging to the two groups had similar baseline clinical data, and there were no statistically significant differences between them. Early rib fracture fixation greatly decreased the length of stay in the ICU (4.63 days vs. 6.72 days, p < 0.001), overall hospital stay (10.15 days vs. 12.43 days, p < 0.001), ventilation days (3.67 days vs. 4.55 days, p < 0.001), and hospitalization cost (6900 USD vs. 7600 USD, p = 0.008). Early rib fracture fixation can decrease inflammatory cytokine levels and infection marker levels, prevent hyperinflammation and improve infection in patients with multiple rib fractures. The timing of rib fracture fixation does not influence the surgical procedure time, operative blood loss, 30-day all-cause mortality, or surgical site infection.

Conclusion

The findings from the present research indicated that early rib fracture fixation (≤ 48 h) is a safe, rational, effective and economical strategy and worth clinical promotion.

### Early fixation versus conservative therapy of multiple, simple rib fractures (fixCon): protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^112gWkoD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Recruitment and randomization

Eligible persons presenting to the emergency department (ED) or referred from another hospital, with multiple, simple rib fractures will be informed about the trial at the ED or at the surgical ward after admission. After explanation of the study, eligible patients will receive written information and a consent form from the attending physician, the clinical investigator, or a research assistant. Patients meeting all eligibility criteria will be recruited within 1 day after hospital admission. As surgical rib fixation appears to be most beneficial when performed within 72 h after trauma, patients are stimulated to decide within this period. However, informed consent can be given by the patient as long as rib fixation can be carried out within 1 week after trauma. Should patients not be able to sign informed consent themselves, a legal representative will receive oral and written information about the study, in the hospital, by the attending physician, the clinical investigator, or a research assistant, and will be asked to consent with participation of the patient.

After signing informed consent by patient or proxy, participants are allocated to one of the two study arms (surgical stabilization or nonoperative treatment) using a web-based randomization program that will be available 24 h a day. Allocation will be at random and concealed, in a 1:1 ratio, and will be stratified by site. Variable block sizes will be used; in each block, both treatments will be represented equally. As the intervention cannot be blinded, it will in no case be necessary to break the randomization code.

As with many surgical trials, patients and surgeons cannot be blinded for the intervention. In order to reduce bias as much as possible, a research physician or research assistant will perform the follow-up measurements using a standardized protocol. Also, the treating surgeon or ICU doctor will identify the primary outcome (i.e. pneumonia) based on the definition as mentioned under outcome measures.

Participation is on a voluntary basis and participants are allowed to withdraw from the study at any time without specifying why. The general practitioner will be informed about the patients' participation.

### Outcomes of surgical versus nonsurgical treatment for multiple rib fractures: a US hospital matched cohort database analysis [^116yU6BK]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The study findings provide important evidence regarding demographic characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with multiple rib fractures for SSRF versus NOM cohorts. Compared with patients treated with NOM, patients in SSRF cohort were younger, with higher rates of concurrent and severe injuries, indicating that surgical intervention is selectively being provided to the more severe patients. However, patients with SSRF demonstrated better recovery and were more likely to be discharged home versus to a skilled nursing facility or other inpatient care than NOM patients. At 3 and 12 months postadmission, the lung-related readmission rates were lower in SSRF than NOM cohort.

### Comparative effectiveness analysis of two regional analgesia techniques for the pain management of isolated multiple rib fractures [^115YPDZJ]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: Catheter-based regional analgesia has been proposed as an alternative to systemic analgesia for patients with multiple rib fractures (MRF). This study sought to compare the efficacy of regional techniques for decreasing pain and improving clinical outcomes. Study design: This was a multi-institutional, retrospective cohort study of adult (≥ 18 years) patients admitted to four nonacademic trauma centers over two years (from 07/1/2014 to 06/30/2016). Study inclusion was MRF (≥ 3 fractures) with no other severe injuries. Two primary regional analgesia techniques were utilized and compared: continuous intercostal nerve blocks (CINB) and epidural (EPI) analgesia. The primary outcome, average pain scores on treatment, was examined using a repeated measures, linear regression mixed model. Secondary outcomes included hospital LOS, ICU LOS, ICU admission and hospital readmission, pulmonary complications, and incentive spirometry volumes during treatment, and were examined with univariate statistics. Results: There were 339 patients with isolated MRF; 85 (25%) required regional analgesia (CINB, n = 41; EPI, n = 44) and the remaining 75% received systemic analgesia only (IV, n = 195; PO, n = 59). There were demographic and clinical differences between regional analgesia and systemic analgesia groups; on the contrary, there were no demographic or clinical differences between the CINB and EPI groups. Adjusted pain scores were similar for the EPI and CINB groups (4.0 vs 4.4, p = 0.49). Secondary outcomes were worse in the EPI group compared to the CINB group: less improvement in incentive spirometry volume (p = 0.004), longer ICU LOS (p = 0.03), longer hospital LOS (p < 0.001), and more ICU admission (p < 0.001). Conclusion: In patients requiring regional analgesia, pain management was equivalent with CINB and EPI, but CINB was associated with significantly better clinical outcomes. CINB might offer an efficient alternative for pain control in patients with MRF.

### To fix or let them flail: the who, what and when of rib fixation [^112U3Lt2]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Rib fractures are a common traumatic injury and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. For decades, the primary management of rib fractures relied on conservative management including pain control, respiratory hygiene and physical therapy without a substantial improvement in outcomes. The paradigm is shifting, however, as more and more patients are undergoing SSRF with advancing technologies that allow for safer and more effective surgeries. Particularly in patients with FC, unstable chest walls, inability to wean from a ventilator, non-union or chronic pain, SSRF has demonstrated benefits in mortality, ICU LOS and pain control. Although the data are currently limited, the literature continues to expand the scope of indications for SSRF. As technology in polymer chemistry advances, the material utilized for SSRF continues to improve as well. This review offers an overview of indications, contraindications and main points to consider for SSRF and hopes to guide physicians and direct future research as it pertains to the surgical management of rib fractures.

### Delayed hemothorax following blunt thoracic trauma: a case report [^117AfumD]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion and Conclusions

This case involves an elderly patient with multiple comorbidities who sustained blunt thoracic trauma, resulting in multiple rib fractures (MRF) and hemothorax without clear indications for surgical management. Initially, the patient responded to conservative management of the MRF and tube thoracostomy for the hemothorax. However, the clinical course became erratic, characterized by anemia, acute renal injury, GI bleeding and multiple infectious complications. Notwithstanding, active bleeding from an intercostal artery was not detected until post-trauma day 58, which delayed surgical management.

The management of rib fractures and mild to moderate hemothorax are controversial. This patient was not considered for surgical stabilization of the rib fractures because the fracture patterns (non-displaced or minimally displaced) combined with the patient´s comorbidities, suggest a greater risk than the benefit in undergoing surgical stabilization. Traditionally, the management of hemothorax includes chest tube placement. Observational data has suggested that expectant management of hemothorax following blunt chest trauma may be an appropriate strategy in stable patients.

Delayed hemothorax is a rare complication from blunt chest trauma, predominantly affecting the elderly. About 12.3% of cases result in delayed hemothorax, usually within 14 days from the day of trauma. MRF are associated in 92% of cases. Recent reports detail cases from 30 up to 44 days post-trauma. Delayed hemothorax represents significant morbidity and functional decline in this group of patients. This patient has predictors for delayed hemothorax. A propensity cohort study proposed a clinical prediction score for delayed hemothorax. According to its findings, both an age > 70 years and the presence of three or more rib fractures are factors present in the patient that may associate to the occurrence of this complication. However, age, frailty and multiple comorbidities configured a higher risk of postoperative complications, with some presenting in this case, including acute renal injury and multiple infectious hits.

### Rib fractures, the evidence supporting their management, and adherence to that evidence base… [^1134B7Wa]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

The octogenarian who fell into the side of his bathtub; the restrained driver in a motor vehicle collision at 40 mph with side impact; the retiree who slipped from her ladder while cleaning out her gutters. Invariably, it seems, an initial chest radiograph shows some fractured ribs, and the injury list in the electronic health record is populated with an S22 International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis code. However, from this juncture, given that trauma surgeons are wont to form strong but divergent opinions regarding management, the treatment courses vary. Is a chest computed tomographic scan necessary. Should the patient be admitted to an intensive care unit. Which form of analgesia is most appropriate. Should a thoracostomy tube be placed for a modest associated pneumothorax or hemothorax. Does noninvasive ventilation have a role. If there are multiple adjacent rib fractures, should the fractures be operatively stabilized.

In their cohort study evaluating more than 625 000 patients with rib fractures at 777 US trauma centers in the National Trauma Data Bank from 2007 to 2014, Tignanelli et al1 waded into the complex but fundamentally central topics of how, from an empirical perspective, trauma surgeons actually manage these patients and how aligned this care is with the available evidence from comparative effectiveness studies. They identified that among 6 so-called evidence-based practices — ie, neuraxial blockade, intensive care unit admission, pneumatic stabilization, chest computed tomographic scans for elderly patients.

with at least 3 fractured ribs, operative fixation of what is known as flail chest, and tube thoracostomy for pneumothorax or hemothorax — 3 were associated with decreased inpatient mortality, and adherence across all centers to all 6 EBPs was modest at best and negligible at worst. Readers could easily conclude that trauma surgeons disregard available evidence of comparative effectiveness and are not optimally managing patients with chest wall injuries, possibly at significant detriment to the outcomes of those patients.

### The analgesic effect of retro-laminar block versus paravertebral block in patients with multiple fracture ribs… [^117RTW4G]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Rib fractures are a common injury, occurring in up to 10% of all trauma patients. Multiple rib fractures can be particularly painful and debilitating, making it difficult for patients to breathe and cough. This can lead to complications such as atelectasis, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. Adequate pain control is essential for patients with rib fractures. This can help to improve respiratory function, reduce the risk of complications, and speed up recovery. RLB is thought to be easier to perform than PVB, and there is a lower risk of complications. However, there is limited studies support the use of RLB for pain management in patients with rib fractures. The primary objective of this research is to compare the analgesic efficacy of retrolaminar block and paravertebral block in patients with fracture ribs.

Secondary objectives include:

- To compare the safety of RLB and PVB
- To compare the duration of analgesia provided by RLB and PVB Rib fractures are a common injury, occurring in up to 10% of all trauma patients. Multiple rib fractures can be particularly painful and debilitating, making it difficult for patients to breathe and cough. This can lead to complications such as atelectasis, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. However, PVB can be technically challenging to perform, and there is a risk of complications such as pneumothorax and pleural puncture. Retrolaminar block is a newer regional anaesthetic technique that has been proposed as an alternative to PVB for pain management in patients with rib fractures. RLB involves injecting local anaesthetics into the retrolaminar space, which is a region of tissue located between the lamina of the vertebra and the epidural space. RLB is thought to be easier to perform than PVB, and there is a lower risk of complications.

However, there is limited studies support the use of RLB for pain management in patients with rib fractures. Procedure: rertrolaminar block Procedure: paravertebral block

### Thoracic blocks versus thoracic epidural and patient controlled… [^113Vwcsu]. ClinicalTrials (2012). Low credibility.

Thoracic Blocks Versus Thoracic Epidural and Patient Controlled Anesthesia in Traumatic Rib Fracture PatientsClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Rib fractures are the most common injury sustained following blunt trauma. Ziegler and Agarwal noted that in a population of more than 7000 trauma patients, 10% had fractured ribs. These injuries are normally the hallmark of significant chest trauma; and as the number of fractured ribs increases, there is an exponential increase in morbidity and mortality. For healthy patients with one to two fractured ribs, systemic analgesics may suffice. For more than three to four fractured ribs, studies and experience have reaffirmed the superior analgesia made possible with continuous thoracic epidural, continuous thoracic paravertebral, and continuous intercostal block, however, a comparative head to head trial comparing the relative merits and disadvantages of each technique has not been undertaken in multiple rib fracture patients.

Rib fractures following trauma are associated with severe postoperative pain and significant morbidity. Atelectasis, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and intensive care admission are related to poor analgesia and consequent immobility and splinting during inspiration. With traumatic multiple fractured ribs, concomitant lung injury is expected. The effect of this injury is exacerbated when the pain of MFR leads to guarding, shallow breaths, and suboptimal chest physiotherapy. Atelectasis, pneumonia, consolidation, and respiratory failure ensue, necessitating or prolonging assisted ventilation and/or oxygenation and increasing morbidity and mortality. Additionally, inadequately treated pain after rib fractures can lead to chronic pain and global deconditioning.

Regional/neuraxial blocks provide superior analgesia, the impact of a successful block is immediate and substantial, and, especially regarding elderly, some authorities have categorically stated that most 55–65 year-olds with three or four fractured ribs should receive a regional block. The relative lack of systemic sedation makes it easier to monitor patients with head and abdominal injuries, and the reduced need for systemic medications obviates their inherent concomitant risks. These findings suggest that a thoracic paravertebral block is the best available analgesic method in rib trauma patients: however, the above studies have been performed in the post-surgical setting and not the trauma setting, and concentrated their findings on respiratory parameters, and not pain relief, though the two may be related.
