## Question

Treatment pancolitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment approach for ulcerative colitis with pancolitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the disease extent and severity. Then, I should confirm baseline assessment and prognostic markers. Next, I will consider first-line therapy for mild-to-moderate pancolitis, followed by induction for moderate-to-severe disease and rescue strategies for severe or steroid-refractory cases. After that, I need to outline maintenance options and address special populations, and finally, I should plan surveillance, patient education, and summarize an algorithm with checkpoints for reassessment and escalation decisions.

> Let me first confirm the disease extent and severity, because treatment hinges on both. Pancolitis is defined as inflammation extending proximal to the hepatic flexure and accounts for roughly 20–40% of UC; it carries higher risks of colectomy and colorectal cancer than more limited disease, so I need to be explicit about this extent and its implications at baseline [^114KW9LJ] [^1147LA1v]. I should verify severity using a validated tool such as the Mayo Score and incorporate endoscopic severity and patient-reported outcomes; objective markers like fecal calprotectin and CRP help stratify risk and track response, with calprotectin correlating with endoscopic remission and surgery risk in acute severe colitis, while albumin can reflect severity in flares [^1137xL3P] [^115AZoZK].

> Next, I should review the initial workup and exclude mimics. Wait, let me verify that infections like C. difficile are excluded at diagnosis, since this can change management; in patients with cystic fibrosis, for example, C. difficile pancolitis may present atypically and can require systemic steroids alongside antibiotics, underscoring the need to check stool studies early [^117NZ6Qt]. I need to ensure that endoscopic evaluation with intubation of the ileum and biopsies is obtained to confirm UC and map extent; in pancolitis, microscopic "backwash" ileitis may be present and does not automatically reclassify to Crohn's disease, particularly in children, so I should not jump to conclusions about diagnosis based on subtle ileal changes alone [^115AZoZK] [^112nZPQ5]. I should confirm that liver tests are obtained to screen for PSC, given its higher prevalence in pancolitis and its impact on cancer surveillance and phenotype [^1121vgPx] [^114XxtZk].

> For mild-to-moderate pancolitis, I need to start oral 5-ASA promptly. The AGA recommends standard-dose mesalamine at 2–3 g/day rather than low-dose, and for extensive disease I should add rectal mesalamine to oral therapy to improve induction rates. Let me double-check that the labeling aligns with this practice, and yes, both Pentasa and Rowasa support this combined topical plus oral approach in extensive disease [^1122CA1G]. Hold on, I should verify the maintenance target; sustained remission is protective for cancer risk regardless of how it is achieved, so maintaining mesalamine long term remains reasonable even after escalation if tolerated and beneficial, while acknowledging the evidence base for continued 5-ASA after advanced therapy is mixed and observational [^111LmBH4].

> Now, for moderate-to-severe pancolitis, I will now examine corticosteroid-based induction. Prednisolone 40–60 mg/day is appropriate for induction, with tapering once remission is achieved. I need to ensure that we do not rely on steroids for maintenance given toxicity and lack of efficacy in that role, and I should plan a steroid-sparing agent early in the course [^111HnZi6] [^1129YJSU]. But wait, what if symptoms are severe enough to warrant hospitalization or there is high inflammatory burden; in that scenario, intravenous corticosteroids are indicated, and escalation to rescue therapy should be on the table if there is no improvement within about 3–5 days, guided by clinical trajectory and biomarkers [^111HnZi6] [^113cm3zk].

> For steroid-refractory or steroid-dependent disease, I should confirm that infliximab is preferred as first-line advanced therapy. ACG emphasizes that infliximab has the fastest onset among anti-TNFs and is often favored in severe presentations; vedolizumab is a reasonable alternative, particularly for patients at higher infectious risk, and both have robust evidence for induction and maintenance in UC [^1137xL3P] [^111NdPeT]. Let me consider timing; early introduction of biologics is associated with better outcomes than waiting through multiple steroid cycles, and in pancolitis I should not delay escalation if response is inadequate [^111NdPeT] [^113VU8Ae].

> For acute severe ulcerative colitis, I need to check inpatient rescue algorithms. If IV steroids fail within 3–5 days, infliximab or cyclosporine are acceptable rescue options, with infliximab generally preferred for its rapid onset. I should coordinate surgical consultation early, as colectomy remains the definitive salvage for fulminant disease or toxic megacolon and should not be delayed unnecessarily [^111HnZi6] [^1137xL3P]. Toxic megacolon is a life-threatening complication; if suspected, I should confirm the diagnosis with imaging and escalate care promptly to prevent perforation and sepsis [^111HnZi6].

> Once remission is achieved, I should review maintenance strategies. Thiopurines can maintain steroid-induced remission and are reasonable options when steroid-sparing maintenance is needed, acknowledging modest efficacy relative to biologics; meta-analyses suggest benefit over placebo, though with nontrivial adverse effect considerations, so shared decision-making is essential [^1177GTrt]. Anti-TNF therapy, particularly infliximab or adalimumab, is effective for maintenance and reduces relapse; vedolizumab is an appropriate alternative for those preferring a gut-selective agent or with higher infection risk, and real-world data support its persistence and effectiveness in UC cohorts including pancolitis [^1137xL3P]. I should double-check whether tofacitinib or upadacitinib are options; current guidance supports JAK inhibition in moderate-to-severe UC after anti-TNF or as alternatives in selected patients, with careful attention to thrombotic and infection risks, and labeling supports use in adults with moderate-to-severe UC [^115uSZW7] [^116WdNv5].

> Let me consider special populations and comorbidities. In pediatric UC, pancolitis predominates and mesalamine alone is less likely to induce remission; early escalation to immunomodulators or biologics is often necessary, and infliximab remains a first-line advanced therapy with robust pediatric data and the need for therapeutic drug monitoring to optimize outcomes [^112xAHpY] [^115kBoVL]. In PSC-associated UC, pancolitis with rectal sparing and right-sided predominance is common, and colonoscopic surveillance should be intensified given the elevated CRC risk; I should confirm that MRCP is considered for PSC surveillance and coordinate hepatology care early [^114XxtZk] [^1176dx9r]. During pregnancy, cyclosporine has supportive safety data for steroid-refractory flares, and I should balance maternal-fetal risks with the urgency of control and the need to avoid delays in escalation [^115UApv3].

> I should confirm cancer surveillance protocols. For pancolitis, colonoscopic surveillance for dysplasia and cancer should begin 8 years after diagnosis and be repeated every 1–3 years, with consideration of chromoendoscopy or advanced imaging techniques to improve yield; patients with PSC warrant earlier and more frequent surveillance given the markedly increased CRC risk [^111HnZi6] [^114XxtZk]. In pediatrics, I need to ensure surveillance starts when appropriate and is individualized; although childhood CRC is rare, pediatric-onset UC and PSC confer substantial lifetime risk, and expert consensus recommends aligning surveillance timing and intervals with adult guidance once the child reaches adolescence or based on cumulative risk [^111Frgxt] [^111KPHPo].

> I need to ensure supportive care and patient education are embedded throughout. Mesalamine adherence improves outcomes and may be associated with reduced disease extent over time; counseling on medication persistence, adverse effect monitoring, and the risks of prolonged corticosteroid exposure should be routine [^11764GWs] [^111HnZi6]. I should review modifiable lifestyle factors; although diet is adjunctive, patterns emphasizing whole foods and fiber may be beneficial, and patients should be advised on infection risk mitigation when on immunosuppression, including vaccination and opportunistic infection screening as appropriate [^115ofuaL].

> Finally, I will summarize the treatment algorithm with explicit checkpoints. Start with 5-ASA and add rectal therapy in extensive disease. Escalate to prednisolone for moderate-to-severe flares with a plan to taper and introduce a steroid-sparing agent. If steroid-refractory or steroid-dependent, initiate infliximab or vedolizumab, consider tofacitinib or upadacitinib in appropriate patients, and use infliximab or cyclosporine as rescue in acute severe UC with early surgical involvement. Maintain remission with a biologic, vedolizumab, or thiopurine as appropriate, continue 5-ASA if tolerated, and monitor disease with endoscopy and biomarkers while implementing surveillance for colorectal cancer based on extent and PSC status [^1137xL3P] [^111qCkN8] [^115uSZW7] [^116WdNv5] [^111HnZi6].

Pancolitis management centers on **early, aggressive therapy** to induce remission and **maintenance therapy** to prevent relapse [^115MXjFQ]. For mild-to-moderate disease, use high-dose oral mesalamine (2.4–4.8 g/day) plus rectal mesalamine [^1122CA1G]; if unresponsive, add prednisolone 40 mg/day and taper over 8 weeks [^112ZVxWP]. For moderate-to-severe or steroid-refractory disease, initiate anti-TNF (infliximab preferred) [^1137xL3P] or vedolizumab [^111NdPeT]; consider tofacitinib or ustekinumab as alternatives [^111NdPeT]. In acute severe colitis, give IV corticosteroids [^111HnZi6]; if no improvement in 72 hours, escalate to infliximab or cyclosporine, or proceed to colectomy [^notfound]. Maintenance with mesalamine, thiopurines, or biologics is essential; monitor for complications and malignancy risk with periodic colonoscopy [^111HnZi6].

- **Adjunctive therapy**: Thromboprophylaxis, electrolyte correction, and nutritional support [^notfound].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for **refractory disease**, **complications**, or **dysplasia/cancer**:

- **Indications**: Refractory to medical therapy, acute severe colitis, toxic megacolon, perforation, severe hemorrhage, dysplasia, or cancer [^111HnZi6].
- **Procedures**: Total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is preferred; total colectomy with end ileostomy if IPAA is contraindicated [^112W5qNs].
- **Outcomes**: High patient satisfaction, durable remission, and reduced cancer risk.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is essential to assess **disease activity**, **treatment response**, and **complications**:

- **Clinical assessment**: Regular visits, symptom tracking, and patient-reported outcomes [^115AZoZK].
- **Endoscopic evaluation**: Periodic colonoscopy to assess mucosal healing and detect dysplasia or cancer [^111HnZi6].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, CRP, fecal calprotectin, and liver function tests [^113cm3zk].
- **Imaging**: MRI or CT for complications or extraintestinal manifestations [^1176dx9r].

---

## Complications and extraintestinal manifestations

Pancolitis is associated with significant **complications** and **extraintestinal manifestations**:

| **Complications** | **Extraintestinal manifestations** |
|-|-|
| Toxic megacolon | Arthritis |
| Perforation | Pyoderma gangrenosum |
| Severe hemorrhage | Erythema nodosum |
| Colorectal cancer | Primary sclerosing cholangitis |
| Nutritional deficiencies | Ocular inflammation |

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Emerging therapies include **novel biologics** (e.g. anti-IL-23 agents, S1P modulators) and **small molecules** (JAK inhibitors) [^116iV3zh]. Personalized medicine aims to tailor therapy using biomarkers and genetic profiling [^111WXXm2], and ongoing trials are evaluating new agents and combination strategies [^notfound].

---

Pancolitis requires a **stepwise approach**: mesalamine for mild disease, corticosteroids for moderate flares, and biologics or small molecules for severe or refractory cases, with surgery for complications or refractoriness. Regular monitoring and individualized care are essential for optimal outcomes.

AGA Living Clinical Practice Guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis — future directions and updating plan note that "future selection of therapy may be based on predictive clinical and biomarker-based models", but "there is a paucity of data on how such models can inform treatment selection in the real-world setting", with "ongoing research efforts using multi-omic platforms using serum, stool, and tissue specimens" to develop predictive biomarkers. It emphasizes that "Shared decision making is an important process in selecting the management strategy for management of ulcerative colitis" and describes potential strategies including "combination advanced therapy or episodic use of nonimmunogenic advanced therapies, such as small molecules", while stating that "Further primary data are required to accurately inform the positioning of such strategies". For maintenance as a living guideline, it specifies that "the AGA will update relevant recommendations from these guidelines by periodic review of evidence every 6 months", and that the review "will include availability of phase 3 or phase 4 efficacy data for new treatments, treatment strategies, or existing treatments, as well as significant new safety concerns informing treatment positioning".

4.4 Maintenance treatment in ileocolonic Crohn's disease

Statement 38. We recommend that systemic or locally acting corticosteroids should be avoided as maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease due to toxicity and lack of efficacy (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

Irrespective of whether remission is induced surgically or medically, corticosteroids are not effective in maintaining remission in Crohn's disease compared with placebo (see Section 5.2.8.1: Overuse of corticosteroids). Systematic reviews and pooled trial data show that budesonide does not reduce relapse rates over a 12-month period. One systematic review did show a modest reduction in CDAI scores, but this was outweighed by a significant increase in adverse events and adrenocortical suppression compared with the placebo groups.

4.4.1 Immunomodulator therapy

Statement 39. We recommend that for patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease responding to prednisolone, early introduction of maintenance therapy with thiopurines (GRADE: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence) or methotrexate (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence) should be considered to minimise risk of flare as prednisolone is withdrawn (Agreement: 93.3%).

Relapse of Crohn's disease is common on corticosteroid withdrawal, particularly in moderate to severe disease, and early initiation of corticosteroid-sparing therapy is appropriate. Immunomodulators such as azathioprine, mercaptopurine or methotrexate are effective in the maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease.

4.4.1.1 Thiopurine therapy

Statement 40. We recommend that azathioprine or mercaptopurine can be used as monotherapy in the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (GRADE: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

Thiopurines should not be used for induction of remission in active Crohn's disease. Thiopurines are more effective than placebo in maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease but the Cochrane analysis reports low quality evidence (NNT = 9). A systematic review and network meta-analysis also showed the benefit of azathioprine/mercaptopurine compared with placebo in remission maintenance (OR 1.7 (95% CI 1.3 to 2.6)), although anti-TNF therapy was significantly more effective than thiopurines.

### French national consensus clinical guidelines for the management of ulcerative colitis [^111ssH5W]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of multifactorial etiology that primarily affects the colonic mucosa. The disease progresses over time, and clinical management guidelines should reflect its dynamic nature. There is limited evidence supporting UC management in specific clinical situations, thus precluding an evidence-based approach.

Aim

To use a formal consensus method - the nominal group technique (NGT) - to develop a clinical practice expert opinion to outline simple algorithms and practices, optimize UC management, and assist clinicians in making treatment decisions.

Methods

The consensus was developed by an expert panel of 37 gastroenterologists from various professional organizations with experience in UC management using the qualitative and iterative NGT, incorporating deliberations based on the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation recommendations, recent reviews of scientific literature, and pertinent discussion topics developed by a steering committee. Examples of clinical cases for which there are limited evidence-based data from clinical trials were used. Two working groups proposed and voted on treatment algorithms that were then discussed and voted for by the nominal group as a whole, in order to reach a consensus.

Results

A clinical practice guideline covering management of the following clinical situations was developed: (i) moderate and severe UC; (ii) acute severe UC; (iii) pouchitis; (iv) refractory proctitis, in the form of treatment algorithms.

Conclusions

Given the limited available evidence-based data, a formal consensus methodology was used to develop simple treatment guidelines for UC management in different clinical situations that is now accessible via an online application.

### Treatment of relapsing mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis with the probiotic VSL # 3 as adjunctive to a standard pharmaceutical treatment: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study [^1145XA9D]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Statistical assessment

Baseline characteristics of patients were compared using Student's t-test for independent samples or Pearson's χ²-test as appropriate. Values of P ≥ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Pearson's χ²-test was used to compare the UCDAI score at each visit with the basal visit score after adjustment of data using the last-observation-carried-forward method. Comparison of stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and mucosal appearance at each time between treatment groups and at each visit vs. the basal value was performed using Pearson's χ²-test. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was also assessed.

A multivariate analysis was also performed. The general linear model multivariate procedure is based on a general linear model in which factors and covariates are assumed to have linear relationships to the dependent variables. As dependent variables, we chose UCDAI overall response at visit three (increase of 50% or more in the UCDAI score compared with the screening score) and disease extension at visit three (left-sided colitis, distal colitis, pancolitis). Fixed factors categorical predictors were selected as factors in the model (treatment with placebo or VLS#3, and concomitant treatment with or without the combination of 5-ASA and immunosuppressors). The general linear model multivariate procedure assumes that all model factors are fixed, i.e. they are generally thought of as variables, the values of interest of which are all represented in the data file, usually by design.

The statistical analysis of all the data sets pertaining to efficacy (specifically, primary and secondary end points) and safety (specifically, serious adverse events as defined by federal guidelines) has been independently performed by a biostatistician who is not employed by the corporate entity. The corresponding author had full access to all data and takes full responsibility for the veracity of the data and analysis.

Treatment

The patient was started on prednisone 40 mg daily for 2 weeks, and on the second day, she reported a marked improvement in pain intensity. Steroids were stopped after 2 weeks without tailoring them off as this was too short a course to require tailoring doses. She was discharged on the fifth day on oral prednisone to complete the course.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^113JazSM]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis — role of antibiotics: We suggest against prophylactic antibiotics in patients with severe acute pancreatitis (AP) (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). While antibiotics should not be used in patients with sterile necrosis, antibiotics are an important part of treatment in infected necrosis. In patients with infected necrosis, antibiotics known to penetrate pancreatic necrosis should be used largely to delay surgical, endoscopic, and radiologic drainage beyond 4 weeks, and some patients may avoid drainage altogether because the infection may completely resolve with antibiotics. Routine administration of antifungal agents along with prophylactic or therapeutic antibiotics is not needed. When cultures are negative and no source of infection is identified, antibiotics should be discontinued.

### Indeterminate colitis: a distinctive clinical pattern of inflammatory bowel disease in children [^112W5qNs]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis are frequently clinical conditions in children. Another clinical entity, indeterminate colitis, is considered a subgroup of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. It is generally characterized by early onset in the first years of life, and clinical behavior is rapidly progressive to pancolitis. The definition of indeterminate colitis has changed over the years, but it is usually used to identify severe colitis with overlapping features of ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the surgical treatment of choice for patients with ulcerative colitis, but increased rates of complications have been found in indeterminate colitis. Therefore, it is better to be cautious in patients with indeterminate colitis who present with severe attacks and require surgery.

### Primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease comorbidity: an update of the evidence [^114XxtZk]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Comorbid primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) represent a unique disease phenotype with a different risk profile than PSC or IBD alone. While the pathogenetic mechanisms behind both diseases remain unclear, recent studies have targeted several immune-mediated pathways in an attempt to find a potential therapeutic target. Patients with PSC-associated IBD typically exhibit pancolitis with a right-to-left intestinal inflammatory gradient associated with a greater incidence of backwash ileitis and rectal sparing. Although there is an increased incidence of pancolitis in this population, bowel symptoms tend to be less significant than in IBD alone. Likewise, the degree of inflammation and symptoms of PSC-associated IBD are characteristically less clinically significant. Despite the relatively quiescent clinical presentation of PSC-associated IBD, there is an increased risk for colorectal and hepatobiliary malignancy making vigilance for malignancy essential.

### High-and low-dose oral delayed-release mesalamine in children with mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis [^115QZ9ox]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease characterized by chronic mucosal inflammation of the colon. With the exception of patients who have a cecal patch, the inflammatory response usually begins in the rectum and extends proximally with a diffuse, continuous pattern. Approximately 15% to 20% of patients with ulcerative colitis are children. In the United States, the incidence of pediatric ulcerative colitis varies between 1 and 4/100,000 individuals per year. Estimates of the average age-at-onset in children vary, although 80% to 90% of patients are age ≥ 9 years when symptoms develop. The incidence and disease pattern seen in the United States are similar to those observed in other developed countries. Evidence from the medical literature suggests that the clinical course and manifestations of ulcerative colitis are similar in children and adults; however, younger children tend to have increased colitis and more diffuse involvement with pancolitis compared with older children and adults. The most common symptoms of ulcerative colitis — diarrhea, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, fever, and weight loss — are found in comparable proportions of both children and adults, and are more dependent on the disease activity than on age.

Oral mesalamine (Asacol; Warner Chilcott, Rockaway, NJ) is often used as maintenance treatment of ulcerative colitis in adults and children. Although some evidence points to a dose-response relation in adult patients with active ulcerative colitis treated with oral mesalamine, data are sparse to support the claim of a relation between dose and clinical efficacy in the pediatric population. Moreover, the safety of oral mesalamine, which is well established in the adult population, lacks confirmation in children. Among practicing pediatric gastroenterologists, the daily dose of oral mesalamine administered to children with active ulcerative colitis ranges from 30 to > 100 mg · g −1 · day −1. The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of low- and high-dose oral, delayed-release mesalamine for the treatment of children with active, mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis.

### TNF-alpha gene expression in colorectal mucosa as a predictor of remission after induction therapy with infliximab in ulcerative colitis [^111cn9pV]. Cytokine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

It has been documented that treatment with infliximab (IFX) induces remission in 1/3 of patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC). Predictors of response could improve selection of patients with a higher probability of favorable outcome.

Aim

To determine predictor factors for the clinical outcome of IFX induction therapy in UC.

Methods

UC patients with moderate to severe disease who received 5mg/kg IFX at weeks 0, 2 and 6weeks were included. Ulcerative colitis disease activity index (UCDAI) score including endoscopic sub-scores were assessed before and after treatment. Several predictors, including TNF-alpha mRNA expression, were tested in a regression model.

Results

Fifty-nine patients completed the study. Age, gender, steroid therapy, immunosuppressive, pancolitis, endoscopic sub-score, disease duration, C-reactive protein, interleukin-(IL)-4, IL-10 or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) did not predict mucosal or clinical remission. There was an inverse and independent association between pre-treatment TNF-alpha expression levels and clinical and endoscopic remission of IFX treatment (logistic regression, p = 0.01 and p = 0.003, odds ratio 2.5 and 4.8, respectively).

Conclusion

The clinical outcome of an induction therapy with IFX in UC is inversely associated with the pre-treatment gene expression levels of TNF-alpha in colorectal mucosa.

### Microbial dynamics in newly diagnosed and treatment Naïve IBD patients in the mediterranean [^116qpbBq]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease subtypes, following the Montreal classification for CD and UC, had only minor effects on community diversity in UC patients and no significant influence on the community of CD patients. In UC, we observed a decrease of NTI (less phylogenetically clustered) in patients with subtype E3 (pancolitis) compared with the less severe subtypes E1 and E2 (F(2,22) = 3.5799, P = 0.0451). When we focus on medications, neither non-IBD-related medication nor previous antibiotic use (at least 6 weeks or 6 months prior) affected the complexity of CD and UC microbiota (Table S7). We also analyzed data on IBD-related pharmaceutical treatments required within 12 months postdiagnosis. A combined analysis of CD and UC patients revealed that patients with a less diverse community were more likely to receive prednisolone treatment (Chao1: P = 0.00174, P FDR = .03483; Simpson: P = 0.00543, P FDR = .05434; binomial GLM, Figure 2E and 2F). However, nonspecific treatments and other anthropogenic factors influence disease trajectories, as well. Thus, this relatively small study can only be suggestive and will need further validation.

### Effectiveness and safety of oral vancomycin for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis: a systematic review and pooled analysis [^113cWySb]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic progressive disease that is characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and stricture formation in the biliary tree.PSC is associated with significant morbidity including increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, gallbladder carcinoma, and colorectal carcinoma. Currently, the only effective treatment for PSC is liver transplantation. About 70% of patients with PSC have underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Ulcerative colitis (UC) has been classically thought to be more common in PSC compared to Crohn's disease (CD). However, IBD associated with PSC (IBD-PSC) seems to represent a distinctive phenotype in comparison to UC and CD without PSC. IBD-PSC is more likely to be associated with rectal sparing, pancolitis with greater severity of inflammation in the right compared to the left colon and backwash ileitis. In addition, IBD-PSC is associated with a significantly higher rate of colorectal cancer compared with UC without PSC. The current treatment paradigm of IBD-PSC mirrors that of IBD without PSC starting with mesalamine for mild–moderate colonic disease and immunosuppressants/advanced therapies in moderate-to-severe or steroid-dependent disease which can be required in up to a one-third of IBD-PSC patients. Up to 50% of patients with IBD-PSC do not achieve endoscopic remission despite treatment with advanced therapies.

### Diet as a treatment for inflammatory bowel disease: is it ready for prime time? [^115ofuaL]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diet remains an important topic for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), yet few guidelines for dietary recommendations exist. There is a growing interest in the use of diet as treatment or adjuvant therapy for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Here, we highlight the latest evidence on the use of diet for treatment of symptoms, active disease and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

Recent Findings

The Crohn's Disease Exclusion Diet (CDED) and the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) are studied diets that have gained popularity, but there is growing interest in the use and efficacy of less restrictive diets such as the Mediterranean diet. Recent data suggest healthful dietary patterns alone, with an emphasis on whole foods that are high in vegetable fibre and that promote less consumption of ultra-processed foods may also help achieve remission in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

Summary

In this review, we summarize the literature on diet as treatment for IBD. We highlight the latest clinical dietary studies, randomized clinical trials, as well as new and emerging diets for the treatment of IBD.

### IBD-like features in syndromic diarrhea / trichohepatoenteric syndrome [^116zzeen]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEOIBD) (inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] before 6 years of age) may manifest as a monogenic disease affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Syndromic diarrhea/trichohepatoenteric syndrome (SD/THE), a rare disorder caused by alteration of a complex involved in RNA degradation, has been reported to present with some degree of colitis and in some cases an IBD-like presentation.

Methods

We reviewed clinical and biological data of 4 previously published cases and added detailed data of 2 new cases of SD/THE with an IBD-like presentation.

Results

All the 6 patients presented with typical intractable diarrhea and hair abnormalities. The colon was affected in all of the patients: 1 had ileitis, 2 had panenteritis, and 2 presented with perianal disease. Fecal calprotectin level and erythrosedimentation rate were elevated in 2 cases each. All the therapeutic classes of IBD treatment (mesalazine, steroids, immunomodulators, and biological therapy) were used in the 6 cases. In 2 patients, treatment had no effect. Three showed a partial effect, and 1 patient sustained only a transient effect.

Conclusions

SD/THE can have a similar presentation as VEOIBD, often as pancolitis. IBD treatments appear to have little efficacy for SD/THE, suggesting a different pathogenesis for the IBD-like features in SD/THE compared with classical IBD.

3.9.1 Thiopurines

While studies vary in quality, meta-analyses consistently report a benefit of thiopurines over placebo for the maintenance of steroid-induced remission in UC but not for induction of remission. Meta-analysis of three randomised controlled thiopurine maintenance studies favours thiopurines over placebo (RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.95). In a further meta-analysis, OR was 2.59 (95% CI 1.26 to 5.3), absolute risk reduction was 23% and the number-needed-to-treat (NNT) to prevent one recurrence was five. A recent Cochrane review included 232 patients from four maintenance studies of azathioprine versus placebo and showed a benefit of azathioprine over placebo (44% vs 65% failure, respectively, RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.86). The side effects of thiopurines, both short- and long-term, should be considered (see Section 5.2.2 on Drug management: thiopurines) in choice of therapy, and also in decisions about duration of therapy, particularly in older patients (see Section 5.2.7.1 Stopping thiopurines).

### A novel inflammatory marker for extensive ulcerative colitis; endocan [^116kCZoy]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background & aims

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease characterized by mucosal inflammation. Endocan, a proteoglycan secreted by endothelial cells in response to inflammatory cytokines, has been reported to be overexpressed in inflammatory conditions. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the utility of endocan level in determining the extent and severity of disease in patients with ulcerative colitis and to determine whether it can be a candidate marker for noninvasive evaluation and monitoring since there is not enough data in the literature.

Materials and methods

Sixty-five people were included in the study, including thirty-five with ulcerative colitis and thirty in the control group. Patients with first diagnosed ulcerative colitis clinically, endoscopically, and histopathologically, without any treatment, and with normal liver and kidney tests were included in the study. Endoscopic scoring of all patients was performed according to the Mayo endoscopic scoring (MES) system. Blood samples for CRP (C-reactive protein) and endocan were taken from the patients simultaneously.

Results

There was a significant statistical difference between all patients with ulcerative colitis and the control group in both endocan level and CRP level (p < 0.001). There was a statistically significant difference between endocan levels and CRP levels between the left-distal group and pancolitis (diffuse colitis) patients, but there was no statistical difference between age and MES.

Conclusion

Serum endocan level can be useful in determining the extent of ulcerative colitis and planning treatment.

### Treatment persistence and colectomy-free outcomes in patients with ulcerative colitis receiving golimumab or adalimumab: a UK experience [^115XvGnG]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is the most common type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the UK, with around 146 000 people affected.UC is a chronic disease, with patients experiencing relapses and periods of remission, and patients who initially have disease of limited extent (proctitis) sometimes progressing to more extensive disease (proctosigmoiditis, left-sided colitis or pancolitis). Symptoms of UC include bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, urgency and tenesmus as a result of inflammation and ulceration of the colonic mucosa.

UK and European clinical guidelines recommend that UC treatment selection should aim for sustained steroid-free remission, and consider disease severity, extent and current activity. Treatment options for UC include aminosalicylates (5-ASA), corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, biologics and the Janus kinase inhibitor, tofacitinib. Although biologics are efficacious in many patients, failure to respond has been reported to occur in 30.0%–40.0% of patients with acute refractory UC. A secondary loss of response to biologics is also experienced by some patients, which is believed to result from antidrug antibodies formed due to biologics being naturally produced proteins; antidrug antibodies have been detected in ≤ 41.0% of patients with UC receiving biologics.

The therapeutic potential of biologics reported in clinical trials, with narrowly defined populations and carefully controlled conditions, is not always seen in clinical practice, with suboptimal adherence and persistence impacting clinical outcomes. Studies that explore real-world treatment outcomes following product approval are valuable in providing decision-makers with insight to the effectiveness of a product used beyond the controlled environment of a clinical trial. Published studies report treatment persistence rates at 1 year for biologics ranging from 35.0% to 63.0% in patients with UC from Ireland, the USA and Canada. A number of observational studies have explored treatment response in the three antitumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents currently licensed for use in UC. These have included multicentre cohort studies of adalimumab and golimumab in Spain, an observational study of golimumab in Italian primary IBD centresand a retrospective analysis of the outcomes of infliximab treatment at a Japanese academic hospital.

Outcome and follow-up

A repeat CT abdomen-pelvis on day 31 of admission showed an improvement in the transverse colon which was now 4 cm in calibre. Subsequently, flexible sigmoidoscopy was attempted and revealed a normal mucosa from anus to distal descending colon. The biopsy showed no signs of IBD or dysplasia. The patient was now eating a regular diet and bowel movements had settled. He was discharged with no medications to take home and was planned to be followed up in 6 weeks.

Overall survival and event-free survival

At last follow-up (median, 192 months; range, 6–804), 31 patients (97%) were alive. Twelve patients were aged > 20 years; the oldest patient in this cohort was 67 years old. One patient died at age 5 years due to pancolitis with sepsis. She presented with the c.485A > G p. Gln162Arg variant and was diagnosed with severe neutropenia (282 count/μL) immediately after birth. Despite treatment with G-CSF up to 20 μg/kg, she suffered from severe infections as well as bone metabolism disorders and syndromic features.

No alloHSCT-related mortality was reported (median follow-up after alloHSCT, 91.5 months; range, 9–147; Figure 4). Acute and chronic GVHD of the liver was suspected in 1 patient because of transaminitis and a bilateral cataract after transplantation. The patient received steroid treatment for an extended period of 2 years and calcineurin inhibitors for 3 years. All symptoms resolved entirely. Veno-occlusive disease was reported in 1 patient, and 1 patient developed phototoxicity after treatment with voriconazole. One patient experienced reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus without further complications. Further infectious complications after transplantation were not observed (Table 2). One patient underwent a second alloHSCT after autologous reconstitution at 10 months, and 1 patient experienced graft failure 1 month after the first alloHSCT.

### Granulocyte and monocyte apheresis for induction of remission in children with new-onset inflammatory bowel colitis [^1138N858]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of granulocyte and monocyte apheresis (GMA) with mesalazine for induction of remission in pediatric patients with newly onset chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) colitis.

Methods

Thirteen pediatric patients with newly onset extensive IBD colitis were investigated per the ECCO/ESPGHAN IBD protocol. Of these 13, 12 received 10 treatments with Adacolumn (ADA) during a median of 6.25 weeks in combination with low-to-moderate doses of mesalazine, which was continued after apheresis. A control colonoscopy was performed 12 to 16 weeks after GMA treatment. Primary outcomes were mucosal healing (Mayo endoscopic score) and histopathologic grading of biopsies. A secondary outcome was disease activity as measured by the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index.

Results

Twelve children (6 girls) with a median age of 14.6 years and a median duration of symptoms at diagnosis of 3.2 months received all planned 10 treatment sessions with ADA. Ten of 12 patients had pancolitis and 2 of 12 extensive colitis. A final diagnosis, however, indicated ulcerative colitis in 10 children and Crohn disease in 2 children. At control colonoscopy, 8 of 12 children were in clinical remission and the Mayo endoscopic score showed significant improvement in 9 of 12 patients (P = 0.006). Complete microscopic remission, according to the Geboes score, was observed in 2 patients.

Conclusions

In this small study GMA for induction of remission of newly onset pediatric IBD colitis was effective in 8 of 12 patients. Further controlled studies are warranted to confirm the efficacy of this treatment model.

### Special considerations for biologic medications in pediatric ulcerative colitis [^112xAHpY]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: More extensive disease, high rates of corticosteroid refractory and dependent disease, and the potential impact of disease on growth and development differentiate inflammatory bowel disease in children from adults. This is particularly evident in ulcerative colitis where pancolitis predominates, success of mesalamine alone in achieving remission is less than 50%, and there is a high need for immunomodulator or biologic therapies. Areas Covered: This review describes the use of infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and vedolizumab in the treatment of children with ulcerative colitis but is limited in scope due to the paucity of controlled clinical trials. A search of existing literature with keywords of these specific biological therapies as well as 'pediatric', 'ulcerative colitis', and 'inflammatory bowel disease' was used to complete this review. Expert Opinion: Therapeutic drug monitoring has become standard of care when assessing dosing and changes in therapy and will play a role in future treatment planning.

### Management of inflammatory bowel disease… [^112ZVxWP]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Treatment of Symptoms Loperamide increases both colonic water absorption and internal sphincter function. It can be helpful as adjunctive therapy in patients who have proctitis and diarrhea, patients who have chronic watery diarrhea without active disease and patients who have undergone ileoanal pullthrough surgery. Loperamide should not be used in patients with active pancolitis, bloody diarrhea or suspected enteric infection. Sulfasalazine in a low dosage can be used to maintain remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. In a higher dosage, the drug can be used to treat active ulcerative colitis. 20 This tablet has been found to be as effective as sulfasalazine in maintaining remission of ulcerative colitis. 21 It has also been beneficial in the treatment of active Crohn's disease and, in a dosage of 2. 4 g per day, in maintaining remission.

22 In enema or suppository form, mesalamine is the most effective therapy for distal proctosigmoiditis, but it has little efficacy in anorectal Crohn's disease. Corticosteroids Systemic Corticosteroids For the past 30 years, corticosteroids have been the mainstay of therapy in patients with moderate to severe active inflammatory bowel disease. 25 Initial treatment is prednisone, 40 to 60 mg per day. In severely ill hospitalized patients, reasonable initial therapy is hydrocortisone, 100 mg administered intravenously every eight hours. Intravenous therapy generally produces rapid improvement of symptoms, with maximal benefit occurring when the corticosteroid has been administered for six to eight days. Topical Corticosteroids Corticosteroid enemas are beneficial in patients with ulcerative proctosigmoiditis. The foam preparations may facilitate retention and thus may be more effective than the liquid preparations.

Both foam and liquid corticosteroid enemas are slightly less effective than 5-ASA enemas and are almost as expensive. Some systemic absorption occurs; adrenal suppression and other corticosteroid side effects rarely occur with long-term use. 31 Azathioprine and mercaptopurine are beneficial in 50 to 70 percent of patients with intractable perianal Crohn's disease. 32 Less information is available about their effectiveness in treating ulcerative colitis, although they have been beneficial in patients with this disease.

### IBD phenotype at diagnosis, and early disease-course in pediatric patients in Croatia: data from the Croatian national registry [^113m1rsh]. Pediatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) presents with extensive phenotype. The aim of this study was to determine the phenotype of pediatric IBD patients in Croatia at diagnosis and follow-up.

Methods

Children were prospectively recruited into Croatian IBD national registry. Data on diagnostic evaluation, therapy and 1-year follow-up were collected.

Results

A total of 51 newly diagnosed patients were recruited (19 Crohn's disease (CD), 28 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 4 IBD-unclassified (IBD-U)). Most common location in CD was ileocolonic disease (52.6%), and pancolitis in UC (53.6%). The recommended complete diagnostic algorithm was performed only in 29.4% of patients. First-line therapy used in CD was exclusive enteral nutrition for remission induction (84.2%) and azathioprine for maintenance (73.7%). In patients with UC, aminosalicylates were the most common drug used (89.3%). By the end of the first year 41.2% of CD and 53.9% of UC patients had one or more relapses and required treatment escalation.

Conclusion

Our data confirm extensive intestinal involvement in pediatric IBD and relatively high relapse rate during the first year of follow-up. More effort should be invested on the national level to implement more stringent adherence to the current European guidelines.

Impact

The key message of our article is that pediatric IBD in Croatia shows extensive intestinal involvement with high relapse rates in first year of follow-up. It is the first cohort study reporting on the phenotype of pediatric IBD in Croatia, but also investigates adherence to diagnostic and therapeutic European guidelines which is not commonly reported. The study is national based, thus having the greatest impact on Croatian health care, stressing out that more effort should be invested on the national level to implement more stringent adherence to the current European guidelines.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^111NdPeT]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis in adults — key concept statements indicate that there are no validated therapeutic biomarkers or companion diagnostic tests to enhance selection or predict response to treatment for the patient with active ulcerative colitis (UC); patients with UC should have available all medical options as recommended by their doctor and healthcare team, and third-party payers and requirements for step therapy should not come between the patient and their healthcare team in making decisions about treatment for UC; patients with moderately to severely active UC have higher rates of response and remission with their first therapies than after failure of one or more other advanced therapies; given the expanding number of therapies per mechanistic class, a distinction between primary nonresponse and secondary nonresponse is important to select the next therapeutic option; post hoc subgroup analyses and network meta-analyses provide hypothesis-generating data but are not sufficient to stratify therapies for individual patients; infliximab is the preferred anti-TNF therapy for patients with moderately to severely active UC; some patients with moderately to severely active UC who are at higher risk for infectious complications may benefit from vedolizumab or an anti-IL-23 strategy over more systemically immunosuppressed medical options; and initial and subsequent therapies for moderately to severely active UC may be chosen based on extraintestinal manifestations, including the involvement of joints or skin, in which therapies having efficacy for both UC and the extraintestinal organ is known.

### Long-term outcomes of autoimmune pancreatitis: a multicentre, international analysis [^115Ef1dJ]. Gut (2013). Low credibility.

Significance of this study

What is already known on this subject?
Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a treatable form of chronic pancreatitis that is felt to be responsive to steroid treatment.
There are few long-term data regarding response to treatment and subsequent disease sequelae.

What are the new findings?
Disease relapses are common after steroid discontinuation, and typically occur in the pancreas and/or biliary tract.
Pancreatic duct stones are relatively uncommon, but are seen more frequently in patients with at least one disease relapse.
The occurrence of incident cancers following AIP diagnosis appears to be uncommon.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?
Since disease relapses are common, additional studies are needed to compare different treatment strategies for maintaining disease remission.
Further investigations are needed to understand if the risk of cancer is increased compared with the general population.

### Appendicectomy plus standard medical therapy versus standard medical therapy alone for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis (ACCURE): a pragmatic, open-label, international, randomised trial [^115MXjFQ]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease affecting an estimated 5 million individuals globally as of 2023, with a rising incidence worldwide. This disease affects the mucosal layer of the colon and rectum, and is characterised by a relapsing-remitting course. The inflammation typically starts in the rectum (proctitis) and with subsequent relapses it might extend proximally, involving the entire colon (pancolitis). Clinical symptoms of active colitis include frequent and urgent bowel movements, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, and fatigue, and the condition is associated with an impaired health-related quality of life.

The therapeutic goal in ulcerative colitis is to maintain health and related quality of life and avoid disability by adequately inducing and maintaining clinical and endoscopic remission. Therefore, current medical therapy follows a step-up strategy to reduce inflammation until remission is reached, thereby preventing disease-related complications, such as colectomy, and development of colorectal neoplasia.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^115AZoZK]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis — diagnosis, assessment, monitoring, and prognosis — The diagnosis of UC should be suspected in patients with hematochezia, increased stool frequency, or bowel urgency, and infectious etiologies should be excluded at the time of diagnosis. Colonoscopy with intubation of the ileum and biopsies of affected and unaffected areas should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of UC, with mucosal biopsies interpreted by a pathologist, preferably one with expertise in gastrointestinal pathology. Categories of disease extent include proctitis within 18 cm of anal verge (distal to rectosigmoid junction), left-sided colitis extending from sigmoid to splenic flexure, and extensive colitis beyond splenic flexure including pancolitis; if the terminal ileum is normal, further evaluation of the stomach and small bowel by upper endoscopy and cross-sectional imaging is not needed unless other symptoms or findings suggest proximal gastrointestinal involvement or a diagnosis of Crohn's disease rather than UC. Definitions of disease severity are needed to guide treatment decisions and should be based on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), the inflammatory burden including endoscopic assessment and markers such as FC, CRP, and serum albumin, disease course, and disease impact. Endoscopic severity should be reported using a validated endoscopic scale such as the Mayo Endoscopic Score or the UC Endoscopic Index of Severity, and disease assessment and monitoring in response to therapy and during maintenance and suspected relapse may be performed with FC, CRP, endoscopic assessment with flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, and/or intestinal ultrasound.

### Oral mesalamine and clinical remission are associated with a decrease in the extent of long-standing ulcerative colitis [^11764GWs]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare colonoscopy alone with surveillance biopsy for the determination of anatomic extent in long-standing ulcerative colitis (UC). To assess the influences of mesalamine use and clinical disease activity on the change of histologic extent with time.

Materials and Methods

Disease extent (proctosigmoiditis, left-sided colitis, or pancolitis) measured by colonoscopy and surveillance biopsy was compared among 212 consecutive patients with long-standing UC. Among the 102 patients who had 2 consecutive colonoscopies with surveillance biopsies, the following influences on change in histologic extent were determined: disease activity, mesalamine use, age at disease onset, folic acid, corticosteroid and azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine use, and time between colonoscopies.

Results

Agreement between gross and microscopic findings was poor (kappa = 0.39). Colonoscopy underestimated and overestimated extent in 25.9% and 8.5%, respectively. Microscopic distribution between consecutive colonoscopies remained the same in 60.8%. Where distribution changed, an increase was twice as common as a decrease in extent. There was no difference in age at onset, time between colonoscopies, or disease duration among those with an increase, decrease, or no change in extent. Clinical remission and oral mesalamine were independently associated with 10.7 and 5.8 times the odds of a decrease in disease extent, respectively. Folic acid, topical mesalamine, corticosteroids, and immunomodulators did not influence change in extent.

Conclusions

UC extent is best determined by surveillance biopsy. Among patients with long-standing UC, histologic extent fluctuates with time. Disease remission and oral mesalamine were independently associated with decreases in disease extent.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

12.3.2 Practice points

1 Paediatric‐onset UC is a risk factor for CRC, especially UC pancolitis. However, the absolute risk of CRC in children under the age of 18 years is low; CRC is exceptionally rare before puberty (Agreement 100%).
2 Risk factors for dysplasia or CRC in children with UC include long disease duration, VEO disease, PSC and family history (first‐degree relative) of CRC (Agreement 100%).
3 In patients with PSC and UC, colonoscopy should be considered annually or every 2 years from the time of PSC diagnosis. However, surveillance could be deferred in pre‐pubertal children while individualising based on risk factors (disease duration, family history, severity of the disease over time, and disease extent), since CRC is extremely rare under the age of 12 years, even in the presence of PSC (Agreement 100%).
4 Children who start CRC surveillance before the age of 18 should have surveillance intervals thereafter determined as per adult CRC surveillance guidelines (Agreement 100%).
5 Characterisation, therapeutic management and follow‐up of colonic dysplasia in children with IBD should largely follow guidance outlined for the adult IBD population. However, as dysplasia is such a rare occurrence in children, cases with dysplasia should be discussed between a paediatric gastroenterologist, an expert endoscopist and a histopathologist to determine optimal management (Agreement 100%).
6 Patients with UC and PSC have a high lifetime risk of hepatobiliary malignancy, with MRCP‐based surveillance shown to reduce mortality in the adult population. However, the risk of hepatobiliary cancer onset in childhood is low, with the pre‐puberty risk extremely low. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine MRCP surveillance in paediatric patients with IBD‐PSC (Agreement 92%).

### Successful treatment of palmoplantar psoriasis with apremilast in an immunosuppressed pediatric patient on Concurrent biologic therapy [^116gvm6W]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Immunosuppressive medication may be indicated in patients with severe psoriasis refractory to other treatment modalities. There is a subset of patients, however, who are immunosuppressed at baseline and are not ideal candidates for these agents. Here we report the case of a 15-year-old girl on immunosuppressive medication for preexisting pancolitis and chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis who had an excellent response to concurrent apremilast therapy for her previously refractory palmoplantar psoriasis. These findings support the potential role of apremilast in treating pediatric palmoplantar psoriasis and its utility as an adjunctive therapy in immunosuppressed patients with refractory skin disease.

### What is the latest in autoimmune pancreatitis [^113P1mHk]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a steroid-responsive fibroinflammatory disorder with 2 clinically distinct subtypes known as type 1 autoimmune and type 2 autoimmune pancreatitis. Type 1 AIP is considered the pancreatic manifestation of immunoglobulin G4-related disease, a systemic disease often presenting with other organ involvement. Advances in understanding the unique clinical presentation, imaging findings, histopathology, and clinical course of this relatively uncommon disease have led to international consensus regarding diagnosis and treatment. While corticosteroids remain the mainstay of treatment, several emerging novel therapies have been explored primarily in the context or relapsing and refractory cases.

### Mucosal transcriptomics implicates under expression of BRINP3 in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis [^114Ue4Y5]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

BRINP3 Association with Disease Phenotype and Treatment

To assess whether low BRINP3 expression was associated with a particular disease phenotype, biopsies obtained from the ascending colon of patients with UC with either pancolitis or left-sided colitis were compared (Fig. 3). Individuals with left-sided disease were defined as those having no historical evidence of inflammation in the ascending colon. Therefore, alterations in BRINP3 expression at this location in these individuals would suggest that reduced expression is not associated with previous inflammation and support the hypothesis that low BRINP3 may predispose to disease onset. Although the overall expression levels compared with HC were lower in individuals with a history of pancolitis (P < 0.0008) as opposed to patients with left-sided disease (P = 0.183) (Fig. 3), BRINP3 levels were not consistent with phenotype as normal expression was observed in 30% of patients with pancolitis and low in 2 out of 7 individuals with left-sided colitis. To address the possible effects of treatment on BRINP3 expression, patients were separated into subgroups according to their medication at the time biopsies were taken. There was no difference between expression of BRINP3 with treatment (Fig. Supplemental Digital Content 8,) in the rectum or at any other location (data not shown).

### Understanding patient journey in ulcerative colitis prior to biologic initiation: a 5-year exploration [^113VU8Ae]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There has been a more pronounced shift toward earlier, more aggressive therapies in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis (UC). The aim of this study was to describe the pre-biologic treatment and health care experience, including co-morbidities and overall health care utilization, for UC patients who initiated biologic therapies, in the 5 years prior to the initiation of the first biologic agent.

Methods

UC patients who initiated a biologic agent approved for UC between 9/15/2005 and 1/30/2018 were identified from the IBM® MarketScan® Commercial Database, a large US database. The date of the first recorded UC biologic exposure was defined as the index date, and ≥ 5 years of pre-index records were required to evaluate patients' treatment, disease progression and overall health care utilization prior to initiating biologic agents.

Results

Among the 1891 eligible patients, treatment with oral corticosteroids, 5-aminosalicylates, and other non-biologic immunomodulators, all increased progressively across the 5 years prior to the index. From within year-five to within year-one prior to the index, the median duration of oral corticosteroid treatment increased from 34 to 88 days per year and the proportion of patients who experienced more extensive/pancolitis disease increased from 16 to 59%. Overall, the frequency of all-cause health care visits also increased.

Conclusions

Patients with UC experienced increasing morbidity and treatment burden in the 5 years prior to initiating biologic therapy. To achieve reduced corticosteroids in UC management, better risk stratification is needed to help identify patients for more timely biologic treatment.

### Optimizing therapy in patients with pancolitis [^114KW9LJ]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Pancolitis affects approximately 20% to 40% of the total ulcerative colitis population and remains a therapeutic challenge for clinicians. Practitioners must focus on pancolitis when evaluating a patient for ulcerative colitis, because pancolitis is associated with more severe and fulminant disease and a higher rate of colorectal cancer and colectomy. It is imperative for clinicians to be knowledgeable in the clinical course, medications, and appropriate manner to induce and maintain clinical remission to prevent serious sequelae of the disease. The purpose of this article is to provide a review of the treatment of pancolitis for general gastroenterologists, because medical management decisions have life-long effects for this subgroup of patients.

### Clinical guidelines for the management of inflammatory bowel disease: update of a French national consensus [^115aKTyV]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

New treatments and therapeutic approaches repeatedly emerged in the field of inflammatory bowel disease.

Aim

to update the French treatment algorithms for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).

Methods

A formal consensus method was used to determine changes to the treatment algorithms for various situations of CD and UC. Thirty-seven experts voted on questions that had been drafted by the steering committee ahead of time. Consensus was defined as at least 66% of experts agreeing on a response.

Results

Anti-TNF were reinforced as a first-line therapy rather than the use of immunosuppressant alone. Vedolizumab for UC, ustekinumab for CD took place as second-line maintenance therapy and potentially as a first-line therapy in the setting of unrestricted reimbursement for vedolizumab. Tofacitinib was recommended by the experts in case of vedolizumab failure for UC. Algorithms for complicated CD with abscess, intestinal and complex anal fistula were updated according to recent prospective cohort studies.

Conclusion

The changes incorporated to the algorithms provide up-to-date and easy-to-use guidelines to treat patients with IBD.

### Cyclosporine treatment of steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis during pregnancy [^115UApv3]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Cyclosporine is considered a safe and effective treatment of severe steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis (UC). However, few data are available concerning its safety profile in pregnant women. We report here the experience of 5 GETAID centers.

Methods

In a retrospective study data on patients with severe UC treated with cyclosporine during pregnancy were extracted from medical records of consecutive patients treated between 2001 and 2007.

Results

Eight patients (median age 30.5 years old) were identified. At the time of flare-up the median duration of pregnancy was 11.5 weeks of gestation (range 4–25). Seven patients had pancolitis. All patients had more than 3 commonly used clinical and biological severity criteria. Three patients had severe endoscopic lesions and 5 patients had not. All patients received intravenous corticosteroids for at least 7 days before introduction of cyclosporine. Two patients received azathioprine during treatment with cyclosporine. No severe infections or other complications due to treatment were observed. Treatment was effective in 7/8 patients. One patient received infliximab due to cyclosporine therapy failure with a good outcome. No colectomy was performed during pregnancy. Seven pregnancies were conducted to term, but 1 in utero death occurred due to maternal absence of S-protein. Two newborns were premature, including 1 case of hypotrophy. No malformations were observed.

Conclusions

In our experience, treatment with cyclosporine for steroid-refractory UC during pregnancy can be considered safe and effective.

### Management of paediatric ulcerative colitis, part 1: ambulatory care-an updated evidence-based consensus guideline from the European society of paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [^1176dx9r]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

The IBD phenotype in patients with PSC also seems different compared to classic UC or CD. Colitis in PSC‐IBD is characterised by extensive inflammatory distribution, with highest signs of active inflammation in proximal colon that decrease towards the rectum, even with rectal sparing. High pancolitis rates (68%–83%) but low rates of proctitis (2%–4%) have been reported. Backwash ileitis, endoscopic and/or histologic inflammation of distal ileum in patients with pancolitis, has been described also as one of the classical IBD phenomena in PSC.PSC, that may precede IBD onset by years but also occur after colectomy, may progress to liver cirrhosis, ultimately necessitating liver transplantation. UC patients with PSC have a greater risk of malignancies such as CRC and cholangiocarcinoma (8%–30% of UC patients with long‐standing PSC). However, CRC in paediatric UC before age 12 years is extremely rare. As PSC is associated with more extensive disease, the theoretical cancer risk is higher than in limited colitis, but the clinical course is usually milder. The higher colectomy rate in these patients in older ages is mainly secondary to dysplasia and CRC. Older age at PSC diagnosis increases the risk of colonic neoplasia. Targeted biopsies aimed at abnormal areas identified by newer colonoscopic techniques (chromoendoscopy, confocal endomicroscopy) are recommended. The optimal follow‐up method is still debatable. In a multicentre report of 781 children with PSC (4277 person‐years of follow‐up), overall event free survival was 70% at 5 years and 53% at 10 years but PSC‐IBD was associated with a favourable prognosis; cholangiocarcinoma occurred in 1%. In another registry, median time to complications was similar in both paediatric and adult cohorts. A recent study evaluating 82 paediatric IBD patients with sclerosing cholangitis (31% female; mean age at diagnosis 11.9 ± 2.8 years), followed up for a mean of 6.8 ± 3.3 years, suggested that children have better clinical outcomes than previously reported, particularly if diagnosed early. The authors recommend prompt assessment for PSC, including liver biopsy and biliary imaging, when liver function abnormalities are detected.MRCP remains the most appropriate imaging modality for diagnosing PSC in children. A pattern of irregular bile ducts, with zones of narrowing and dilatation, is characteristic of PSC.

### Treatment persistence and colectomy-free outcomes in patients with ulcerative colitis receiving golimumab or adalimumab: a UK experience [^113zRHJk]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Results

Patient demographic, disease and treatment characteristics are shown in table 1. Of 183 patients, 87 (47.5%) had initiated treatment with golimumab, and 96 (52.5%) with adalimumab. At least 12 months of follow-up data were available for 86.3% of the sample.

Table 1
Patient demographic, clinical and treatment characteristics

We observed a higher proportion of males treated with golimumab (71.3%) compared with adalimumab (49.0%) (p = 0.003). Baseline characteristics between golimumab and adalimumab were relatively similar in age, body mass index (BMI), time to treatment, type of UC diseases, % treatment experienced (first line vs second line) and Charlson Comorbidity Index (p < 0.05). At diagnosis, most patients (61.7%) had either pancolitis or left-sided colitis. The mean time between diagnosis of UC and initiation of treatment with golimumab or adalimumab were 8.5 and 7.4 years, respectively (p = 0.397). About 80.0% of the patients received golimumab or adalimumab as their first-line biologic therapy. For 37 patients receiving a second-line biologic, half of the patients received infliximab (Remicade) as their first-line treatment followed by infliximab (biosimilar) (37.8%). Antidrug antibody status after first-line treatment was available for very few patients receiving a second-line biologic. Overall, 24.3% of patients tested positive for antidrug antibodies at discontinuation of their first-line biologic treatment.

### Altered expression of innate immunity genes in different intestinal sites of children with ulcerative colitis [^1124HHMj]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Innate immunity has been very rarely investigated in ulcerative colitis and never in paediatrics. The present study was aimed at describing expression of innate immunity genes (NOD2, RIP2, α-defensins HD5 and HD6) in inflamed colon and in ileum of children with ulcerative colitis. Expression of TNFα and IL-1β was also analyzed.

Methods

15 children with ulcerative colitis (9 pancolitis, 6 left-sided colitis) and 10 control children were enrolled. mRNA and protein expressions were detected by real time PCR and western blot assays.

Results

NOD2, RIP2, IL-1β, TNFα expression levels were significantly increased in colonic mucosa of patients compared to controls (p < 0.01). These genes were also upregulated (p < 0.01) in the ileum of both pancolitis and left-sided colitis children. HD5 and HD6 were significantly upregulated (p < 0.01) in the inflamed colon of patients as well as in the ileum of those with pancolitis.

Conclusions

An increased mucosal expression of innate immunity genes was found in the inflamed colon of children with ulcerative colitis, outlining the role of the innate immune response in disease pathogenesis. Involvement of the ileum in ulcerative colitis suggests that an immune activation can also be established in intestinal sites classically uninvolved by the inflammation, carrying implications for the treatment and course of the disease.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on the use of thiopurines, methotrexate, and anti-TNF-α biologic drugs for the induction and maintenance of remission in inflammatory Crohn's disease [^114nUUwj]. Gastroenterology (2013). Medium credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association Institute guideline — discussion and scope — states that data on the safety of long-term combination therapy versus anti–TNF-α drug alone are of very low quality and do not suggest increased serious infection risk, but combination therapy is associated with increased lymphoma; the guideline used the GRADE methodology to create recommendations on immunomodulators and anti–TNF-α drugs for induction and maintenance of remission in moderately severe Crohn's disease, aiming to inform clinical decision making and establish quality indicators with transparent and actionable recommendations. It notes that strong recommendations were limited by poor-quality data on serious adverse events and that insufficient high-quality data precluded recommendations on precise questions (timing of therapy initiation, symptom versus endoscopic targets, and responses to early or late treatment failures). The guideline was designed not to address certain treatment strategies (corticosteroid induction with thiopurine maintenance versus anti–TNF-α induction/maintenance without corticosteroids) and does not address special populations (fistulizing Crohn's disease, surgically induced remission, or children), while being the first to address medical therapy in Crohn's disease using a methodology that explicitly assesses the balance of benefits and risks together with patient values and preferences based on systematic review.

### IBD in India: similar phenotype but different demographics than the west [^113FfSf9]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is emerging in the developing world but phenotypic data are limited. We aimed to describe the phenotype, clinical presentation, disease behavior, and treatments of IBD in a large cohort in India.

Methods

All persons presenting to the Asian Institute of Gastroenterology in Hyderabad, India since 2004 with a confirmed diagnosis of IBD were enrolled. The demographic profile at the first visit, family history of IBD, smoking history, time from first symptom onset to diagnosis, use of anti-tuberculousis treatment before IBD-specific treatment, disease phenotype, and medication history were collected by interview and chart review. Disease and family history and treatments used were updated at each follow-up visit.

Results

Of 4006 persons enrolled, 59.9% had ulcerative colitis (UC) and the majority were male (60.3%). The median diagnostic delay in both UC and Crohn's disease (CD) was at least 2 years. At the time of diagnosis only 4.5% of CD were smokers and only 3.8% of UC were ex-smokers. Positive family history was uncommon (2.1%). The phenotype of persons with CD included 22.9% with stricturing disease and 9.4% with fistulizing disease. The most common site of disease was ileocolonic (40.9%) and only 2.5% had perineal fistulas. Among those with UC 18.7% had proctitis and 30.3% had pancolitis.

Conclusions

This is the largest cohort of persons with IBD reported from Asia. Although there are several demographic differences between persons with IBD from India compared with the West, the phenotypes of the disease are not highly different.

### How close are we to a success stratification tool for improving biological therapy in ulcerative colitis? [^111WXXm2]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Biological therapies have become the standard treatment for ulcerative colitis (UC). However, clinical remission rates post-induction therapy remain modest at 40–50%, with many initial responders losing response over time. Current treatment strategies frequently rely on a 'trial and error' approach, leading to prolonged periods of ineffective and costly therapies for patients, accompanied by associated treatment complications.

Area Covered

This review discusses current evidence on risk stratification tools for predicting therapeutic efficacy and minimizing adverse events in UC management. Recent studies have identified predictive factors for biologic therapy response. In the context of personalized medicine, the goal is to identify patients at high risk of progression and complications, as well as those likely to respond to specific therapies. Essential risk stratification tools include clinical decision-making aids, biomarkers, genomics, multi-omics factors, endoscopic, imaging, and histological assessments.

Expert Opinion

Employing risk stratification tools to predict therapeutic response and prevent treatment-related complications is essential for precision medicine in the biological management of UC. These tools are necessary to select the most suitable treatment for each individual patient, thereby enhancing efficacy and safety.

### Crohn's disease: diagnosis and management… [^1111P6sU]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

CORTICOSTEROIDS Corticosteroids are often used for symptom management. 2, 24 Tapering courses of prednisone, with initial doses of 40 to 60 mg based on disease severity, are recommended. Depending on response and how quickly remission is achieved, first tapering by 5 mg per week until the patient reaches a dose of 20 mg, and then tapering by 2. 5 to 5 mg weekly until discontinuation is an appropriate strategy. Anti-TNF agents, such as certolizumab pegol, adalimumab, and infliximab, induce and maintain remission in moderate- to high-risk patients, or in patients with inadequate response to corticosteroids and immunomodulators. Onset of action and clinical benefit are often seen within two weeks of therapy initiation. The overall effectiveness of anti-TNF agents is greatest when given within two years of disease onset.

2 Anti-interleukin-12/23p40 antibody therapy is an emerging treatment option for patients when standard therapies have been ineffective. 2 The U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of ustekinumab for Crohn's disease in September 2016. Although ustekinumab has been shown to be better than placebo for achieving remission and decreasing symptoms of Crohn's disease, no head-to-head studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ustekinumab over other therapies, and clinical experience is limited. 2, 33, 34. Perianal fistulization is classified as simple or complex. Simple disease is managed with surgical drainage of abscesses and antibiotic therapy. Complex disease first requires surgical drainage of abscesses followed by therapy with an anti-TNF agent. The addition of ciprofloxacin or thiopurines can enhance the effect of anti-TNF agents.

Evidence for the management of other fistulas is limited. When treatment is necessary, they usually require surgical intervention. Anti-TNF agents, thiopurines, and tacrolimus may also provide benefit. 2, 22.

### Microscopic / "Backwash" ileitis and its association with colonic disease in new onset pediatric ulcerative colitis [^112nZPQ5]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Microscopic ileitis and its association with pancolitis in adults with ulcerative colitis (UC) have been described. The incidence of ileitis and associations with colonic disease in pediatric UC have, however, not been thoroughly investigated. This study was undertaken to examine the prevalence of microscopic ileal inflammation at the time of initial diagnosis in a cohort of children with UC.

Methods

We reviewed colonoscopy and biopsy data at time of diagnosis from 105 children and young adults with treatment naïve UC; ileal and colonic mucosal biopsies were available on all patients. Ileal mucosal biopsies were examined for the presence and severity of ileal inflammation, and other histologic features. Concurrently obtained colonic mucosal biopsies were assessed to define the severity, distribution, and extent of disease; endoscopic and clinical follow-up data were reviewed.

Results

A total of 107 ileal mucosal biopsies and 693 corresponding colonic mucosal biopsies were examined. Seventeen of 105 patients (16%) were found to have ileal inflammation (mean age = 10.4 years, 59% girls), 14 (82%) of whom had histologic pancolitis. The presence of ileal inflammation was significantly associated with endoscopic pancolitis (P = 0.02). The association between histologic pancolitis, severity of active inflammation in the cecum, and ascending colon suggested a possible association with ileal inflammation (P = 0.06, 0.07, and 0.08 respectively), but did not reach statistical significance.

Conclusion

Patients with new onset UC may have microscopic ileal inflammation at time of diagnosis, even if the terminal ileum appears macroscopically normal. The presence of endoscopic pancolitis is associated with the presence of histologic ileitis. In contrast to existing studies in adults, an association between the presence of ileitis and the histologic severity or the histologic extent of colitis was not observed. Children with microscopic ileitis in the context of UC do not need to be reclassified as "indeterminate colitis" or Crohn disease.

### Management of paediatric ulcerative colitis, part 1: ambulatory care-an updated evidence-based consensus guideline from the European society of paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [^111KPHPo]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

A recent survey of Dutch paediatric gastroenterologists demonstrated profound variability in paediatric dysplasia surveillance practice, including perceived indication, surveillance interval and endoscopic approach, with 70% expressing need for clearer guidance. There is no doubt that paediatric‐onset IBD is an established lifetime risk factor for CRC. Meta‐analysis data, from five population‐based studies comprising 283,540 patient years, showed a 2.4‐fold increased risk of all cancers with paediatric IBD (pRR: 2.46, 95% CI: 2.06–2.93), with particularly high risk of CRC (pRR: 20.29, 95% CI: 15.90–25.90). A Scandinavian cohort study also yielded high estimates of CRC for UC pancolitis [36.3 (95% CI: 22.8–57.8)].

However, cancer associated with paediatric‐onset IBD usually presents in early adulthood. A recent analysis of Danish and Finnish population registry data showed a median age of CRC diagnosis to be 26.2 years (23.1–31.1) with a median time from IBD to cancer diagnosis of 11.1 years (9.4–16.4). Similarly, a Korean data set demonstrated that all but one CRC associated with IBD occurred at least 8 years after diagnosis.

Disease duration, PSC and VEO‐IBD may confer risk for the onset of dysplasia within childhood. A Swedish nationwide cohort study (1964–2014, N = 346) described 5 IBD‐associated CRCs diagnosed before the age of 18, with higher incidence after 10 years of follow‐up, and all cases occurring after 5 years of follow‐up. A cohort of 509 patients with PSC‐IBD diagnosed in childhood, with a median age of diagnosis of 13.2 years (9.3–15.6), showed a risk of dysplasia or cancer of 2.8 cases per 1000 patient years, with 5 and 10 years probability of CRC of 0.8% (95% CI: 0.3%–2.7%) and 4.8% (95% CI: 2.0%–11.1%), respectively. Of the eight cases of dysplasia or CRC, four were in patients with very early‐onset IBD.

### ACG clinical guideline: primary sclerosing cholangitis [^1121vgPx]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) epidemiology — prevalence in ulcerative colitis (UC) and population estimates are described as follows: the prevalence of PSC in UC is estimated at ~5%, a Swedish UC cohort of 1,500 found 5% with elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) with PSC confirmed in 55 patients (3.7%), and PSC was more common in men and pancolitis than left-sided colitis or proctitis (5.5% vs 0.5%). Among Asian and Southern European populations with PSC, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) prevalence is estimated at 30%–50%, and in the United States PSC prevalence is estimated to be 1 to over 16 per 100,000.

### A nomogram for predicting the response to exclusive enteral nutrition in adult patients with isolated colonic Crohn's disease [^117JGVLL]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

EEN has been widely accepted as a first-line therapy to treat active CD in children. – However, other than in the Japanese population, this intervention is not routinely utilized in adults due to heterogeneous response rate. Given that cCD patients have intact small bowel and relatively uninjured absorption function, EEN may be effective as an inducing therapy.

Our study showed that 52.9% of patients with cCD achieved clinical remission after EEN therapy, which is consistent with the results we reported previously. Given that more than half of the patients with isolated CD patients benefited from EEN therapy, we identified six factors that were predictive for the response to EEN, namely, pancolitis, colonic lesion features, SES-CD, CRP before treatment, LBMI and ∆pre-Alb, and we developed a simple, intuitive graph of a statistically predictive nomogram model that quantified the risk of nonresponse to EEN based on the five factors.

In our nomogram model, pancolitis is the greatest contributor to the risk of nonresponse to EEN, followed by LBMI and colonic lesion features. CRP before treatment showed the smallest effect on the probability of response to EEN. According to our findings, the risk of EEN therapy failure is approximately five times higher in isolated CD patients with pancolitis than in those without pancolitis. Pancolitis, characterized by high levels of inflammatory cytokines, will destroy the immunonutrition and anti-inflammatory effects of enteral nutrition.

We also observed that features of colonic lesions are related to the efficacy of EEN therapy. In particular, strictures or strictures combined with ulcers have a greater negative impact on the effectiveness of EEN therapy than fissuring ulcers. A likely explanation is that fibrostenosis and stricture are well-recognized endpoints in Crohn's disease and chronic inflammation sequelae. Strictures, the result of the wound-healing process, are accumulations of collagenous scarring that thicken the muscle layers and contract the lumina. These changes play a role in producing critical architectural changes in the intestinal wall that impede the normal movement of intestinal contents.EEN may be less effective in such luminal situations. Intestinal inflammation is not noticeable in some cases, but it does consistently coexist with strictures. Therefore, some newly diagnosed CD patients who are undergoing EEN for the first time still cannot achieve a satisfactory response to EEN therapy.

### Combining mucosal microbiome and host multi-omics data shows prognostic potential in paediatric ulcerative colitis [^115fpF6W]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

As is normally seen in paediatric practice, colitis was extensive and severe in all examined patients, who were given steroids. All patients had pancolitis. whereof six patients also had inflammation extending to TI. No further biopsies were taken after treatment, as it is not a standard practice to perform a second endoscopy in children to directly assess mucosal healing.

Children were treated according to ECCO/ESPGHAN guidelines with aminosalicylates and corticosteroids to achieve remission. Children on corticosteroids were prescribed omeprazole concurrently to avoid gastritis. Some children with mild disease, did not require corticosteroids and were successfully treated with aminosalicylates only. Children who did not receive corticosteroids were excluded from the study. Children who failed to enter remission on corticosteroids were also excluded. Corticosteroids were tapered to zero within 3 months according to the guidelines. After corticosteroid therapy commencement, 73% children achieved initial remission within 1 month.

All children who entered the study, therefore, achieved remission within 6 months. Children were deemed to have remained in remission if, after 6 months, they required no further corticosteroids (which equates to a paediatric UC score (PUCAI) of less than 10. Children were deemed to have relapsed if they required a new course of corticosteroids (with a PUCAI of greater than 10). The median relapse time was at 2 months (maximum — 5 months). The primary endpoint of the study was, therefore, whether they were either in remission or had relapsed by 6 months after starting corticosteroids for the first time.

Of the 74 patients recruited into the study, 9 were excluded due to a lack of confirmed UC diagnosis. Furthermore, 7 patients were excluded due to a lack of corticosteroid treatment, and 2 patients were excluded for not achieving remission after initial corticosteroid treatment. Microbiome analysis was conducted for 48 patients (159 biopsy samples), epigenome for 55 (168 samples), and transcriptome for 53 (173 samples). The total number of patients in all analyses was 56. Further cohort characteristics are presented in Table 1 in the Results section. In the full cohort, there were no statistically significant differences between the relapse and remission groups (Welch's two-sample t-test and Fisher's exact test for quantitative and qualitative variables, respectively).

Regarding medical management for acute pancreatitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, therapeutic, ACG 2024 guidelines recommend to administer antibiotics along with debridement/necrosectomy for the treatment of infected necrosis. Use antibiotics known to penetrate pancreatic necrosis to delay surgical, endoscopic, and radiologic drainage beyond 4 weeks. Recognize that some patients may avoid drainage altogether because the infection may completely resolve with antibiotics.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic long-term relapsing and remitting disorder including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The aim of therapy is to induce and maintain remission. Anti-TNF therapies dramatically improved clinical outcomes but primary failure or secondary loss is a common problem as well as potential side effects potentially limiting efficacy and long-term use. The advent of new targeted agents with the potential for greater safety is welcomed in IBD and offers the potential for different agents as the disease becomes refractory or even combination therapies to maximise effectiveness without compromising safety in the future. More data are required to understand the best positioning in pathways and longer-term safety effects.

One of the key questions concerning therapy options in IBD patients with prior history of cancer is the length of drug-holiday period required for immunosuppressants and biologics after the treatment of the index cancer. The ECCO consensus guidancein this topic recommends an interval of 2 years before starting immunosuppression and perhaps waiting up to 5 years for malignancies with intermediate or high risk of recurrence, such as of the urinary tract, gastrointestinal cancer, leukaemia and multiple myeloma. A similar interval is suggested in many expert opinion papers published.

### A novel inflammatory marker for extensive ulcerative colitis; endocan [^112Kddur]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease characterized by mucosal inflammation. Endocan, a proteoglycan secreted by endothelial cells in response to inflammatory cytokines, has been reported to be overexpressed in inflammatory conditions. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the utility of endocan level in determining the extent and severity of disease in patients with ulcerative colitis and to determine whether it can be a candidate marker for noninvasive evaluation and monitoring since there is not enough data in the literature.

Materials and Methods

Sixty-five people were included in the study, including thirty-five with ulcerative colitis and thirty in the control group. Patients with first diagnosed ulcerative colitis clinically, endoscopically, and histopathologically, without any treatment, and with normal liver and kidney tests were included in the study. Endoscopic scoring of all patients was performed according to the Mayo endoscopic scoring (MES) system. Blood samples for CRP (C-reactive protein) and endocan were taken from the patients simultaneously.

Results

There was a significant statistical difference between all patients with ulcerative colitis and the control group in both endocan level and CRP level (p < 0.001). There was a statistically significant difference between endocan levels and CRP levels between the left-distal group and pancolitis (diffuse colitis) patients, but there was no statistical difference between age and MES.

Conclusion

Serum endocan level can be useful in determining the extent of ulcerative colitis and planning treatment.

### A novel inflammatory biomarker in assessing disease activity in ulcerative colitis: gasdermin D [^1159AMpE]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design and patient selection

This prospective study was carried out at Antalya Training and Research Hospital, Turkey, between September 2022 and March 2024. UC patients who were diagnosed at Antalya Training and Research Hospital and were on follow-up at the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) outpatient clinic of Antalya Training and Research Hospital were enrolled in the study. Patients with a concurrent infection of any kind, malignancy, and co-morbid inflammatory-driven disorders like active rheumatologic conditions were not enrolled in the study, as these diseases would alter the inflammatory status of the patient thus serum GSDMD levels.

Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, time since UC diagnosis, treatment modality used at the time of enrollment, concurrent use of steroids, involvement site of UC (proctitis, left-sided colitis, extensive colitis, pancolitis), and Truelove and Witts' severity index (TWSI) results were recorded at the day of blood sampling. Laboratory workout utilized in the study comprised WBC, ESR, CRP, and GSDMD. Blood samples for GSDMD were obtained from participants at the same blood sampling session for serum parameters utilized in the study. Mayo endoscopic subscores (MES) of the patients were recorded.

Patients were divided into four groups according to the extent of disease involvement: proctitis (involvement of rectum only), left-sided colitis (involvement extending to descending colon), extensive colitis (involvement extending proximal to descending colon), and pancolitis. Patients were also split into two groups in terms of the treatment they were on at the time of enrollment in the study. First group comprised of patients on conventional therapy, which included 5-aminosalicylic acid and/or azathioprine treatments. Second group comprised of patients on biologic therapy, which included biological agents and small-molecule therapies. Concurrent corticosteroid usage was also recorded and analyzed, regardless of the dosage and type of corticosteroids.

This research was approved by University of Health Sciences, Antalya Training and Research Hospital Ethics Committee (Date: 11/08/2022, No: 2022−244). The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was acquired from each participant in the study.

### Diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune pancreatitis [^111r3rhh]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Clinical management of autoimmune pancreatitis changed over the last years. The lack of high-quality studies, probably due to the relative rarity of the disease, has not fully clarified many diagnostic and therapeutic aspects. Aim of this review is to overview the literature from a clinical point of view, focusing on diagnostic and therapeutic approach to this complicated disease.

Recent Findings

They have been focused mainly on the risk of misdiagnosing a cancer. Many significant articles have been published on the treatment strategies of autoimmune pancreatitis, considering both induction and maintenance therapy.

Summary

Diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis remains challenging, particularly in focal pancreatic involvement, despite recent advances on imaging modalities. Treatment is based on induction and maintenance phases. Steroid treatment remains the best option to induce remission. Maintenance therapy may be used to prevent disease relapses, and low-dose steroids, azathioprine or rituximab are the therapeutic options. However, it remains unclear which patient needs to be treated.

Left-sided ulcerative colitis is not a distinct entity, but a less extensive form of pancolitis. The epidemiologic and genetic characteristics are thought to be analogous. The rate of colorectal cancer, however, seems to be proportional to the extent of disease. Primary treatment for left-sided disease is topical 5-aminosalicyclic acid (5ASA) agents. In patients who do not respond to topical therapy, oral 5ASA agents of differing delivery methods to the distal bowel can be used. There is much debate pertaining to the clinical superiority of the oral 5ASA agents.

### Long-term maintenance treatment in ulcerative colitis: a 10-year follow-up [^114qWifd]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2002). Low credibility.

Background

With the extensive use of mesalamine, the natural history of ulcerative colitis is probably changed.

Aim

To evaluate the relapse rate and the duration of remission in patients with ulcerative colitis on maintenance treatment with mesalamine.

Patients and Methods

Enrolled in the study were 95 patients divided into 4 groups according to macroscopic location of the disease and treated with the same therapy starting from the date of enrolment. Patients in all 4 groups were followed-up until relapse occurred. The disease activity was evaluated by the Clinical Activity Index and Endoscopic Index. Patients suitable for recruitment showed a Clinical Activity Index and Endoscopic Index lower than 6 and 4, respectively. The patients with ulcerative pancolitis or left-sided colitis were treated with 1.6 g/day while the cases with proctosigmoiditis or proctitis were treated with 5-acetylsalicylic acid enemas 4 g/day Each patient was evaluated with clinical and endoscopic assessment at a 6-month interval. Relapse was defined as an increase in Clinical Activity Index and Endoscopic Index, of more than 6 and 4, respectively.

Results

Five patients dropped-out. All enrolled patients showed a clinical and/or endoscopic relapse within 10 years, the majority 2 or 3 years after diagnosis: pancolitis and left-sided colitis within 2–3 years and patients with distal colitis within 9–10 years.

Conclusions

A relapse was observed in most cases within 3 years, and in all recruited patients within a space of ten years. The extent of the disease in the colon is an important prognostic factor, as patients with distal colitis showed a lesser tendency to relapse.

Microscopic colitis — Recommendation 3: In patients with symptomatic microscopic colitis in whom budesonide therapy is not feasible, the AGA suggests treatment with mesalamine over no treatment for the induction of clinical remission. Conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence. Moderate-quality evidence from a single randomized clinical trial suggests that mesalamine therapy is associated with a lower likelihood of achieving clinical response when compared with no treatment (odds ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.44–1.24), although this was not statistically significant, and other trials reported clinical response rates of 84% and 87%, and in a third 44%. Because of the uncertain balance between benefits and potential harms, mesalamine is recommended conditionally as a potential second-line therapy that can be used under select circumstances.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^1137xL3P]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) — therapy positioning for moderately to severely active disease emphasizes access and selection principles: "There are no validated therapeutic biomarkers or companion diagnostic tests to enhance selection or predict response to treatment for the patient with active UC". Patients "should have available all medical options" and step-therapy requirements "should not come between the patient and their health care team" when making decisions. Patients with moderate to severe UC "have higher rates of response and remission with their first therapies than after failure of one or more other advanced therapies", and distinguishing between "primary nonresponse and secondary nonresponse is important" to select the next option. "Post hoc subgroup analyses and network meta-analyses provide hypothesis-generating data but are not sufficient to stratify therapies for individual patients". "Infliximab is the preferred anti-TNF therapy for patients with moderately to severely active UC". For those at higher infectious risk, some "may benefit from vedolizumab or an anti-IL-23 strategy over more systemically immunosuppressive medical options". Therapy selection "may be chosen based on extra-intestinal manifestations", including joints or skin, when therapies have efficacy in both UC and the extraintestinal organ.

### Tofacitinib in patients with ulcerative colitis: inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire items in phase 3 randomized controlled induction studies [^115uSZW7]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Patients

In the pooled OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 studies, 234 patients were randomized to receive placebo, and 905 patients were randomized to receive 10 mg of tofacitinib BID. Overall, the majority of patients (age, mean [SD] 41.2 [13.9] years) were male (58.6%), white (80.1%), had never smoked (64.1%), had extensive/pancolitis UC (51.5%), and had received prior TNFi (54.3%), corticosteroid (90.3%), or immunosuppressant (74.0%) treatment. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were generally similar between treatment arms for all patients, TNFi-naïve patients, and TNFi-experienced patients. Some numerical differences were observed when comparing patients with and without prior TNFi experience, including a numerically higher proportion of TNFi-experienced patients having extensive/pancolitis disease extent and previously receiving and failing immunosuppressant treatment compared with TNFi-naïve patients (Table 1).

Baseline Distribution of IBDQ Items

In the overall population in the pooled Induction 1 and 2 studies, the IBDQ items within each domain that had the lowest baseline scores and were impacted the most by disease were "bowel movements been loose" and "problem with rectal bleeding" (mean 2.3 in both treatment arms) for the bowel symptom domain; "getting good night's sleep" (mean 3.1 and 3.0 for 10 mg of tofacitinib BID and placebo, respectively) for the systemic symptom domain; "felt relaxed/free of tension" (mean 2.9 and 2.8 for 10 mg of tofacitinib BID and placebo, respectively) for the emotional function domain; "difficulty doing leisure/sports" (mean 3.1 and 3.0 for 10 mg of tofacitinib BID and placebo, respectively) for the social function domain. The baseline distribution for each IBDQ item was generally similar between the 2 treatment groups. Furthermore, baseline IBDQ item scores were generally similar between the overall population and TNFi-naïve and TNFi-experienced patients (Table 2).

### Real-world persistence of successive biologics in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: findings from ROTARY [^112ddpAS]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Adjusted analysis of each biologic demonstrated some variables that significantly impacted the rate of switching or discontinuation for some first- and second-line biologic treatments for patients with UC (Supplementary Tables 9 and 10). Baseline disease extent other than pancolitis was associated with a significantly higher rate of switching or discontinuation for patients receiving infliximab as a first-line biologic. At the second line of biologic treatment, patients of a race or ethnicity other than White or Caucasian who were receiving adalimumab had a significantly lower rate of switching or discontinuation. Increasing age and duration of conventional therapy at baseline of 91 days or above resulted in a significantly lower rate of switching or discontinuation for patients who were receiving infliximab, while disease extent other than pancolitis significantly increased the rate of switching or discontinuation for patients receiving vedolizumab.

### Metabolic panniculitis: α-1 antitrypsin deficiency panniculitis and pancreatic panniculitis [^1152Z9oW]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Panniculitis can be the initial presentation of both alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and pancreatic disease. They can both present with abscess-like draining nodules, but may present like other forms of panniculitis with erythematous nodules. It is important to consider these in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with panniculitis. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a relatively common disorder mainly affecting the lungs and liver. It frequently goes undiagnosed, yet critical interventions can be made to minimize disease progression. Panniculitis associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can be difficult to treat. Pancreatic panniculitis occurs in less than 3% of patients with underlying pancreatic disease and is often associated with arthritis. Diagnosis and treatment of the underlying pancreatic disease is imperative.

### Intravascular foscarnet crystal precipitation causing multiorgan failure [^115kn97h]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

We report a case of multiorgan failure resulting from treatment with the antiviral foscarnet in a kidney transplant recipient. Precipitation of foscarnet crystals was confirmed histologically from a biopsy of the transplant using optical and infrared microscopy. In addition to kidney damage resulting from foscarnet crystal precipitation in the tubular lumen and glomerular capillaries, the patient presented with pancreatitis, pancolitis, and myocarditis with shock. Interruption of the treatment led to rapid improvement in her general condition, but did not prevent permanent loss of the kidney transplant. When faced with unexplained multiorgan failure in a patient treated with foscarnet, one should assume this substance to be toxic. A kidney biopsy can confirm this diagnosis.

### Interference with the lower gut-liver axis induces remission of primary sclerosing cholangitis in a patient with ulcerative colitis [^115uoJEt]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The mechanism of pathogenesis in PSC remains poorly understood and this is reflected in the limited treatment options in clinical practice. Current animal models of PSC remain suboptimal, and to date, there is not a single animal model that displays all attributes of the disease seen in humans. Well-designed longitudinal studies offer alternative means to identify causative microorganisms, however, the lack of a biomarker in early disease, low prevalence of the disease and poor accessibility of the biliary tree restrict the conduct of such studies. Observational studies such as case control and association studies, though do not demonstrate causality, still provide important information and have contributed to much of our understanding of PSC.

Similarly, this case report describes a series of longitudinal observations in a patient over a 9-year period including the evolution and behaviour of the disease; from the diagnosis of UC, to the development of PSC and pyoderma gangrenosum, and subsequently the effects of partial and complete "knock out" of the lower GI tract by subtotal colectomy and total proctectomy. It is noteworthy that there are several distinct PSC-IBD phenotypes; the majority are patients with PSC-UCwith backwash ileitis, rectal sparing disease or pancolitis. In this particular case, the patient suffered from pancolitis with rectal involvement. It was severe, treatment-resistant pancolitis that was the indication for her colectomy, and there was little clinical evidence to suggest backwash ileitis before or after her surgery. Interestingly, the remission of PSC described in this case is preserved up until today, 7 years following proctectomy. Our observations suggest that the complete remission of PSC was successfully achieved through interference of the lower gut–liver axis, and notably, only after removal of the rectum. This suggests pathogens within the rectum may also contribute to pathogenesis and disease activity of PSC.

### Long-term course and prognostic factors in pediatric ulcerative proctitis: a multicenter cohort study [^1147LA1v]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC), an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), has become more prevalent among children worldwide in recent years. Ulcerative colitis is classified by the extent of lesions as ulcerative proctitis (UP, E1); left-sided UC (E2), distal to the splenic flexure; extensive UC (E3), distal to the hepatic flexure; and pancolitis (E4), proximal to the hepatic flexure. Although UP is considered mild colitis because inflammation is localized, it causes frequent diarrhea, bloody stools, tenesmus, and abdominal pain, impacting the quality of life for affected children. A greater proportion of children than adults with UC have a severe course, with 74% having pancolitis at diagnosis. Only 5%-9% of children with UC have only UP at diagnosis, representing a less common UC presentation than in adults.

First-line therapies for UP in adults include topical 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA); topical steroids or 5-ASA plus oral steroids may be required. Refractory proctitis, defined as resistance to these treatments, requires intensification to thiopurine or biologics. Proximal disease extension of UP occurs in 30% of adults, frequently requiring immunosuppressive treatment. Recently, concern has arisen about the exclusion of UP from randomized clinical trials of biologic and small molecule agents in patients with moderate to severe UC. Clinical data concerning treatment options are particularly limited for refractory UP; recommendations for management of moderate to severe UP are largely extrapolated from data based on extensive UC. To address this problem, the International Organization for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease has issued a consensus statement standardizing methods for patient evaluation in UP trials. A 2023 study reported the efficacy of tofacitinib in adults with UP, and studies are increasingly focusing on UP.

Although UP treatment is progressing in adults, data concerning natural history and treatment is sparse for children. European Crohn's and Colitis Organization guidelines suggest that topical 5-ASA may be effective in children with mild to moderate UP, but since children face greater risk of disease extension oral medications should be added; however, detailed recommendations are not given. Few reports have even described the natural history of pediatric UP. In this study, we investigated clinical course, therapy, and characteristics of refractory UP in children.

### Potential mogamulizumab-associated inflammatory bowel disease in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma management [^11196gaB]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case 1

An 87-year-old female was referred to our clinic for the management of stage IVA1 (T4NxM0B2) Sézary syndrome, which had progressed after 2 years of combined treatment with methotrexate and extracorporeal photopheresis (Fig 1). Mogamulizumab was initiated, resulting in complete skin and blood remission after only 3 cycles. After 3 months of mogamulizumab following the standard dosing (mogamulizumab 1 mg/kg intravenously on a weekly basis for the first 28-day cycle, then on days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles), the patient developed severe, progressively worsening diarrhea. An infectious cause was ruled out. No additional treatments were introduced concomitantly with mogamulizumab. The patient had no known history of autoimmune disorder, smoking, or recent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or proton pump inhibitors. The chronology of events raised the suspicion of an immune-related etiology associated with mogamulizumab treatment. Endoscopic evaluation revealed ulcerative pancolitis with histology indicating drug-induced colitis (Fig 2). Despite mogamulizumab's discontinuation, the symptoms persisted, leading to a diagnosis of severe grade 4 mogamulizumab-induced colitis. Systemic corticotherapy was initiated, followed by selective immunosuppressive therapy with vedolizumab, yielding a limited effect. Despite its potential to worsen CTCL, treatment with monoclonal anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-tumor necrosis factor) antibody infliximab was started, resulting in a favorable intestinal response. Initially, the patient maintained complete clinical and blood response 1 year after stopping mogamulizumab. Following infliximab initiation, a worsening of skin and blood tumor burden was observed. Extracorporeal photopheresis was reinitiated, and the patient has since remained in complete remission.

### Oral vancomycin is associated with less therapy intensification in adults with symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease and underlying primary sclerosing cholangitis [^117KFAMz]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Seventy percent of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a cholestatic liver disease, have comorbid inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Typically, comorbid symptomatic IBD in PSC is a milder phenotype of ulcerative colitis (UC), characterized by pancolitis, rectal sparing and ileitis. Since PSC is associated with alterations in the gut microbiome, antibiotics are postulated to be beneficial in treatment. While no proven therapy for PSC exists, oral vancomycin therapy (OVT) has received considerable interest, without demonstrating a clear benefit in PSC outcomes. Therefore, recent guidelines concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend OVT for the treatment of PSC. Notably, the guidelines did not address the role of OVT in the treatment of symptomatic comorbid IBD in patients with PSC (IBD-PSC).

Recent data in pediatric IBD-PSC patients show that OVT is associated with a higher likelihood of IBD clinical and endoscopic remission — although associations with IBD therapy changes, including therapy de-escalation, were not directly studied. It is not yet clear whether this association also holds in adult IBD-PSC patients, who can have different response rates to IBD therapy than pediatric patients; to date, the majority of data on OVT in adult IBD-PSC patients are from case reports. We hypothesized that OVT would similarly be associated with a better IBD disease course in adults with IBD-PSC. We studied whether OVT was associated with differences in IBD disease activity, as assessed by the need for IBD therapy intensification, in adult patients with IBD-PSC.

Over the course of the last 2 decades our knowledge of autoimmune pancreatitis has increased exponentially. In this review, we summarize the clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of AIP, to better allow general gastroenterologists and primary care providers to consider AIP as a as a rare but important cause of painless obstructive jaundice and recurrent acute pancreatitis. While steroids remain the mainstay of first line therapy, a number of patients with type 1 AIP require immunomodulators or rituximab to maintain remission; recommendations on the management of relapses continue to evolve.

"The implication of a strong recommendation is that most individuals should receive the intervention". In contrast, "The implication of a weak recommendation is that the preferred course of action is suggested but that additional factors, such as patient values and preferences, will need to be considered", and "The majority of fully informed patients would still want to follow this course of action, but many would not", with "The final decision regarding the course of action" being shared between provider and patient.

3.9.10 Therapeutic choice after anti-TNF failure

Infliximab and other anti-TNF drugs have been used in UC for many years, and it is therefore important to consider alternatives for patients failing these drugs and who need to switch 'out of class' (see Sections 5.2.4.5: Common Disease Considerations, Primary non-response to anti-TNF therapy and 5.2.4.6: Common Disease Considerations, Secondary loss of response to anti-TNF therapy). It is important to note that surgery should always be discussed as an option in patients failing a therapeutic agent, particularly as there is generally a reduction in response to each successive immunosuppressive or biologic drug.

### Ulcerative colitis: diagnosis and treatment [^111HnZi6]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic disease with recurrent symptoms and significant morbidity. The precise etiology is still unknown. As many as 25 percent of patients with ulcerative colitis have extraintestinal manifestations. The diagnosis is made endoscopically. Tests such as perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies are promising, but not yet recommended for routine use. Treatment is based on the extent and severity of the disease. Rectal therapy with 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds is used for proctitis. More extensive disease requires treatment with oral 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds and oral corticosteroids. The side effects of steroids limit their usefulness for chronic therapy. Patients who do not respond to treatment with oral corticosteroids require hospitalization and intravenous steroids. Refractory symptoms may be treated with azathioprine or infliximab. Surgical treatment of ulcerative colitis is reserved for patients who fail medical therapy or who develop severe hemorrhage, perforation, or cancer. Longstanding ulcerative colitis is associated with an increased risk of colon cancer. Patients should receive an initial screening colonoscopy eight years after the onset of pancolitis and 12 to 15 years after the onset of left-sided disease; follow-up colonoscopy should be repeated every two to three years.

### Curcumin use in ulcerative colitis: is it ready for prime time? A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials [^1122CA1G]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory condition that presents with watery and/or hemorrhagic diarrhea associated with rectal urgency. Symptoms can be debilitating and severely affect a person's quality of life. At diagnosis, 30–50% of patients have disease confined to the rectum or the sigmoid colon (distal colitis), 20–30% have left-sided colitis and about 20% have pancolitis. Of the patients with distal colitis, 25–50% progress to more extensive forms of the disease over time.

In early 2019, the American Gastroenterology Association (AGA) released clinical guidelines for the management of mild to moderate UC. The recommendation is to start standard dose mesalamine (2–3 g/day) or diazo-bonded 5-amino-salicylic acid (5-ASA), rather than low dose mesalamine, sulfasalazine or no treatment, in patients with extensive mild-moderate UC. The addition of rectal mesalamine to oral 5-ASA is recommended for patients with extensive or left-sided mild-to-moderate UC.

There have been reports regarding the efficacy of curcumin, a natural phenol found in the large-leafed herb Curcuma longa L. (common names turmeric, Indian saffron) in the treatment of various diseases, such as hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, as well as UC. However, the AGA made no recommendations on its use in mild-to-moderate UC patients already on a 5-ASA agent. The reason for this was stated to be a "knowledge gap", probably from the lack of large randomized placebo controlled studies (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of curcumin and its side-effect profile. We therefore aimed at filling this "knowledge gap" by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of the current evidence in order to evaluate the role of combination curcumin therapy in patients with UC.

Suspect infected pancreatic necrosis — algorithm: Typically occurring after day 7–10 with renewed pain, fevers, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), the figure advises to "SKIP CT Aspiration!", to "Assume Infected Necrosis", and to "Use Targeted Antimicrobial Therapy" with "Pancreatic Necrosis Penetrating Antibiotics". Under the "Clinically Stable" branch, continue antibiotics and observe, delaying minimally invasive surgical, radiologic, or endoscopic debridement " > 4–6 weeks", with "[In Select Patients who do well: No Debridement!]", whereas the "Clinically Unstable" branch directs "Prompt Surgical Debridement".

Patients with UC

Adjusted for baseline demographics and clinical characteristics, results of the logistic regression model suggest that the overall odds of experiencing an adverse medical event during first and second lines of biologic treatment were not significantly different between patients with UC who received two anti-TNFα treatments successively and those who received vedolizumab followed by an anti-TNFα treatment (OR, 1.147; 95% CI, 0.787–1.670; P = 0.476) (Fig. 4 B).

In patients with UC, one to two and three or more hospitalization events were associated with higher odds of experiencing an adverse medical event than no hospitalization events (OR, 1.963; 95% CI, 1.412–2.728; P < 0.001 for one to two hospitalization events, and OR, 4.935; 95% CI, 2.195–11.095; P < 0.001 for three or more hospitalization events). Less extensive disease than pancolitis was associated with lower odds of experiencing an adverse medical event in patients with UC (OR, 0.714; CI, 0.521–0.978; P = 0.036). Each year increase in age was associated with lower odds of experiencing an adverse medical event in patients with UC (OR, 0.987; 95% CI, 0.977–0.997; P = 0.010).

### Acute pancreatitis [^113Gunge]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is an unpredictable and potentially lethal disease. The prognosis mainly depends on the development of organ failure and secondary infection of pancreatic or peripancreatic necrosis. In the past 10 years, treatment of acute pancreatitis has moved towards a multidisciplinary, tailored, and minimally invasive approach. Despite improvements in treatment and critical care, severe acute pancreatitis is still associated with high mortality rates. In this Seminar, we outline the latest evidence on diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for acute pancreatitis.
