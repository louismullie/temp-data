## Question

A 40-year-old man presents with a swollen left big toe that started this morning. The patient states that he attended a party last night and drank 4 glasses of whiskey. He denies any trauma to the foot. The patient has a history of similar episodes in the past that were related to alcohol use. His symptoms were previously relieved with ibuprofen. However, the pain persisted despite treatment with the medication. Physical examination reveals a tender and erythematous, swollen left 1st metatarsophalangeal joint. Which of the following events most likely contributed to his condition?

Answer Choices:
A. Vasoconstriction
B. Downregulation of integrins in the neutrophils
C. Upregulation of cellular adhesion molecules to promote neutrophil migration
D. Decreased expression of selectin in the endothelium

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pathophysiologic mechanism best explains why alcohol triggered an acute gout flare in the first metatarsophalangeal joint, with options including vasoconstriction, downregulation of neutrophil integrins, upregulation of endothelial adhesion molecules, or decreased selectin expression. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely clinical diagnosis and whether the vignette fits gout. Then, I should verify the mechanistic link between alcohol and gout flares. Next, I will examine each answer choice against the known inflammatory cascade in acute gout. Finally, I will select the option that aligns with neutrophil recruitment and endothelial activation and confirm it with guideline and pathophysiology sources.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis. The presentation of acute monoarthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint with rapid onset of severe pain, erythema, and swelling, especially in a man with prior similar episodes and a recent alcohol trigger, is classic for acute gouty arthritis; EULAR diagnostic guidance highlights male sex, monoarticular foot involvement, rapid onset, erythema, and prior similar attacks as highly suggestive features when synovial fluid analysis is not available, which fits this case well [^d7fabb1b] [^43247b64].

> Now, I need to check the mechanistic connection between alcohol and gout flares. Alcohol increases uric acid production and decreases renal urate excretion, acutely raising serum urate and promoting monosodium urate crystal deposition; when crystals are phagocytosed, the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated, driving IL-1β release and a robust neutrophil-driven inflammatory response, which explains the rapid onset and intensity of pain and swelling in acute gout [^367c7bbb].

> Next, I should review the inflammatory cascade to see which option matches. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to ensure I'm aligning the mechanism with neutrophil recruitment. In acute gout, IL-1β and other cytokines upregulate endothelial adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and induce selectin-mediated rolling, leading to firm adhesion and transmigration of neutrophils into the joint, which produces the clinical picture of warmth, erythema, and swelling; this is precisely the sequence that alcohol can precipitate by increasing urate and triggering crystal inflammation [^ffd5097a] [^367c7bbb].

> Let me examine each option carefully. Vasoconstriction would be counterproductive to the observed erythema and warmth and is not a recognized driver of neutrophil recruitment in gout, so Option A is unlikely. Downregulation of neutrophil integrins would impair adhesion and migration, which contradicts the massive neutrophil influx seen in gout, so Option B is incorrect. Decreased selectin expression would also impair rolling and recruitment, again inconsistent with the histopathology of gout, so Option D is wrong. Upregulation of cellular adhesion molecules on the endothelium directly facilitates neutrophil rolling, adhesion, and diapedesis, which is exactly what occurs in acute gout flares, making Option C the mechanistically coherent choice [^367c7bbb].

> Wait, let me verify that this aligns with authoritative guidance. The EULAR and ACR documents emphasize the inflammatory nature of acute gout and the centrality of neutrophil-driven inflammation, while mechanistic reviews detail IL-1β–driven endothelial activation and neutrophil trafficking; none of these sources support vasoconstriction, integrin downregulation, or decreased selectins as contributors to gout flares, reinforcing that upregulation of adhesion molecules is the correct answer here [^d7fabb1b] [^51f63de7] [^367c7bbb].

> Final answer: C. Upregulation of cellular adhesion molecules to promote neutrophil migration, because alcohol acutely elevates urate, triggers MSU crystal–mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β release, which upregulates endothelial adhesion molecules and drives neutrophil recruitment into the joint, producing the classic acute gout flare at the first metatarsophalangeal joint [^ffd5097a] [^367c7bbb].

---

The most likely contributing event is **upregulation of cellular adhesion molecules** (option C), which promotes neutrophil migration and drives the acute inflammatory response in gout. Alcohol increases uric acid and triggers monosodium urate crystal deposition, which activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and endothelial cells, leading to increased expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and selectins that recruit neutrophils and cause the rapid onset of pain, erythema, and swelling typical of a gout flare [^367c7bbb]. Options A, B, and D are incorrect because vasoconstriction is not a key driver of gout inflammation, and downregulation of integrins or selectins would impair, not enhance, neutrophil recruitment [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology of acute gout flare

Acute gout is driven by **monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition** in joints and soft tissues, which triggers a robust inflammatory response [^ffd5097a]. The key steps include:

- **Crystal deposition**: Elevated serum uric acid from alcohol intake promotes MSU crystal formation in the joint [^ffd5097a].
- **Inflammasome activation**: MSU crystals are phagocytosed, activating the NLRP3 inflammasome and releasing IL-1β, a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine [^notfound].
- **Endothelial activation**: IL-1β induces endothelial cells to upregulate adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin), enabling neutrophil rolling, adhesion, and transmigration [^notfound].
- **Neutrophil recruitment**: Neutrophils migrate into the joint, releasing reactive oxygen species and proteases, causing tissue damage and clinical inflammation [^notfound].

---

## Role of alcohol in triggering gout flares

Alcohol — especially spirits like whiskey — **increases uric acid** through multiple mechanisms:

- **Increased uric acid production**: Alcohol metabolism generates lactate, which reduces renal uric acid excretion.
- **Dehydration**: Alcohol causes dehydration, concentrating uric acid and promoting crystal deposition.
- **Direct inflammatory effects**: Alcohol may amplify inflammatory signaling, lowering the threshold for flares.

---

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Option** | **Mechanism** | **Relevance to gout flare** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Vasoconstriction | Alcohol can cause vasodilation, not vasoconstriction, and this is not a primary driver of gout inflammation | Incorrect |
| B. Downregulation of integrins in neutrophils | Integrins are upregulated, not downregulated, to facilitate neutrophil adhesion and migration | Incorrect |
| C. Upregulation of cellular adhesion molecules | Correct: IL-1β drives endothelial upregulation of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and selectins, enabling neutrophil recruitment | Correct |
| D. Decreased expression of selectin in the endothelium | Selectins are upregulated, not downregulated, to mediate neutrophil rolling and adhesion | Incorrect |

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **C. Upregulation of cellular adhesion molecules**, which mediates neutrophil recruitment and drives the acute inflammatory response in gout flares triggered by alcohol [^notfound].

Diagnosis

Clinical

An acute gout flare presents as a painful, swollen joint. Patients may complain of severe throbbing pain at night waking them from sleep and pain with ambulation if the foot and ankle are affected. They may note having had similar symptoms during previous gout flares if the condition is long standing. There may be a recent trigger, such as dehydration, alcohol/purine ingestion, illness, or surgical procedure. On examination, patients may have fever, pain with active and passive range of motion of the affected joint, tenderness to palpation, warmth, and erythema. Chronic tophaceous gout appears as subcutaneous nodules that are normally painless but become painful during a flare. The skin overlying the nodules may erode, revealing chalky tophaceous material. Ulceration over a gouty tophus is a risk factor for superinfection. Gout flares can occur in any joint but occur most commonly in the foot and ankle, specifically the first metatarsophalangeal joint.

If a patient with a painful, swollen joint has a history of gout and similar symptoms from previous flares, a gout flare is likely. In the case of no known previous gout history, atypical symptoms, or other risk factors for infection such as immunocompromise or overlying skin ulceration, gout diagnosis must be confirmed with aspiration to rule out septic arthritis, superinfected gout, or a different crystalline arthropathy such as pseudogout/calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition.

Introduction

IgA vasculitis, formerly known as Henoch-Schönlein purpura, is a leukocytoclastic vasculitis characterized by the deposition of IgA-dominant immune complexes in small blood vessel walls. IgA vasculitis is most often idiopathic but has been associated with infectious agents, malignancies, and drug reactions. While rare, there have been documented cases reporting alcohol consumption as a trigger for IgA vasculitis in adults.,

Here, we describe a case of recurrent IgA vasculitis triggered by alcohol and summarize the current literature about the theorized etiology and pathophysiology.

A case report is presented of a 32-year-old female with an eight-month history of isolated right first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ) pain, after exhaustive, non-specific diagnostic evaluation. An open biopsy was performed, and a 3.5 cm wooden foreign body, believed to be the result of an injury 18 years prior, was excised from the 1st MTP. Open biopsy may be required as an important part of the workup for definitive diagnosis of a foreign body synovitis. A discussion regarding the presentation, clinical and diagnostic findings follows.

Clinical case

The patient, a 60‐year‐old man, presents with a six‐hour history of right big toe pain and swelling. He awoke overnight with a throbbing sensation in the toe and, over one hour, developed intense pain, redness, heat, and swelling of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. He describes the pain as the worst pain he has ever experienced (9 of 10 in severity). He is unable to move the joint, take weight on his foot, or put on a shoe. The day before, he celebrated his 60th birthday with a round of golf and a large meal. He had an episode of joint pain and swelling in the left ankle six months ago, which was treated with naproxen and resolved after one week. He usually has no joint pain. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and impaired glucose tolerance.

Examination shows that he is distressed with the pain. There is exquisite tenderness, swelling, warmth, and erythema of the right first metatarsophalangeal joint. He is unable to bear weight on the right foot. The other joints examine normally. There is a small white nodule (tophus) on the helix of the left ear.

Laboratory test findings show a C‐reactive protein level of 68 mg/L (reference range < 5 mg/L) and a neutrophil count of 12.3 × 10/L (reference range 1.9–7.5 × 10/L). The serum urate level measures 8.0 mg/dL (reference range 3.3–7.0 mg/dL).

Point‐of‐care ultrasound shows a double contour sign, together with grade 3 synovial hypertrophy and color Doppler signal at the right first metatarsophalangeal joint. At the left first metatarsophalangeal joint, a double contour sign is also present, together with a tophus and adjacent bone erosion at the medial metatarsal head.

Freiberg's disease is an avascular necrosis affecting the second, third, or, rarely, the fourth metatarsal head. It is typically a chronic, progressive process, eventually causing pain and loss of normal function of the metatarsophalangeal joint. Normally, patients present to the Emergency Department with atraumatic foot pain, however, as we illustrate with this case, an acute fracture may occur, requiring recognition and appropriate treatment. Our patient presented with acute pain, swelling, and point tenderness of the forefoot after a minor fall. Radiographs revealed a fracture through the head of the second metatarsal and underlying avascular necrosis consistent with Freiberg's disease. Identifying the underlying chronic process was important in understanding how minor trauma resulted in a fracture in this patient.

Case 1

The first case was a 32-year-old man with intermittent joint swelling and pain over 6 years, which aggravated 2 months ago. The patient had also experienced left gluteal pain for 2 weeks. The first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ) of the left foot was affected at the onset, and the pain gradually involved all MTPJs, both ankles and knees, left elbow and tarsal joints of both feet. The patient had a high purine diet history before joint swelling and pain in the early period of this disease, each episode involving one to two joints, and intermission gradually reduced from 6 months to 1 week. His serum urate levels were elevated, but he did not accept regular treatment. Approximately 2 years ago, the patient took dexamethasone for joint swelling and pain, although the specific dosage was unknown. He had experienced right knee joint swelling and pain without any significant predisposing factor 2 months earlier, and the symptoms were relieved after intra-articular betamethasone injection. But, joint swelling and pain involving both ankles, tarsal joints and MTPJs reappeared 1 week after discontinuing treatment. The pain in the left gluteal region occurred 2 weeks before the current admission, and was sharp when changing position, but was unclear at rest and night. There was no infection of urinary and intestinal tracts before hip pain. The patient had no history of psoriasis and iritis. Lumbar disk herniation was diagnosed 7 years earlier because of low back pain with left lower limb radiating pain. Physical examination showed the following: obesity, a grain size of tophi visible on the edge of the right ear, right knee joint tenderness without swelling, double ankle joint tenderness with slight swelling and tenderness of all MTPJs of the left foot and tarsal joints of both feet, but no tenderness of the SIJ. Laboratory tests showed the following: serum uric acid (UA) 564.2 µmol/L, triglycerides (TGs) 2.12 mmol/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 32 mm/h, negative human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 and rheumatoid factor. CT of the SIJ showed bone erosion of the left SIJ (Figure 1). MRI of the SIJ showed the unilateral SIJs of the left articular surface with patchy hypointense T1 and hyperintense T2 signals. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) showed the hyperintense signal of the left SIJ with edge blurring, mainly indicating the sacroiliitis (Figure 2). He underwent CT-guided percutaneous biopsy of the left SIJ, and monosodium urate (MSU) crystals were shown by polarized microscopy (Figure 3A), although histopathology of the puncture objects did not indicate tophus formation (Figure 3B). Therefore, the clinical diagnosis of gouty arthritis was correct. Loxoprofen sodium tablets were given to the patient at the onset without satisfactory results, so prednisone was then prescribed and the symptoms were relieved soon after. After the symptoms of acute gout subsided, the patient took allopurinol.

Clinical history

A 41-year-old Chinese male was admitted to our hospital because of a 3-year history of recurrent productive cough and new onset of recurrent hemoptysis and fever for 6 months. Three years ago, the patient had been admitted to the local hospital because of cough and expectoration, and the chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed bilateral lower lung infection. Not much improvement of respiratory symptoms had been observed, although treatments of anti-infection and anti-tuberculosis had been administrated in turn. Besides, the patient suffered a new onset of intermittent symmetric pain of limb joints, swelling of the upper eyelid, and erythematous maculopapular rash on the dorsal surfaces of the metacarpophalangeal joint, bilateral elbow joint, and proximal interphalangeal joint. Both lower limbs developed a livedo reticularis appearance after standing for approximate 5 min. Six months before admission, the patient experienced hemoptysis and developed a fever with maximum temperature of 38.5 °C. The frequency of redness and swelling of upper eyelids increased with and left and right eyelids alternated once a week. The new soybean-sized subcutaneous nodules with tenderness were found on the bilateral finger pulp. High potency anti-infection, anti-tuberculosis and anti-fungus treatment were given but demonstrated ineffectiveness with accelerated cough and expectoration. The patient had a 3-year history of sinusitis and family history of asthma. And he had no previous history of smoking and drinking.

### Gout: an update [^ffd5097a]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Arthritis caused by gout (i.e., gouty arthritis) accounts for millions of outpatient visits annually, and the prevalence is increasing. Gout is caused by monosodium urate crystal deposition in tissues leading to arthritis, soft tissue masses (i.e., tophi), nephrolithiasis, and urate nephropathy. The biologic precursor to gout is elevated serum uric acid levels (i.e., hyperuricemia). Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is common and usually does not progress to clinical gout. Acute gout most often presents as attacks of pain, erythema, and swelling of one or a few joints in the lower extremities. The diagnosis is confirmed if monosodium urate crystals are present in synovial fluid. First-line therapy for acute gout is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids, depending on comorbidities; colchicine is second-line therapy. After the first gout attack, modifiable risk factors (e.g., high-purine diet, alcohol use, obesity, diuretic therapy) should be addressed. Urate-lowering therapy for gout is initiated after multiple attacks or after the development of tophi or urate nephrolithiasis. Allopurinol is the most common therapy for chronic gout. Uricosuric agents are alternative therapies in patients with preserved renal function and no history of nephrolithiasis. During urate-lowering therapy, the dose should be titrated upward until the serum uric acid level is less than 6 mg per dL (355 micromol per L). When initiating urate-lowering therapy, concurrent prophylactic therapy with low-dose colchicine for three to six months may reduce flare-ups.

### Approach to the pharmacological management of chronic pain in patients with an alcohol use disorder [^edcd6235]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Case introduction

A 40-year-old man experienced a work-related accident in 2009 involving his shoulders and wrists. He had a history of alcohol dependence but quit drinking in 1997. At the time of his injury, it was determined that he was at high risk for misuse of opioids. He had no other medical conditions or current medications. After his accident, he resumed drinking to self-manage his pain and continued to drink 12 beers every other day. He was prescribed naltrexone after attending a detoxification program for 1 week, but later discontinued it because of a perceived lack of efficacy. Instead, he planned to cut back slowly and had acknowledged that his pain is a trigger for his drinking.

The patient reported a constant pinching sensation in his right shoulder, into the anterior rotator cuff. He also has pain and numbness in both of his wrists and intermittent numbness on the ulnar aspect of his left hand involving his fourth and fifth fingers. He rated this pain on a visual analog scale as 6/10 most of the time, though it increased to 10/10 quickly with any repetitive use or overhead work.

### Pseudopodagra: a presenting manifestation of infective endocarditis [^b977ae62]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Podagra is a term used to describe acute monoarthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal (1st MTP) joint. The most common diagnoses of arthritis in this joint are: crystal-induced synovitis, septic arthritis, traumatic conditions and reactive arthritis. When etiologies other than gout are involved this is frequently referred to as pseudopodagra. We report the case of a patient who presented with pain and swelling of the 1st MTP The absence of intraarticular crystals and hyperuricemia encouraged further evaluation of the patient. A cardiac murmur was investigated by echocardiography, which revealed valvular vegetations and the diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE) was established. This is the first reported case of a podagra-like presentation of IE. As in this case, the diagnosis of gout should rest on findings beyond the presence at 1st MTP arthritis, with evaluation of all extraarticular signs in order to rule out other possible diagnoses.

### Assessment and management of atraumatic first metatarsophalangeal joint pain [^430e08e4]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). Medium credibility.

Nontraumatic pain in the first metatarsophalangeal joint is frequent and can be debilitating. The metatarsophalangeal joint complex comprises four articulating surfaces including the first metatarsal, the proximal phalanx, and tibial and fibular sesamoids, which are all contained within a synovial capsule. The most common causes of pain are hallux valgus and hallux rigidus. However, other diagnoses, such as functional hallux limitus, sesamoiditis, gout, and inflammatory autoimmune arthritis, need to be considered as well. A systematic approach is key to accurately diagnose the source of pain, which can sometimes be the result of more than one condition. The most important clinical information to obtain is a focused history, meticulous clinical examination based on understanding the precise anatomy and biomechanics of the first metatarsophalangeal joint, and analysis of the relevant imaging. Each pathology has a different treatment algorithm, as such, understanding the pathoanatomy and biomechanics is important in forming an effective treatment plan.

### Case report: leprosy osteoarticular alterations mimicking rheumatoid arthritis [^cdfeec6c]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Deformities of bones of the face and extremities are markers of leprosy (Hansen's disease) which contribute to stigma associated with this disease. Among these deformities are articular alterations that can mimic rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this case, a 64-year-old man presented with a history of having been treated for lepromatous leprosy and erythema nodosum leprosum episodes, which evolved with joint alterations similar to those of RA. Most cases of leprosy-related arthritis are associated with reactional episodes, of which a large number do not respond to conventional therapy for leprosy reactions. In cases of chronic arthritis not associated with leprosy reactions, although patients show considerable relief with anti-leprosy therapy, arthritis is not completely resolved. This emphasizes the need for early diagnosis and treatment of leprosy to prevent the development of osteoarticular alterations.

### Alcohol consumption in relation to risk and severity of chronic widespread pain: results from a UK population-based study [^5a309d7c]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

Aside from consideration of the possible mechanisms whereby an association is observed, we think it is important to evaluate to what extent a causal mechanism is likely. Hill 20, in proposing his factors to consider whether an association was causal or not, identified one necessary criterion: temporality. The postulated risk factor must precede the onset of disease (or symptoms). From the available evidence of the 2 studies, it is not possible to determine that this criterion is met. Both were cross‐sectional studies and could be observing the consequences of having CWP of a particular severity. For example, in our study it may be that persons who have less disabling symptoms have few restrictions on their daily activities (including social activities) and are able to more fully engage in pastimes that give rise to opportunities for social consumption of alcohol. That may be true also for the comparison of persons with and without CWP. However, in our current study we have a category of "never having regularly consumed alcohol", and persons in this category have a high prevalence of CWP and (if they have CWP) high levels of disability. Provided that persons are truthfully answering the questionnaire, their alcohol consumption cannot have changed after the development of fibromyalgia and does suggest that persons who have never consumed alcohol have a high risk of symptoms/disabling symptoms. In terms of other factors proposed by Hill, only strength (i.e. the observed associations are large) and biologic gradient (i.e. risk appears to be related to dose) are definitely satisfied. In terms of specificity (i.e. is the relationship only observed with CWP/fibromyalgia?), it is of note that a relationship between alcohol consumption and health has been observed for both general health and specific health conditions 21. In a seminal prospective study of approximately half a million US adults followed from 1982–91, Thun et al 22 reported mortality rates from cardiovascular disease to be significantly lower among men (relative risk [RR] 0.7, 95% CI 0.7–0.8) and women (RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.6–0.7) reporting at least 1 drink daily (i.e. at least 7 units/week) than among nondrinkers, with little relation to the level of consumption. Overall mortality rates were lowest among those consuming 1 drink per day, although mortality rates increased among heavy drinkers. A so‐called J‐shaped pattern of alcohol consumption and overall mortality has been reported in other major studies 23, 24. Specifically, alcohol consumption has also been related to increased mood, quality of life 25, and physical health 26. Therefore, any effect of alcohol consumption on pain is not specific, and an alternative mechanism to a direct effect is that alcohol has positive effects on general health, which influences the reporting of pain. Indeed, general health status has been found to be a strong predictor of pain onset in epidemiologic studies 27, 28. Alternatively, alcohol may have no positive effects on health at all either directly or indirectly, and drinking within limits that are regarded in society as normal may simply be a marker or indicator for those with healthier lifestyles and beneficial levels of certain risk factors 21.

A 54-year-old Chinese male with a 12-year history of gout and hyperuricemia reported a 3-day history of lower limb edema and elevated serum creatinine. He suffered episodic gouty attacks, despite intermittently being treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Tophaceous deposits were present in the hands and toes for at least 5 years. Furthermore, the patient reported high alcohol intake spanning 20 years. He denied any history of trauma or spinal injuries. After he had been admitted to inpatient ward, he was found to have tenderness in the left anterior leg with anesthesia. Five days later, he complained of progressive back pain radiating to his anterior chest. The level of skin anesthesia increased from the lower extremities to his chest. Several days later, the paraparesis progressed to difficulty walking.

On physical examination the patient was found to have a fever of 38.8 °C. He had significant tenderness in his back and obvious difficulty with ambulation secondary to pain. Multiple tophi were also noted over several interphalangeal joints and metatarsophalangeal joints. Neurological examination showed that his lower limb strength had decreased (Grade 4/5) on the left and he had left ankle clonus. The lower abdominal and cremasteric reflexes were normal. The left lower limb also showed exaggerated reflexes as well as positive Babinski and Rossolimo' sign. Reflexes were intact and within normal range on the straight-leg raise test. Laboratory values at the time of admission are depicted in Table 1.

Computed tomography of the thoracic spine showed spinal stenosis at the T3/T4, T9-T12 levels. He also underwent magnetic resonance imaging, which showed hypertrophic ligamentum flavum at the level of T3/T4, T5/T6, T9/T10, T10/T11 and T11/T12 (Figures 1 and 2). The discs of T7/T8, L3/L4, and L5/S1 showed posterior bulge. Degenerative disc disease was found at the levels of T1/T2, T12/L1, L1/L2 and L5/S1.

### Cellulitis [^fc42512e]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis is a common infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused predominantly by gram-positive organisms. Risk factors include prior episodes of cellulitis, cutaneous lesions, tinea pedis, and chronic edema. Cellulitis is a clinical diagnosis and presents with localized skin erythema, edema, warmth, and tenderness. Uncomplicated cellulitis can be managed in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics. Imaging often is not required but can be helpful. Recurrent cellulitis is common and predisposing conditions should be assessed for and treated at the time of initial diagnosis. For patients with frequent recurrences despite management of underlying conditions, antimicrobial prophylaxis can be effective.

Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Erythrodermic psoriasis — case 6 presents a 29-year-old man with a family history of psoriasis who developed plaque type psoriasis at 12 years of age initially treated with low-potency topical corticosteroids, with progressive worsening over the subsequent 6 years. He was treated initially with 15 mg per week of oral methotrexate (MTX) that led to significant elevations in his liver function test (LFT) findings after 9 months of therapy requiring discontinuation, failed to respond to a 12-week course of intramuscular alefacept, and thereafter obtained significant improvement with etanercept; approximately 7 months after his last etanercept dose an upper respiratory infection led to rapid worsening with involvement of most of his body surface area (BSA) sparing only the palms and soles. On examination he was afebrile with other vital signs within normal limits and had generalized erythematous inflammatory patches and plaques covering 95% of his BSA with superficial exfoliation of the face, palms, and soles, pitting edema of the lower extremities, and swelling of the toes without any specific individual joint tenderness.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^901a5cd0]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Acute Charcot arthropathy — clinical diagnosis relies on characteristic unilateral inflammatory changes in an insensate foot, frequent pain despite neuropathy, and awareness of ulceration that can mimic osteomyelitis. The initial diagnosis is often clinical, based on profound unilateral swelling, increased skin temperature, erythema, joint effusion, and bone resorption in an insensate foot; these characteristics in the presence of intact skin are often pathognomonic of acute neuroarthropathy. In more than 75% of cases, the patient will present with some degree of pain in an otherwise insensate extremity, and diagnosis can be complicated when patients first present with a concomitant ulceration, raising questions of potential contiguous osteomyelitis.

### Diffuse pigmented villonodular synovitis in the metatarsophalangeal joint of the hallux: a case report [^a2472028]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

A 60-year-old woman presented to our institution with a 2-month history of swelling and unrelieved pain on walking, localized to the right hallux. Magnetic resonance image scans revealed a multinodular soft tissue mass with low signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images. Microscopic examination of a specimen procured using fine-needle biopsy revealed multinucleated giant cells, hemosiderin deposition, and foaming histiocytes, indicative of pigmented villonodular synovitis. Thereafter, excision of the mass and a thorough synovectomy were carried out using 2 separate longitudinal incisions. Although pigmented villonodular synovitis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint is not unheard of, it is relatively rare and physicians should consider it in the differential diagnosis when treating patients with prolonged chronic arthritis of the first pedal ray. This case, moreover, clearly depicts the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging combined with fine-needle biopsy in regard to making the diagnosis of pigmented villonodular synovitis.

### Rare lateral dislocation of the first metatarsophalangeal joint: a case report and review of the literature [^1d14bd3c]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Traumatic lateral dislocations of the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint are very rare. A 44-year-old male was referred after a motorcycle to car accident because of an exposed head of the left first metatarsal through a laceration on the medial aspect of the first MTP joint. Radiographs showed a lateral dislocation of the first MTP joint, with concomitant fractures of the neck of the second metatarsal and the base of the third and fourth metatarsal bones. The dislocation was reduced in the emergency department with the patient under conscious sedation after thorough irrigation. At the 1-year postoperative visit, the patient had full painless range of motion of the first and second MTP joints without any complaints. Lateral dislocation of the first MTP joint is an injury usually associated with fracture of the adjacent metatarsals and/or ligamentous injuries. It is easily reducible, with acceptable midterm outcomes.

After a diagnostic joint aspiration, the synovial fluid analysis revealed a cell count of 0.3×10³ leucocytes per µL and no crystals.

The patient was initially treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and because symptoms did not improve, she received 30 mg/die of prednisolone. Treatment resulted in a partial response, but symptoms in the MTP2 joint persisted. Diagnostic and therapeutic arthrocentesis of the left MTP 2 joint was performed. Although no joint fluid was obtained, an injection of 12 mg triamcinolone actetonide resulted in significant clinical improvement. At a follow-up visit after discontinuation of corticosteroids, the patient was completely symptom-free. On analysis of blood tests, CRP and ESR were within the normal range.

During the advent of artificial turf and flexible footwear in football, turf toe was initially coined and described as a 1st metatarsophalangeal joint sprain injury. In the classic setting of hyperextension of the 1st metatarsophalangeal joint, turf toe is an injury to its plantar capsuloligamentous complex. Advances in MR imaging and knowledge of the complex 1st metatarsophalangeal joint help pinpoint the injured plantar structures as well as assess severity and chronicity of the injury. Detailed analysis of turf toe should highlight the best conservative and surgical options for injured athletes to reach optimal recovery.

### Soft tissue enlargement of fingers in a teenager [^29c479c3]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Amyopathic juvenile dermatomyositis
B. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
C. Pachydermodactyly
D. Subcutaneous granuloma annulare
E. Pachydermoperiostosis

Answers:
A. Amyopathic juvenile dermatomyositis – Incorrect. Amyopathic juvenile dermatomyositis is an autoimmune inflammatory disease with predominantly skin findings such as a purplish-red rash over the eyelids, erythematous patches and plaques over the neck, shoulders, chest, and back and dilated nail bed capillary loops. Purplish-red papules may be present on dorsum of hands over the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints. Bilateral widening of the digits limited to PIP joints is not a feature. ANA is reported positive in 50% of cases.
B. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis – Incorrect. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory arthritis in children younger than 16 years. Characteristic symptoms include joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. Common lab abnormalities include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, with possible positive ANA and rheumatoid factor. Imaging shows changes of periarticular osteoporosis and bony erosion in the joint space.
C. Pachydermodactyly – Correct. Pachydermodactyly is a benign and uncommon fibromatosis typically seen around the proximal interphalangeal joints resulting in asymptomatic soft tissue swelling. It is most commonly seen in adolescent males. X-ray shows no joint or bony abnormalities and lab abnormalities are usually absent.
D. Subcutaneous granuloma annulare – Incorrect. Subcutaneous granuloma annulare is a granulomatous inflammatory disorder of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue manifesting clinically as a single or multiple subcutaneous nodules. These lesions are predominantly found in children and often occur on the scalp, acral surfaces, and lower limbs, especially on the shins. The presence of discrete nodules as opposed to fusiform widening of digits makes this diagnosis less likely.
E. Pachydermoperiostosis – Incorrect. Pachydermoperiostosis is a rare genetic disorder with skin and bone involvement. Findings include coarsening of facial features, acne, hyperhidrosis, enlargement of hands and feet, clubbing of fingers and toes, and radiographic findings of periostosis and arthritis.

Idiopathic avascular necrosis of the first metatarsal head rarely occurs in pediatrics. The present case of avascular necrosis of the first metatarsal head occurred in a 13-year-old male who came to the clinic with a 9-month history of pain in the first metatarsophalangeal joint. Conservative treatment had been applied for 9 months, but the pain had not been relieved. Therefore, surgical treatment, including decompression and debridement, was performed in the first metatarsal head of the patient. After 6 months of follow-up monitoring, full range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint was observed, and the pain had disappeared. No any other complications had developed during 18 months of follow-up monitoring.

Case summary

A 40-year-old previously healthy man presented to the emergency department with a 1-day history of lip and bilateral eyelid swelling and a generalized pruritic rash, all starting simultaneously. The patient described the lesions as migratory, each lasting for a few hours. The rash started on the back and subsequently spread to his extremities within hours, sparing his face and scalp. The eyelid swelling decreased on the same day without treatment, whereas the lip swelling persisted. Clinically, there was no clear association with ingestion of any food or medication. He denied recent ingestion of newly prescribed or over-the-counter medications, herbal supplements, or home remedies. He denied similar previous presentations or history of allergies, except for an episode of generalized rash after receiving an antibiotic 4 years before presentation. The patient had no medical conditions and denied receiving any medications, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibitors.

Before the symptoms occurred, he had a 5-day history of mild, nonproductive cough and dyspnea with low-grade fever. He reported ingesting 2 g (4 tablets) of acetaminophen for the fever within 2 days before his presentation, but with no improvement. He had regularly received acetaminophen in the past without any rashes or adverse reactions. He did not report a history of smoking or alcohol consumption and also denied family history of allergies or angioedema. The patient denied contact with any individuals with a confirmed positive case of COVID-19. He was employed as support staff for a designated COVID-19 hospital.

On examination, the patient was in mild respiratory distress. Vital signs on admission were as follows: temperature 37.4°C, blood pressure 118/67 mm Hg, respiratory rate 22/min, and oxygen saturation 97% on room air. Erythematous generalized urticarial welts were noted, more prominent on the trunk (Fig 1), whereas the palms and soles were spared. Dermographism was not detected. His lips were markedly swollen (Fig 2); eyelid swelling was resolving at presentation. No other skin abnormalities were found. There were no wheezes or crackles on chest examination.

### A diagnostic rule for acute gouty arthritis in primary care without joint fluid analysis [^d623ec8e]. Archives of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Acute Gout Diagnosis Rule" for gout.

The Acute Gout Diagnosis Rule is a clinical calculator used to diagnose acute gout without joint fluid analysis. This rule applies to adult patients presenting with monoarthritis, where only one joint is inflamed.

The clinical utility of this calculator is to help clinicians make a diagnosis of acute gout in settings where joint fluid analysis may not be readily available or feasible. It uses a combination of clinical factors and laboratory results to determine the likelihood of a gout flare.

Exclusion criteria for the use of this calculator include patients with polyarticular disease (more than one joint affected), septic arthritis, recent trauma to the joint, or other clear causes of monoarthritis. It should also not be used in patients who have already been diagnosed with gout or pseudogout.

The Acute Gout Diagnosis Rule evaluates the likelihood of an acute gout diagnosis based on specific symptoms and medical history. It assesses several factors through yes or no responses, which are converted into a numerical score. This score then corresponds to a prevalence percentage that reflects the likelihood of having gout.

The user inputs include:

- Male sex
- Previous patient-reported arthritis attack
- Onset within 1 day
- Joint redness
- First metatarsophalangeal joint involvement (a common site for gout)
- History of cardiovascular or related conditions (such as hypertension or angina)
- Serum uric acid level greater than 5.88 mg/dL (or 0.35 mmol/L)

For each condition checked as true, specific points are assigned:

- **Male sex**: 2 points
- **Previous arthritis attack**: 2 points
- **Onset within 1 day**: 0.5 points
- **Joint redness**: 1 point
- **First metatarsophalangeal joint involvement**: 2.5 points
- **Cardiovascular or related conditions**: 1.5 points
- **High serum uric acid**: 3.5 points

The responses are evaluated by adding up the respective points for each true response. The total score, ranging from 0 to 13, determines the interpretation:

- A score of 4 or less suggests that the prevalence of gout is about 2.2%, indicating a low likelihood of gout.
- A score between 5 and 7 suggests a 31.2% prevalence, indicating a moderate likelihood of the condition.
- A score of 8 or more suggests an 80.4% prevalence, indicating a high probability of having gout.

These outcomes help in estimating the likelihood of acute gout based on common symptoms and clinical markers.

### Swollen, discolored toes… [^d7f5e37e]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

A 68-year-old man presented to the emergency department complaining of painful swelling in the second and third toes of his left foot, which had started four days earlier. The patient denied trauma or fever. His medical history was significant for hypertension and atrial fibrillation. Medications included lisinopril, sotalol, and warfarin. During the past six months, his anticoagulation consistently had been in the therapeutic range. Progression of pain and discoloration motivated him to seek care. Physical examination revealed the left second and third toes were tender, edematous, and purplish with sharp demarcation at the base of both digits. Lymphangitic streaking was absent. Peripheral pulses were normal in both legs, and the anklebrachial index also was normal bilaterally. Left foot radiographs showed swelling, but no evidence of osteomyelitis or fracture.

The patient was admitted and received empiric antibiotic treatment along with hydrocodone for pain. A thrombogenic etiology initially seemed more likely in this patient, given his known atrial fibrillation, the distal location of the embolic event, and its simultaneous onset in adjacent toes. However, when review of laboratory values confirmed consistently therapeutic anticoagulation and no cardioembolic source was found on transthoracic echocardiogram, attention shifted toward a possible atherogenic source. When the diagnostic work-up in this patient revealed no obvious thrombogenic etiology, the presumptive diagnosis was an atheromatous embolic event. Antibiotic therapy was stopped during hospitalization given the lack of apparent benefit. The patient was discharged with oral hydrocodone for pain relief. During the weeks after discharge, the patient's pain slowly improved, but the purplish color of his toes persisted.

A vascular surgery consult recommended continued outpatient pain management, with observation to see if toe amputation eventually would be required. The differential diagnosis of the toe findings in this patient includes cellulitis, cryoglobulinemia, trauma, and warfarin skin necrosis. Cellulitis was unlikely, given the sharply demarcated border to the skin change, the absence of fever, and lack of response to antibiotic therapy. Cryoglobulinemia may lead to purpuric or gangrenous lesions in the distal extremities, and its incidence is increasing recently because of its association with hepatitis C infection.

### Unusual clinical presentations of gout [^f78c4101]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The dogmatic description of gout is described as an inflammatory crystal-induced arthropathy that afflicts peripheral joints. This manuscript describes many recent cases and unusual clinical presentations of gout. Emphasis is placed on the ability of gout to cause diagnostic dilemmas that can impact patient treatment and care.

Recent Findings

Various genetic mutations can predispose patients in developing early onset gout. Environmental exposures, medications, and certain patient populations can affect pathophysiology of uric acid, predisposing patients both typical and atypical manifestations of gout. Numerous reports have described gout deposition in unusual parts of the body, which can mimic unrelated disease processes.

Summary

Although classic gout is still most commonly seen, the disease can manifest as with a wide array of presentations. It is likely that such atypical presentations are a result of a complexity of reasons. When presented with a diagnostic challenge in a patient with gout, the clinician should be aware of unusual manifestations of gout and consider it in the differential.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute gout [^e43ae695]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis that is characterised by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid and other tissues. The natural history of articular gout is generally characterised by three periods: asymptomatic hyperuricaemia, episodes of acute gout and chronic gouty arthritis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs) are commonly used to treat acute gout. Published guidelines recommend their use to treat acute attacks, using maximum recommended doses for a short time.

Objectives

To assess the benefit and safety of NSAIDs (including COXIBs) for acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies to 7 October 2013, the 2010 and 2011 ACR and EULAR abstracts and performed a handsearch of reference lists of articles. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trial register and ClinicalTrials.gov. We applied no date or language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We considered all published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials that compared NSAIDs with placebo or another therapy (including non-pharmacological therapies) for acute gout. Major outcomes were pain (proportion with 50% or more reduction in pain or mean pain when the dichotomous outcome was unavailable), inflammation (e.g. measured by joint swelling/erythema/tenderness), function of target joint, participant's global assessment of treatment success, health-related quality of life, withdrawals due to adverse events and total adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the studies for inclusion, extracted the data, performed a risk of bias assessment and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 23 trials (2200 participants). One trial (30 participants) of low-quality evidence compared an NSAID (tenoxicam) with placebo. It found that significantly more participants had more than 50% reduction in pain after 24 hours (11/15 participants) compared with those taking placebo (4/15 participants) (risk ratio (RR) 2.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 6.72). A similar outcome was seen for more than 50% improvement in joint swelling after 24 hours (5/15 participants taking NSAIDs versus 2/15 participants taking placebo; RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.57 to 10.93). The trial did not measure function, participant global assessment of treatment success and health-related quality of life. There were no adverse events reported with the use of tenoxicam; two adverse events (nausea and polypuria) were reported in the placebo group. No between-group differences in outcome were observed after four days. Moderate-quality evidence based upon four trials (974 participants) indicated that NSAIDs and COXIBs produced similar benefits in terms of pain, swelling and global improvement, but COXIBs were associated with fewer adverse events. Pain reduction was 1.9 points on a 0- to 10-point scale with COXIBs (0 was no pain) while pain reduction with NSAIDs was 0.03 points lower or better (mean difference (MD) -0.03, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.13). Joint swelling in the COXIB group was 1.64 points on a 0- to 3-point scale (0 is no swelling) and 0.13 points higher with NSAIDs (MD 0.13, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.34). Function was not reported. Participant-reported global assessment was 1.56 points on a 0- to 4-point scale with COXIBs (0 was the best score) and was 0.04 points higher with NSAIDs (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.20). Health-related quality of life assessed using the 36-item Short Form showed no evidence of a statistically significant between-group difference (MD 0.49, 95% CI -1.61 to 2.60 for the physical component). There were significantly fewer withdrawals due to adverse events in participants treated with COXIBs (3%) compared with NSAIDs (8%) (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.34 to 4.28). There was a significantly lower number of total adverse events in participants treated with COXIBs (38%) compared with NSAIDs (60%) (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.86). There was moderate-quality evidence based on two trials (210 participants) that oral glucocorticoids did not differ in pain reduction, function or adverse events when compared with NSAIDs. Pain reduction was 9.5 on a 0- to 100-point scale with glucocorticoids, pain reduction with NSAIDs was 1.74 higher or worse (MD 1.74, 95% CI -1.44 to 4.92). The trials did not assess inflammation. Function measured as walking disability was 17.4 points on a 0- to 100-point scale with glucocorticoids, function with NSAIDs was 0.1 lower or better (MD -0.10, 95% CI -4.72 to 4.52). The trials did not measure participant-reported global assessment and health-related quality of life. There were no withdrawals due to adverse events. There was no evidence of a difference in total number of adverse events with glucocorticoids (31%) versus NSAIDs (49%) (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.28).

Authors' Conclusions

Limited evidence supported the use of NSAIDs in the treatment of acute gout. One placebo-controlled trial provided evidence of benefit at 24 hours and little or no harm. We downgraded the evidence due to potential selection and reporting biases, and imprecision. While these data were insufficient to draw firm conclusions, they did not conflict with clinical guideline recommendations based upon evidence from observational studies, other inflammatory arthritis and expert consensus, which support the use of NSAIDs in acute gout. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that selective COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs are probably equally beneficial although COX-2 inhibitors are likely to be associated with significantly fewer total and gastrointestinal adverse events. We downgraded the evidence due to an unclear risk of selection and reporting biases. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that systemic glucocorticoids and NSAIDs were also equally beneficial in terms of pain relief. There were no withdrawals due to adverse events and total adverse events were similar between groups. We downgraded the evidence due to unclear risk of selection and reporting bias. There was low-quality evidence that there was no difference in function. We downgraded the quality due to unclear risk of selection bias and imprecision.

### Gout mimicking spondyloarthritis: case report and literature review [^3e8f699b]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Gout is clinically characterized by episodes of monoarthritis, which not only typically affects the peripheral joints but also occasionally affect the axial joint, such as the sacroiliac joint (SIJ), and often mimics spondyloarthritis (SpA). Two cases of gout mimicking SpA are presented in the current paper. One patient was a 32-year-old man with a history of asymmetrical oligoarthritis of ankle and metatarsophalangeal joints (MTPJ). He had left gluteal pain for 2 weeks. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the bone erosion of the left SIJ. T1-weighted MRI showed hypointense T1 and hyperintense T2 signals of the left SIJ. The other patient was a 24-year-old man with left back pain and hip pain for 4 months and intermittent fever for 3 months. He had a history of gout for 3 years. Both patients underwent CT-guided sacroiliac biopsy, and monosodium urate (MSU) crystals were shown by polarized microscopy. Gout can often mimic SpA and seldomly affects the SIJ. Thus, its correct diagnosis and adequate therapy can halt the development of such damaging complications.

### A recurrent, painful, and indurated plaque on a 75-year-old man's back [^2ef6b178]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

A 75-year-old male retired physician presented with a 6-year history of an episodic, indurated and painful plaque located on the upper left side of his back that continued to recur and regress with incomplete healing every 3 to 4 months. Physical examination found a well-demarcated, tender, indurated erythematous plaque with central erosion (Fig 1).

Reoccurrence manifested with development of a pustule or bulla, which subsequently progressed to a larger indurated plaque that was tender, pruritic, and burning. Punch biopsy found a dense infiltrate of atypical small-to-medium–sized lymphocytes in the upper and middle dermis as well as around hair follicles (Fig 2, A). Focally, the infiltrate obscured the dermoepidermal j unction (Fig 2, B).

Sex

Some authors have identified significant relationships between sex and risk of alcohol-related neuropathy. Several studies, including a larger study by Vittadini et al. have found that there is an increased prevalence amongst males. Behse and colleagues, however, found that females were more vulnerable to severe neuropathy, whilst males were overrepresented amongst mild cases, though this is based on a small study (n = 37). These studies did not adjust for alcohol consumption, and therefore, this may be because male subjects consume more alcohol as opposed to any biological vulnerability to alcoholic neuropathy in the male sex.

Case Presentation

In February 2008, a 12-year-old girl developed the flu with high fever, malaise, headaches, photophobia, myalgia and arthralgia. PCR and viral culture of a nasopharyngeal swab demonstrated influenza B virus. Two weeks after the flu symptoms resolved, she complained of painful swelling at the proximal interphalangeal joint of the 3rd left toe and, about one week later, at the left first metatarsophalangeal joint. Physical examination revealed tenderness, erythema, mild swelling, and restricted motion in these joints and in the interphalangeal joint of the left 1 st toe. The remaining physical examination was normal. In particular, there was no rash and no enthesitis or enthesalgia. Uveitis was excluded by ophthalmologic examination. Laboratory determinations revealed an elevated eosinophil count (9%) and low serum IgA of 0.45 g/l (normal, 0.70–2.30). Remaining blood counts, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ferritin, liver and kidney parameters, antinuclear antibodies, antistreptolysin titer and rheumatoid factor were normal or negative. Serologic tests were negative for Borrelia burgdorferi and Toxoplasma gondii and revealed no other acute or recent viral infection including CMV, EBV, adenovirus, parvovirus, mumps, and rubella. A stool culture was not done due to the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. HLA typing was not done. The patient was treated with ibuprofen (200–400 mg orally three times daily) and physical therapy. After initial improvement, she presented six weeks later with worsening pain, redness and swelling of the left first metatarsophalangeal joint. Intra-articular injection of 6 mg triamcinolone-hexacetonide led to resolution of symptoms. The patient discontinued taking the ibuprofen one month later. When seen three months after the injection, she was without complaints and had a normal musculoskeletal exam. At 18 months follow up she continues to be free of symptoms.

### One-bone tarsus: a case report [^9b5721d5]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Tarsal coalition is a condition characterized by abnormal connections between ≥ 2 tarsi. Although tarsal coalition is not rare, tarsal coalitions involving > 2 tarsi are very unusual. In this report, we describe a case of multiple tarsal coalitions in a 24-year-old male who experienced progressively worsening pain for 3 to 4 months before presenting for care. This case was unique in that all the tarsal and tarsometatarsal bones in the foot were fused and formed 1 integrated tarsal. All of the metatarsals were fused as well, and the patient had no joints or ranges of motion in the hindfoot or midfoot. The patient's pain was responsive to anti-inflammatory medications, and no surgical intervention was necessary. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most extensive case of multiple tarsal coalitions described in the literature to date.

A 45-year-old man presented with severe pinch-point crush injury to his left foot. Plain radiographs revealed dislocation of the first metatarsophalangeal joint and dorsolateral dislocation of the basal phalanx and sesamoids. The first tarsometatarsal joint was subluxed in the plantar direction and the second to fourth tarsometatarsal joints were subluxed dorsally. The sesamoids were displaced dorsolateral to the metatarsal head. There was a longitudinal tear of the joint capsule at the medial margin of the medial sesamoid, which was sutured together with the abductor hallucis tendon and collateral ligament. The Lisfranc and dorsal ligaments in the tarsometatarsal joint were torn and repaired after reduction and fixed with a plate. One year after surgery, there was contracture of the first metatarsophalangeal joint, but the patient had no pain and was able to run.

### Diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-associated liver diseases: 2019 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^02ad44dd]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol-associated liver disease — clinical presentation and AUD recognition: There is no unique presentation of ALD that can be distinguished with confidence from other forms of liver disease, and alcohol use is often not disclosed by the affected patient, whereas liver injury, whether due to alcohol or other causes, often proceeds silently. Although not all patients with ALD meet the criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD), failure to recognize AUD remains a significant clinical problem, and providers need to have a high index of suspicion for AUD in patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms and signs given in Table 6. Table 6 lists symptoms such as odor of alcohol on breath, tiredness, abdominal pain, day/night reversal (sleepy by day; wakeful at night), peripheral neuropathy, weight gain (due to ascites), weight loss (due to loss of proximal muscle mass), confusion (as part of hepatic encephalopathy), loss of sexual drive, and amenorrhea, and signs including spider angioma, palmar erythema, leukonychia, ecchymoses, icteric conjunctivae, loss of proximal muscle mass, systemic hypotension; tachycardia suggests alcohol withdrawal syndrome, ascites, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, bruises, gynecomastia, gonadal atrophy in men, neurological findings of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (fine tremor, psychomotor agitation, transient hallucinations or illusions) and hepatic encephalopathy (coarse flapping tremor [asterixis], altered consciousness), as well as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and Dupuytren's contracture.

### A patient with a purple, edematous great toe [^25dce5b4]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Cryoglobulinemia – Incorrect. Waldenström macroglobulinemia can lead to type I cryoglobulinemia with cutaneous manifestations, including retiform purpura on areas such as acral sites, ulcers, infarction, and hemorrhagic crusts. However, histopathologic findings typically show vasculitis or noninflammatory hyaline thrombosis. These features are inconsistent with this patient's biopsy.
B. Atypical mycobacterial infection – Incorrect. Infection is a consideration given his history of Waldenström macroglobulinemia. However, the biopsy lacks necrotizing granulomas or organisms, which would be expected in an infectious process.
C. Gout – Incorrect. While the great toe is a common location for gout, it typically presents as acute, painful monoarthritis with monosodium urate crystal deposition. Histology would show amorphous crystalline deposits with a foreign-body granulomatous reaction, which is inconsistent with this patient's chronic history and biopsy findings.
D. Sarcoidosis – Correct. While the clinical presentation of a violaceous, swollen toe with nail dystrophy is not specific for sarcoidosis, the presence of noncaseating granulomas on histopathology, along with the patient's known history of systemic sarcoidosis, strongly supports this diagnosis. Specifically, this presentation suggests sarcoid dactylitis, a rare manifestation occurring in approximately 0.2% of all sarcoidosis cases, typically involving the digits with swelling, pain, and discoloration.
E. Kaposi sarcoma – Incorrect. While Kaposi sarcoma often presents as violaceous plaques or nodules on the distal extremities, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, histopathology would typically reveal spindle cell and vascular proliferation, features not observed in this case.

### Acute-onset, painful, acral granuloma annulare in a 52-year-old female [^3651579b]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

AOPAGA was first described by Brey et alin 2006. This rare variant of localized GA is characterized by the abrupt formation of tender papules and annular plaques primarily on the hands and feet. In our patient, a diagnosis of AOPAGA was made via clinicopathological correlation.

While GA commonly involves the dorsal hands/feet, the volar/glabrous surfaces are typically spared. Formation of GA lesions on palmar skin, as seen in our patient, is exceptionally rare. Among the 4 cases included in the original description of AOPAGA, Brey et al reported 2 patients with lesions on the palms. Including this case report's patient, 18 AOPAGA cases have now been reported, with 14 cases noting AOPAGA involvement of volar/glabrous hand skin (eg, palms, fingertips) and 9 cases reporting AOPAGA exclusively on volar/glabrous hand skin (Table I).,

Table I
Summary of AOPAGA cases

We hypothesize that the propensity of AOPAGA to exclusively appear on volar/glabrous hand skin (50% of AOPAGA cases) suggests an environmental trigger may initiate AOPAGA. Further, we hypothesize that the high level of sensory innervation in volar/glabrous skin underlies the unique painful presentation of AOPAGA. Other subtypes of GA are typically asymptomatic or only mildly painful/pruritic. Systemic symptoms (eg, arthralgias, myalgias) have been observed in 5 of the 18 AOPAGA patients (Table I), which has previously led to the hypothesis that this condition represented an early manifestation of autoimmune disease. Our patient's progressive ankle and distal interphalangeal joint pain temporally coincided with the development of her palmar lesions, but no other evidence of autoimmune disease was identified. Most AOPAGA cases have not reported systemic symptoms or autoimmune disease, though 11% of AOPAGA patients had a history of iron-deficiency anemia and 17% of AOPAGA patients had lymphoma.

### Gait improvement and ulcer prevention with second-to-great toe transposition at the donor site: a case report [^f5328a43]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

A young male patient, who sustained a severe burn injury 6 years ago, received amputation of left hand at the level of metacarpal shaft of the thumb and base of proximal phalanxes of the rest of the fingers. Staged operations, including combined second- and third-toe transfer from the right foot to middle and ring fingers of the left hand, and harvest of great toe from the left foot for reconstruction of left thumb, were successively executed. Unfortunately, callus and ulcer were found at the plantar area of first metatarsophalangeal joint of left donor foot in the following 2 years, which caused troublesome disturbance during ambulation. We hereby present how second toe transposition can decrease the donor foot pain and prevent the recurrence of plantar ulcer after 21 months of follow-up.

### IgA vasculitis triggered by alcohol consumption in a 51-year-old man: a case report [^8ef3d4d9]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Report

An otherwise healthy 51-year-old man presented to the dermatologist for a petechial rash on both lower extremities and groin area. The patient noted that the night before the exanthem developed, he had consumed beverages containing distilled alcohol. The associated symptoms included both ankle swelling and pain. The patient was taking tramadol, as needed, for back pain. The review of systems was negative for other signs of systemic disease.

On cutaneous examination, multiple nonblanchable, dark-red macules, consistent with petechiae, were scattered on both lower extremities, suprapubic area, penis, and scrotum. Areas of necrotic ulceration were present on the left distal extremity (Fig 1, A). There was also marked edema of both ankles.

Fig 1
A, The patient first presented with dark-red macules scattered on both lower extremities, with areas of necrotic ulceration on the left distal extremity. Edema of both ankles can be visualized. B, The patient presented 3 months later due to a recurrence of the petechial exanthem on both lower extremities with new-onset pruritus.

Punch biopsies were taken from the affected areas. An histologic evaluation demonstrated a neutrophilic dermatitis with the obliteration of small dermal vessels, erythrocyte extravasation, and deposition of fibrin and nuclear dust (Fig 2). Direct immunofluorescence studies demonstrated granular, perivascular IgA deposition.
