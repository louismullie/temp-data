## Question

For a homebound patient, can a KUB without contrast demonstrate the placement of a tube or a fistula?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a KUB without contrast can demonstrate the placement of a tube or a fistula in a homebound patient. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a KUB actually shows and how portable bedside radiography applies here. Then, I should verify the evidence for using plain radiographs to confirm various tube positions. Next, I will examine whether a non-contrast KUB can identify a fistula and what imaging is required for definitive leak/fistula diagnosis. Finally, I need to consider practical options and contrast-risk decisions for a homebound patient, including any bedside alternatives if transport is difficult [^113M1Lmy].

> Let me first confirm the modality and clinical context. A KUB is a plain abdominal radiograph without intravenous contrast; it is readily obtainable as a portable bedside study, which makes it particularly feasible in homebound or non-transportable patients, though image quality and coverage must still meet diagnostic needs, and optimized bedside protocols can preserve diagnostic utility while minimizing dose [^113M1Lmy] [^111Rjw62].

> Now, I need to check whether non-contrast KUB can verify tube placement. Radiopaque devices such as ureteral stents and other urologic hardware are directly visible on plain abdominal radiographs and often show characteristic configurations, allowing confirmation of position on KUB; for example, stent positioning with expected proximal and distal coil locations is well depicted on standard X-ray images [^114JiEiS]. Wait, let me verify enteric tube data as well: multiple series demonstrate that bedside abdominal radiographs are the reference confirmation method for feeding tube position, with high diagnostic yield using optimized techniques or even single-view approaches when appropriate, supporting KUB's role in tube verification at the bedside [^114DKSZE] [^112qMhYf] [^113M1Lmy]. I should also confirm concordance data showing strong agreement between alternative visualization technologies and KUB confirmation, reinforcing that radiographs remain the practical standard for final verification in most settings [^117Svk2F] [^113aGuFH] [^117NW8UK].

> Hold on, I should verify limitations and when to escalate beyond a plain KUB for tubes. Although many tubes are radiopaque and readily confirmed, some situations still require contrast-enhanced confirmation under fluoroscopy or CT, especially when malposition is suspected, anatomy is altered, or when verifying luminal patency rather than just anatomic location; indeed, urologic and interventional workflows frequently rely on contrast pyelography or nephrostography to confirm final placement and patency when ultrasound alone is insufficient [^1122Qo6U] [^114vBCZQ]. Let me reconsider the two-view issue as well: while two views can improve certainty, emerging evidence suggests that a single AP view often suffices for certain enteric tube positions, but this must be balanced against clinical risk and the specific device being evaluated [^112qMhYf].

> Next, I should review whether a non-contrast KUB can demonstrate a fistula. Hmm, wait a minute, diagnosing a urinary fistula generally requires demonstrating a tract or active extravasation, which mandates contrast opacification; a non-contrast KUB lacks the ability to depict contrast leak and therefore is not adequate for definitive fistula diagnosis [^112JwwUd]. I need to ensure I cite the appropriate standards: guideline-based pathways consistently recommend contrast-enhanced CT with excretory/delayed phase for ureteral or urinary leaks and ureteral injuries, or formal retrograde cystography for bladder injuries, because these techniques demonstrate extravasation and delineate the tract, which a non-contrast KUB cannot do [^115uyTQD] [^111Qru1o] [^1147DxHB]. I should double-check postoperative and nonlocalized abdominal pain guidance as well, which similarly endorses contrast-enhanced CT to evaluate for postoperative leaks and abscesses, again underscoring the need for contrast-based imaging to confirm a fistula [^1158fzNi].

> But wait, what if the fistula involves the upper tract after kidney surgery or trauma; do we still need contrast to confirm resolution or persistence? Yes, case series and guideline recommendations emphasize using contrast CT urography or MRI sequences to confirm healing or ongoing leakage, not plain radiographs; in other words, KUB may show indirect clues but cannot depict extravasation or the fistulous path required for diagnosis or follow-up [^116w98HF] [^112JwwUd]. I should confirm the paired trauma guidance too, which calls for contrast-enhanced CT with delayed imaging for suspected ureteral injury and recommends drainage when persistent urinary leak is present, all predicated on contrast-based detection of leakage rather than non-contrast radiographs [^112WkUft] [^112UJefz] [^113Xr4mi].

> Now, let me consider the homebound context and contrast risk decisions. If a fistula is suspected and the patient is homebound, transport for contrast-enhanced CT urography or formal cystography may still be required for a definitive diagnosis; contrast decisions should weigh eGFR and AKI status, but contemporary guidance supports proceeding with indicated iodinated contrast imaging when risk is acceptable, avoiding under-dosing that compromises diagnostic yield, and using shared decision-making for eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or suspected AKI [^1112wAcS] [^115smFd6] [^1115pgdf] [^115iuB3g]. I should also verify alternatives in patients who cannot receive iodinated contrast or when access is constrained; MR urography may be considered in selected patients with adequate GFR and can be performed without gadolinium in some scenarios, though sensitivity is reduced, reinforcing that even alternative pathways still rely on contrast-based or excretory-phase imaging to confirm leaks, not plain KUB [^113veqwv] [^113orMDL].

> I will now examine potential bedside adjuncts when fluoroscopy is unavailable. Endocavitary or nephrostomy-based contrast-enhanced ultrasound can, in certain settings, delineate ureteral patency or even a leak or fistulous connection, showing high concordance with fluoroscopic nephrostograms; this can be a pragmatic, radiation-free problem-solving tool at the bedside, though availability and operator expertise vary and these techniques are not a replacement for guideline-mandated CT urography when definitive mapping is needed [^115PtD7d] [^111pBULj]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; even with CEUS adjuncts, if clinical stakes are high, arranging transport for formal contrast-enhanced imaging remains the standard for diagnosis and pre-intervention planning in suspected urinary fistulae [^115uyTQD] [^111Qru1o] [^112JwwUd].

> Bottom line, I should confirm the final stance clearly. For tube placement verification in a homebound patient, a non-contrast KUB is appropriate and can reliably demonstrate the position of radiopaque devices such as ureteral stents, nephrostomy tubes, and feeding tubes, making it a practical first-line option at the bedside [^114JiEiS] [^114DKSZE] [^112qMhYf] [^113M1Lmy]. For fistula detection, a non-contrast KUB is insufficient; definitive diagnosis requires contrast-enhanced imaging such as CT urography with delayed excretory phase or formal cystography, with modality selection tailored to the suspected site of leakage and patient factors, even if this necessitates transport from the home setting [^115uyTQD] [^112JwwUd] [^111Qru1o] [^1158fzNi].

Yes. A KUB without contrast can **confirm placement of radiopaque tubes** (e.g. Foley, nephrostomy, ureteral stents, NG/OG, feeding tubes) [^113M1Lmy] [^112qMhYf] and detect radiopaque foreign bodies or stones [^113GJxZG]. However, it does not reliably detect non-radiopaque tubes, soft-tissue catheters, or **fistulas** [^112JwwUd], and it cannot assess tube patency or function [^115PtD7d]. For homebound patients, KUB is a practical, low-risk bedside option; if a fistula is suspected or a more detailed assessment is needed, arrange contrast studies or ultrasound when feasible [^1158fzNi] [^115uyTQD].

## Tubes and devices visible on KUB without contrast

KUB radiographs can **confirm placement of radiopaque tubes** and devices, including:

- **Foley catheters**: Radiopaque balloon/marker visible in bladder.

- **Nephrostomy tubes**: Radiopaque markers/side holes visible in renal pelvis [^115PtD7d].

- **Ureteral stents**: Radiopaque double-J configuration visible from renal pelvis to bladder [^114JiEiS].

- **Nasogastric (NG) and orogastric (OG) tubes**: Radiopaque strip visible from esophagus to stomach [^112qMhYf].

- **Feeding tubes**: Radiopaque markers/strips visible in gastrointestinal tract [^117NW8UK].

- **Foreign bodies or stones**: Radiopaque objects visible in urinary tract [^114nSXUw].

---

## Limitations of KUB without contrast

KUB without contrast has **important limitations**:

- **Non-radiopaque tubes**: Silicone or polyurethane catheters may not be visible.

- **Soft-tissue catheters**: Suprapubic or peritoneal catheters may not be visible.

- **Fistulas**: Cannot reliably detect urinary or enteric fistulas without contrast [^112JwwUd].

- **Tube patency**: Cannot assess function or patency [^111pBULj].

- **Small structures**: Limited sensitivity for small or subtle abnormalities [^111MQpeu].

---

## Alternative imaging modalities for homebound patients

For homebound patients, **consider these alternatives**:

- **Ultrasound**: Bedside assessment of hydronephrosis, fluid collections, and some catheters; no radiation [^114vBCZQ].

- **Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)**: Bedside assessment of ureteral patency and leaks [^115PtD7d]; no ionizing radiation [^111pBULj].

- **Portable CT**: Limited availability; higher sensitivity for small structures and fistulas [^1158fzNi].

- **MRI**: No radiation; limited availability and longer scan times [^113veqwv].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines support using KUB to confirm radiopaque tube placement but **recommend contrast-enhanced CT or MRI when a fistula is suspected** [^112JwwUd] or a detailed assessment is needed [^1158fzNi]. For homebound patients, KUB is practical and low risk; consider alternative imaging when feasible.

---

## Practical considerations for homebound patients

For homebound patients, KUB is practical — it allows portable bedside radiography [^111Rjw62], involves minimal radiation without contrast [^113M1Lmy], and costs less than CT or MRI. However, its **limited sensitivity may miss non-radiopaque tubes or small abnormalities** [^111MQpeu], and it provides no functional assessment; patency or leaks cannot be evaluated [^115PtD7d].

## Summary table: visibility of tubes and fistulas on KUB without contrast

| **Structure** | **Visibility on KUB without contrast** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|
| Radiopaque tubes (Foley, nephrostomy, ureteral stents, NG/OG, feeding tubes) | Visible | Radiopaque markers/strips clearly visible [^113M1Lmy] |
| Non-radiopaque tubes (silicone, polyurethane catheters) | Not visible | Alternative imaging required |
| Soft-tissue catheters (suprapubic, peritoneal) | Not visible | Alternative imaging required |
| Urinary or enteric fistulas | Not visible | Contrast-enhanced imaging required [^112JwwUd] |
| Foreign bodies or stones | Visible if radiopaque | Radiopaque objects clearly visible [^113GJxZG] |

---

KUB without contrast is useful for confirming **radiopaque tube placement** in homebound patients [^113M1Lmy], but it **cannot detect non-radiopaque tubes or fistulas** [^112JwwUd]. Use alternative imaging when a detailed assessment is needed [^1158fzNi].

Internal ureteral stents have become an integral part of urologic practice to relieve intrinsic as well as extrinsic upper urinary tract obstruction. Missed internal ureteral stents are a serious potential complication that is associated with increased patient morbidity. This issue is especially prevalent in developing countries due to poor patient compliance, lack of understanding, and inadequate administration of stent registries. Diagnosis of forgotten ureteral stents is usually straightforward with standard imaging. Here, we report a case where the forgotten stent was missed on ultrasound and computed tomography but was identified on a plain radiograph. This case thereby emphasizes the still relevant role of plain radiographs in the evaluation of stone disease.

### A clinically optimal protocol for the imaging of enteric tubes: On the basis of radiologist interpreted diagnostic utility and radiation dose reduction [^113M1Lmy]. Academic Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a patient thickness-based protocol specifically for the confirmation of enteric tube placements in bedside abdominal radiographs. Protocol techniques were set to maintain image quality while minimizing patient dose.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 226 pre-intervention radiographs were obtained to serve as a baseline cohort for comparison. After the implementation of a thickness-based protocol, a total of 229 radiographs were obtained as part of an intervention cohort. Radiographs were randomized and graded for diagnostic quality by seven expert radiologists based on a standardized conspicuity scale (grades: 0 non-diagnostic to 3+). Basic patient demographics, body mass index, ventilatory status, and enteric tube type were recorded and subgroup analyses were performed. Effective dose was estimated for both cohorts.

- **Results**: The dedicated thickness-based protocol resulted in a significant reduction in effective dose of 80% (p-value < 0.01). There was no significant difference in diagnostic quality between the two cohorts with 209 (92.5%) diagnostic radiographs in the baseline and 221 (96.5%) diagnostic radiographs in the thickness-based protocol (p-value 0.06).

- **Conclusion**: A protocol optimized for the confirmation of enteric tube placements was developed. This protocol results in lower patient effective dose without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy. The technique chart is provided for reference. The protocol development process outlined in this work could be readily generalized to other imaging modalities.

### Nasoduodenal tube placement: Are two views necessary to confirm position [^112qMhYf]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Nasoduodenal tube (NDT) placement is typically performed at the bedside, and two-view abdominal radiographs are usually used to confirm tube position. Anecdotally, in most instances, the lateral view is unnecessary and utilizes more than twice the radiation than an anteroposterior (AP) view alone.

- **Objective**: We hypothesize that NDT location can be determined using only the AP view, with the NDT position determined on two views utilized as the gold standard.

- **Materials and methods**: A search was performed for all two- or three-view abdominal radiographs from September 2012 to September 2013 with the phrase "ND tube" in the reason field of the requisition. These studies were independently reviewed by two radiologists and scored for anatomical tube position in three different scenarios: AP view alone, the lateral view alone, and both views together, with the latter serving as the gold standard. The anatomical scores were subsequently grouped to reflect clinically significant scenarios. Comparative analysis was performed with the original and clinically grouped scores.

- **Results**: A total of 102 patients and 306 separate two-view exams were evaluated. Of the 102 patients, 55 had at least two separate exams. Across raters, concordances of AP and lateral scores relative to the gold standard assessment were 88% and 73% for anatomical scores, and 91.5% and 86.4% for clinically grouped data. Trend differences for fewer errors were found with the AP compared to the lateral view. There were statistically significant group differences with a greater number of false-negative errors.

### A case of urinary bladder agenesis and bilateral ectopic ureters: A case report [^114FNZsQ]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

She presented three weeks later to our emergency department with AKI, ascites, and left ureterostomy obstruction. At presentation, the ureterostomies were nonfunctional, and the insertion of the nephrostomy tube was deemed impossible according to the interventional radiologist. Therefore, surgical exploration of the left side (the only functioning side) was performed, revealing complete ureteral necrosis and a 1-cm segment of renal pelvis remaining. This renal pelvis remnant was open to the peritoneal cavity, and there was intraperitoneal urine leakage. The left renal pelvis was then closed after leaving a nephrostomy tube in place for drainage. No intraoperative or postoperative bleeding was encountered. The nephrostomy tube then became complicated by frequent blockage, leakage, and infection with difficult reinsertions.

The patient received several types of antibiotics throughout her hospital stay for her reUTIs, including trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, fluconazole, caspofungin, ceftazidime, colistin, nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin.

The patient's renal function declined slowly, and at the age of 11 months, she had evidence of chronic kidney disease associated with high creatinine, hyperphosphatemia, metabolic acidosis, and anemia.

### Metachronous renal vein and artery injure after percutaneous nephrostolithotomy [^116x4CwJ]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Percutaneous nephrostolithotomy is an important approach for kidney stones removal. A percutaneous nephrostomy drainage tube placement is an effective method to stop venous bleeding. Occasionally, the catheter can pierce into the renal parenchyma and migrate into the renal vein, even reaching the vena cava.

- **Case presentation**: A 66-year-old woman underwent a percutaneous nephrostolithotomy for a kidney staghorn stone, complicating severe bleeding. Computed tomography angiography showed the percutaneous nephrostomy drainage tube inside the renal vein. The percutaneous nephrostomy drainage tube was withdrawn 3 cm back to the renal parenchyma/sinus/pelvis in stages, with the surgical team on standby. Seven days later, the patient developed severe hematuria. Computed tomography angiography demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm located near the percutaneous nephrostomy drainage tube. The pseudoaneurysm was embolized successfully.

- **Conclusion**: Our case shows intravenous misplacement of the nephrostomy tube and subsequent pseudoaneurysm after percutaneous nephrostolithotomy. To our knowledge, this seems to be the first documentation of major bleeding from the injury to both renal vein and artery. The percutaneous nephrostomy drainage tube can be withdrawn back to the renal parenchyma/sinus/pelvis in stages with the surgical team on standby, and the withdrawn distance may vary according to patient and catheter position.

### Clinical characteristics of ureteral calculi detected by nonenhanced computerized tomography after unclear results of plain radiography and ultrasonography [^1177aDmB]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Prospective non-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) was performed for patients presenting with renal colic and showing negative or equivocal results on plain x-ray of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) as well as ultrasonography (US) to evaluate the usefulness of plain CT. We also evaluated the clinical characteristics of urinary calculi detected under such conditions.

Between January 2000 and June 2002, 560 patients presented with acute unilateral renal colic. Of these patients, 238 who were negative or equivocal for ureteral calculus on KUB and US underwent non-enhanced CT. The diagnostic value of plain CT in patients with negative or equivocal KUB and US was determined, and results and other clinical findings were compared. Clinical characteristics of ureteral stones detected by plain CT were compared with those of stones diagnosed by KUB and US.

By plain CT, 143 (60.1%) and 6 (2.5%) cases of pain were determined to have been caused by ureteral stones and other pathogeneses, respectively. No definitive diagnosis was obtained in 89 (37.4%) of cases. Stone size detected by plain CT was significantly smaller than controls (3.77 vs. 6.37 mm, p < 0.0001) and tended to be located in the middle or lower ureter (76.2% or 109 of 143 vs. 52.2% or 168 of 322, p < 0.0001). Symptoms spontaneously improved in 137 (95.8%) of patients after conservative therapy, while 6 underwent intervention, a rate significantly lower (p < 0.0001) than controls (32.9% or 106 of 322).

Non-enhanced CT is a useful modality for the diagnosis of patients presenting with acute renal colic.

### Extrapulmonary tuberculosis: An old but resurgent problem [^115pre1V]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

Thickening of the ureter wall is observed in acute TB involvement, while strictures in the lumen and a shortening of the ureter are detected in chronic TB involvement (Fig. 37).

Fig. 37: Axial (a) and coronal (b) non-contrast CT scan of a 74-year-old male with urinary tuberculosis reveal debris collection within the dilated right renal pelvis and dilated right ureter with diffuse wall thickening. 3D MIP Coronal T2-weighted MR urogram shows strictures (arrows) of the right ureter.

- **Urinary bladder TB**: Urinary bladder involvement is caused by the spread of the infection from the kidneys. Bladder wall thickening, ulceration, and filling defects due to granulomatous material are observed in acute TB (Fig. 38), while decreased bladder capacity and irregular and calcified appearances in bladder contours indicate chronic TB. Fibrotic changes can also cause hydroureteronephrosis.

Fig. 38: A 47-year-old male. Coronal post-contrast CT scan shows diffuse thickening of the bladder wall (arrow) and dilated left proximal ureter (arrowheads).

- **Involvement of the genital organs**: Genital TB affects both men and women and can cause infertility. Involvement of the prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymis, and testicles can be seen in men, while women can present with ovary, fallopian tube, and endometrium involvement. Primary genital TB can develop in women's cervix, vagina, or vulva. The transmission route can be through infected semen from male partners with active genitourinary TB or through sputum used as a sexual lubricant by their partners with pulmonary TB.

### Canadian Association of Radiologists guidance on contrast-associated acute kidney injury [^1115pgdf]. Canadian Journal of Kidney Health and Disease (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for acute kidney injury, specifically the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy, the CAR 2022 guidelines recommend restricting contrast medium use. It is suggested to obtain indicated contrast imaging if the eGFR is greater than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² and there are no signs or symptoms of AKI in non-emergent, stable outpatients, inpatients, and emergency patients when eGFR is available. An individual patient decision should involve the caring team or patient/patient decision-maker to explain and balance the risks of contrast-associated AKI against the risks and uncertainties of delayed or suboptimal imaging when the eGFR is 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or less, or if AKI is suspected.

### Urotrauma: AUA guideline [^115Y24ck]. The Journal of Urology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for kidney trauma, particularly concerning nonoperative management, the AUA 2014 guidelines recommend performing urinary drainage in the presence of complications such as enlarging urinoma, fever, increasing pain, ileus, fistula, or infection. Perform the drainage via ureteral stenting and consider augmenting it with a percutaneous urinoma drain, percutaneous nephrostomy, or both.

### Modified Whitaker test: A novel diagnostic for nephroptosis [^1156hzvb]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Five weeks following the initial presentation, a community urologist performed a cystoscopy with a right retrograde urogram and attempted ureteroscopy. A tortuous ureter was noted, and the renal pelvis was not visualized; a double-J stent was placed, and she was referred to our urologic service.

She presented to the University of Virginia urology clinic seven weeks after the initial presentation. With the stent in place, she reported nearly constant pain that limited her ability to complete daily 5-mile walks. The intensity of the pain was exacerbated by movement but was not affected by hydration. One week later, she underwent right ureteroscopy with ureteral stent removal and the placement of a right percutaneous nephrostomy tube that alleviated her pain. She was scheduled for a Whitaker test.

The patient returned in two weeks for a Whitaker test of the right renal pelvis and ureter, facilitated by the nephrostomy tube still in place. She was placed in a supine position, and dilute contrast was infused at a rate of 8 mL/min. Once 60 mL of contrast was infused into the renal pelvis, the patient reported mild flank discomfort and fullness. The differential pressure between the renal pelvis and bladder was 15 cm of water, below the 20–22 cm of water cut-off for a diagnosis of obstruction. The patient was then placed in a reverse Trendelenburg position (45°) with continued perfusion of 8 mL/min. At this point, the differential pressure rose to 24 cm of water, and she reported intense flank pain. This dynamic study demonstrated positional-dependent obstruction via differential pressures.

### Intra-ureteric placement of a urinary catheter in the previously undiagnosed duplex ureter [^112p8XWH]. International Urogynecology Journal (2014). Low credibility.

We report the inadvertent insertion of a urinary catheter into the upper moiety ureter of a duplex kidney in a full-term pregnant woman prior to an emergency caesarean section. The patient complained of severe pain during the inflation of the catheter balloon. All measures to deflate the balloon and remove the catheter failed. Retrograde ureteric contrast examination showed the placement of the catheter in the proximal part of the right upper moiety ureter of a duplex ureter. The catheter was removed with ureteroscopic forceps. We concluded that congenital variation of the urinary tract can complicate a simple catheterisation.

### Impact of colloidal fluid on stent failure under extrinsic ureteral obstruction: An experimental study [^113PGGsf]. Journal of Endourology (2020). Low credibility.

Drainage of an obstructed kidney due to extrinsic ureteral obstruction (EUO) is imperative. Ureteral stents, commonly employed to facilitate drainage, often fail under EUO. This is usually attributed to external pressure over the ureter that occludes the stent lumen. We have shown previously that external pressure and deformation of the ureter alone cannot explain frequent stent failure, and we speculated that colloids present in urine may play a critical synergetic role. In this study, we evaluate the role of colloidal fluid in ureteral obstruction under extrinsic compression.

- **Materials and methods**: An in vitro ureter-stent model was employed using a latex tube to simulate a flexible ureter connecting simulated glass kidney and bladder units. The ureter was placed in a deformed configuration of 40° with external pressure of 2000 g exerted over the deformed region of the stented ureter, representing extrinsic pressure. Four different ureteral stents were tested: 4.8F, 6F, 7F, and 8F. A colloidal solution based on chicken albumin was injected through the simulated kidney into the stented ureter. Four replicates were performed for each stent diameter, and straight stented ureters with no external pressure were used as controls. Stent failure was defined as kidney unit pressure over 10 cm H₂O or complete obstruction of fluid flow; time to stent failure was measured.

- **Results**: Average failure time in 4.8F and 6F stents was 44 and 66 hours, respectively. The 7F ureteral stent failed in two replicates, after an average time of 75 hours, and continued to drain in the others.

### Diagnosis of medullary sponge kidney by computed tomographic urography [^114pUuij]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of medullary sponge kidney traditionally was established by means of intravenous pyelography. Beginning in the mid-1990s, intravenous pyelography rapidly was supplanted by computed axial tomography as the preferred imaging study for evaluating patients with renal stone disease. Conventional computed tomographic imaging has not been satisfactory for diagnosing medullary sponge kidney. The introduction of multidetector-row computed tomography in 1999 allowed radiologists to acquire images composed of elements allowing the creation of high-resolution 3-dimensional displays. Computed tomographic urography is an imaging technique that provides both cross-sectional displays and images of the contrast-filled renal collecting systems, ureters, and urinary bladder that are equivalent to intravenous pyelography. We report a case of medullary sponge kidney diagnosed by means of 3-dimensional multidetector-row computed tomographic urography.

### Metachronous renal vein and artery injure after percutaneous nephrostolithotomy [^111fvjNW]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Axial contrast-enhanced CT and volume rendering images of CT angiography demonstrate critical findings post-nephrostomy. Specifically, images A-B exhibit a percutaneous nephrostomy drainage tube inside the left renal vein, while images C-D reveal the drainage tube situated inside the left renal pelvis after staged withdrawal.

On the eighth post-operative day, the patient experienced significant symptoms, including gross hematuria and severe left loin pain. Notably, a considerable hemoglobin level drop was detected, from 9.3 g/dL to 6.8 g/dL, despite the patient maintaining hemodynamic stability and normal coagulation parameters. An abdominal computed tomography scan identified a large left perinephric hematoma. Initial conservative treatment, consisting of bed rest and transfusions, was implemented but proved ineffective as gross hematuria persisted. Subsequently, a computed tomography angiography was conducted, revealing a pseudoaneurysm in the left renal artery. To manage the bleeding, a selective left renal angiogram was performed to facilitate endovascular control. This angiogram confirmed active bleeding from a pseudoaneurysm branch of the left renal artery, evidenced by contrast extravasation. Two 2 mm x 2 cm metal coils were used for selective embolization of the bleeding site. Within twenty-four hours, hematuria resolved, and the patient remained hemodynamically stable.

### Outcomes of nephrostomy and double J stent in malignant ureteral obstruction in the Palestinian practice [^1122Qo6U]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Decompressive interventions**: In DJS, a flexible stent is placed within the ureter to alleviate obstruction and facilitate urine flow from the kidney to the bladder. The technique often involves a cystoscopic insertion, where a guidewire is navigated through the urethra into the bladder and then up into the ureter. The stent is advanced over the guidewire, ensuring proper placement in the renal pelvis and bladder, all while the patient is under general anesthesia and in the lithotomy position.

	- In some patients, fluoroscopic-guided stenting was used instead of cystoscopy. This technique uses real-time X-ray guidance to position the DJS accurately within the ureter. After placing a guidewire through the urethra into the bladder, the stent is advanced over the guidewire under fluoroscopic visualization to confirm proper positioning.

	- In cases where ultrasound placement is unsuccessful, patients undergo PCN via ultrasound-guided puncture with an 18-fr needle, followed by the insertion of a guidewire. A catheter is then placed directly into the renal pelvis through the skin. When the PCN was the primary decompressive intervention, it was performed under local anesthesia and the placement was confirmed by a final pyelography using iodine contrast medium.

### Diagnostic value of chest radiographs in bedridden patients suspected of having pneumonia [^111Rjw62]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

To assess the diagnostic value of the chest radiograph for diagnosing pneumonia in bedridden patients, we used non-contrast-enhanced high-resolution chest computed tomography (CT) as the gold standard.

- **Methods**: We prospectively evaluated bedridden patients hospitalized with a moderate to high clinical probability of pneumonia. Chest radiographs were interpreted in a blinded fashion by three observers and classified as definite, normal, or uncertain for pneumonia. Chest CT was obtained within 12 hours of obtaining the chest radiograph. Bayesian analysis was applied to assess the accuracy of chest radiographs in diagnosing pneumonia.

- **Results**: Over a 5-month period, 58 patients were evaluated, of whom 31 (53%) were female. Chest radiographs were interpreted as negative, uncertain, or positive for pneumonia in 31 (53%), 15 (26%), and 12 (21%) patients, respectively, while CT confirmed pneumonia in 11 (35%), 10 (67%), and 10 (83%) of these cases, respectively. The sensitivity of the chest radiograph to diagnose pneumonia was 65%, the specificity was 93%, and the positive and negative predictive values were 83% and 65%, respectively. The overall accuracy was 69% (95% confidence interval, 50%-79%).

- **Conclusions**: In bedridden patients with suspected pneumonia, a normal chest radiograph does not rule out the diagnosis; hence, a chest CT scan might provide valuable diagnostic information.

### Unusual stent after ureteral substitution. A first case [^114JiEiS]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

A 59-year-old woman was admitted for recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI). Her past history includes right hip prosthesis and hysterectomy for cervical cancer at age 56, followed by radiotherapy. At age 58, an extensive stricture of the left ureter was treated with ileal loop substitution in a General Surgery setting, as the patient resides in a peripheral area with first-level hospitals. This procedure was performed by a general surgeon instead of a urologist. Three months later, due to worsening of left hydronephrosis, the patient underwent pyeloplasty with the placement of a 'stent' of unknown characteristics using a flank approach. Ten months after the second procedure, the patient was evaluated at our institution for recurrent UTI and fever, with irritative bladder symptoms such as frequency and urge incontinence. Her serum creatinine was 1 mg/dL, and a urine culture revealed over 1 million E. coli colony forming units per mL.

As a second step, a plain X-ray of the abdomen was performed, which showed the presence of a stent-like radiopaque device on the left side with its upper part projecting onto the left kidney area and three short interruptions at its proximal third. Furthermore, a renal scintigraphy revealed severely reduced (10%) left kidney function.

- **Figure 1 description**: Abdominal X-ray showing a radiopaque stent in the left collecting system; the upper extremity appears uncoiled, with two short interruptions at the proximal third, while the lower extremity forms a wide coil inside the bladder.

Within the ITT population, there was 1 subject who did not undergo a KUB because of an adverse event (unrelated to FT placement) that led to death before the image could be obtained. No subjects' radiographs were inconclusive regarding the final placement location; therefore, no subjects underwent radiograph with contrast media.

Agreement between the IRIS placement location and KUB confirmation occurred in 40 instances (93.0%), which was statistically significant (Cohen's κ = 0.3645; p = 0.014). As stated, during the initial training cases period, 1 subject's FT was discovered to be coiled in the pharynx (2.1%) on x‐ray. In the other cases of disagreement, 2 cases were read as in "stomach" via camera visualization but were determined to be "small bowel" via x‐ray. These tubes may also have migrated to the small bowel before confirmatory x‐ray. Finally, 1 tube was read as "postpyloric" via camera visualization; however, subsequent confirmatory x‐ray was read as "downstream antrum/proximal pylorus", which may have also occurred due to tube movement after placement.

### CT urography [^111MQpeu]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

With the advent of multi-detector row CT scanners, evaluation of the urothelium of the entire urinary tract with high-resolution thin sections during a single breath-hold has become a reality. Multidetector CT urography (MDCTU) is a single examination that allows evaluation of potential urinary tract calculi, renal parenchymal masses, and both benign and malignant urothelial lesions. Initial results with this new technique are encouraging.

- **Methods to improve opacification and distension**: Investigations of MDCTU focus on the opacification and distension of the upper urinary tract, including the collecting systems, pelvis, and ureters. The role of abdominal compression, infusion of saline and/or furosemide, and optimal time delay of excretory phase imaging is being explored.

- **Detection of upper tract urothelial malignancies**: Upper tract urothelial malignancies, including small lesions less than 5 mm in diameter, can be detected with high sensitivity.

- **Radiation reduction methods**: Methods to reduce radiation exposure are being explored, including split-bolus contrast injection techniques that combine nephrographic and excretory phases into a single phase. It is likely that in the near future, radiological evaluation of significant unexplained hematuria or of known or prior urothelial malignancy will consist of a single examination — MDCTU.

### Does retrograde treatment of upper urinary tract stones necessitate postoperative upper urinary tract drainage? Conclusions from more than 500 single center consecutive cases [^111WXHTe]. Journal of Endourology (2018). Low credibility.

Temporary drainage of the upper urinary tract after ureterorenoscopy for the treatment of urinary stones is almost a routine in endourologic practice. In these cases, a Double-J stent (DJS) is left for 7 or more days. In borderline cases, a ureteral catheter attached to the urethral catheter may be left for 24–48 hours. In some situations, a tubeless approach is possible. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the necessity and immediate postoperative implications of upper tract drainage by comparing complications and symptoms in the immediate postoperative period among these three groups of patients.

A database of 516 consecutive patients who underwent ureterorenoscopy for ureteral and/or renal stones between October 2014 and September 2016 was retrospectively evaluated. The cohort was divided according to the type of postoperative drainage of the upper urinary tract. The data consisted of demographic parameters, stone location, number and burden, severity of preoperative obstruction, and postoperative complications. Symptoms in the immediate postoperative period, assessed by visual analog scale (VAS) score, frequency, and type of analgesics used, were evaluated and compared. Categorical dependent variables were evaluated using chi-square or Spearman's correlation tests, whereas continuous dependent variables were analyzed using Pearson correlation analysis.

There were 196 (38%) tubeless, 214 (41%) ureteral catheter (UC), and 106 (21%) DJS cases. Patients who were drained with DJS at the end of the procedure had significantly higher stone burdens.

### Ureteric stent versus percutaneous nephrostomy for acute ureteral obstruction - clinical outcome and quality of life: a bi-center prospective study [^116unY92]. BMC Urology (2019). Low credibility.

Over a two-year period, 75 consecutive patients presenting to the emergency room of two hospitals with an obstructing ureteral stone necessitating drainage were asked to participate in this study by an on-call urologist involved in the study. The estimated recruitment rate was 42%. This study is an Institutional Review Board approved, bi-center, prospective study comparing the impact on quality of life of percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) and retrograde ureteral catheterization.

Patients were offered renal drainage when definitive therapy was not immediately available or was contraindicated, and when a two-stage procedure was considered a safer approach. Entry criteria included an obstructing ureteral stone with either fever (> 38°C), acute renal failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≤ 60 ml/min), or intractable pain. The diagnosis of the obstructing ureteral stone was made by either a non-contrast CT or a combination of renal ultrasound and abdominal X-ray.

Exclusion criteria were age < 18 years, pregnant women, and patients with contraindications to either form of drainage (e.g. uncorrected coagulopathy excluding percutaneous drainage, hemodynamic instability precluding anesthesia required for double J stent [DJS] placement, or abnormalities of the urinary tract). Patients received either a DJS or a PCN according to the surgeon's preference. Practical issues, such as the availability of an operating room or the interventional radiologist, often dictated the choice of drainage, particularly in patients with fever, as it is our policy to reduce time to drainage to the minimum in this high-risk group.

### Survanta [^116XGQaS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Important administration instructions**: For intratracheal administration only. SURVANTA should be administered by or under the supervision of clinicians experienced in intubation, ventilator management, and general care of premature infants. The administration of SURVANTA is facilitated if one person administers the dose while another person positions and monitors the infant. Before administering SURVANTA, assure proper placement and patency of the endotracheal tube. At the discretion of the clinician, the endotracheal tube may be suctioned before administering SURVANTA. The infant should be allowed to stabilize before proceeding with dosing. Administer SURVANTA intratracheally by instillation through a 5 French end-hole catheter.

- **Recommended dosage**: Each dose of SURVANTA is 100 mg of phospholipids/kg birth weight (4 mL/kg). In the prevention strategy, in premature infants with evidence of surfactant deficiency, give the first dose of SURVANTA as soon as possible, preferably within 15 minutes of birth. To treat infants with RDS confirmed by radiographic and clinical findings, give the first dose of SURVANTA as soon as possible, preferably by 8 hours of age. Four doses of SURVANTA can be administered in the first 48 hours of life. Doses should be given no more frequently than every 6 hours. The need for additional doses of SURVANTA is determined by evidence of continuing respiratory distress. Radiographic confirmation of RDS should be obtained before administering additional doses to those who received a prevention dose.

### Comparison of image quality between filtered back-projection and the adaptive statistical and novel model-based iterative reconstruction techniques in abdominal CT for renal calculi [^115yT1o7]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

To compare image quality on computed tomographic (CT) images acquired with filtered back-projection (FBP), adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR), and model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) techniques in CT kidney/ureter/bladder (KUB) examination, we conducted a study. Eighteen patients underwent standard protocol CT KUB at our institution. The same raw data were reconstructed using FBP, ASIR, and MBIR.

Objective image parameters, such as mean image noise, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for the kidney, and mean attenuation values of subcutaneous fat were assessed. Subjective image parameters, including image noise, image contrast, overall visibility of kidneys/ureters/bladder, visibility of small structures, and overall diagnostic confidence, were scored using a system from 1 (best) to 5 (worst).

- **Results**: Objective image measurements revealed significantly less image noise and higher CNR, with the same fat attenuation values for the MBIR technique (P < 0.05). A significant difference between ASIR and MBIR was observed (P < 0.05). The mean effective dose was 3 mSv.

- **Conclusion**: MBIR shows superior reduction in noise and improved image quality (both objective and subjective analysis) compared with ASIR and FBP CT KUB examinations.

- **Main messages**: There are many reconstruction options in CT. Novel model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) showed the least noise and optimal quality.

### Clinical costs of feeding tube placement [^114DKSZE]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Although small-bore tube placement is common, insertion can lead to serious complications. We investigated the use of radiographs, fluoroscopy, feeding tubes, and complications associated with blind feeding-tube placement.

- **Methods**: The electronic and paper records of adult patients receiving a small-bore feeding tube in 2005 were retrospectively reviewed for the following variables: demographics, desired location (gastric or postpyloric), number of radiographs, number of tubes per individual, time interval between medical prescription, tube placement and delivery of the diet, complications, transport for fluoroscopy, and hospital location of placement (intensive care unit vs floor).

- **Results**: We identified 1,822 tubes placed into 729 patients (male: 449, 61.6%; female: 280, 38.4%; median age: 59 years old, range 18–98). All tubes were placed by nurses unless fluoroscopically placed in radiology or placed after head and neck surgery in the operating room. An average of 2.5 (range 1–20) tubes was used per patient. A total of 2,696 radiographs were obtained for an average of 3.7 (range 0–32) films per patient and 1.5 (range 0–11) per feeding tube. Successful placement was higher for intragastric (93.3%) than for postpyloric position (60.4%; p < .001). Fluoroscopy was needed in 18.6% of the patients, mostly for postpyloric insertion (p < .001). Respiratory tree misplacement occurred in 23 (3.2%) patients; 9 (1.2%) had a pneumothorax and 4 (0.5%) died. Patients with a malpositioned feeding tube underwent more tube insertions (6.8 ± 5.4; range 2–20) than patients with successful placements.

### Prolonged urinary leakage after partial nephrectomy: a novel management pathway [^116w98HF]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

To describe an original method for managing prolonged urinary leakage after partial nephrectomy, we placed a Malecot catheter in the ureter to improve urinary drainage and, therefore, avoid the renal percutaneous treatment of the fistula or potential open surgery.

- **Technical considerations**: We performed ureteral stenting using a 16 F Malecot catheter in three patients who had a prolonged urinary fistula after partial nephrectomy, where the placement of a ureteral stent could not resolve the urine leak. Drainage using two ureteral catheters was performed, but it was insufficient for the urinary fistula to resolve. We subsequently placed a 16 F Malecot catheter into the dilated ureter and the renal pelvis using a cystoscopic approach, along with a bladder catheter to complete the drainage. In all cases, the urine leak stopped after stenting with the Malecot catheter. One month after stenting, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed complete healing of the fistula, with no infection or secondary ureteral stricture reported.

- **Conclusion**: This technique, with a low complication profile, can be used as an additional endoscopic step before more invasive procedures.

### Analysis of long-term effect of ureteral balloon dilatation combined with internal and external drainage tube in the treatment of benign ureteral stricture [^111FKVFx]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Introduction**: The study involves assessing the impacts of ureteral balloon dilatation and the use of internal and external drainage tubes on benign ureteral strictures. Fig. 1 shows the fluoroscopic image where a guidewire is inserted through a percutaneous access to the urinary bladder, and the ureteral stenosis is dilated with a balloon.

- **Procedure description**:
	- Fig. 2 outlines the placement of the internal and external drainage tube under fluoroscopy, with its distal end in the bladder and the side holes located in the renal pelvis.
	- As depicted in Fig. 3, the drainage tube's end is pulled into the renal pelvis, allowing the contrast medium to enter the bladder cavity through the ureter.

- **Criteria for tube removal**: The following conditions guide tube removal:
	- Imaging examination reveals no ureteropelvic dilatation.
	- Renal function tests indicate a significant decrease in urea nitrogen and creatinine levels.
	- Prior to removal, the distal end of the drainage tube is relocated from the bladder to the renal pelvis. A contrast agent injected through the external orifice should smoothly enter the bladder from the renal pelvis via the ureter.
	- If these criteria are unmet, the tube's end is repositioned into the bladder using a guide wire, and the procedure is repeated after three months.

- **Follow-up**: Six months after the removal of drainage tubes, patients undergo reexaminations including B-ultrasound, enhanced CTU, or IVP of the urinary system, as shown in Fig. 4. The success rate is defined by the patency rate between 36–60 months of follow-up.

- **Statistical analysis**: All analyses were conducted using SPSS software.

### Does baseline radiography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder help facilitate stone management in patients presenting to the emergency department with renal colic [^11636BgB]. Journal of Endourology (2013). Low credibility.

A baseline kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) radiograph at the time of computed tomography (CT) for ureteral stones might aid the interpretation of future KUBs. However, the CT scout radiograph might render the baseline KUB redundant. We sought to assess the diagnostic utility of baseline KUB for patients with ureteral stones.

Patients with ureteral stones were retrospectively identified. All had a baseline KUB in addition to CT and were reassessed after 4 to 60 days with KUB. Each patient's imaging was randomized 1:1 into either "KUB&CT" or "CT" groups. Three urologists independently assessed the imaging: CT (with scout film) and baseline KUB in the KUB&CT group, but only the CT (not KUB) in the CT group. Definitive stone assessment on follow-up KUB was defined as all three reviewers answering either Yes or No (not Indeterminate) to the question of stone passage or migration.

Of the 154 stones identified, the mean diameter was 4.8 ± 2.1 mm, and density was 914 ± 300 Hounsfield units (HU), with 54.4% located in the distal ureter. Stone visibility was 60.4% on KUB vs. 43.5% on scout film (P < 0.001). Scout film visibility favored the CT group (52.7% vs. 35.0%, P = 0.027). After adjusting for body mass index, skin-to-stone distance, size, density, and location, definitive assessment rates were higher in the KUB&CT group (P = 0.047). When reviewers reassessed the CT group using the baseline KUB, they could achieve a definitive assessment in an additional 16 cases (21.6%, P < 0.001). Definitive assessments were associated with higher rates of stone visibility on scout films.

### Successful identification of anatomical markers and placement of feeding tubes in critically ill patients via camera-assisted technology with real-time video guidance [^113aGuFH]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

In this study, agreement between the IRIS image and radiographic confirmation was 93%. These results suggest that with further study, direct visualization of the gastric mucosa by the IRIS camera could potentially preclude the need for radiographic confirmation in almost all patients but may require some improvements to the camera to identify other anatomical markers. Our results and clinical experience in this study were similar to a recently published case series by Mizzi et al. using IRIS to confirm bedside FT placement in patients in the ICU. In that study, 20 unconscious patients underwent FT placement using the device, and the gastric mucosa was identified in 90% of the cases, with airway misplacement avoided in approximately one-third of patients. In both Mizzi et al.'s study and our own, there was some difficulty with image quality. The manufacturer has since improved the device design to increase the quality of the camera's visualization. In some patients who were quite anxious about the FT placement procedure, the tube was quickly passed through the esophagus and to the stomach, where this was the first landmark able to be photographed due to the desire to minimize procedure time and patient anxiety from FT placement. It should be noted that all FTs were planned to be gastric in location; in some patients, the investigators noted the pylorus was easily identified and the tube was passed into the small bowel (postpyloric) after discussion with the primary care team as to the appropriateness of postpyloric tube placement.

### Limitations of noncontrast CT for measuring ureteral stones [^114BBzuF]. Journal of Endourology (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with renal colic are frequently evaluated in the emergency room with a helical noncontrast CT scan (NCCT) as the primary imaging modality. Treatment decisions are often based on the size of the ureteral stone(s). We wished to assess the accuracy of NCCT in estimating ureteral stone size compared with plain abdominal (KUB) films.

- **Patients and methods**: Forty-eight patients were identified who had ureteral stones seen on NCCT and KUB films performed on the same day. The number of consecutive images on which a ureteral stone was visible on NCCT was multiplied by the reconstruction interval of 5 mm to create a size estimate, which was compared with the measurements of the same stone seen on the KUB film.

- **Results**: The NCCT overestimated stone size by approximately 30% to 50% compared with KUB.

- **Conclusion**: Counting the number of consecutive NCCT images depicting a ureteral stone is not an accurate method of stone measurement when a reconstruction interval of 5 mm is used. Urologists should consider stone measurement techniques carefully and understand the limitations of imaging studies when evaluating patients with symptomatic ureteral stones.

### Jelmyto [^1156JuMH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

To begin the process, measure the kidney volume. The instillation volume will be equal to the patient's kidney volume. If the kidney volume is already known, proceed to the next section.

If the kidney volume is not known or needs reassessment, follow these steps:

- **Perform a retrograde pyelogram**: Use diluted contrast (50%) until you observe the entire renal pelvis and calyces, with contrast beginning to flow below the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ). Record the volume of contrast injected at this point, then allow it to drain from the kidney. This may take about five minutes.
	- **Note**: Do not withdraw contrast back into the syringe.

- **Repeat the above steps**: Conduct three measurements total to enhance accuracy. Calculate the average of these three volume measurements and round to the nearest whole number. This result is the patient's kidney volume.

- **Select the instillation volume**: Use the lesser value between the kidney volume or 15 mL as the instillation volume. Note that the maximum instillation volume is 15 mL. Record this volume for future instillations.

- **Chill the Jelmyto**: Place the Jelmyto vial in an ice bath for at least 10 minutes, but no longer than one hour. After a minimum of 10 minutes, advance the ureteral catheter over the guidewire towards the target anatomy in the pyelocalyceal system.

### Cystografin [^111DFfkX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

Preparation of the patient: Appropriate preparation is desirable for optimal results. A laxative the night before the examination and a low-residue diet the day before the procedure are recommended.

- **Dosage**: The dose for retrograde use in cystography and voiding cystourethrography ranges from 25 to 300 mL depending on the age of the patient and the degree of bladder irritability; amounts greater than 300 mL may be used if the bladder capacity allows. Best results are obtained when the bladder is filled with the contrast agent. If desired, the preparation may be diluted with sterile water or sterile saline.

- **Administration**: After sterile catheterization, the bladder should be filled to capacity with Cystografin using a suitable sterile administration set. Care should be taken to avoid using excessive pressure. The presence of bladder discomfort or reflux and/or spontaneous voiding usually indicates that the bladder is full.

- **Radiography**: The commonly employed radiographic techniques should be used. A scout film is recommended before the contrast agent is administered.

### Successful identification of anatomical markers and placement of feeding tubes in critically ill patients via camera-assisted technology with real-time video guidance [^117NW8UK]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). High credibility.

Translating these results into the expected impact on clinical practice, radiographic confirmation of correct FT placement could potentially be avoided by accurate IRIS visualization of the gastric mucosa, thus saving time and money, avoiding radiation exposure, and offsetting the cost of the camera technology.

- **Strengths of this study**: The enrolment of patients with a variety of diagnoses as eligible subjects from all ICU and step‐down units at the facility improves the generalizability of these results.

- **Shortcomings of this study**: The single‐center design limited the scope. Also, only three individuals (MD, RN, and PA credentials) placed all the tubes, somewhat limiting the generalizability of the placement experience. The clinicians also completed training cases and were therefore well-practiced on the use of IRIS during this study. The learning curve for general clinicians must be determined in further studies.

Only three of the tubes placed were in the postpyloric space. Because postpyloric tubes are generally harder to place, further investigation is warranted to determine the feasibility and success rates of postpyloric tube placement. These patients may, in fact, represent an ideal opportunity to use anatomical markers to guide the more challenging postpyloric placement.

### Endocavitary contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS): a novel problem-solving technique [^111pBULj]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Following percutaneous nephrostomy insertion, it is frequently necessary to assess the renal collecting system and ureter for free passage of contrast prior to removal of the catheter to ensure patency. The stent patency, point of obstruction, or relief of a prior obstructing aetiology can all be assessed. Contrast imaging of the ureters also allows for the delineation of a fistula or ureteric rupture. The spatial resolution of endocavitary CEUS allows for a confident assessment of free ureteric drainage. Recent studies demonstrate 79–100% concordance with fluoroscopy, with 94% of discordant cases showing ureteric patency on CEUS nephrostogram, which was not seen on conventional fluoroscopy.

In an acute setting, UCA injected via a needle entering a renal collecting system can be used as an alternative to fluoroscopic imaging, enabling confident bedside nephrostomy placement. This percutaneous puncture may be facilitated by placing a small volume of UCA on a puncture needle and observing as the UCA refluxes back along the needle as a calyceal puncture is achieved due to the back pressure of urine.

- **CEUS nephrostogram**: Images obtained of the entire ureter and bladder following ultrasound contrast administered through an in-dwelling nephrostomy confirm patency of the collecting system with contrast opacifying the (A) renal calyces, (B) ureter, and (C) bladder, which contains a urinary catheter (white arrow). (D) Conventional fluoroscopic nephrostogram confirms free drainage along the collecting system and into the bladder (arrows).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for bladder cancer, specifically with respect to imaging for staging non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, the NCCN 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining abdomen and pelvis imaging for staging in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer using the following methods:

- **CT urography**: Involves CT of the abdomen and pelvis without and with intravenous contrast, including excretory imaging.

- **Magnetic resonance urography**: Consider performing this, especially in patients with poor renal function or an allergy to iodinated contrast, provided the GFR is ≥ 30 and there is no acute renal failure. This may be performed without gadolinium-based contrast using T2 imaging and native image contrast to evaluate the upper tracts, though it will have decreased sensitivity to plaque-like or non-obstructive lesions and metastasis.

- **Renal ultrasound or CT without contrast**: Use in conjunction with retrograde ureteropyelography for patients who cannot receive either iodinated or gadolinium-based contrast material.

- **MRI of the pelvis**: Consider obtaining this without and with intravenous contrast for local staging in sessile or high-grade tumors. This may be performed in addition to CT urography and can be conducted without contrast if renal function does not allow for contrast administration, as early data suggest T2 and diffusion-weighted images may assist with local staging.

### Visualization of the renal vein filled with contrast agent may indicate the renal vein injury during percutaneous nephrolithotomy: two case reports [^1112erLS]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Radiographic findings**: In Figure 1, the radiograph of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder reveals the left renal vein, the collecting system, and the suboptimal position of the puncture needle tip. In Figure 2, the radiograph shows the collecting system without visualization of the renal vein upon injection of contrast agent through the subsequent puncture needle (indicated by arrow).

- **Case study of patient 2**: The patient, a 41-year-old woman, presented with left flank pain and an unremarkable medical history. White blood cells were detected in the urine, prompting the initiation of empirical antibiotics. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis indicated left mild hydronephrosis and a renal calculus measuring 2.2 cm. She was diagnosed with renal calculi and mild hydronephrosis, and a PCNL procedure was planned. A ureteral catheter was retrogradely inserted into the left ureter, targeting the middle posterior calyx. The puncture site of the target calyceal fornix was localized under fluoroscopy monitoring. This was achieved by using a contrast agent injected through the ureteral catheter, producing a retrograde pyelogram. Clear urine was seen upon withdrawal of the stylet. During the injection of contrast agent into her left collecting system through the puncture needle, the left renal vein filled with contrast agent, becoming visible (Figure 3). It was also identified that the location of the puncture needle tip was not optimal, as it was near the calyceal infundibulum. Consequently, the puncture needle was withdrawn. A puncture tract passing through the middle posterior calyceal fornix was then performed simultaneously.

### Efficacy analysis of self-help position therapy after holmium laser lithotripsy via flexible ureteroscopy [^115pYg1L]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

All enrollees received a preoperative plain abdominal radiograph of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) and unenhanced computed tomography (CT) to assess hydronephrosis and the size, location, and number of stones. The same imaging regimen was used for all patients. Stone size was determined by measuring the longest diameter on the preoperative radiologic images. In the case of multiple stones, the sum of the longest diameters of stones was used.

Patients were placed in a lithotomy position after general anesthesia. Subsequently, a semirigid ureteroscope (8–9.8 F; Richard Wolf GmbH, Knittlingen, Germany) was retrogradely inserted into the upper urinary tract with the assistance of a Zebra guidewire (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA) to check the ureter and simplify the placement of a 12/14F ureteral access sheath (UAS; Cook Medical, Limerick, Ireland). A 7.5F fiberoptic flexible ureteroscope (FURS, P5; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted into the renal pelvis via the UAS to search and fragment stones (≤ 2 mm). Fragmentation was done using a 200-micron holmium laser fiber at an energy setting of 12–20 W based on the visually determined hardness of stones. Routinely, a 4.7F double-J stent (Bard Peripheral Vascular, Tempe, AZ, USA) was placed after lithotripsy. If the UAS could not be positioned due to ureter straitness, a 6F double-J stent (Bard Peripheral Vascular) was implanted for 2 weeks before lithotripsy.

A KUB examination was done on postoperative day 1. If residual fragments were found, patients in the position group were instructed accordingly.

### Conray [^1169Kwc5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Following intravenous injection, Conray is rapidly excreted by the kidneys. Conray may be visualized in the renal parenchyma 30 seconds following bolus injection. Maximum radiographic density in the calyces and pelves occurs in most instances within 3 to 8 minutes after injection. In patients with severe renal impairment, contrast visualization may be substantially delayed.

- **Patient preparation**: Appropriate preparation of the patient is important for optimal visualization. A low residue diet is recommended for the day preceding the examination, and a laxative is given the evening before the examination, unless contraindicated.

- **Precautions**: Infants and small children should not have any fluid restrictions prior to excretory urography. Injections of Conray represent an osmotic load which, if superimposed on increased serum osmolality due to partial dehydration, may magnify hypertonic dehydration (see warnings and precautions, general concerning preparatory dehydration).

- **Adverse reactions**: See section on general adverse reactions.

- **Usual dosage**: Adults - The usual dose is 30 to 60 mL. Children 14 years of age and over, of average weight, may receive the adult dose. The total dose is normally injected within 30 to 90 seconds. Higher dosages may be indicated to achieve optimum results in instances where poor visualization may be anticipated (e.g. elderly patients or patients with impaired renal function). When nephrograms and/or sequential urograms are desired, the total dose should be rapidly injected, normally within 15 to 30 seconds.

### Metachronous renal vein and artery injure after percutaneous nephrostolithotomy [^116xkmwX]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Percutaneous nephrostolithotomy is an important approach for kidney stones removal. The placement of a percutaneous nephrostomy drainage tube is an effective method to stop venous bleeding. Occasionally, the catheter can pierce into the renal parenchyma and migrate into the renal vein, potentially reaching the vena cava.

- **Case presentation**: A 66-year-old woman underwent a percutaneous nephrostolithotomy for a kidney staghorn stone, which was complicated by severe bleeding. A computed tomography angiography revealed the percutaneous nephrostomy drainage tube inside the renal vein. The tube was withdrawn 3 cm back to the renal parenchyma/sinus/pelvis in stages, with the surgical team on standby. Seven days later, the patient developed severe hematuria. Computed tomography angiography demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm located near the percutaneous nephrostomy drainage tube. The pseudoaneurysm was successfully embolized.

- **Conclusion**: Our case shows intravenous misplacement of the nephrostomy tube and a subsequent pseudoaneurysm after percutaneous nephrostolithotomy. To our knowledge, this seems to be the first documentation of major bleeding from an injury to both the renal vein and artery. The percutaneous nephrostomy drainage tube can be withdrawn back to the renal parenchyma/sinus/pelvis in stages with the surgical team on standby. The withdrawn distance may vary according to the patient and catheter position.

### Ureteric stent associated spondylodiscitis [^111rxJ3X]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

This case report describes a clinical presentation of spondylodiscitis following an emergency ureteric stent placement for an infected and obstructed kidney in a woman in her late 70s who presented with right flank pain, raised inflammatory markers, and an acute kidney injury.

A non-contrast CT scan of the kidney, ureters, and bladder (KUB) revealed a 9 mm obstructing stone, and prompt decompression with a JJ stent was performed. Although the initial urine culture showed no growth, a subsequent urine culture after discharge identified an extended spectrum beta-lactamase Escherichia coli. Postoperatively, the patient experienced novel, worsening lower back pain and persistently elevated inflammatory markers. An MRI revealed spondylodiscitis at L5/S1, for which she was treated with a 6-week course of antibiotics, resulting in a good but slow recovery.

This case highlights the unusual finding of spondylodiscitis post-ureteric stent placement, and clinicians should be aware of this rare complication.

### Safety and efficacy of standard vs. tubeless percutaneous nephrolithotomy in pediatric populations: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^1178iFZc]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

Drainage tube-related pain is a major source of postoperative discomfort following standard PCNL. In traditional PCNL, the placement of a drainage tube often leads to symptoms such as discomfort and pain due to the tube. The drainage tube can irritate the urinary tract, bladder, or renal pelvis, triggering bladder spasms, stent colic, and other discomforts, which in turn increases the need for analgesics. In contrast, tubeless PCNL eliminates the need for a drainage tube, significantly reducing these sources of pain and consequently decreasing both the intensity and duration of postoperative pain, as confirmed in our study.

It is noteworthy that our study demonstrates that tubeless PCNL is effective in certain pediatric patients, and age is not an absolute contraindication for this approach. Although some scholars have suggested that factors such as stone size and number, bilateral PCNL, intercostal access, and single-puncture PCNL are not absolute contraindications, the decision to perform tubeless PCNL should be made flexibly based on intraoperative conditions. However, we still recommend considering the use of a nephrostomy tube in the following situations: ureteral stricture or obstruction, complete or partial staghorn stones (with the expectation of requiring staged fragmentation), congenital urinary tract anomalies, significant intraoperative bleeding, renal abscess, solitary kidney or functionally solitary kidney, severe collecting system injury, and impaired renal function.

This study has several limitations. Firstly, variations in controlling factors such as…

More extensive injury may require expert intervention for ureteroureterostomy to the opposite side or reimplantation in the bladder. In these cases, or where damage control surgery is required, the ureter can be exteriorized to control urine leakage.

- **Bladder trauma**: The bladder is the second most commonly injured genitourinary organ due to its size and location. With landmine explosions and related pelvic trauma, the full bladder can rupture — either extraperitoneal, intraperitoneal, or combined. Intraperitoneal rupture always requires surgical repair, whereas the extraperitoneal may, on select indications, require repair (such as bone shards in the bladder or prostatic urethral damage). Most cases are managed nonoperatively with Foley catheter drainage for 10–14 days.

Diagnosis of bladder injury is best confirmed by a formal cystogram using 200–300 mL contrast injected transurethrally into the bladder, and then keeping the catheter clamped to prevent the bladder from emptying. A dynamic view is useful, but a simple pelvic AP and lateral X-ray with the bladder full will confirm any leaks (contrast extravasation). A post-micturition set of X-rays is also advised to see any occult retroperitoneal leaks.

Repair is either at midline laparotomy or via a Pfannestiel approach (for isolated bladder injury), opening the bladder dome.

### Obstructed kidney and sepsis secondary to urethral catheter misplacement into the distal ureter [^116kP29n]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

An 86-year-old woman underwent routine catheter replacement in the community, but the new catheter failed to drain urine. Attempts to remove the catheter failed both by the community nurse and by the urology team in the hospital. A CT scan confirmed that the catheter balloon was inflated in the distal right ureter. The patient was started on antibiotics and listed for cystoscopy under general anaesthetic. During the procedure, the catheter was visualized entering the right ureter, and the balloon was punctured using a wire under image intensifier guidance. Once removed, a new catheter was inserted. Very dilated ureteric orifices were noted. Postoperatively, the patient required HDU support for 48 hours due to sepsis and, upon recovery, was discharged home. The key learning point in this case is to always consider catheter misplacement in the ureter if it is not draining well and the patient presents with pain.

### Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) nephrostogram: Utility and accuracy as an alternative to fluoroscopic imaging of the urinary tract [^115PtD7d]. Clinical Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to establish the feasibility and accuracy of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) nephrostogram in comparison to the reference standard, fluoroscopic nephrostogram, as alternative imaging of the urinary tract post-nephrostomy insertion.

- **Materials and methods**: This prospective study received approval from the institutional and national ethics committee. All patients for whom a fluoroscopic nephrostogram was requested were included. Both fluoroscopic and CEUS nephrostograms were performed within 24 hours. Two reviewers conducted the image analysis, which included the assessment of nephrostomy position, and opacification of the pelvicalyceal system, ureter, and bladder. Diagnostic accuracy of the CEUS nephrostograms was compared to fluoroscopic nephrostograms.

- **Results**: Sixty-two nephrostograms were performed in 48 patients from June 2011 to April 2016, with a male percentage of 52.1% (25/48), and a mean age of 65 years (range 28–90 years). Indications for nephrostomy included malignancy (29/62; 46.8%), benign ureteric stricture (14/62; 22.6%), urinary diversion (8/62; 12.9%), renal calculus (5/62; 8.1%), hematoma (3/62; 4.8%), or pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction (3/62; 4.8%). Two nephrostomies were identified as displaced by both techniques. The pelvicalyceal system was visualized in 60/60 (100%) examinations in both fluoroscopic and CEUS nephrostograms. The entire ureter was visualized in 30/60 (50%) with CEUS compared to 32/60 (53.3%) fluoroscopically. The distal ureter was the least well-visualized segment for both techniques, with no significant difference (p = 0.815). Both CEUS and fluoroscopy could be used to correctly identify displaced nephrostomies.

### 2023 WSES guidelines for the prevention, detection, and management of iatrogenic urinary tract injuries (IUTIs) during emergency digestive surgery [^115uyTQD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Ureteral injuries

CT urography with both nephrographic and excretory phases (5–20 min after contrast administration) represents the gold standard technique in case of suspected ureteral injuries. Once IUTI is identified, appropriate management depends on the type, location, and grade of the lesion, the time of diagnosis, and the patient's condition. The primary goals of IUTI management are preserving renal function, ensuring adequate drainage by stenting or nephrostomy, and minimizing surgical morbidity.

In the infrequent case where the ureter is sutured without being transected, balloon dilation of the ligated portion can be attempted to avoid surgery. In partial ureteral transection, minimally invasive techniques, including percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement, wire recanalization of the ureteral lumen, and stent placement, are preferred. Percutaneous nephrostomy combined with anterograde stent placement may be performed in the event of retrograde stent failure or considered a first option in patients at high risk for retrograde stent failure. However, conservative management carries a risk of subsequent ureteral stricture, necessitating a strict follow-up.

The surgical approach is preferred when the ureteral lesion is complete or involves a large ureteral segment. For upper and middle third IUTI, the first-line repair is often a ureteroureterostomy, where the distal and proximal ureteral ends are debrided back to viable tissue, and a standard running or interrupted end-to-end anastomosis is performed. Ureteral devascularization must be kept to a minimum.
