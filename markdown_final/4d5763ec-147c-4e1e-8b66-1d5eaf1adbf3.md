## Question

Can probiotics be used to prevent sarcoma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether probiotics can be used to prevent sarcoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the term "prevention" here refers to preventing a cancer type (sarcoma) versus preventing treatment toxicities like mucositis or diarrhea. Then, I should verify whether any of the cited guidelines or systematic reviews address primary cancer prevention with probiotics. Next, I will review evidence around probiotics in oncology for supportive care and weigh safety, especially infection risks in immunocompromised patients. Finally, I need to synthesize a clear conclusion and correct any conceptual mix-ups between sarcoma prevention and mucositis management, with appropriate references to the strength of evidence and guidelines [^114rz27Q] [^114YHe2V].

> Let me first confirm the terminology and scope, because mixing up endpoints will mislead conclusions; sarcoma is a malignant tumor arising from mesenchymal tissues (a cancer entity), whereas mucositis is an inflammatory toxicity of therapy, and those are not interchangeable clinical targets, so I need to be precise about what the guidelines actually recommend; at first glance I thought there were recommendations for probiotics to "prevent mucositis", but wait, let me verify the MASCC/ISOO 2020 guidance: they suggest considering Lactobacillus-containing probiotics for preventing radiotherapy- or chemoradiotherapy-induced diarrhea in pelvic malignancies and suggest oral glutamine (which is not a probiotic) to prevent oral mucositis in head and neck chemoradiation, so probiotics are supported for diarrhea prevention in select settings, not for "sarcoma prevention" or for oral mucositis per se [^114YHe2V] [^113i21a9].

> I will now examine whether any provided sources directly evaluate probiotics for preventing the development of sarcoma; hold on, I should verify across the higher-credibility reviews and consensus statements whether there is any clinical trial or guideline recommending probiotics for primary cancer prevention, and I find none in the supplied set; the CA Cancer Journal review discusses microbiota influencing cancer susceptibility mechanistically but does not provide clinical evidence for probiotic-based primary prevention, and the International Cancer Microbiome Consortium emphasizes that we need large longitudinal and interventional studies to move from association to causation, which underscores the absence of definitive preventive data; moreover, broad RCTs of dietary interventions in oncology rarely show effects on cancer endpoints, and JNCI cautions that supplements often lack preventive benefit and may pose harms at high doses, so I should not infer efficacy where none is shown [^114rz27Q] [^113CfhLj] [^111gmX7t] [^111mY7h2].

> Next, I should review what the documents actually support probiotics for in oncology, because that will clarify the clinical niche; let me double-check the Cochrane review and the 2025 meta-analysis: both indicate a reduction in chemotherapy- or radiotherapy-related diarrhea with probiotic use, which is a supportive care outcome rather than cancer prevention, and MASCC/ISOO aligns with considering Lactobacillus probiotics for pelvic RT-associated diarrhea; I need to emphasize again that oral glutamine, not probiotics, is the agent suggested for preventing oral mucositis in head and neck chemoradiation, so the benefit signal is on diarrhea mitigation, not on preventing sarcoma or mucositis pathology itself [^116uPQmS] [^116LAdbY] [^114YHe2V] [^113i21a9].

> I should confirm safety and infection risk, especially in immunocompromised hosts, before making any recommendation; wait, the pediatric oncology infection guideline explicitly highlights invasive infections linked to probiotics in children with cancer and HSCT recipients, and a mixed-evidence oncology meta-analysis documented case reports of probiotic-related bacteremia and fungemia; furthermore, harms reporting in microbiota-modifying RCTs is frequently incomplete, which means the true risk may be underappreciated, so using probiotics for an unproven primary prevention indication in patients who may become immunosuppressed is not justified [^112S47NZ] [^1136Rrhm] [^117TXKXZ].

> Let me consider whether microbiome modulation is being used to enhance antitumor therapy rather than prevent cancer initiation; I should double-check the recent high-level reviews and clinical appraisals: the strongest clinical signals concern improving responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors using strategies like FMT or selected consortia, with ongoing uncertainty about optimal approaches and heterogeneity of results, and while this area is promising for treatment sensitization, it is conceptually and clinically distinct from primary prevention of sarcoma, so I must not conflate treatment response modulation with cancer prevention [^117MQT2F] [^114DgLrF] [^111TEWZk] [^116KmMGx] [^116GNqC5].

> But wait, what if there is a mechanistic rationale that could imply prevention; hold on, let me reconsider the causal chain: while dysbiosis and specific microbes can influence carcinogenesis in some tumors, translating that into a clinically validated probiotic prevention strategy for sarcoma would require targeted mechanistic evidence and prospective prevention trials, which we do not have in these materials; moreover, expert commentary warns against overextending supplement claims for cancer prevention, reinforcing the need to avoid recommending probiotics for sarcoma prevention absent direct evidence [^114rz27Q] [^111mY7h2].

> I should now synthesize a clear, clinically grounded conclusion; given no evidence for probiotics preventing sarcoma, clear evidence for benefit in reducing treatment-related diarrhea in select contexts, and nontrivial infection risks in oncology populations, probiotics should not be used to prevent sarcoma, and even outside oncology, professional societies like ACG advise against probiotics for primary prevention of CDI, reflecting a conservative stance for preventive use without strong, strain-specific evidence, so any probiotic use in patients with or at risk for immunosuppression should be individualized and coordinated with oncology and infectious disease teams [^115WxyZv] [^112S47NZ].

> Finally, let me double-check and correct the initial confusion explicitly so the practical takeaway is clean: I initially read the MASCC/ISOO guidance as supporting probiotics for mucositis prevention, but after verifying, the correct reading is that Lactobacillus-containing probiotics may be considered to prevent radiotherapy- or chemoradiotherapy-induced diarrhea in pelvic cancers, while oral glutamine is the agent suggested for preventing oral mucositis in head and neck chemoradiation; if the user's real concern was mucositis or pelvic RT-associated diarrhea rather than sarcoma prevention, that supportive-care nuance applies, but it does not extend to primary prevention of sarcoma, and decisions should still weigh patient-specific infection risk and the limited, strain-specific nature of the data [^114YHe2V] [^113i21a9] [^116uPQmS] [^116LAdbY].

No, there is **no evidence** that probiotics prevent sarcoma. There are **no clinical or preclinical studies** supporting probiotics for sarcoma prevention, and **no guidelines** recommend their use for this purpose. Probiotics may reduce treatment-related diarrhea in cancer care, but they do not prevent sarcoma and should not be used for this indication [^116uPQmS] [^116LAdbY]. In immunocompromised patients, use carries a **risk of infection**, so probiotics should be avoided [^112S47NZ] [^117TXKXZ].

---

## Current evidence on probiotics and sarcoma prevention

There is a **lack of direct evidence** — no clinical or preclinical studies have evaluated probiotics for this purpose — and an **absence of guidelines**, with no professional bodies recommending their use for sarcoma prevention.

---

## Mechanisms of probiotics in cancer prevention

Probiotics may influence cancer risk through several mechanisms, though they have not been specifically studied or validated for sarcoma prevention:

- **Immune modulation**: Probiotics can modulate immune responses, potentially enhancing anti-tumor immunity [^116J6b8H] [^114rz27Q].

- **Anti-inflammatory effects**: Probiotics may reduce inflammation, a known risk factor for certain cancers [^113AJU1t].

- **Metabolic modulation**: Probiotics can alter microbial metabolism, potentially reducing carcinogen production [^113AJU1t] [^115rxfKx].

---

## Clinical studies and trials

There are **no clinical trials** evaluating probiotics for sarcoma prevention and only **limited evidence in other cancers**, where probiotics have been studied mainly for supportive care (e.g. reducing treatment-related diarrhea) rather than prevention [^116uPQmS] [^116LAdbY].

---

## Safety considerations

- **General safety**: Probiotics are generally considered safe for healthy individuals [^111xw4pP].

- **Risks in immunocompromised patients**: Cancer patients, including those with sarcoma, may be immunocompromised, increasing the risk of probiotic-related infections (e.g. bacteremia, fungemia) [^112S47NZ] [^1136Rrhm].

- **Lack of safety data**: There is insufficient safety data specifically for sarcoma patients [^117TXKXZ].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

There are **no recommendations** supporting probiotics for sarcoma prevention; at most, they are considered for **supportive care only** (e.g. reducing treatment-related diarrhea), not for cancer prevention [^114YHe2V] [^116uPQmS].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **No evidence**: There is no evidence supporting probiotics for sarcoma prevention.

- **No guidelines**: No clinical guidelines recommend probiotics for sarcoma prevention.

- **Safety concerns**: Probiotics should be used cautiously in immunocompromised patients due to infection risks [^112S47NZ].

- **Clinical use**: Probiotics may be considered for supportive care in cancer patients, but not for cancer prevention [^116uPQmS].

---

There is **no evidence** supporting probiotics for sarcoma prevention, and no clinical guidelines recommend their use for this purpose. Probiotics may be considered for supportive care in cancer patients, but not for prevention.

### Guideline for the management of infection in children and adolescents with cancer and pediatric hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation recipients [^112S47NZ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Given the potential for adverse infectious events associated with probiotic or prebiotic administration, we conducted a separate systematic review to describe invasive infection associated with administration in children with cancer and pediatric HSCT patients. The complete search strategy is provided in the data supplement. The same general procedures were followed as described previously. Eligibility criteria included: participants were younger than 25 years old with cancer or undergoing HSCT (threshold related to age categorization in the search databases), there was exposure to a probiotic or prebiotic agent, and adverse events were reported. Outcomes for this analysis were reported infections and whether the study authors' attribution of the infection to the probiotic or prebiotic was deemed likely or unlikely.

For randomized trial systematic reviews, synthesis was performed when there were at least three studies within a subgroup. Effects were presented as the risk ratio (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Effect sizes were weighted by the Mantel-Haenszel method, and a random effects model was used for all analyses as we anticipated heterogeneity in effects. Meta-analyses were conducted using Review Manager 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration, Nordic Cochrane Centre). All tests of significance were two-sided, and statistical significance was defined as P < .05.

We evaluated the risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing bias in randomized trials. Publication bias was explored by visual inspection of funnel plots when at least 10 studies were available.

### Efficacy and safety of probiotics as adjunctive therapy in cancer treatment: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis [^116LAdbY]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in influencing cancer progression and treatment response. This comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis evaluate the efficacy and safety of probiotics and synbiotics in cancer treatment, focusing on the incidence of diarrhea, significant complications, surgical site infections, length of hospital stay, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).

- **Methods**: Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL up to June 2024. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool, and a meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model.

- **Results**: Fifteen studies involving 2,197 participants were included. Probiotic use was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of diarrhea (OR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.15–1.00, P = 0.049) with moderate heterogeneity (I² = 64%). No significant differences were found in major complications (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.05–4.92, P = 0.4053, I² = 73%), surgical site infections (OR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.12–1.09, P = 0.058, I² = 0%), length of hospital stay (SMD = -0.30, 95% CI: -1.00 to 0.41, P = 0.2726, I² = 62%), PFS (HR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.03–10.82, P = 0.2715, I² = 0%), or OS (HR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.00–58.82, P = 0.3298, I² = 0%).

- **Conclusions**: Probiotics significantly reduced the incidence of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea, highlighting their potential as supportive care agents in oncology. However, their impact on significant complications, surgical site infections, length of hospital stay, and survival outcomes remains inconclusive.

### Workshop report: Modulation of antitumor immune responses by dietary and microbial metabolites [^115rxfKx]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2017). Low credibility.

The human microbiota maintains an enormous and diverse capacity to produce a diet-dependent metabolome that impacts both host tissue and microbial community homeostasis. Recent discoveries support a growing appreciation that microbial metabolites derived from bioactive foods are also important regulators of host immune and metabolic functions. To gain a better understanding of the evidence for the roles of dietary and microbial metabolites in tumor immunity, the Division of Cancer Biology and the Division of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute, cosponsored a workshop on August 31 and September 1, 2016, in Bethesda, Maryland.

Workshop participants examined several lines of converging science that link nutrition, microbiology, and tumor immunology and identified key concepts and research opportunities that will accelerate our understanding of these interactions. In addition, the participants identified some of the critical gaps and research challenges that could be addressed through interdisciplinary collaborations, including future opportunities for translating new information into novel cancer prevention and treatment strategies based on targeting host immune functions that are altered by metabolite sensing pathways.

### The role of gut microbiota in cancer treatment: Friend or foe [^116bze3a]. Gut (2020). Low credibility.

The gut microbiota has been implicated in cancer and shown to modulate anticancer drug efficacy. Altered gut microbiota is associated with resistance to chemo drugs or immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), whereas supplementation of distinct bacterial species restores responses to the anticancer drugs. Accumulating evidence has revealed the potential of modulating the gut microbiota to enhance the efficacy of anticancer drugs. Regardless of the valuable findings by preclinical models and clinical data of patients with cancer, a more thorough understanding of the interactions of the microbiota with cancer therapy helps researchers identify novel strategies for cancer prevention, stratify patients for more effective treatment, and reduce treatment complications.

In this review, we discuss the scientific evidence on the role of gut microbiota in cancer treatment and highlight the latest knowledge and technologies leveraged to target specific bacteria that contribute to tumorigenesis.

- **Overview of the role**: The gut microbiota in cancer establishes the links between bacteria, inflammation, and cancer treatment.

- **Mechanisms of bacterial modulation**: Distinct bacterial species modulate cancer growth, immune responses, and the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs and ICIs.

- **Approaches to modulation**: Various methods to modulate the gut microbiota and their potential in translational research are demonstrated.

- **Limitations and future directions**: The limitations of microbiome research in the context of cancer treatment, ongoing efforts to overcome these challenges, and future perspectives are discussed.

### The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement on the definition and scope of synbiotics [^114LA7CG]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

A synergistic synbiotic is a type in which the substrate is designed to be selectively utilized by the co-administered microorganisms. The live microorganism is selected based on its ability to provide a health benefit, and the substrate is chosen to primarily support the growth or activity of that selected microorganism. Although the substrate might also enrich other beneficial members of the gastrointestinal microbiota, its main target is the ingested microorganism.

Designing and demonstrating the efficacy of a synergistic synbiotic is experimentally challenging. Nearly all synbiotics used in published clinical trials or available commercially are of the complementary form, irrespective of whether they have been deliberately designed or named as such.

- **Design and mechanisms of action of complementary and synergistic synbiotics**: Two approaches to designing synbiotics are presented. The complementary approach combines a prebiotic and a probiotic that work independently to elicit one or more health benefits. Both the prebiotic and probiotic must meet applicable criteria. The prebiotic functions by modulating the resident microbiota in a manner associated with an improved health outcome. The synergistic approach involves selecting a substrate that is utilized by the co-administered live microorganism, enhancing its functionality.

### The role of the microbiome in cancer development and therapy [^114rz27Q]. CA Cancer J Clin (2017). High credibility.

The human body harbors enormous numbers of microbiota that influence cancer susceptibility, in part through their prodigious metabolic capacity and profound influence on immune cell function. Microbial pathogens drive tumorigenesis in 15% to 20% of cancer cases. Even larger numbers of malignancies are associated with altered composition of commensal microbiota (dysbiosis) based on microbiome studies using metagenomic sequencing. Although association studies cannot distinguish whether changes in microbiota are causes or effects of cancer, a causative role is supported by rigorously controlled preclinical studies using gnotobiotic mouse models colonized with one or more specific bacteria. These studies demonstrate that microbiota can alter cancer susceptibility and progression through diverse mechanisms, such as modulating inflammation, inducing DNA damage, and producing metabolites involved in oncogenesis or tumor suppression.

Evidence is emerging that microbiota can be manipulated for improving cancer treatment. By incorporating probiotics as adjuvants for checkpoint immunotherapy or by designing small molecules that target microbial enzymes, microbiota can be harnessed to improve cancer care.

### Dietary interventions in cancer: A systematic review of all randomized controlled trials [^111gmX7t]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2024). High credibility.

Prior systematic reviews addressing the impact of diet on cancer outcomes have focused on specific dietary interventions. In this systematic review, we assessed all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating dietary interventions for cancer patients, examining the range of interventions, endpoints, patient populations, and results.

- **Methods**: This systematic review identified all RCTs conducted before January 2023 testing dietary interventions in patients with cancer. Assessed outcomes included quality of life, functional outcomes, clinical cancer measurements (e.g. progression-free survival, response rates), overall survival, and translational endpoints (e.g. inflammatory markers).

- **Results**: In total, 252 RCTs were identified involving 31,067 patients. The median sample size was 71 (interquartile range 41 to 118), and 80 (32%) studies had a sample size greater than 100. Most trials (n = 184, 73%) were conducted in the adjuvant setting. Weight or body composition and translational endpoints were the most common primary endpoints (n = 64, 25%; n = 52, 21%, respectively). Direct cancer measurements and overall survival were primary endpoints in 20 (8%) and 7 (3%) studies, respectively. Eight trials with a primary endpoint of cancer measurement (40%) met their endpoint. Large trials in colon (n = 1429), breast (n = 3088), and prostate cancer (n = 478) each showed no effect of dietary interventions on endpoints measuring cancer.

- **Conclusion**: Most RCTs of dietary interventions in cancer are small and measure nonclinical endpoints.

### A human, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of prebiotic, probiotic, and synbiotic supplementation: Effects on luminal, inflammatory, epigenetic, and epithelial biomarkers of colorectal cancer [^112AC1kw]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Diet is an important factor in colorectal carcinogenesis; thus, dietary supplements may have a role in colorectal cancer prevention.

- **Objective**: The objective was to establish the relative luminal, epithelial, and epigenetic consequences of prebiotic, probiotic, and synbiotic dietary supplementation in humans.

- **Design**: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-week crossover trial of resistant starch and Bifidobacterium lactis, either alone or as a combined synbiotic preparation, in 20 human volunteers. Rectal biopsy, feces, and serum samples were collected. The rectal mucosal endpoints were DNA methylation at 16 CpG island loci and LINE-1, epithelial proliferation (Ki67 immunohistochemistry), and crypt cellularity. The fecal endpoints were short-chain fatty acid concentrations, pH, ammonia, and microbiological profiles (by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing). Serum endpoints were a panel of cytokines and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.

- **Results**: Seventeen subjects completed the entire study. The synbiotic intervention fostered a significantly different fecal stream bacterial community than did either the prebiotic (P = 0.032) or the probiotic (P = 0.001) intervention alone, in part because of a greater proportion of patients harboring fecal Lachnospiraceae spp. These changes developed in the absence of any significant differences in fecal chemistry. There were no differences in epithelial kinetics.

- **Conclusions**: This synbiotic supplementation with B. lactis and resistant starch, in the doses used, induced unique changes.

### The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement on the definition and scope of synbiotics [^11448VBH]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

The panel recognized that a common usage of the term synbiotic includes products combining a probiotic and a prebiotic. Such a combination product might lack evidence of co-dependent function but is designed for the components to work independently to promote an observed health benefit. The panel agreed that such a formulation could be considered a synbiotic, provided that the components meet their respective probiotic and prebiotic definitions.

Thus, the probiotic strain(s) is chosen based on the benefits it provides to the host, while the prebiotic is designed to promote the growth and activities of beneficial members of the indigenous microbiota, providing a health benefit. Furthermore, a combination of probiotic and prebiotic must be tested to confirm that a health benefit is conferred by the combined formulation compared with a placebo. Otherwise, the product should not be labeled a synbiotic. Based on these qualifiers, the panel retained the definition that a combination of a probiotic and a prebiotic be denoted as a complementary synbiotic.

- **Synbiotic categories**: Synbiotics can be formulated using two approaches. A complementary synbiotic comprises a probiotic plus a prebiotic (more than one of each can be used), working independently to achieve one or more health benefits. The probiotic and prebiotic components of the complementary synbiotic must meet the minimum criteria as stipulated previously. A synergistic synbiotic is composed of a live microorganism and a selectively utilized substrate.

### Potential beneficial role of probiotics on the outcome of COVID-19 patients: An evolving perspective [^117GtyCf]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Low credibility.

Probiotics can support the body's systems in fighting viral infections. This review aims to focus on the knowledge about the use of probiotics as adjuvant therapy for COVID-19 patients.

- **Methods**: We performed extensive research using the PubMed-LitCovid, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases, and conducted manual searches on Google Scholar, Elsevier Connect, and Web of Science on this issue.

- **Results**: We found several papers reporting data on the potential role of probiotics, as well as contrasting experimental data.

- **Conclusions**: Most data show positive results demonstrating that probiotics can play a significant role in fighting SARS-CoV-2 infection. They seem effective in lowering inflammatory status, especially in patients with chronic comorbidities such as cancer and diabetes, thus improving clinical outcomes.

### MASCC/ISOO clinical practice guidelines for the management of mucositis secondary to cancer therapy [^113i21a9]. Cancer (2020). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced mucositis, specifically with respect to the prevention of oral mucositis using oral glutamine, the ISOO/MASCC 2020 guidelines suggest offering oral glutamine for the prevention of oral mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer receiving concomitant radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

### Dietary supplements and cancer prevention: balancing potential benefits against proven harms [^111mY7h2]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2012). Low credibility.

Nutritional supplementation has become a multibillion-dollar industry, with about half of all US adults taking supplements. The use of supplements is driven partly by the belief that they can prevent chronic diseases, including cancer. However, several expert committees and organizations have found little to no scientific evidence supporting the idea that supplements reduce cancer risk. On the contrary, evidence now suggests that high doses of some supplements can increase cancer risk. Despite this, marketing claims from the supplement industry continue to suggest anticancer benefits.

Insufficient government regulation of the marketing of dietary supplement products may result in unsound advice to consumers. It is crucial for both the scientific community and government regulators to provide clear guidance to the public regarding the use of dietary supplements for cancer risk reduction.

### The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement on the definition and scope of synbiotics [^116jAdjY]. Nature Reviews. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Across studies, species from the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Streptococcus are the most commonly used live microorganisms within the formulations tested. The substrate components are usually galacto-oligosaccharides, inulin, or fructo-oligosaccharides, but doses vary considerably, from as low as 100 mg to as much as 10–15 g per day. For example, in a double-blind RCT, twice daily consumption of a synbiotic composed of Lactobacillus acidophilus 10 (10^9 CFU), Lactobacillus rhamnosus HS111 (10^9 CFU), Lactobacillus casei 10 (10^9 CFU), Bifidobacterium bifidum (10^9 CFU), and fructo-oligosaccharides (100 mg) 4 days before and 10 days after surgery for periampullary neoplasms resulted in a lower number of postoperative infections, shorter duration of antibiotic therapy, fewer non-infectious complications, shorter length of hospital stay, and reduced mortality compared to patients receiving a placebo (sucrose). Although such low doses would not be expected to provide a prebiotic effect in complementary synbiotics, they could, in theory, be sufficient to stimulate a cognate microorganism in a synergistic synbiotic formulation.

In one RCT of 225 adults with overweight and obesity, a combination of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 420 and polydextrose (12 g per day) resulted in a relative reduction in body fat mass of 4.5%, whereas the individual treatments had no effect. However, selective utilization was not established in this study. Thus, by itself, this study does not provide sufficient evidence that the tested combination was either a complementary or a synergistic synbiotic.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of probiotics on bone outcomes in rodent models [^116mMxzm]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Low credibility.

A total of 3,252 articles were identified using MEDLINE (n = 678), Embase (n = 1,560), CINAHL Complete (n = 124), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (n = 80), and Web of Science (n = 810). No additional articles were found after searching grey literature and reference lists of relevant publications. After the removal of 1,164 duplicates, 2,088 studies were included for title and abstract screening. From this list, 220 studies progressed to full-text review and were assessed for eligibility. At this stage, 149 articles were excluded for one or more of the following reasons: not a full-text publication in English, not a rodent model, no oral administration or consumption of a probiotic intervention, none of the specified primary outcomes reported, or studies with no comparator group(s). Overall, this systematic review consisted of data synthesis from 71 included studies.

### Probiotics for the prevention or treatment of chemotherapy- or radiotherapy-related diarrhoea in people with cancer [^116uPQmS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Treatment-related diarrhoea is one of the most common and troublesome adverse effects associated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy in people with cancer. Its reported incidence has been as high as 50% to 80%. Severe treatment-related diarrhoea can lead to fluid and electrolyte losses, nutritional deficiencies, and could adversely affect quality of life (QoL). It is also associated with an increased risk of infection in people with neutropenia due to anticancer therapy and often leads to treatment delays, dose reductions, or treatment discontinuation. Probiotics may be effective in preventing or treating chemotherapy- or radiotherapy-induced diarrhoea.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and side effects of probiotics used alone or combined with other agents for the prevention or treatment of chemotherapy- or radiotherapy-related diarrhoea in people with cancer.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to July week 2, 2017), and Embase (1980 to 2017, week 30). We also searched prospective clinical trial registers and the reference lists of included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of probiotics for prevention or treatment of chemotherapy- or radiotherapy-related diarrhoea in people with cancer.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used random-effects models for all meta-analyses. If meta-analysis was not possible, we summarized findings narratively.

### Probiotics in 2015: Their scope and use [^111xw4pP]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The field of probiotics continues to evolve and progress. This paper reviews several situations within the probiotic field that are of interest, including the scope of the proper use of the term "probiotic", the use of systematic reviews and meta-analyses for probiotics, regulatory challenges to conducting human research on probiotics in the United States, medical recommendations for probiotic use, and safety assurance for probiotics used for vulnerable populations.

The greatest need in the probiotic field remains well-conducted and well-reported human trials to better define the functionality of probiotics for different indications and populations.

### Novel clinical trial designs emerging from the molecular reclassification of cancer [^111AtJeU]. CA (2025). High credibility.

The microbiome consists of diverse microorganism communities in the human body. It includes viruses, bacteria, fungi, and eukaryotes that colonize human body surfaces. The microbiome can play a role in carcinogenesis, activating aberrant signaling pathways and eliciting immunosuppressive effects. Gut microorganisms can affect anticancer treatment efficacy for both chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Modulation of the microbiome may improve immunotherapy efficacy. Thus, an understanding of each individual microbiome can help with the further personalization of therapy.

With the vast amount of data generated by multiomic approaches, it can be difficult to integrate all of the information to optimize anticancer therapy for each individual. **Artificial intelligence**: AI and machine learning can be exploited to analyze multimodal-omics data and optimize clinical integration. Therefore, although our understanding of cancer remains incomplete, additional technologies beyond genomics may provide further insight into cancer biology.

A better understanding of the drivers of tumor growth and which molecular alterations should be prioritized as therapeutic targets may be revealed by such methodologies as transcriptomics, proteomics, functional impact, epigenomics, metabolomics, immunomics, and the microbiome. Future precision medicine oncology clinical trials and studies should combine these methodologies with genomic testing to better evaluate their role in optimizing cancer therapy.

### Why do ACG and AGA guidelines differ for the use of probiotics and the prevention of CDI [^111ZzmsQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

In the recent publication of the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines for Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI), Kelly et al. recommended against probiotics for the primary prevention of CDI (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence) and for preventing CDI recurrences (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). These ACG guidelines failed to account for the strain specificity associated with probiotic efficacy by basing their conclusions on data pooling disparate types of probiotics together, often resulting in a biased efficacy measurement. When different probiotics are analyzed accounting for strain specificity, some strains show significant efficacy, whereas others do not. Additionally, Kelly et al. based their recommendations on only one underpowered randomized trial (RCT) to detect a significant effect on CDI and several meta-analyses that did not account for strain specificity.

When the American Gastroenterology Association published their guidelines for CDI, they reviewed 39 RCTs, accounted for strain specificity in their analysis, and determined that four different types of probiotics could be recommended for CDI. Both guidelines point out the need for more RCTs of probiotics for CDI to increase the strength of the evidence for both primary and secondary prevention of CDI.

### International cancer microbiome consortium consensus statement on the role of the human microbiome in carcinogenesis [^113CfhLj]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

- **Key directions for future research**: With the aims of making a more definitive statement regarding causality and generating true translational impact, the consortium suggested several key directions for future work on the microbiome and cancer.

	- **Large, longitudinal international cohort studies**: Proving causation in cancer is difficult because of the lag between exposure and phenotype and the complex interactive nature of potential causative factors. However, these difficulties can be overcome by conducting large, international, longitudinal cohort studies as exemplified by the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) and Framingham studies. The execution of such studies within the microbiome field is not without challenge but is necessary to move from testing association to causation.

	- **Increased focus on interventional studies**: Observational studies have provided valuable knowledge regarding microbiome composition and function in cancer; however, more emphasis must be placed on interventional research to translate this knowledge to patient benefit. We need to develop our understanding of how manipulation of the microbiome can impact cancer. For example, early studies have suggested that antibiotic use may increase cancer risk.

	- **Integration with other oncology research**: One way to deliver the above objectives is through integration with ongoing oncology research efforts.

### Microbiota boost immunotherapy? A meta-analysis dives into fecal microbiota transplantation and immune checkpoint inhibitors [^116GNqC5]. BMC Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Although fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has shown initial promise in immunotherapy, its clinical application remains in the early exploratory stages, with several controversies and uncertainties.

- **Heterogeneity in clinical research**: There is considerable heterogeneity in clinical research on the impact of FMT on the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Some studies have reported that FMT can substantially improve ICI response rates. For instance, a clinical trial involving melanoma patients demonstrated that 40% (6/15) of patients experienced benefit when treated with FMT in combination with PD-1 inhibitors. Another trial on melanoma similarly demonstrated positive outcomes with the combination of FMT and ICIs. However, other studies did not observe significant benefits from FMT.

- **Variability in outcomes**: This variability in outcomes may be attributed to several key factors, including donor dietary habits and gut microbiota diversity, recipient immune status and tumor immunogenicity, microbiota screening and functional analysis criteria, as well as the optimization of transplantation dosage and frequency. However, the optimal protocol for implementing FMT has yet to be established.

Critical parameters, such as large-scale randomized controlled trials, interdisciplinary research, and long-term efficacy assessments, require further optimization. Clinical trials must rigorously standardize microbiota management and protocol implementation, establishing stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria for different tumor types and stages across diverse ethnic and geographical patient populations.

### Considering the supraorganism: Harnessing the gut microbiome for cancer prevention, detection, and treatment [^1149x4Hm]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Causal relationships between specific microbes and cancer are well recognized. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that the broader community of gut microbes may influence cancer risk, provide diagnostic insight, shape clinical course, and impact treatment success in the gastrointestinal tract and beyond. In this issue, Murphy et al. reviewed evidence for the role of the microbiome in clinical oncology. Given that the gut microbiome may be modified by treatments ranging from diet and live biotherapeutics to microbial transplantation, microbiome-directed therapies hold tremendous promise for personalized therapies and improved treatment outcomes.

### Dietary synbiotics reduce cancer risk factors in polypectomized and colon cancer patients [^1145TYZm]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Animal studies suggest that prebiotics and probiotics exert protective effects against tumor development in the colon, but human data supporting this suggestion are weak. The objective was to verify whether the prebiotic concept (selective interaction with colonic flora of nondigested carbohydrates), as induced by a synbiotic preparation — oligofructose-enriched inulin (SYN1), Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 (BB12) — is able to reduce the risk of colon cancer in humans.

The 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a synbiotic food composed of the prebiotic SYN1 and probiotics LGG and BB12 was conducted in 37 colon cancer patients and 43 polypectomized patients. Fecal and blood samples were obtained before, during, and after the intervention, and colorectal biopsy samples were obtained before and after the intervention. The effect of synbiotic consumption on a battery of intermediate biomarkers for colon cancer was examined.

- **Results**: Synbiotic intervention resulted in significant changes in fecal flora: Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus increased, and Clostridium perfringens decreased. The intervention significantly reduced colorectal proliferation, and the capacity of fecal water to induce necrosis in colonic cells and improve epithelial barrier function in polypectomized patients. Genotoxicity assays of colonic biopsy samples indicated a decreased exposure to genotoxins in polypectomized patients at the end of the intervention period. Synbiotic consumption prevented an increased secretion of inflammatory markers, although the end of the sentence appears truncated.

### Probiotic supplementation during antibiotic treatment is unjustified in maintaining the gut microbiome diversity: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115txB9P]. BMC Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The main strength of the study is the high level of evidence for our quantitative results, as we included only randomized controlled trials in our review and meta-analysis. Moreover, to our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis and the most comprehensive review of the topic at the time of writing. We followed the strict guidelines of Cochrane recommendations and the PRISMA Statement when performing our systematic review and meta-analysis, which strengthens our results.

Although we identified all relevant studies published on the topic without setting restrictions on microbial variables, we acknowledge the limited availability of eligible articles. Our strict inclusion criterion of using only results from randomized controlled trials ensured the highest level of evidence, despite potentially reducing the number of included articles and cases. This emphasizes the necessity for further high-quality studies. Due to the small sample sizes and the limited number of studies, the results of the meta-analysis of the investigated diversity indices should be approached with caution. We could not perform a quantitative synthesis of much of the data due to insufficient reporting and high variability in the methods and indices used to measure and describe gut microbial composition and diversity. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) are generally considered a more accurate method to represent groups of DNA sequences than operational taxonomic units (OTUs), as they do not rely on arbitrary similarity thresholds and can identify individual variants within a taxon. However, due to the lack of…

### The role of gut microbiota in cancer treatment: Friend or foe [^115DffH5]. Gut (2020). Low credibility.

Accumulating evidence has underscored the critical role of the gut microbiota in cancer therapies. Some bacterial species are essential for the antitumor effect of cancer treatment, whereas other species attenuate the efficacy of cancer drugs via diverse mechanisms. Given the relationships between host, gut microbiota, and cancer treatments, research efforts have been directed to investigate the mechanisms used by bacteria to modulate patients' response to treatment and their clinical outcomes.

In this review, we explored the dynamic interactions between the host, the gut microbiota, and various cancer treatments, including chemotherapies and immunotherapies. Regardless of the recent advances in the field of microbiome research, limitations of research hamper the clinical applications of bacterial therapies. Notably, strong associations between distinct bacterial species and cancers have been established, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive and need extensive validation via preclinical models and clinical trials.

Recently, findings supported the potential of microbial markers or enterotypes in cancer diagnosis and prognosis, the potential of phage therapies in targeted delivery of cancer drugs, and the potential of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) or probiotics in remodeling the tumor microenvironment or in potentiating antitumor immunity. The role of the microbiota in cancer is context-dependent. Bacteria interact with a plethora of host, as well as exogenous factors in patients with cancer, and influence tumorigenesis via diverse mechanisms.

### The role of gut microbiota in cancer treatment: Friend or foe [^117RSVwV]. Gut (2020). Low credibility.

**Key messages**: The gut microbiota has been implicated in cancer and shown to modulate the efficacy of anticancer treatment. Altered gut microbiota is associated with resistance to chemotherapy drugs or immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Modulating the microbiota via antibiotics, probiotics, fecal microbiota transplant, or nanotechnologies may potentiate the antitumor effects of chemotherapy drugs or ICIs. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest the use of tumor-associated bacteria as diagnostic or prognostic markers for cancer. Microbial signature may be used to stratify patients with cancer for more effective treatment or to reduce treatment complications.

### Integrative medicine across the pediatric cancer care trajectory: A narrative review [^116uSmHP]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Non-herbal dietary supplements

Several RCTs have investigated the use of non-herbal dietary supplements such as glutamine and vitamin E (tocopherol), as well as prebiotics and probiotics in the pediatric oncology setting. A study from the U.S. found that glutamine was well tolerated and associated with improved sensory function and overall QoL in children and adolescents undergoing vincristine treatment for leukemia, lymphoma, extracranial solid tumors, and medulloblastoma. Parenteral glutamine was shown to be safe and effective in reducing oral stomatitis in a retrospective observational study of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, when compared to controls receiving standard care alone. An RCT of oral glutamine supplementation showed a reduced onset of oral mucositis, with a lower duration of hospitalization and expenditures in children and adolescents undergoing consolidation chemotherapy with high-dose methotrexate for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, in another RCT among children with varied pediatric malignancies, no beneficial effect was found with oral glutamine in preventing chemotherapy-induced mucositis, though a reduced need for and duration of parenteral nutrition was observed in the oral glutamine-treated group.

### Towards modulating the gut microbiota to enhance the efficacy of immune-checkpoint inhibitors [^114iATLN]. Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

The gut microbiota modulates immune processes both locally and systemically, including how the immune system reacts to emerging tumors, whether antitumor immune responses are reactivated during treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and whether unintended destructive immune pathologies accompany such treatment. Advances over the past decade have established that the gut microbiota is a promising target and that modulation of the microbiota might overcome resistance to ICIs and improve the safety of treatment. However, the specific mechanisms through which the microbiota modulates antitumor immunity remain unclear.

Understanding the biology underpinning microbial associations with clinical outcomes in patients receiving ICIs and the landscape of a 'healthy' microbiota would provide a critical foundation to facilitate opportunities to effectively manipulate the microbiota and thus improve patient outcomes. In this review, we explore the role of diet and the gut microbiota in shaping immune responses during treatment with ICIs and highlight the key challenges in leveraging the gut microbiome as a practical tool for the clinical management of patients with cancer.

Immunotherapy has become a new paradigm in oncology, improving outcomes for several types of cancer. However, some aspects of its management remain uncertain. One of the key points needing better understanding is the interaction between immunotherapy and the gut microbiome, and how modulation of the microbiome might modify the efficacy of immunotherapy. Consequently, the negative impact of systemic antibiotics and corticosteroids on the efficacy of immunotherapy needs to be clarified.

### Probiotic supplementation during antibiotic treatment is unjustified in maintaining the gut microbiome diversity: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111gWtK3]. BMC Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Antibiotic treatment affects the gut bacterial microbiota both quantitatively and qualitatively, causing a decrease or even extinction of certain species, leading to a low-diversity microbiome. This can allow some potentially harmful bacteria, such as Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, or Clostridioides difficile, to become dominant. This microbial imbalance is known as dysbiosis. Deviation from the normal microbiome has been linked to conditions such as obesity, malnutrition, inflammatory bowel disease, neurological dysfunctions, and cancer. Although the gut microbiota can spontaneously recover, its restoration is influenced by various host and external factors, including age, health status, geographical area of origin, dose, duration, and the spectrum of antibiotic treatment.

Young, healthy adults typically possess stable microbial community functions. However, repeated disturbances of the ecosystem are particularly detrimental if there is insufficient time for recovery after initial impairment. Previous research has demonstrated that the gut microbiota generally recovers within about two weeks following a single antibiotic exposure in adults, but repeated exposures can significantly prolong the recovery time.

### The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement on the definition and scope of synbiotics [^1147XBS2]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

Regulatory authorities are primarily focused on two issues: product safety and product labeling. These encompass both truthfulness and compliance with regulatory statutes. Even if the term synbiotic is not included in governmental guidelines or regulations, the use of the proposed scientific definition of the term will aid regulatory oversight of products labeled as 'synbiotic'.

Regulatory statutes differ with regard to geographical regions, regulatory categories, types of allowable claims, and premarket approval. Furthermore, different standards exist for manufacturing, efficacy, and safety depending on geographical region and product category. The term synbiotic does not stipulate a regulatory category, so, simply stated, regulatory requirements for a synbiotic would need to meet those that apply to the category (for example, drug, food, or supplement) of the marketed product.

Regulatory complications can result in regions that impose probiotic-specific regulations. For example, Canada, Italy, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Brazil have requirements specific to probiotic foods or supplements. Furthermore, there is a proposal under consideration by Codex Alimentarius that could result in probiotic-specific global standards. The Codex Alimentarius is a collection of standards, guidelines, and codes of practice adopted under the auspices of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations and World Health Organization to protect consumer health and promote fair practices in food trade. Codex Alimentarius standards could affect probiotic products.

### The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement on the definition and scope of synbiotics [^117HCdog]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

In May 2019, the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) convened a panel of nutritionists, physiologists, and microbiologists to review the definition and scope of synbiotics. The panel updated the definition of a synbiotic to "a mixture comprising live microorganisms and substrate(s) selectively utilized by host microorganisms that confers a health benefit on the host".

The panel concluded that defining synbiotics simply as a mixture of probiotics and prebiotics could suppress the innovation of synbiotics that are designed to function cooperatively. Requiring that each component must meet the evidence and dose requirements for probiotics and prebiotics individually could also present an obstacle. Rather, the panel clarified that:

- **Complementary synbiotic**: This type, not designed for its components to function cooperatively, must be composed of a probiotic plus a prebiotic.

- **Synergistic synbiotic**: This synbiotic is when the substrate is designed to be selectively utilized by the co-administered microorganisms.

This consensus statement further explores the levels of evidence (existing and required), safety, effects upon targets, and implications for stakeholders of the synbiotic concept.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the efficacy and safety of probiotics in people with cancer [^1136Rrhm]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Probiotics are living microorganisms that confer a health benefit on the host when administered. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigates the efficacy and safety of probiotics in adult and pediatric patients diagnosed with cancer.

- **Methods**: A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken (PROSPERO registration: CRD42016050252). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), identified through screening multiple databases, were included for analysis of efficacy. Non-randomized controlled trials and case reports were included for safety analysis. Outcomes included the reduction in the incidence and severity of diarrhea, as well as adverse events. Where possible, data were combined for meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Planned subgroup analyses were not possible due to marked heterogeneity of study characteristics.

- **Results**: Twenty-one studies (N = 2982 participants) were included for assessment of efficacy. Probiotics may reduce the incidence of diarrhea in patients with cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34–0.78, 95% prediction interval (PI) 0.3–0.92, I-sq 36.9%, 5 studies] and the duration of pyrexia [standardized mean difference 0.39 days, 95% CI 0.35–0.43, I-sq 0.01%, 5 studies]. Twenty-five studies (N = 2242) were included in the safety analysis. Five case reports showed probiotic-related bacteremia/fungemia/positive blood cultures. Definitions and reporting of adverse events were variable and inconsistent.

- **Conclusions**: There remain insufficient studies to assess the true effect of probiotics in people with cancer.

### The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement on the definition and scope of synbiotics [^113HrZBX]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

The qualifier 'established' refers to a probiotic or prebiotic that meets the requirements of the globally accepted definitions from the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics consensus. Studies are conducted in the target host.

- **Example 1**: In a blinded four-arm study, 41 healthy volunteers received either Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bi-07 (10^9 CFU per day), 8 g per day xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS), the combination of both, or an inert maltodextrin control for 21 days. XOS enhanced bifidobacteria counts in faeces in both the synbiotic and prebiotic groups compared with the control and improved plasma lipid profiles, modulated markers of immune function in healthy adults. The lowest reported use of analgesics was observed during combination supplementation along with a reduced expression of CD19 on B cells (as markers of immune function). Thus, the combination exerted certain benefits that were not afforded by the probiotic or prebiotic alone. This study shows a prebiotic status for XOS used at 8 g per day. Previous evidence supports that Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bi-07 at 10^9 CFU per day met criteria for a probiotic. Taken together, this tested product meets our definition of a complementary synbiotic. However, because an increase of Bifidobacterium was not observed in individuals fed the combination product, it does not meet our definition of a synergistic synbiotic.

### Evidence-based guidelines for use of probiotics in preterm neonates [^1152RfsZ]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Evidence indicates that probiotic supplementation significantly reduces all-cause mortality and definite necrotizing enterocolitis without significant adverse effects in preterm neonates. As the debate about the pros and cons of routine probiotic supplementation continues, many institutions are satisfied with the evidence and wish to use probiotics routinely. Due to the lack of detail on many practical aspects of probiotic supplementation, clinician-friendly guidelines are urgently needed to optimize the use of probiotics in preterm neonates.

- **Aim**: To develop evidence-based guidelines for probiotic supplementation in preterm neonates.

- **Methods**: To develop core guidelines on the use of probiotics, including strain selection, dose, and duration of supplementation, we primarily used data from our recent updated systematic review of randomized controlled trials. For equally important issues, including strain identification, monitoring for adverse effects, product format, storage and transport, and regulatory hurdles, a comprehensive literature search covering the period 1966–2010, without restriction on the study design, was conducted using the databases PubMed and EMBASE, as well as the proceedings of scientific conferences. These data were utilized in our updated systematic review.

- **Results**: In this review, we present guidelines, including the level of evidence, for the practical aspects (such as strain selection, dose, duration, clinical and laboratory surveillance) of probiotic supplementation, and for addressing non-clinical but important issues.

### Targeted approaches for in situ gut microbiome manipulation [^112wPizF]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2020). Low credibility.

The gut microbiome represents a rational target for the prevention and treatment of gut-mediated disorders. The use of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics is a way to selectively target beneficial microbes at the expense of those seen to be detrimental. Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when included in the diet in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit. They are most commonly administered in dairy foods and beverages, or dried versions are provided as pills, capsules, or mixtures that can be added to foods. Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are the most frequently used probiotics. Both groups have been shown to stimulate immune processes and inhibit pathogens.

Prebiotics are ingredients selectively utilized by populations of host microorganisms that confer a health benefit. For gut effects, a prebiotic must escape mammalian digestion and be utilized selectively by a restricted group of microorganisms that have been clearly identified to have health-promoting properties, usually in the colon.

- **Synbiotics**: These are physical combinations of probiotics and prebiotics that together confer a health benefit.

Prebiotic substances may be present in isolated form or in foods. To meet the criterion of being "utilized selectively", they must affect a limited range of microbes rather than substantial portions of the microbiome. The most commonly studied prebiotics are soluble fibers, inulin, fructooligosaccharides, galactooligosaccharides (GOSs), and, more recently, human milk oligosaccharides at the time of writing.

### Microbiota-centered interventions: The next breakthrough in immuno-oncology [^11125vw7]. Cancer Discovery (2021). Low credibility.

The cancer-immune dialogue subject to immuno-oncological intervention is profoundly influenced by microenvironmental factors. Indeed, the mucosal microbiota — and more specifically, the intestinal ecosystem — affects the tone of anticancer immune responses and the clinical benefit of immunotherapy. Antibiotics blunt the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), and fecal microbial transplantation may restore the responsiveness of ICI-resistant melanoma.

Here, we review the yin and yang of intestinal bacteria at the crossroads between the intestinal barrier, metabolism, and local or systemic immune responses during anticancer therapies. We discuss diagnostic tools to identify gut dysbiosis and the future prospects of microbiota-based therapeutic interventions.

- **Significance**: Given the recent proof of concept regarding the potential efficacy of fecal microbial transplantation in patients with melanoma primarily resistant to PD-1 blockade, it is timely to discuss how and why antibiotics compromise the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. We describe the balance between beneficial and harmful microbial species in play during therapies and introduce the potential for microbiota-centered interventions for the future of immuno-oncology.

### Microbiome modulation for the treatment of solid neoplasms [^111TEWZk]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

The human microbiome is an ecosystem of microorganisms composed primarily of bacteria that symbiotically interact with the body. The gut microbiome's interplay with the immune system makes microbiome modulation a focus for treating solid malignancies responsive to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Common strategies to modulate the gut microbiome, including prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), have shown clinical activity in patients with advanced solid malignancies receiving ICIs. By contrast, other approaches, such as postbiotics and vitamin supplementation, have not demonstrated meaningful clinical benefit.

- **Clinical appraisals**: In this review, we critically appraised studies addressing the gut microbiome modulation combined with ICIs in patients with solid malignancies. Figure 1 summarizes the main microbiome modulation approaches, their limitations, and relevant ongoing clinical trials in oncology.

### Guideline for the management of infection in children and adolescents with cancer and pediatric hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation recipients [^1154xCEn]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

This recommendation refers to the administration of a probiotic during a CDI episode as an adjunct to CDI-directed antibiotic therapy, not as secondary prophylaxis. Three trials examined probiotics or prebiotics for the treatment of CDI (Data Supplement). No children were included in any of these studies, and only one patient with cancer was included. All studies compared the intervention with placebo when used as an adjuvant to standard antibiotic therapy for CDI. Probiotics or prebiotics significantly reduced CDI recurrence (RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.77).

- **Weighing potential efficacy and risks**: The panel weighed the potential efficacy of these agents to reduce CDI recurrence against the potential for invasive infection raised in Recommendation 1. Given the lack of direct efficacy and safety data in children with cancer and pediatric HSCT patients, the panel made a weak recommendation against the routine use of probiotics to treat CDI.

### Probiotics in the United States [^111rdcpk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Probiotics are live microbial products that have a defined health benefit. Scientific research has established that there are validated indications for the use of some probiotics available in the United States; however, in many cases, they are often used for conditions for which no benefit has been established.

This article reviews the uses of probiotics in the United States, as well as the state of regulatory issues surrounding probiotics. Although the use and scientific understanding of probiotics are rapidly increasing, it is evident that there is a need to clarify the regulatory issues, which, at present, are unclear and subject to misinterpretation.

In addition to efficacy, safety issues must be considered in determining when and how probiotics are to be used.

### Cancer pharmacomicrobiomics: targeting microbiota to optimise cancer therapy outcomes [^1139RvaM]. Gut (2022). Low credibility.

Therapeutic resistance and toxicity are major stumbling blocks in cancer therapy. Tremendous efforts have been put forth to predict treatment outcomes and optimize treatment response. Gut microbes are undeniably potential candidates for being predictive biomarkers and treatment targets. Despite the exciting results, the future is not without challenges, including an inadequate mechanistic understanding of microbiota modulation on therapeutic response, undetermined microbial signatures as biomarkers, and the lack of consensus on the optimal microbiota modulation method. Moreover, studies focus mainly on bacteria, but commensal viruses, fungi, and archaea also have an unneglectable role in cancers. Of note, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) transfers not only bacteria but also other non-bacterial microbes, yet their effects on recipients are unclear, which raises potential safety concerns.

- **Concerted efforts** are required to overcome challenges lying ahead. First, more functional investigations and prospective longitudinal human studies are needed to dissect the biological complexity of host–microbes–drug interactions. Rigorous identification of the key microbes affecting treatment outcome is the prerequisite for clinical translation. Future studies should go beyond bacteria. A recent study demonstrated that depleting gut bacteria could lead to commensal fungi overgrowth, reducing the radiotherapy-induced anticancer immunity.

### An update on the use and investigation of probiotics in health and disease [^116J6b8H]. Gut (2013). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Several molecular and cellular steps in the carcinogenic pathways have been defined, and evidence indicates a prominent causative role for environmental factors, including obesity and diet. Both factors are associated with changes in the gut microbiome. It is noteworthy that tumor incidence and mass are greater in conventional than in germ-free rodents. Taken together, these findings strongly support the concept that the microbiota play some role in CRC, but causality remains to be confirmed. Sears et al. have presented evidence that enterotoxigenic B. fragilis, for example, may trigger E. cadherin catabolism, provoke intestinal inflammation, and thereby increase the risk of colonic cancer. Others have analyzed the microbiology in patients with CRC and suggested that bacterial diversity is less, altered, or accompanied by high levels of Fusobacterium nucleatum sequences.

Studies in rodents have concentrated on probiotic effects on precancerous lesions and tumors. Such studies have yielded consistent, beneficial effects. Several potential mechanisms have been described, including alterations in microbiota species and metabolism, changes in colonic pH, binding or inactivation of carcinogens, enhanced immune responses, reduced colonic inflammation, lowered epithelial proliferation, and increased apoptosis.

Biomarker studies in humans show that synbiotics reduced fecal-water-induced genotoxic damage and increased transepithelial resistance. A synbiotic combination.

### The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement on the definition and scope of synbiotics [^117A9oiH]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

The media — encompassing TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, websites, and social media — plays an increasingly central role in communicating science. These efforts require a commitment to craft clear, simple messages that remain true to the science. Too often, scientists or their institutions fail to effectively translate complex research findings into a format that is understandable by the lay public. At times, overextended or inflated representations of research findings are communicated through official academic or journal press releases.

- **Media Practices**: Communicators are encouraged to differentiate between association studies and those presenting causal evidence. It is crucial to describe individual studies within the context of the totality of evidence and to avoid overgeneralizing results, such as those from model organisms like mice. Additionally, the limitations of studies should be noted, whether the studies are null or suggest benefits from the interventions being tested. Within this framework, the media should adopt the scientific definition of synbiotics as presented in this statement.

### Probiotics for preventing and treating nosocomial infections: Review of current evidence and recommendations [^112ZuVW4]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To review the available clinical data supporting the use of probiotics in preventing and treating serious nosocomial infections.

- **Data source**: A Medline database from 1996 to July 2006 and references from identified articles were used to perform a literature search relating to the clinical applications of probiotics in preventing and treating Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDD) and prevention of hospital-associated pneumonia (HAP).

- **Conclusion**: Nosocomial infections like HAP and CDD contribute significantly to health-care costs in the United States. These clinical problems are associated with prolonged hospital stays and increased mortality in critically ill patients. The emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens in cases of HAP and the recent description of an epidemic, toxin gene-variant strain of C difficile, combined with the anticipated lack of new antimicrobial agents in the near future, emphasize the need for new, innovative strategies to prevent and treat these diseases. Probiotics normally function as colonizers and contribute to the overall health of their hosts by multiple mechanisms, including immune and antibacterial effects. There is no clinical evidence to support the use of probiotics to restore the normal human flora in critically ill patients and reduce HAP rates. Probiotics can prevent episodes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, but their utility in treating and preventing CDD requires demonstration of benefit in multicenter clinical trials, preferably sponsored by the National Institutes of Health.

### Probiotic supplementation during antibiotic treatment is unjustified in maintaining the gut microbiome diversity: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115qevg6]. BMC Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

- **Risk of bias assessment**: Risk-of-bias assessment was performed by two independent authors using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (RoB2). Disagreements were solved by consensus. Domains assessed biases resulting from the randomization process, deviations from the intended intervention, missing data, the measurement of the outcome, and the selection of the reported results. The investigators rated each domain, and the risk level was automatically calculated by the algorithm, which could be characterized as low, some concerns, or high.

- **Certainty assessment**: The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tool was applied by two independent investigators to assess the quality of the best available evidence. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.

### Targeting the gut microbiota for cancer therapy [^117MQT2F]. Nature Reviews Cancer (2022). High credibility.

Growing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota modulates the efficacy and toxicity of cancer therapy, most notably immunotherapy and its immune-related adverse effects. The poor response to immunotherapy in patients treated with antibiotics supports this influential role of the microbiota. Until recently, results pertaining to the identification of the microbial species responsible for these effects were incongruent, and relatively few studies analyzed the underlying mechanisms. A better understanding of the taxonomy of the species involved and their mechanisms of action has since been achieved.

Defined bacterial species have been shown to promote an improved response to immune-checkpoint inhibitors by producing different products or metabolites. However, a suppressive effect of Gram-negative bacteria may be dominant in some unresponsive patients. Machine learning approaches trained on the microbiota composition of patients can predict the ability of patients to respond to immunotherapy with some accuracy. Thus, interest in modulating the microbiota composition to improve patient responsiveness to therapy has been mounting.

Clinical proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated that fecal microbiota transplantation or dietary interventions might be utilized clinically to improve the success rate of immunotherapy in patients with cancer. Here, we review recent advances and discuss emerging strategies for microbiota-based cancer therapies.

### Harms reporting in randomized controlled trials of interventions aimed at modifying microbiota: A systematic review [^117TXKXZ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics are used increasingly, although the safety and potential harms of these interventions are poorly understood.

- **Purpose**: To examine how harms-related information is reported in publications of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics.

- **Data sources**: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science (without language restrictions) from 1 January 2015 to 20 March 2018.

- **Study selection**: RCTs assessing the safety or efficacy of at least one intervention involving probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics alone or in combination with another intervention compared with any control (such as a placebo or an antibiotic) for any clinical condition.

- **Data extraction**: Four reviewers independently assessed study characteristics, the reporting of harms, and the presentation of safety results.

- **Data synthesis**: Of 384 trials conducted in healthy volunteers (n = 136) or patients with any of several medical conditions (n = 248), 339 (88%) were published in specialty journals. Trials most often evaluated probiotics (n = 265 [69%]). Studies in persons with medical conditions enrolled outpatients (n = 195) and high-risk patients (n = 53). No harms-related data were reported for 106 trials (28%), safety results were not reported for 142 (37%), and the number of serious adverse events (SAEs) per study group was not given for 309 (80%). Of 242 studies mentioning harms-related results, 37% (n = 89) used only generic statements to describe adverse events (AEs) and 16% (n = 38) used inadequate metrics.

### The role of the cutaneous microbiome in skin cancer: Lessons learned from the gut [^112Qiw2C]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

The human microbiome has recently gained prominence as a major factor in health and disease. Here, we review the literature regarding the microbiome and cancer, and suggest how the microbiome may be manipulated for improved health outcomes. The gut microbiome has been relatively well studied, and the mechanisms of how it may increase or decrease the risk of certain cancers may apply to the skin microbiome. Additionally, the gut microbiome may directly impact the risk of cancer in the skin and other organs by promoting systemic inflammation.

The skin microbiome itself is as diverse as the gut microbiome, but research has just begun to unravel its influence on the host. Like the gut microbiome, it affects the risk for several diseases, including cancer. By using health-promoting strains from the microbiome in oral or topical probiotics, it may be possible to reduce the risk of skin cancer and perhaps even increase the likelihood of successful treatment.

### Cancer pharmacomicrobiomics: Targeting microbiota to optimise cancer therapy outcomes [^114qt9bT]. Gut (2022). Low credibility.

Human microbiota is a dynamic collection of 40 trillion microbes, with 3,000 species encompassing bacteria, fungi, and viruses. They mainly inhabit the epithelial surfaces, especially the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The gut microbiota orchestrates broad aspects of physiological functions, including nutritional responses, and intestinal and immune system homeostasis. Dysbiosis, the microbiota compositional shift with disrupted homeostasis, is associated with diseases including GI, neurological, and metabolic disorders. Specific gut microbes have also been linked to the pathogenesis of cancers, particularly GI malignancies. For instance, the Fusobacterium nucleatum antigen adhesin A (FadA) promotes colorectal cancer (CRC) via E-cadherin-Wnt-β-catenin signalling; genotoxin colibactin from polyketide synthase (PKS)-positive Escherichia coli enhances colorectal tumourigenesis; and Bacteroides fragilis toxin generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing DNA damage. While these bacteria have direct effects on tumourigenesis, some microbes promote inflammation or weaken immunosurveillance to indirectly facilitate cancer development. These microbial immunomodulatory activities are referred to as the 'immune-oncology-microbiome axis'.

Beyond pathogenesis, the microbiota also modulates cancer treatment responses. Despite the rapid development in cancer therapy, challenges remain — acquired resistance, adverse effects, and heterogeneous treatment outcomes. Pharmacogenomics is at the forefront of scientific research studying the impact of genetic variants on individual pharmacological responses.

### The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement on the definition and scope of synbiotics [^112MyUiD]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

A statistician's involvement in the design phase of a study will provide confidence that the sample size is sufficient for the defined outcomes using intention-to-treat analysis. Mediation analyses might be useful to assess whether microbiota effects are contributing to the health benefit. Ancillary analyses, which could include population subgroups, responders versus non-responders, or exploratory microbiota analyses, should be pre-specified.

Finally, as with all trials, funding sources should be transparently reported, adverse events (AEs) must be carefully recorded and reported, and study design, execution, and reporting should comply with CONSORT guidelines to minimize study bias.

### The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement on the definition and scope of synbiotics [^114iS64R]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

Synbiotics present challenges for researchers, including deciphering mechanisms underlying the health benefit and proving that the microbiota are modulated via complementary or synergistic means. Unless appropriate experimental methods of verification are used, the product under assessment should not be referred to as 'synbiotic'.
As for probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics, it might be possible a priori to stratify study participants to enhance either the magnitude of the response or the number of responders to a given synbiotic treatment. The baseline composition of gut microbiota of study participants could be one useful stratification factor. This stratification might improve mechanistic understanding of observed effects and could be useful for characterizing responders and non-responders. Ultimately, this approach could enable better translation of clinical trial outcomes to those who are likely to benefit.

Scientists involved in the publication process (authors, editors, reviewers) should use the term synbiotic correctly and reject erroneous or unsupported use of the term. Even if a given treatment fails to demonstrate an effect (that is, acceptance of the null hypothesis) in a well-conducted study, such results still warrant publication.

- **Industry**: The business community plays a vital part in translating the outcomes of fundamental and clinical research into commercial products that can benefit consumers. To the extent that industry funds research, it is essential that studies adhere to well-established guidelines to manage conflicts of interest.

### Microbiota and cancer immunotherapy: In search of microbial signals [^115Ea7fG]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

The continuous expansion of new clinical trials targeting various cancer forms is likely to contribute to a better understanding of the role of microbiota in mediating the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, provided that microbiota sampling is incorporated into these trials. Larger cohorts may also be necessary to identify potential microbial markers that define responsiveness.

In addition, research is needed to investigate the relationship between microbiota and cancer management beyond T cell target therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. For example, understanding the role of microbiota in other immuno-oncology treatment modalities, such as cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses, and cell-mediated therapies (chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy), may help identify specific microbiota components associated with a particular class of treatment or overlapping signals applicable to a broad spectrum of immunotherapies.

An important consideration regarding the link between microbiota and immune checkpoint response is the source of the signals. So far, efforts have primarily focused on linking drug efficacy to bacteria, but the complexity of the microbiota may conceal additional signals. Fungi and viruses are intrinsic parts of the microbiota and have been shown to impact immune response, an essential component of immunotherapy. Investigating the role of these other microorganisms in defining the interaction between microbiota and cancer therapy is crucial. In conclusion, the search for microbial signals defining the extent of cancer therapeutic response is an ongoing quest.

### Expert consensus document: The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) consensus statement on the definition and scope of prebiotics [^116BCvFF]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

In December 2016, a panel of experts in microbiology, nutrition, and clinical research was convened by the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics to review the definition and scope of prebiotics. Consistent with the original embodiment of prebiotics, but aware of the latest scientific and clinical developments, the panel updated the definition of a prebiotic: a substrate that is selectively utilized by host microorganisms conferring a health benefit. This definition expands the concept of prebiotics to possibly include non-carbohydrate substances, applications to body sites other than the gastrointestinal tract, and diverse categories other than food. The requirement for selective microbiota-mediated mechanisms was retained. Beneficial health effects must be documented for a substance to be considered a prebiotic.

The consensus definition applies also to prebiotics for use by animals, where microbiota-focused strategies to maintain health and prevent disease are as relevant as for humans. Ultimately, the goal of this Consensus Statement is to engender appropriate use of the term 'prebiotic' by relevant stakeholders so that consistency and clarity can be achieved in research reports, product marketing, and regulatory oversight of the category. To this end, we have reviewed several aspects of prebiotic science, including its development, health benefits, and legislation.

### Role of the gut microbiota in nutrition and health [^113AJU1t]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Probiotics are live micro-organisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. Probiotics, mostly Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species, can be included in a variety of products, including foods, dietary supplements, or drugs.

There are concerns that most microbe supplements are unable to establish themselves in the gut and fail to exert an effect on the resident community. However, probiotics can affect health independently of the gut microbiota through direct effects on the host, such as immune modulation or the production of bioactive compounds. The therapeutic effect of probiotic supplementation has been studied in a broad range of diseases.

We searched the Cochrane Library of systematic reviews for "probiotic", yielding 39 studies, and searched Medline for "systematic review" or "meta-analysis" and "probiotic", yielding 31 studies. We included information on systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials published in the past five years where the main treatment was probiotics, not dietary supplements in general. Only studies that focused on comparisons of probiotics with a control group and contained at least some moderate or high-quality randomized controlled trials, as estimated by the authors of the systematic review, were considered. This resulted in a total of 22 systematic reviews. The analysis of 313 trials and 46,826 participants showed substantial evidence for beneficial effects of probiotic supplementation in preventing diarrhea, necrotizing enterocolitis, and acute upper respiratory tract infections.
