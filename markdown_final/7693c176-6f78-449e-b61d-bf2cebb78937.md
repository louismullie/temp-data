## Question

Topical therapies for atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about topical therapies for atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational role of emollients and barrier care. Then, I should verify first-line anti-inflammatory therapy with topical corticosteroids, including potency selection, duration, and safety. Next, I will examine steroid-sparing options such as topical calcineurin inhibitors, PDE-4 inhibitors, and topical JAK inhibitors, with attention to age limits and labeling. After that, I need to review proactive maintenance strategies and wet-wrap therapy. Finally, I should consider special populations, adherence, and when to escalate to systemic therapy, while double-checking guideline concordance and evidence certainty throughout.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: emollients are universally recommended for all pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis, regardless of symptoms, because they repair barrier dysfunction, reduce transepidermal water loss, and can reduce the need for topical corticosteroids. I should double-check that both pediatric-focused reviews and contemporary guidelines align here, and yes, they do, including AAP and AAAAI/ACAAI guidance, with the caveat that prescription "barrier devices" are not favored over OTC moisturizers due to cost and limited incremental benefit [^117FnGdG] [^114oUvfv] [^117Xt1rK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about anti-inflammatory therapy. I need to verify that topical corticosteroids remain first-line for active disease after moisturization failure, and that potency should be matched to age and anatomic site. The AAAAI/ACAAI guideline gives a strong recommendation for adding topical corticosteroids when moisturizers alone fail, and the Cochrane review shows moderate- and potent-potency agents outperform mild-potency for treatment success, while once-daily application is probably as effective as twice daily for flares; for infants and sensitive areas, low-potency agents are preferred, whereas thicker skin or more inflamed sites may justify mid-potency in older children, with careful attention to duration and tapering to mitigate atrophy risk [^116wwvUA] [^1117nAWA] [^111Jg9Cy] [^114oUvfv].

> Wait, let me verify safety messaging because steroid phobia is common. The Cochrane analysis found abnormal skin thinning in only 1% of participants across 22 trials, mostly with higher-potency agents, and no cases of skin thinning in proactive weekend therapy trials, supporting that short courses of appropriately potent steroids are generally safe when used correctly. I should confirm that guidelines also endorse proactive weekend therapy to prevent relapses, which they do, including AAD and AAAAI/ACAAI recommendations for intermittent medium-potency steroids in frequently flaring areas [^1117nAWA] [^116gbFE5] [^1167Rb6v].

> Next, I should review steroid-sparing options. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are appropriate when steroids are contraindicated, for sensitive areas, or as maintenance, with tacrolimus 0.03% approved for children aged 2 years and older and pimecrolimus for mild-to-moderate disease. I need to ensure I address the boxed warning — historically concerning but based on theoretical risk without supportive epidemiology — so counseling should emphasize the absence of demonstrated malignancy signal in long-term observational data and the favorable safety profile with localized, transient burning as the most common adverse effect [^111oS8je] [^111XYh5A] [^113s1jyc].

> I will now examine crisaborole, a topical PDE-4 inhibitor. It is FDA-approved for children aged 2 years and older with mild-to-moderate disease and offers a steroid-sparing anti-inflammatory option, with evidence suggesting faster lesion resolution than vehicle and a favorable safety profile. I should confirm that guidelines list PDE-4 inhibition among recommended topical classes, which they do, albeit with variable certainty across documents [^113s1jyc] [^116sXU2x] [^114HKHWu].

> But wait, what about topical JAK inhibitors? I initially thought ruxolitinib was broadly approved down to age 2, but hold on, I should verify the current U.S. labeling — ruxolitinib 1.5% cream is approved for ages 12 years and older, so use in younger children is off-label. Delgocitinib is not FDA-approved in the U.S. at this time. Guidelines diverge, with AAAAI/ACAAI recommending against topical ruxolitinib in adolescents and adults due to insufficient benefit-risk data, whereas AAD adult guidelines have issued strong recommendations for topical JAK inhibitors, underscoring the need for shared decision-making and caution in pediatrics [^114oUvfv] [^117E2Dia] [^116sXU2x].

> Let me consider proactive maintenance therapy. After induction clears active disease, applying a topical anti-inflammatory intermittently to previously involved sites reduces relapse risk, with AAD suggesting 1–2 times weekly topical corticosteroids and 2–3 times weekly TCIs, and AAAAI/ACAAI endorsing proactive mid-potency steroids in relapsing disease. I should double-check that weekend steroid strategies reduce flares, which Cochrane confirms with a large relative risk reduction, supporting this practice to maintain control and minimize cumulative steroid exposure [^116dGaHq] [^1167Rb6v] [^1117nAWA].

> I need to check wet-wrap therapy. Evidence is mostly pediatric and of low certainty, but WWT with low- to mid-potency steroids appears superior to emollient-only wraps for acute flares, with short-term use mitigating infection risk. Guidelines conditionally recommend WWT for moderate-to-severe flares with explicit education on technique and monitoring, and I should caution that benefit in mild disease is questionable and that secondary infection risk, while uncommon with proper technique, warrants vigilance [^113cC9wm] [^notfound].

> Next, I should review special populations. Infants and toddlers generally require low-potency steroids on thin skin and may benefit from early, consistent emollient use, with some data suggesting that daily moisturization from birth may reduce AD risk in high-risk neonates. For skin of color, inflammation may present as lichenification or dyspigmentation, so I need to ensure counseling addresses expectations and the importance of maintenance to prevent postinflammatory changes. For refractory or infected AD, I should confirm that dilute bleach baths can be considered in select cases with clear instructions, while avoiding routine antimicrobials absent infection [^1147yfpp] [^114oUvfv] [^114jjtHC].

> Hold on, I should verify adherence and education strategies because they materially affect outcomes. Therapeutic patient education improves control by clarifying trigger avoidance, moisturizer-first routines, correct steroid application, and tapering plans. Simple, written action plans and scheduled follow-up help sustain behavior change, and addressing steroid phobia directly improves adherence. I need to ensure that my plan is feasible for caregivers, including quantities dispensed using fingertip-unit guidance and clear stop-taper rules [^113tfaiQ] [^114UP3qh] [^112mjLK3].

> Finally, I should confirm escalation criteria. Persistent moderate-to-severe disease despite optimized topical therapy, frequent flares, or significant psychosocial burden should prompt consideration of systemic therapy, with dupilumab FDA-approved down to 6 months and supported by EAACI guidance for pediatric patients, while traditional immunosuppressants remain options in selected refractory cases. I need to ensure topical adherence and infection control are optimized before declaring topical failure to avoid premature escalation [^117Qo1eW] [^111Po6cS] [^113BftXx].

Topical therapies are the cornerstone of pediatric atopic dermatitis care, with **emollients as foundational therapy** [^117Dxjza] to restore barrier function and reduce flares [^117Dxjza]. Topical corticosteroids are **first-line anti-inflammatory agents** [^116wwvUA] for flares, using the lowest effective potency and duration to minimize adverse effects [^113s1jyc]. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are **steroid-sparing options** for sensitive areas or maintenance [^111oS8je], and crisaborole is a nonsteroidal alternative for mild-to-moderate disease [^113s1jyc]. Wet-wrap therapy is reserved for **severe flares** under specialist supervision [^113cC9wm]. Patient education on proper application, adherence, and safety is essential to optimize outcomes and minimize risks [^113tfaiQ].

---

## Emollients (moisturizers)

Emollients are **foundational therapy** for pediatric AD, restoring barrier function, reducing transepidermal water loss, and decreasing inflammation and itch [^117Dxjza]. Regular use reduces flare frequency and severity and can reduce the need for topical corticosteroids [^117Dxjza]. Nonprescription moisturizers are recommended; prescription barrier devices are not favored due to limited evidence and higher cost [^117Xt1rK]. Preferred formulations are ointments for their occlusion and efficacy; creams are less greasy and may be better tolerated in some children [^114oUvfv].

---

## Topical corticosteroids

Topical corticosteroids are **first-line anti-inflammatory therapy** for pediatric AD flares [^116wwvUA]. They reduce inflammation, pruritus, and secondary infection risk [^117FnGdG]. Potency should be matched to disease severity, treatment area, and age: low-potency agents for the face, intertriginous areas, and infants; mid-potency for trunk and extremities in older children [^112mjLK3]. Use the lowest effective potency for the shortest duration (typically ≤ 2 weeks), then taper to avoid adverse effects [^113s1jyc]. Proactive therapy (e.g. twice weekly) to previously involved areas reduces relapses [^1167Rb6v] [^116gbFE5].

---

## Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs)

TCIs (tacrolimus and pimecrolimus) are **steroid-sparing agents** for pediatric AD, particularly for sensitive areas (face, intertriginous regions) and for maintenance therapy [^111oS8je]. They inhibit T-cell activation and cytokine release, reducing inflammation without causing skin atrophy [^116kDXvQ]. Tacrolimus 0.03% is approved for children ≥ 2 years; pimecrolimus is approved for mild-to-moderate disease in children ≥ 2 years [^111oS8je]. Common adverse effects include transient burning or stinging; long-term safety is favorable, with no increased malignancy risk observed in pediatric cohorts [^111XYh5A].

---

## Topical phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitors

Crisaborole, a topical PDE-4 inhibitor, is FDA-approved for **mild-to-moderate pediatric AD** ≥ 2 years [^113s1jyc]. It reduces inflammation and pruritus with minimal systemic absorption and a favorable safety profile. Common adverse effects include transient burning or stinging at the application site [^notfound].

---

## Wet-wrap therapy

Wet-wrap therapy (WWT) is a specialized technique for **severe pediatric AD flares** refractory to standard therapy [^113cC9wm]. It involves applying a topical corticosteroid followed by damp and dry layers, enhancing penetration and hydration. WWT is typically reserved for short-term use under specialist supervision due to potential risks, including secondary infection and skin irritation [^117FWPdc].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

- **Topical corticosteroids**: Risk of skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, and systemic absorption with prolonged use or high potency. Monitor growth in children receiving prolonged therapy [^1117nAWA].
- **TCIs**: Minimal systemic absorption; monitor for local irritation and rare infections.
- **PDE-4 inhibitors**: Minimal systemic absorption; monitor for local irritation [^notfound].
- **Wet-wrap therapy**: Monitor for secondary infection, skin irritation, and adherence issues [^117FWPdc].

---

## Patient education and adherence

Patient and caregiver education is **critical** for adherence and optimal outcomes. Key points include:

- Proper application techniques (fingertip unit method) [^112mjLK3].
- Adherence to prescribed regimens.
- Recognition of adverse effects and when to seek medical advice.
- Importance of regular emollient use and trigger avoidance [^113tfaiQ].

Atopic dermatitis imposes a significant burden on patients, families and healthcare systems. Management is difficult, due to disease heterogeneity, co-morbidities, complexity in care pathways and differences between national or regional healthcare systems. Better understanding of the mechanisms has enabled a stratified approach to the management of atopic dermatitis, supporting the use of targeted treatments with biologicals. However, there are still many issues that require further clarification. These include the definition of response, strategies to enhance the responder rate, the duration of treatment and its regimen (in the clinic or home-based), its cost-effectiveness and long-term safety. The EAACI Guidelines on the use of dupilumab in atopic dermatitis follow the GRADE approach in formulating recommendations for each outcome and age group. In addition, future approaches and research priorities are discussed.

### Recent developments in atopic dermatitis [^112PQUJy]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a bothersome and common skin disease affecting ∼10.7% of children in the United States. This skin condition significantly decreases quality of life in not only patients, but in their families as well. Pediatricians are often the first physicians to diagnose and manage these patients and thus are relied on by families to answer questions about this disease. AD is complex, multifactorial, and has historically had limited therapeutic options, but the landscape of this disease is now rapidly changing. Pathways contributing to the pathogenesis of this disease are continually being discovered, and new therapies for AD are being developed at an unprecedented rate. With this article, we will review the current guidelines regarding the management of AD, outline updates in the current understanding of its pathophysiology, and highlight novel developments available for the treatment of this burdensome disease.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with topical therapies [^116sXU2x]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

New evidence has emerged since the 2014 guidelines that further informs the management of atopic dermatitis (AD) with topical therapies. These guidelines update the 2014 recommendations for management of AD with topical therapies.

Objective

To provide evidence-based recommendations related to management of AD in adults using topical treatments.

Methods

A multidisciplinary workgroup conducted a systematic review and applied the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) approach for assessing the certainty of evidence and formulating and grading recommendations.

Results

The workgroup developed 12 recommendations on the management of AD in adults with topical therapies, including nonprescription agents and prescription topical corticosteroids (TCS), calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors (PDE-4), antimicrobials, and antihistamines.

Limitations

The pragmatic decision to limit the literature review to English-language randomized trials may have excluded data published in other languages and relevant long-term follow-up data.

Conclusions

Strong recommendations are made for the use of moisturizers, TCIs, TCS, and topical PDE-4 and JAK inhibitors. Conditional recommendations are made for the use of bathing and wet wrap therapy and against the use of topical antimicrobials, antiseptics, and antihistamines.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with topical therapies [^113cC9wm]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis bathing and wet wrap therapy — based on low certainty evidence, bathing for treatment and maintenance in patients with AD can be conditionally recommended, and moisturizers may be applied soon after bathing to improve skin hydration; however, standards for bathing frequency or duration, water temperature, soap type, water softeners, or accessories including bleach for noninfected AD cannot be suggested based on limited evidence. Wet wrap therapy (WWT), in which a topical agent (typically a low or mid potency TCS) is applied then covered by a moistened first layer and a dry external layer, can be used anywhere from 1 hour to 1 day at a time, for up to several weeks if needed. Most data on WWT are from pediatric patients and, based on available pediatric data, WWT with TCS (+ emollient in some studies) are superior to emollient-based wet dressings; in a left-right comparison of 24 patients with acute AD, prednicarbate plus WWT versus prednicarbate alone showed a statistically significant, but not clinically meaningful, improvement in SCORAD with WWT (MD: 1.4 lower, 95% CI: 2.75 lower to 0.05 lower), with no side effects and no withdrawals during the 14 day follow-up period. WWT requires increased effort and time with patient education to ensure correctness, its benefit in mild disease is questioned, and for patients with moderate to severe AD the work group proposes a conditional recommendation based on low certainty evidence.

### Evolving landscape of systemic therapy for pediatric atopic dermatitis [^113BftXx]. Dermatologic Clinics (2022). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease in children. Standard-of-care treatment has been topical therapy. Oral corticosteroids are also commonly used to treat intermittent flares, despite guidelines that recommend against this practice. In 2017, the first targeted biologic agent indicated for moderate-severe AD in adults received US Food and Drug Administration approval. The success of this drug, dupilumab, filled a significant unmet medical need and inspired additional interest in new drug development. This article summarizes safe and effective use of systemic therapy for moderate-severe AD in pediatric patients, highlighting dupilumab and the most promising emerging treatments.

### Tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of adult and pediatric atopic dermatitis: review on safety and benefits [^111XYh5A]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Abstract

Atopic dermatitis requires long‐term management, mainly with topical anti‐inflammatory agents. Topical corticosteroids and tacrolimus ointment (‐O) are recommended as first‐line treatments for. However, the long‐term use ofis limited by cutaneous adverse events such as skin atrophy. For‐O, Japanese andlabelings were updated in 2003 and 2006, respectively, to include a boxed warning about a theoretical risk of skin cancer and lymphoma in patients treated with topical calcineurin inhibitors. However,‐O has been used worldwide for longer than 15 years to treat adult and pediatric patients with. Available data suggest that‐O is effective and well tolerated, and can improve quality of life.‐O has successfully been used in the proactive management ofconsisting of long‐term intermittent use to prevent, delay or reduce the occurrence offlares. Systemic drug absorption after‐O application is negligible and unlikely to result in systemic immunosuppression. There is currently no strong evidence of an increased rate of malignancy in treated patients, and observational data from postmarketing surveillance studies have shown no safety concerns. In the absence of robust evidence, the warning about the carcinogenic potential in the Japanese labeling for‐O does not appear justified and should be reconsidered. This mitigation of description would allow adult and pediatric patients withto receive the effective treatment more appropriately.

Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Executive summary aims and management questions — the guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations about optimal management of atopic dermatitis and address the following 5 main management questions: among patients with AD, what topical treatments should be used to achieve optimal outcomes; whether elimination diets should be used for AD; whether dilute bleach baths should be used for AD; whether allergen immunotherapy should be used for AD; and among patients with AD, what systemic treatments, including phototherapy (UV light therapy), should be used to achieve optimal outcomes. The target audience includes patients, AD specialists (allergists/ immunologists and dermatologists), family medicine physicians, pediatricians, and other decision-makers, and the document may serve as the basis for adoption or adaptation by local, regional, or national guideline panels and policymakers.

### Management of severe atopic dermatitis in children [^112GEufw]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Severe childhood atopic dermatitis refers to the presence of recurrent, widespread, eczematous dermatitis that significantly interferes with the daily activities and/or the quality of life of the affected child and family. The vast majority of children with severe, long-standing atopic dermatitis can be managed with the appropriate use of topical treatments, including long-term maintenance therapy and adjunctive treatments. In the recalcitrant patient, second line therapies such as narrowband ultraviolet light therapy and systemic immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate moefetil, and methotrexate have been shown to be safe and effective in children with severe atopic dermatitis and can lead to sustained clinical improvement. To date, biologic therapy has not been uniformly effective in childhood atopic dermatitis. Management of severe childhood atopic dermatitis, including topical and adjunctive treatments and second-line therapies including systemic immunosuppressants will be reviewed here.

### Atopic dermatitis: skin-directed management [^1159YWpB]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a common inflammatory skin condition characterized by relapsing eczematous lesions in a typical distribution. It can be frustrating for pediatric patients, parents, and health care providers alike. The pediatrician will treat the majority of children with atopic dermatitis as many patients will not have access to a pediatric medical subspecialist, such as a pediatric dermatologist or pediatric allergist. This report provides up-to-date information regarding the disease and its impact, pathogenesis, treatment options, and potential complications. The goal of this report is to assist pediatricians with accurate and useful information that will improve the care of patients with atopic dermatitis.

### Allergy and dermatology US treatment guidelines review for adults with atopic dermatitis [^116oJQzE]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Baricitinib is not currently FDA-approved for moderate-to-severe AD in the United States, but it is approved for treatment of alopecia areata. It selectively inhibits both JAK 1 and JAK 2. The AAD discussed its strong recommendation for baricitinib, 2 to 4 mg, mentioning similar benefits and harm when compared with the other medications in its class. The JTFPP conditionally recommends the use of baricitinib, 2 to 4 mg, in patients who are intolerant of or unable to use mid-to-high potency topical treatments and/or systemic biologic treatments. It makes this recommendation with low certainty, given the same concerns as with the other systemic JAK inhibitors in its class. Both the AAD and the JTFPP state that on the basis of a recent meta-analysis, baricitinib is less efficacious than either upadacitinib or abrocitinib; however, further comparisons were not discussed.

Conclusion

Our review of the most recent updates to the guidelines for the management of AD in adults by dermatologists and allergists in the United States highlights the significant advances in the approach to AD. Because AD affects patients of all ages, we look forward to updated guidelines from the AAD regarding the management of AD in pediatric patients. As we continue to learn more about the complex pathophysiology of AD, it seems reasonable to predict that its management by these 2 specialties will continue to evolve, with each bringing unique perspectives and approaches. The differences are due to the differing perspectives and skill sets of the 2 specialties; to the challenges of weighing patient preference, value, and risk; and to the ever-changing therapeutic landscape. Therefore, it may be more ideal to have "living guidelines" that incorporate change rather than waiting for passage of time before new guidelines are drafted or updated.

Key messages

- The JTFPP and the AAD each publish guidelines for AD management in adults.
- There are similarities in the recommendations for use of biologic agents. Importantly, there are differences in the recommendations for use of topical PDE4 inhibitors and JAK inhibitors.
- This comparison is important, as both specialties treat AD and use the current literature to make recommendations for patients.

### Strategies for topical corticosteroid use in children and… [^111Jg9Cy]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer High- and medium-potency topical corticosteroids increase treatment success compared with low-potency topical corticosteroids, but there is no difference in effectiveness between high- and medium-potency topical corticosteroids. Application of topical corticosteroids once daily is probably as effective as twice daily. Weekend therapy likely prevents eczema relapses without an increased risk of adverse effects.

1. Practice Pointers Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that is common worldwide and has a significant impact on quality of life. It affects up to 20% of children and 5% of adults.

1 Topical corticosteroids are the most commonly prescribed treatment, and prescribing patterns vary widely in the United States. 2 The authors of this review sought to identify the most effective strategies for topical corticosteroid use to treat eczema in adults and children, including different potencies, frequencies, and techniques of application. They also identified potential adverse effects. Examples of topical corticosteroids used in the studies included hydrocortisone 0. 5% to
2. 5% cream/ointment, desonide 0. 05% to
0. 1% cream/ointment, triamcinolone 0. 1% cream/ointment, and clobetasol
0. 05% cream/ointment. Medium-potency topical corticosteroids were more effective than low-potency corticosteroids. No adverse effects were reported in either group.

High-potency topical corticosteroids were more effective than low-potency corticosteroids. 3 The evidence for safety and adverse effect reporting was methodologically inconsistent and of relatively short duration. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends a twice-daily application of topical corticosteroids for the treatment of eczema but states that once-daily application may be sufficient. 4 The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which specifically addresses eczema in children, recommends once- or twice-daily application.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with topical therapies [^113hzfQZ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis — definition and diagnosis note that AD (also known as atopic eczema) is a chronic, pruritic inflammatory skin disease that occurs most frequently in children but also affects many adults and follows a relapsing course, and it is often associated with a personal or family history of allergic rhinitis and asthma. Although the diagnosis of AD is usually made clinically, alternative or concomitant causes of dermatitis such as allergic contact dermatitis or irritant contact dermatitis should be considered and evaluated via comprehensive history and physical exam, and other diagnostic tests such as biopsy or patch testing should be performed if warranted.

### Consensus recommendations on adjunctive topical management of atopic dermatitis [^115We4Di]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is well-recognized as a very common chronic and relapsing pruritic skin disorder affecting both children and adults worldwide. The adverse effects on the quality of life of affected individuals and their families is well-established. The pathophysiology of AD is complex, leading to interindividual variations in clinical presentation and severity. The chronicity of AD, characterized by periods of exacerbation and remission, supports a strong need to develop measures that can effectively and safely prolong remissions between flares of the disease. This article provides an overview of AD including prevalence, severity, and disease course/progression, succinct summaries of pathophysiology and medical management, and discussion of epidermal barrier dysfunction and skin microbiome shifting associated with AD. Additional emphasis is placed on adjunctive topical skin barrier approaches that may prolong disease-free remissions. Results from a panel of dermatologists queried about adjunctive approaches to AD, using a modified-Delphi approach, are also discussed. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(10):1070–1076.

### Efficacy and economics of topical calcineurin inhibitors for the treatment of atopic dermatitis [^115NuGgP]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin disease that frequently affects infants and children. The worldwide prevalence of atopic dermatitis is estimated to be 5–20% of the pediatric population. Studies have shown that atopic dermatitis is associated with considerable economic costs and decreased quality of life. There is no proven curative therapy at present for atopic dermatitis; first-line therapy has generally consisted of dry skin care, avoidance of triggers, application of topical corticosteroids, and administration of histamine H1 receptor antagonists (antihistamines) and oral antibacterials as appropriate. Topical corticosteroids, while effective in many patients, carry the concern of local and systemic adverse effects. As a result, physicians and patients are reluctant to utilize stronger topical corticosteroids in certain areas of the body and for prolonged periods of time. The purpose of this article is to review the efficacy and economics of topical calcineurin inhibitors in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. This new class of agents (specifically tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream) represents an exciting advance in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Clinical data show that topical calcineurin inhibitors are effective and do not cause the adverse effects associated with topical corticosteroids. Several studies have provided evidence that topical calcineurin inhibitors positively affect the quality of life of patients and their caregivers. Compared with branded topical corticosteroids and previous standards of care, topical calcineurin inhibitors appear to be a cost-effective treatment option. Drawing comparisons between tacrolimus and pimecrolimus is difficult because definitive head-to-head comparative studies involving these drugs have not been conducted.

### Future perspectives in the treatment of atopic dermatitis [^1144ju5D]. The Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronically relapsing inflammatory skin disease with an increasing prevalence. The guidelines for the treatment of atopic dermatitis enable us to manage many patients with atopic dermatitis under a global consensus, which also contributes to improving their quality of life. However, there remain some patients with atopic dermatitis whose symptoms cannot be satisfactorily controlled using the therapeutic management recommended by the guidelines. Recent genetic, immunological and physiological insights into the pathomechanisms of atopic dermatitis are expected to overcome the limitations of the currently available treatment. Advances in pharmacology and biotechnology will also provide more efficient and safer medications. In this review, the limitations of the currently available therapies and the advantages and disadvantages of new approaches for the treatment of atopic dermatitis including topical and systemic immunosuppressants as well as biologics and anti-pruritic agents are discussed. Potential new cellular targets for the treatment of atopic dermatitis are also illustrated.

### Atopic dermatitis guidelines: diagnosis, systemic therapy, and adjunctive care [^112rg1WB]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is an important and chronic skin condition that has recently been the subject of enormous volumes of basic science, clinical, and epidemiologic research. This field is undergoing rapid expansion, making it vitally important to integrate the emerging data with our current body of knowledge. In 2014, the American Academy of Dermatology published Guidelines of Care for the Management of Atopic Dermatitis, composed of four parts, reflecting the work of 17 experts from North America and the United Kingdom. 1–4 It uses a patient-oriented system, SORT (Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy), to provide evidence-based guidance in the management of this common, vexing dermatitis. These guidelines join a series of similar efforts published recently across the world, reflecting universal interest in distilling the tremendous volume of basic scientific and clinical data previously generated. 5–7 With new therapies rapidly emerging, clinicians require a current understanding of the field to be able to incorporate new treatments in their practice.

### Special considerations for therapy of pediatric atopic dermatitis [^113wYHRU]. Dermatologic Clinics (2017). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is the leading cause of pediatric dermatology visits in developed nations. Recurrent, itchy rashes in typical locations and a family/personal history of atopy helps to identify children with disease. Most cases (85%) are diagnosed by age 5 years. Some comorbidities are age-based and may affect disease course. Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy; corticosteroidphobia and side effects complicate use. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are alternatives to corticosteroids, especially in sensitive locations. Systemic therapies include antihistamines, immune suppressive agents, and phototherapy, with specific pediatric modifications. This article reviews the nuances and caveats of pediatric atopic dermatitis diagnosis and management.

Atopic dermatitis — topical corticosteroids after moisturization failure: In patients with uncontrolled atopic dermatitis refractory to moisturization alone, the JTF panel recommends addition of a topical corticosteroid over no topical corticosteroid (strong recommendation, high-certainty evidence). The linked systematic review and NMA synthesized 219 RCTs enrolling 43,123 infants, children, and adults with primarily mild-moderate AD addressing 68 different treatments, and TCS, used in RCTs mostly for 2 to 6 weeks, probably did not importantly increase adverse effects, including skin infections, atrophy, or other local skin changes. A Cochrane systematic review reported 26 cases of skin atrophy of 3574 RCT children and adult participants applying mild, moderate, and potent TCS for primarily either 1 to 6 weeks or 16 to 20 weeks (raw proportion: 7 per 1000 [95% CI, 5–11 per 1000]).

### Italian guidelines for therapy of atopic dermatitis-adapted from consensus-based European guidelines for treatment of atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis) [^115sM365]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) therapeutic approach calls for a long-term treatment. Treatment options for AD have recently undergone a revolutionary change by the introduction of the first biologic drug. Availability in daily practice of the last version of international AD guidelines, taking peculiarities of the country into account, can contribute to good clinical practice in Italy. To adapt European Dermatology Forum (EDF) guidelines for AD to the Italian medical-legal context, the EDF guidelines were assessed independently by two independent Italian renowned experts in the field and further integrated with articles published and systematically reviewed before May 2019. The first draft was collegially corrected and updated by the members of the SIDEMAST, ADOI, and SIDAPA. Recommendation levels (A; B; C; D) were graded based on the evidence levels (1–4). The adapted guidelines presented here focus on topical and systemic therapies in AD patients, both children and adults. As opposed to previous Italian guidelines, they include indications about biologics. New relevant evidence available from very recent literature and peculiarities of the Italian medical and legal context have been integrated in the revision process. If compared to general guidelines for AD not adapted to a specific national and cultural context, a revision for specific Italian needs is now available: It comprises the option of implementing the new biologic treatments and is likely to provide an important contribution to the improvement of clinical practice in Italy. Cooperation between patients, dermatologists, allergologists, and pediatricians remains mandatory in AD management. The authors of the present revision recommend an update of the Italian guidelines to be performed at least every second year.

### New and emerging therapies for paediatric atopic dermatitis [^113FaRwS]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2019). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a complex, chronic inflammatory skin disorder with a profound symptom burden, and substantially affects patients' quality of life. It is particularly challenging to manage in children, because conventional treatments such as topical corticosteroids might be inadequate or cause considerable safety concerns. Research into the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis has led to the testing and development of numerous topical, oral, and injectable targeted therapeutic agents. This Review explores relevant drugs that hold therapeutic promise and are being studied in the paediatric setting, with a focus on target relevance, available efficacy and safety data, potential safety concerns, and long-term effect in children with atopic dermatitis.

### A consensus on Staphylococcus aureus exacerbated atopic dermatitis and the need for a novel treatment [^1163wWXf]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The skin microbiome is essential for skin barrier function because it inhibits pathogen colonization, and decreased microbiome diversity correlates with increased Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) burden and atopic dermatitis (AD) severity. Managing S. aureuss-driven AD in clinical practice remains problematic due to complications such as AD exacerbation, impetigo, abscesses, and invasive infections. This project used a modified Delphi process comprising face-to-face discussions followed by a blinded vote to define 5 final consensus statements. A panel of 6 pediatric dermatologists developed a consensus on S. aureus-driven AD exacerbation, challenges in current treatments for AD with secondary bacterial infections, and new developments to improve patient care and outcomes. The panel's 5 consensus statements provide recommendations for dermatologists, pediatricians, and healthcare providers treating patients with secondary infected AD. These recommendations underscore the importance of recognizing and managing S. aureus skin infection in AD clinical practice and promoting antibiotic stewardship to mitigate resistance. The panel defined a significant unmet need for a single topical AD therapy effective against all symptoms, including pruritus, S. aureus-driven AD exacerbation, infection, and inflammation, across AD severity levels.

Atopic dermatitis affects 20% to 25% of children and has significant impact on quality of life of patients and families. Recent studies of the pathogenesis of AD highlight the interplay between a defective skin barrier, immune dysfunction, and the cutaneous microbiome. Standard of care for AD treatment includes topical corticosteroids for active disease and moisturization to repair the barrier defect. Emerging treatments include dupilumab and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. Reduction of triggers and proactive treatment with topical corticosteroids and/or topical calcineurin inhibitors can reduce flares. Treatment plans should be clear and as simple as possible to maximize adherence.

### Atopic dermatitis part 2: management [^113tfaiQ]. Pediatrics in Review (2025). Medium credibility.

The goal of management of atopic dermatitis (AD) or eczema, is to achieve disease control in the absence of a cure. This review aims to outline the current management and treatment of AD and explore gaps in knowledge about the effectiveness of treatment control. Although there is no concrete definition of or specific features that constitute "control" in this context, control includes reducing disease activity, decreasing symptoms, and ultimately improving quality of life. Therapeutic patient education (TPE) improves outcomes and includes information about the disease; recognition of active disease; trigger reduction where possible; moisturization; and instructions on medication use. Applying moisturizers consistently is part of standard care and plays a role in flare prevention. Topical corticosteroids (TCS), for which there is good evidence to support efficacy and safety, are frequently used topical treatments. Despite the infrequent incidence of side effects, the use of TCS is often hindered by fear of these side effects. To ensure adherence to treatment, it is essential to assess and address patients' and caregivers' concerns about steroid use. Effective alternative topical treatments include calcineurin inhibitors, phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors, and Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKI). Ancillary therapies may play a role in some selected patients, for example, wet-wrap therapy and bleach baths, but add complexity to management plans with inconsistent supporting evidence. Antihistamines are no longer routinely recommended. When topical therapy fails, systemic treatment options may be considered, including phototherapy, traditional immune-suppressant therapy, and newer agents such as biologic therapy or JAKI.

### Tacrolimus ointment. A review of its therapeutic potential as a topical therapy in atopic dermatitis [^116kDXvQ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Tacrolimus, a macrolide immunomodulator, is believed to control atopic dermatitis by inhibiting T lymphocyte activation, altering cell surface expression on antigen-presenting dendritic cells and modulating the release of inflammatory mediators from skin mast cells and basophils. Tacrolimus ointment penetrates human skin with no systemic accumulation after repeated applications; systemic absorption is generally low, with most patients in clinical trials having blood concentrations of the drug below the limit of quantification. Moderate to severe atopic dermatitis significantly improved (measured using multiple end-points, including ≥ 90% improvement in Physician's Global Evaluation of Clinical Response) with tacrolimus 0.03 and 0.1% ointment compared with vehicle in both adult (n = 304 and 328) and pediatric (n = 351) patients in three 12-week, double-blind, randomized, phase III trials. In adults, tacrolimus ointment was effective therapy for the treatment of atopic dermatitis on all skin regions, including the head and neck. The 0.1% concentration was more effective than the 0.03% concentration. Clinical improvement in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adult (n = 316) or pediatric (n = 255) patients was seen as early as week 1, and improvement continued and/or was maintained for up to 6 and/or 12 months in long-term studies. The 0.1% formulation was also effective and well tolerated for up to 2 years. Tacrolimus 0.03 and 0.1% ointment was associated with significant quality-of-life benefit in adults, children (aged 5 to 15 years) and toddlers (aged 2 to 4 years) with atopic dermatitis in 12-week phase III trials (n = 985). Skin burning and pruritus were the most common application site adverse events in adult and pediatric patients in short-term and long-term trials. These events were generally of short duration and mild or moderate severity. Cutaneous infections occurred with a similar incidence after treatment with tacrolimus ointment to that seen after vehicle in short-term trials.

Conclusion

Both short- and long-term monotherapy with tacrolimus 0.03 and 0.1% ointment improves moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adult and pediatric patients. Topical tacrolimus ointment is well tolerated, with the majority of adverse events being localized, transient in nature and of mild or moderate severity. Tacrolimus ointment provides a promising addition to the currently available treatments for atopic dermatitis; it can be used as a short- or long-term intermittent therapy for moderate to severe disease, including disease on the head or neck, in adult (0.1 and 0.03% formulations) and pediatric (0.03% formulation) patients who are not adequately responsive to or are intolerant of conventional treatments.

### Patient-reported impact of atopic dermatitis on pediatric and adolescent patients with moderate-to-severe disease: results of a real-world, cross-sectional survey [^113KRSiY]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, inflammatory, relapsing skin disorder and one of the most common and burdensome diseases in children. In Europe and the United States (US), affects up to 20% of children. In around 80% of cases, the onset ofoccurs in the first few years of life, with 60% experiencing relapses into adolescence.

may be concomitantly diagnosed with asthma and allergic rhinitis, and is associated with multi‐dimensional patient burden, including sleep disturbances, anxiety and depression, reduced function and productivity, and a lower quality of life (QoL). Such disease burden reflects the need to optimally treat.

With no definitive cure available, treatments aim to reduce the extent and severity of signs and symptoms. The first‐line treatment of mild‐to‐moderatein pediatric patients utilizes topical corticosteroids, which may be used alone or with topical calcineurin inhibitors, phosphodiesterase (PDE)‐4 inhibitors, or topical Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (presently approved in the US for ages 12+). Systemic therapy may be utilized if there is insufficient response to topical therapies and may include traditional immunosuppressive agents including cyclosporine and methotrexate or UV‐light therapy. Concerns regarding the safety of these treatments in children often lead tobeing suboptimally managed. New drug approvals have provided a broader scope of treatment for patients < 18 years of age with moderate‐to‐severe disease activity.

Real‐world data on the disease burden in pediatric and adolescent patients with moderate‐to‐severeare limited, with the true impact on patients and their caregivers largely unsubstantiated. There is a need to improve the management and QoL ofin these patients. This study investigated the disease burden of, as reported by the patient or their caregiver, to identify specific needs associated with different age groups, thus highlighting opportunities for treatment interventions given the emerging treatment landscape.

### Atopic dermatitis: diagnosis and treatment… [^113s1jyc]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Topical steroids should be applied twice daily until the lesions are significantly improved or less thick. Duration of topical steroid therapy is guided by clinical improvement but is typically two weeks or less. To minimize adverse effects, the lowest possible potency topical steroid should be used for the shortest possible period to maintain good symptom control. Research suggests using a proactive approach to reducing flare-ups with once- or twice-weekly application of topical steroids to specific skin areas that have been repeatedly affected. 30 Because of potential adverse effects, primarily skin atrophy, low-potency topical steroids are recommended when treating atopic dermatitis involving the face, neck, axillae, groin, and flexor surfaces. During severe flare-ups, use of mid- or higher-potency topical steroids for up to two weeks may be appropriate to attain rapid symptom control.

TOPICAL CALCINEURIN INHIBITORS Topical calcineurin inhibitors are steroid-sparing immunomodulators used to treat atopic dermatitis in patients two years and older. Although traditionally used as second-line treatment for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, they may be used as a first-line therapy in conjunction with topical steroids, especially in patients with steroid phobia, or facial or flexural lesions. 30, 34 Topical calcineurin inhibitors are recommended for short- or long-term use and for maintenance therapy. The two available topical calcineurin inhibitors are tacrolimus and pimecrolimus. A meta-analysis of RCTs showed twice-weekly application of either medication increased the time between flare-ups and the total number of disease-free days.
35. Pimecrolimus is recommended for mild to moderate atopic dermatitis, whereas tacrolimus is indicated for moderate to severe disease.

Overall, tacrolimus is more effective than pimecrolimus, but both reduce inflammation and pruritus. 36 A proactive maintenance approach of using tacrolimus twice weekly on areas prone to flare-ups reduces the rate of flare-ups and percentage of treatment days, and increases the time between flare-ups.
37. NEWER TREATMENT OPTIONS Crisaborole is a topical, steroid-sparing phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor that was FDA-approved in 2016 to treat mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in patients two years and older. A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis showed that twice-daily application of crisaborole resolves lesions faster than topical controls.

### Allergy and dermatology US treatment guidelines review for adults with atopic dermatitis [^114zXxRf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

The AAD guidelines regarding using systemic therapies and phototherapy for management of AD in adults also clearly defines what is meant by the varying strengths of recommendation in a table. Strong recommendations have a clear risk and burden-versus-benefit ratio, and they apply "to most patients in most circumstances". Furthermore, the levels of certainty of evidence (high, moderate, low, and very low) have implications. For instance, a high certainty of evidence implies that the AAD work group is "very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect".

There are important updates in the most recent AD guidelines from both the AAD and the JTFPP. Regarding the similarities of the 2 groups' guidelines, use of biologic therapies such as dupilumab and tralokinumab is agreed on for moderate-to-severe AD in adults. Dupilumab is a mAb that blocks signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, and it is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for patients who are aged 6 months or older, have moderate-to-severe AD, and experience inadequate control from topical therapies. Tralokinumab is a mAb that blocks IL-13 signaling. It was approved in December 2021 for adults, but the label was recently (in December 2023) expanded to include adolescents. Both organizations took into consideration the advantageous patient outcomes of the therapies, including "AD severity, itch, sleep disturbance, and AD-related quality of life". Additionally, the side effect profiles of both biologics are favorable and do not require routine laboratory monitoring.

### Practical algorithm to inform clinical decision-making in the topical treatment of atopic dermatitis [^113aMCD8]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic relapsing, inflammatory skin disorder associated with skin barrier dysfunction, the prevalence of which has increased dramatically in developing countries. In this article, we propose a treatment algorithm for patients with mild-to-moderate and severe atopic dermatitis flares in daily clinical practice. An international panel of 15 dermatology and allergy experts from eight countries was formed to develop a practical algorithm for the treatment of patients with atopic dermatitis, with a particular focus on topical therapies. In cases of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis involving sensitive skin areas, the topical calcineurin inhibitor pimecrolimus should be applied twice daily at the first signs of atopic dermatitis. For other body locations, patients should apply a topical calcineurin inhibitor, either pimecrolimus or tacrolimus, twice daily at the first signs of atopic dermatitis, such as pruritus, or twice weekly in previously affected skin areas. Emollients should be used regularly. Patients experiencing acute atopic dermatitis flares in sensitive skin areas should apply a topical corticosteroid twice daily or alternate once-daily topical corticosteroid/topical calcineurin inhibitor until symptoms improve. Following improvement, topical corticosteroid therapy should be discontinued and patients switched to a topical calcineurin inhibitor. Maintenance therapy should include the use of pimecrolimus once daily for sensitive areas and tacrolimus for other body locations. This treatment algorithm can help guide clinical decision-making in the treatment of atopic dermatitis.

### Current and future monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of atopic dermatitis [^115SJ5W4]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a common immunologic skin disease. Mild atopic dermatitis can be managed with emollients and topical therapies such as low potency topical steroids, which have a favorable safety profile. Severe atopic dermatitis, in contrast, is a challenging disease to treat. Topical therapies are typically inadequate for control of severe atopic dermatitis. When topical therapies fail, the mainstay of therapy for severe atopic dermatitis has traditionally been phototherapy or off-label use of systemic immunosuppressant treatment, yet systemic immunosuppressants all have significant potential toxicities, drug interactions, and contraindications, requiring close monitoring. Targeted biologics are therefore attractive treatment options for topical therapy-refractory cases of atopic dermatitis, with the potential to offer effective, safer treatment of uncontrolled atopic dermatitis. Dupilumab, as the only biologic therapy currently FDA-approved for atopic dermatitis, is effective for many patients, but there is need for continuing study of additional biologic therapies to address the needs of diverse patients with uncontrolled atopic dermatitis.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory, pruritic skin disease that affects up to 10% of adults and 20% of children in developed countries. AD negatively impacts the health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients and their caregivers/families, with greater disease severity being associated with poorer HRQoL. Due to the complex pathophysiology of AD, guidelines recommend regimented hygiene, the use of moisturizers, topical steroids and calcineurin inhibitors, which can be used in combination with other treatments such as phototherapy for moderate‐to‐severe or refractory AD. The ultimate goals for treatment are to repair and maintain the skin barrier, to reduce sensations of itching and burning, and to prevent AD relapse. Despite current treatments, there is still an unmet need for safe and effective therapies to improve disease management and long‐term patient outcomes.

### Expert perspectives on management of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: a multidisciplinary consensus addressing current and emerging therapies [^114aHnb3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin disease that affects children and adults. Until recently, the only Food and Drug Administration-approved systemic treatment option for patients with moderate-to-severe AD was systemic steroids, which are not recommended by current guidelines and are commonly associated with disease rebound. Instead, clinicians choose from several off-label immunosuppressants, which can have serious adverse effects. A significant number of these patients go untreated. Research on the immunopathogenesis of AD has paved the way for new, targeted, systemic therapies for moderate-to-severe AD. In early 2017, the Food and Drug Administration approved dupilumab for adults with moderate-to-severe AD whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical therapies. Although the national guidelines can be very helpful to clinicians, the process for updating them does not allow for timely incorporation of novel therapies. A steering committee of AD experts, including dermatologists, allergists, and a patient advocacy group representative, developed recommendations on the basis of a literature review and expert opinion to help clinicians understand how new therapies fit into the current treatment paradigm and to provide practical recommendations for assessing AD severity, treatment response, and treatment failure.

### Translating atopic dermatitis management guidelines into practice for primary care providers [^114UP3qh]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis affects a substantial number of children, many of whom seek initial treatment from their pediatrician or other primary care provider. Approximately two-thirds of these patients have mild disease and can be adequately managed at the primary care level. However, recent treatment guidelines are written primarily for use by specialists and lack certain elements that would make them more useful to primary care providers. This article evaluates these recent treatment guidelines in terms of evaluation criteria, treatment recommendations, usability, accessibility, and applicability to nonspecialists and integrates them with clinical evidence to present a streamlined severity-based treatment model for the management of a majority of atopic dermatitis cases. Because each patient's situation is unique, individualization of treatment plans is critical as is efficient communication and implementation of the plan with patients and caregivers. Specifically, practical suggestions for individualizing, optimizing, implementing, and communicating treatment plans such as choosing a moisturizer formulation, avoiding common triggers, educating patients/caregivers, providing written treatment plans, and scheduling physician follow-up are provided along with a discussion of available resources for patients/caregivers and providers.

Nonprescription therapies — moisturizers for AD were shown to reduce signs, symptoms, and inflammation, to improve AD severity and to increase time between AD flares; topical moisturizers target xerosis by minimizing transepidermal water loss and improving stratum corneum hydration and are integral to nearly all AD management plans. While they may be used as monotherapy in mild cases, they are typically utilized as part of a comprehensive regimen with pharmacologic treatments; an analysis of 5 moisturizer studies (including 500 patients) showed a small reduction in AD severity with the use of moisturizers.

### Atopic dermatitis yardstick: practical recommendations for an evolving therapeutic landscape [^115dmaij]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

The implementation of treatment guidelines for atopic dermatitis is challenging, in part because of different guidance documents being used by different groups of specialists and in part because the language of guidelines often reflects the evidence base rather than the practical "how to". The Atopic Dermatitis Yardstick is part of a series developed in response to the need to proactively address the loss of disease control for atopic illnesses at all levels of severity. It presents a comprehensive update on how to conduct a sustained step-up in therapy for the patient with inadequately controlled or poorly controlled atopic dermatitis. Patient profiles, based on current guidelines and the authors' combined clinical experience, provide a practical and clinically meaningful guide to aid physicians in helping their patients achieve the goal of clear to almost clear. The intent is not to replace guidelines but to complement their recommendations incorporating the latest research and therapies.

### Optimizing outcomes for paediatric atopic dermatitis [^1121FJY4]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is considered the most prevalent chronic inflammatory condition in very young children, with a prevalence approaching 20% in some industrialized countries. Recent advances in the understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of AD - particularly in relation to genetically determined skin barrier dysfunction and the role of microbial infections in AD flares - have helped to galvanize thinking on approaches to treatment in young patients. Topical anti-inflammatory medicines (corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors) in addition to emollients are the mainstay of therapy in children, but parents need help to understand how and when to apply them and reassurance to allay their fears about the long-term effects of these treatments. At the same time, more work is required in order to identify which clinical signs, symptoms, long-term control of flares, and quality of life measures are the best outcome domains for AD clinical trials in order to continue to improve control of AD in children.

### A global review on the risk factors and management of early atopic dermatitis in children ages 0 to 2 years old [^1147yfpp]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing skin disease starting typically in atopic-prone children between 3–6 months of age, with most children having developed AD by the age of 5 years. Intense itching leads to sleep disturbance, especially in younger children and toddlers.
This review explores early intervention in infants and young children with AD by controlling skin barrier function and inflammation at the earliest time point using a moisturizer and a proactive treatment.

Methods: A working group of experienced clinicians managing pediatric populations with AD convened for a meeting. The panel reviewed the literature surrounding early intervention in infants and young children with AD and developed and discussed clinical questions aimed at optimizing clinical outcomes.

Results: Complex gene/immune system/environment interactions are involved in AD development. Epidermal barrier defects play a central role in the condition, with various studies showing impairment of skin barrier function at birth may precede clinical AD. Dynamic changes take place in the amounts of skin lipids during infancy.
Studies confirm that daily use of a moisturizer from birth onwards may offer benefits in improving skin barrier function and possibly prevention of AD, especially in high-risk, atopic prone newborns. Plant-based moisturizers were shown to be safe and effective when applied in pediatric patients with AD and may provide a TCS-sparing effect while improving skin condition.

Conclusion: Dry skin conditions during infancy may predict the subsequent development of AD. Consequently, emollient therapy from birth represents a feasible, safe, and effective approach for AD prevention. Therefore, parental education and the application of moisturizers are recommended as an integral part of AD prevention, treatment, and maintenance.

### The safety and efficacy of tacrolimus ointment in pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis [^111oS8je]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common skin disease in children, and its prevalence is increasing. It is a chronic disorder, characterized by intermittent flares and phases of remission. Treatment regimens often require multiple therapies. These can vary between patients, and in an individual patient, depending on the state of disease. The traditional treatment for AD flares is topical corticosteroids, which are fast acting and effective for relief of symptoms, but may cause adverse effects, including those resulting from systemic absorption, particularly in children. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) are alternative treatments for AD. Tacrolimus ointment, a TCI, is approved for patients aged 2 years and older. Multiple studies have shown that tacrolimus is effective for short-term relief of symptoms in pediatric patients with AD. Long-term trials have demonstrated that the effectiveness of tacrolimus is maintained for up to 4 years in children. Additional studies have revealed that long-term intermittent use of tacrolimus as part of maintenance therapy can prevent AD flares. Tacrolimus has a low potential for systemic accumulation, and analysis of long-term studies indicates that it has a good safety profile. Treatment with tacrolimus, alone or in combination with topical corticosteroids for acute flares, may be a useful option for long-term management of AD in pediatric patients.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^111C7uM9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) gaps in research — the expert group's priorities emphasize that while much is known about diagnosis and evaluation, much has yet to be learned. Significant gaps in research were identified, including but not limited to: validation studies of the AAD workgroup diagnostic criteria, development, validation, and uniformity in use of disease severity and quality of life measurements applicable to a busy clinical practice environment, interventional studies testing impact of multidisciplinary management on AD outcomes, and additional quality, controlled studies on epidemiologic risk factors for disease. It is hoped that additional knowledge of AD pathogenesis will soon lead to a proven biomarker for diagnosis and/or monitoring, and that AD-associated pruritus is better understood to generate improved therapeutic options.

### Management of atopic dermatitis in the pediatric population [^116vEbFr]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis, one of the most common skin disorders in young children, has a prevalence of 10% to 20% in the first decade of life. It is a chronic illness that requires a multifaceted treatment strategy in the setting of limited therapeutic options. Balancing safety concerns with efficacious treatment is of particular importance in the pediatric population. Parents of patients with atopic dermatitis turn to their primary caregivers for guidance regarding this physically demanding and psychologically stressful condition. In addition to serving as a review of atopic dermatitis, this article delves into the state-of-the-art therapeutic options and includes a detailed review of the differences between topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors. We also discuss new treatment strategies that are being used by atopic dermatitis specialists, such as comprehensive "education-as-intervention" models, wet wraps, bleach baths, and systemic immunomodulatory therapies.

### How we treat atopic dermatitis now and how that will change over the next 5 years [^115LGFE3]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

We live in exciting times in atopic dermatitis therapeutics, with many novel treatments in the clinical trial pipeline. Frustratingly, most of these trials are vehicle- or placebo-controlled, rather than head-to-head comparisons. Network meta-analyses can rank treatments against each other, even for placebo-controlled studies, aiding evidence-based guideline formulation and clinical decision-making. Treatment registries are an important additional vehicle to collect 'real-world' data on the long-term (cost) effectiveness and safety of the new drugs, outside of the stringent and short-term settings of clinical trials. As further agents enter clinical practice, the need for biomarkers of treatment response and drug safety becomes more pressing to move us towards personalized medicine and to avoid wasting healthcare resources. This review takes stock of our current treatment armamentarium for atopic dermatitis, highlights important gaps in our knowledge - including the relatively low number of studies conducted in children - and maps out how our treatment approaches for atopic dermatitis can become more targeted and holistic in the future.

### Diagnosis and management of common dermatoses in children: atopic, seborrheic, and contact dermatitis [^114SwwWT]. Clinical Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Atopic, seborrheic, and contact dermatitis can significantly reduce the quality of life of patients and their families. Although differing in specific aspects of their epidemiology, etiology, and pathobiology, all 3 dermatoses are common in the pediatric population, and they share a common treatment approach. Although effective and widely used to manage exacerbations of pediatric dermatitis, the use of topical corticosteroid remains a concern for some physicians and parents because of its potential for systemic absorption and adverse events associated with prolonged use. Newer additions to the dermatitis treatment algorithm, such as the topical calcineurin inhibitors, may provide an effective steroid-sparing treatment option. Adjuvant treatments, such as antihistamines, antifungals, and antibiotics, also can provide benefit in appropriate circumstances. As there is no cure for dermatitis, a comprehensive, multipronged management strategy of preventive measures, such as trigger avoidance and periodic pharmacologic treatment, will provide patients and caregivers with the best opportunity to successfully control the disease.

### Consensus guidelines for the management of atopic dermatitis: an Asia-Pacific perspective [^116it3C6]. The Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a relatively common disease in patients in the Asia-Pacific region. It presents a particular clinical challenge and requires careful clinical management. The chronic nature of AD characterized by flares, exacerbations and periods of quiescence requires a multipronged approach aimed at reducing itch, inflammation and the appearance of secondary lesions. In addition, varying levels of maintenance therapy may be required to avoid exacerbations. Survey data from the region indicate that there is significant variation across the Asia-Pacific with regard to current treatment practices. The management of AD may also be influenced by differing health-care systems, variable climate, access to medical care and cultural diversity. The current consensus guidelines have been developed to provide up-to-date and concise evidence- and experience-based recommendations directed towards general practitioners and general dermatologists in the Asia-Pacific region on the management of pediatric and adult AD.

### Systemic therapy for atopic dermatitis [^117CZUD1]. Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

Systemic therapy for atopic dermatitis (AD) is indicated in patients with severe disease refractory to adequate topical treatment. Currently available drugs aim to decrease inflammation by suppressing and/or modulating immune responses and thus may indirectly improve skin barrier function, resulting in a decrease in clinical signs and symptoms in particular pruritus. Before considering systemic treatment, patient adherence to topical treatment including skin care has to be ensured. The selection of the drug depends on the disease severity, localization, complications, concomitant diseases, and age of the patient, but also on their availability and costs as well as the doctor's experience. Bearing in mind the potential risk of resistance, systemic therapy with antibiotics should be exclusively considered in clinically manifest infections such as in children. Here, we review recently published clinical trials and case reports on systemic therapy of pediatric and adult patients with AD to draw conclusions for clinical practice. Although AD is a common disease, controlled clinical studies investigating the efficacy of systemic drugs are scarce, except for cyclosporine, which has been approved for the therapy of severe AD.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with topical therapies [^114rN5PS]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

Gaps in research — priorities for topical atopic dermatitis (AD) therapies. There are significant gaps in our current understanding of various topical AD therapies, and studies are needed which examine quality of life and other patient-important outcomes, changes to the cutaneous microbiome, as well as long term follow-up, and use in special and diverse populations (eg, pregnancy, lactation, immunosuppression, multiple co-morbidities, skin of color, and pediatric). Studies of moisturizer use in AD vary widely in methods, duration, endpoints and active ingredients, making it difficult to draw conclusions, and compare or aggregate data from various studies; future studies should prioritize standardization of study methods and study endpoints, larger sample sizes, and sufficient follow-up times. Additionally, studies examining variations in bathing and additives such as sodium hypochlorite and magnesium chloride are needed, and further research is called for to augment WWT data in adults, addressing variability in topical therapy, use of antiseptic solution in the wraps, and composition of wrap material; increased use of new systemic AD treatment options in moderate-to-severe disease may also result in a selection bias toward milder disease in topical therapy studies.

### Management of severe atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients [^111Q71xY]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a common, chronic inflammatory skin disorder, present in about 12% of children worldwide. Optimizing management of severe atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients is critical to reduce signs of inflammation, alleviate pruritus and sleep disturbance, minimize the development and/or impact of comorbidities, and improve the patient and caregiver's quality of life. Evaluating the longitudinal severity of pediatric atopic dermatitis is an important component of measuring therapeutic response and long-term management, and is different in clinical practice versus clinical trials. This article describes when and how to use different treatments for pediatric patients with severe atopic dermatitis, including topical medications, phototherapy, and systemic medical therapies (traditional immunosuppressants, biologics, and small molecule inhibitors). It also provides recommendations useful in clinical practice for nonpharmacologic interventions for pediatric patients with severe atopic dermatitis.

2 Topical Treatments

Topical treatment options for atopic dermatitis have greatly expanded over the past 25 years. Topical corticosteroids have been the mainstay of therapy for decades and remain important first‐line treatments for most children and adults with atopic dermatitis. However, their clinical benefit is limited in some instances by the potential for local adverse events (AEs), particularly in sensitive anatomic locations such as the face and folds. Additionally, while topical corticosteroids are safe and effective for most people when used properly, patient concerns over AEs may negatively impact adherence.

The introduction of the topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, in the early 2000s was a major development for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, giving patients the first non‐corticosteroid topical anti‐inflammatory treatment option. TCIs work by blocking both Th(T helper cell)1 and Th2 immune responses and reduce inflammation and improve the skin barrier without the risk of atrophy. TCIs are not effective for all patients, particularly for more severe lesions of atopic dermatitis, and are limited by application‐site discomfort. Fortunately, the development of TCIs paved the way for other non‐steroidal targeted topical therapies.

- Repairing and maintaining the skin barrier
- Hydrating the skin
- Reducing itch
- Treating inflammation
- Preventing and managing skin infections These treatment targets, when effectively addressed, not only improve disease symptoms and reduce flares but assist the child and family in achieving adequate sleep. Treating Inflammation To treat inflammation during a flare of atopic dermatitis, apply a topical corticosteroid twice daily to affected areas until improvement occurs. Ointments are preferred over creams because they tend to be more effective and better tolerated, although some patients prefer creams because they are less greasy. Choosing a topical corticosteroid depends on the age of the child and the area to be treated.

### Corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis… [^112mjLK3]. AAP (2021). Medium credibility.

Topical corticosteroids exert their effect through many mechanisms, including anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, antiproliferative, and vasoconstrictive effects. Selecting a Corticosteroid Consider the following factors when selecting a topical corticosteroid:

- How old is the patient.
- In general, a less potent preparation is required in infants than in older children or adolescents. For example, for the management of flares of atopic dermatitis, a low-potency preparation usually is sufficient in an infant, while in an adolescent, a mid-potency or high-potency product is needed.
- What area will be treated.
- Absorption of steroids varies with the thickness of the skin in various regions of the body.
- Absorption is greatest in areas where the skin is thin and lowest where the skin is thick.

Thus, only a low-potency preparation should be used on the face, while a mid-potency product will be needed to manage dermatitis on the feet.
- Absorption is also increased in occluded or warm and opposed areas of skin. Hence, in areas such as the axillae, groin, or diapered area of an infant, low-potency preparations are typically recommended. How much should you dispense. For treatment of a small area, prescribing a small tube is sufficient; however, larger amounts may be needed. Some rules that help determine the amount to prescribe include the following:

- In an older child, it takes
- 2 FTU to cover the face and neck
- 2. 5 FTU to cover the hand and arm
- 3. 5 FTU to cover the chest and abdomen
- 4. 5 FTU to cover the foot and leg
- When managing atopic dermatitis that involves a significant portion of the body, prescribing amounts of 227 or 454 g, rather than small tubes, may be necessary.

Adverse Effects When used appropriately topical corticosteroids are very safe; however, using too potent a preparation, particularly in an inappropriate location or for too long, may result in adverse effects.

Introduction

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic relapsing–remitting skin disease characterized by pruritus and skin inflammation. 1 Interactions among skin barrier dysfunction, immune abnormalities and infectious/environmental agents are thought to play roles in the development of AD, although the precise disease pathogenesis is not fully elucidated. 1

Atopic dermatitis usually appears in infancy and childhood (~85% of cases), and more than two‐thirds of pediatric patients with AD outgrow the condition before adolescence. 2 However, approximately 1–3% of adults are also affected. 3 The chronic nature of AD and the requirement for the frequent application of emollients and topical medications mean that its burden is high for patients and the health‐care system.

The main goals of therapy in patients with AD include relieving pruritus, improving skin barrier function, reducing inflammation and preventing flares. 1 Although preventing disease flares requires long‐term management, it has also been suggested that achieving remission with initial therapy may have a "disease‐modifying" effect and therefore play an important role in the long‐term management of AD. 4 The effective treatment of AD is important not only for improving symptoms and quality of life but also for preventing the development of chronic or severe symptoms. The use of topical anti‐inflammatory agents in pediatric patients with AD has been described as an important, potentially disease‐modifying strategy. 5 Therefore, the ideal first‐line pharmacological agents for the treatment of AD should have an excellent safety/tolerability profile as well as reliable anti‐inflammatory efficacy.

Currently recommended first‐line treatments include topical corticosteroids (TCS) and tacrolimus ointment (TAC‐O). 6, 7, 8 Although TCS have potent anti‐inflammatory activity in the maintenance treatment as well as in the crisis intervention, 9, 10 their long‐term use is known to be associated with cutaneous adverse events such as skin atrophy. 11, 12, 13 The occurrence of these side‐effects can decrease patient adherence to topical treatments, sometimes leading to the cessation of TCS. 14, 15

The mechanism of action of TAC‐O differs from those of TCS. 16 Topical tacrolimus inhibits the activation of pro‐inflammatory cells such as T lymphocytes and mast cells 17, 18 and prevents the progression of cytokine‐driven inflammation (Fig. 1).

### What's new in topicals for atopic dermatitis? [^113cPtmB]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can have tremendous impact on quality of life for affected children and adults. First-line therapy for acute management of AD includes topical therapies such as corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and, more recently, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor crisaborole. Topical agents have remained the mainstay therapy for decades; however, there has been a longstanding need for topical therapies with high efficacy and low risk of adverse effects with long-term use. Given the ongoing advances in understanding the pathogenesis of AD, there are novel targets for pharmacological intervention. We are now in an unprecedented time with more than 40 topical treatments in the pipeline for AD in addition to many developments and treatments on the horizon. This review summarizes selected therapeutic topical agents in later phases of development that target various aspects in the pathogenesis of AD such as Janus kinase inhibition (ruxolitinib and delgocitinib), phosphodiesterase-4 inhibition (roflumilast and difamilast), aryl hydrocarbon modulation (tapinarof), and modulation of the microbiome. We also review novel targeted therapies that are in early phase clinical trials, including AMTX-100, BEN-2293, and PRN473. Preliminary findings on efficacy and tolerability of most of these agents are promising, but further studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of these novel agents against the current standard of care.

### Developing drugs for treatment of atopic dermatitis in children (≥ 3 months to… [^117PWAgx]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is the most common chronic skin disease, and it primarily affects children. Although atopic dermatitis (AD) has the highest effect on burden of skin disease, no high-level studies have defined optimal therapy for severe disease. Corticosteroids have been used to treat AD since the 1950s and remain the only systemic medication with Food and Drug Administration approval for this indication in children, despite published guidelines of care that recommend against this option. Several clinical trials with level 1 evidence have supported the use of topical treatments for mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in adults and children, but these trials have had little consistency in protocol design. Consensus recommendations will help standardize clinical development and trial design for children. The Food and Drug Administration issues guidance documents for industry as a source for "the Agency's current thinking on a particular subject". Although they are nonbinding, industry considers these documents to be the standard for clinical development and trial design. Our consensus group is the first to specifically address clinical trial design in this population. We developed a draft guidance document for industry, Developing Drugs for Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis in Children (≥ 3 months to < 18 years of age). This draft guidance has been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration based on a provision in the Federal Register (Good Guidance Practices).

### Atopic dermatitis (eczema) guidelines: 2023 American academy of allergy, asthma and immunology / American college of allergy, asthma and immunology joint task force on practice parameters GRADE-and institute of medicine-based recommendations [^1174zUcg]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidance addressing atopic dermatitis (AD) management, last issued in 2012 by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Joint Task Force, requires updating as a result of new treatments and improved guideline and evidence synthesis methodology.

Objective

To produce evidence-based guidelines that support patients, clinicians, and other decision-makers in the optimal treatment of AD.

Methods

A multidisciplinary guideline panel consisting of patients and caregivers, AD experts (dermatology and allergy/immunology), primary care practitioners (family medicine, pediatrics, internal medicine), and allied health professionals (psychology, pharmacy, nursing) convened, prioritized equity, diversity, and inclusiveness, and implemented management strategies to minimize influence of conflicts of interest. The Evidence in Allergy Group supported guideline development by performing systematic evidence reviews, facilitating guideline processes, and holding focus groups with patient and family partners. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach informed rating the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations. Evidence-to-decision frameworks, subjected to public comment, translated evidence to recommendations using trustworthy guideline principles.

Results

The panel agreed on 25 recommendations to gain and maintain control of AD for patients with mild, moderate, and severe AD. The eAppendix provides practical information and implementation considerations in 1–2 page patient-friendly handouts.

Conclusion

These evidence-based recommendations address optimal use of (1) topical treatments (barrier moisturization devices, corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, PDE4 inhibitors [crisaborole], topical JAK inhibitors, occlusive [wet wrap] therapy, adjunctive antimicrobials, application frequency, maintenance therapy), (2) dilute bleach baths, (3) dietary avoidance/elimination, (4) allergen immunotherapy, and (5) systemic treatments (biologics/monoclonal antibodies, small molecule immunosuppressants [cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate, JAK inhibitors], and systemic corticosteroids) and UV phototherapy (light therapy).

Abstract

Background

Eczema is a common skin condition. Although topical corticosteroids have been a first‐line treatment for eczema for decades, there are uncertainties over their optimal use.

Objectives

To establish the effectiveness and safety of different ways of using topical corticosteroids for treating eczema.

Search methods

We searched databases to January 2021 (Cochrane Skin Specialised Register; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; GREAT) and five clinical trials registers. We checked bibliographies from included trials to identify further trials.

Selection criteria

Randomised controlled trials in adults and children with eczema that compared at least two strategies of topical corticosteroid use. We excluded placebo comparisons, other than for trials that evaluated proactive versus reactive treatment.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods, with GRADE certainty of evidence for key findings. Primary outcomes were changes in clinician‐reported signs and relevant local adverse events. Secondary outcomes were patient‐reported symptoms and relevant systemic adverse events. For local adverse events, we prioritised abnormal skin thinning as a key area of concern for healthcare professionals and patients.

Main results

We included 104 trials (8443 participants). Most trials were conducted in high‐income countries (81/104), most likely in outpatient or other hospital settings. We judged only one trial to be low risk of bias across all domains. Fifty‐five trials had high risk of bias in at least one domain, mostly due to lack of blinding or missing outcome data.

Stronger‐potency versus weaker‐potency topical corticosteroids

Sixty‐three trials compared different potencies of topical corticosteroids: 12 moderate versus mild, 22 potent versus mild, 25 potent versus moderate, and 6 very potent versus potent. Trials were usually in children with moderate or severe eczema, where specified, lasting one to five weeks. The most reported outcome was Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) of clinician‐reported signs of eczema.

We pooled four trials that compared moderate‐ versus mild‐potency topical corticosteroids (420 participants). Moderate‐potency topical corticosteroids probably result in more participants achieving treatment success, defined as cleared or marked improvement on IGA (52% versus 34%; odds ratio (OR) 2.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41 to 3.04; moderate‐certainty evidence). We pooled nine trials that compared potent versus mild‐potency topical corticosteroids (392 participants). Potent topical corticosteroids probably result in a large increase in number achieving treatment success (70% versus 39%; OR 3.71, 95% CI 2.04 to 6.72; moderate‐certainty evidence). We pooled 15 trials that compared potent versus moderate‐potency topical corticosteroids (1053 participants). There was insufficient evidence of a benefit of potent topical corticosteroids compared to moderate topical corticosteroids (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.89; moderate‐certainty evidence). We pooled three trials that compared very potent versus potent topical corticosteroids (216 participants). The evidence is uncertain with a wide confidence interval (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.09; low‐certainty evidence).

Twice daily or more versus once daily application

We pooled 15 of 25 trials in this comparison (1821 participants, all reported IGA). The trials usually assessed adults and children with moderate or severe eczema, where specified, using potent topical corticosteroids, lasting two to six weeks.

Applying potent topical corticosteroids only once a day probably does not decrease the number achieving treatment success compared to twice daily application (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.38; 15 trials, 1821 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).

Local adverse events

Within the trials that tested 'treating eczema flare‐up' strategies, we identified only 26 cases of abnormal skin thinning from 2266 participants (1% across 22 trials). Most cases were from the use of higher‐potency topical corticosteroids (16 with very potent, 6 with potent, 2 with moderate and 2 with mild). We assessed this evidence as low certainty, except for very potent versus potent topical corticosteroids, which was very low‐certainty evidence.

Longer versus shorter‐term duration of application for induction of remission

No trials were identified.

Twice weekly application (weekend, or 'proactive therapy') to prevent relapse (flare‐ups) versus no topical corticosteroids/reactive application

Nine trials assessed this comparison, generally lasting 16 to 20 weeks. We pooled seven trials that compared weekend (proactive) topical corticosteroids therapy versus no topical corticosteroids (1179 participants, children and adults with a range of eczema severities, though mainly moderate or severe).

Weekend (proactive) therapy probably results in a large decrease in likelihood of a relapse from 58% to 25% (risk ratio (RR) 0.43, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.57; 7 trials, 1149 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence).

Local adverse events

We did not identify any cases of abnormal skin thinning in seven trials that assessed skin thinning (1050 participants) at the end of treatment. We assessed this evidence as low certainty.

Other comparisons

Other comparisons included newer versus older preparations of topical corticosteroids (15 trials), cream versus ointment (7 trials), topical corticosteroids with wet wrap versus no wet wrap (6 trials), number of days per week applied (4 trials), different concentrations of the same topical corticosteroids (2 trials), time of day applied (2 trials), topical corticosteroids alternating with topical calcineurin inhibitors versus topical corticosteroids alone (1 trial), application to wet versus dry skin (1 trial) and application before versus after emollient (1 trial). No trials compared branded versus generic topical corticosteroids and time between application of emollient and topical corticosteroids.

Authors' conclusions

Potent and moderate topical corticosteroids are probably more effective than mild topical corticosteroids, primarily in moderate or severe eczema; however, there is uncertain evidence to support any advantage of very potent over potent topical corticosteroids. Effectiveness is similar between once daily and twice daily (or more) frequent use of potent topical corticosteroids to treat eczema flare‐ups, and topical corticosteroids weekend (proactive) therapy is probably better than no topical corticosteroids/reactive use to prevent eczema relapse (flare‐ups). Adverse events were not well reported and came largely from low‐ or very low‐certainty, short‐term trials. In trials that reported abnormal skin thinning, frequency was low overall and increased with increasing potency. We found no trials on the optimum duration of treatment of a flare, branded versus generic topical corticosteroids, and time to leave between application of topical corticosteroids and emollient. There is a need for longer‐term trials, in people with mild eczema.

### The treatment and management of atopic dermatitis in the pediatric emergency department: highlighting physician practices and the desire for patient-centered resources [^1141yUdr]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a common, complex skin disorder with significant morbidity. The management of atopic dermatitis is multifactorial and often varies by physician experience and comfort level. We conducted a single-institution survey of pediatric emergency medicine physicians regarding their perceived confidence in managing atopic dermatitis, knowledge of treatment options, and interest in patient-centered clinical resources. The results of our survey suggest that many pediatric emergency physicians at our center are somewhat confident managing atopic dermatitis and that topical corticosteroids represent the mainstay of treatment of AD. Our survey identified common AD therapies used by emergency department physicians and highlights the desire for further patient-centered resources in the emergency care setting.

### Pediatric atopic dermatitis: a review of the medical management [^117FnGdG]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the available treatment options for pediatric atopic dermatitis.

Data Sources

A literature review was performed in MEDLINE (1950-February 2010) using the key word atopic dermatitis. The references identified were evaluated in comparative treatment. The references included in this review were limited to studies conducted in children less than 18 years of age and written in the English language.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All of the literature retrieved that was published within the last 5 years (2005–2010) was included in this review. Other pertinent articles published prior to 2005 were also included.

Data Synthesis

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that usually begins during infancy. Potential causes include irritants such as soap and detergents, food allergens, contact allergens, and skin infections. Emollients, moisturizing agents that inhibit water loss and provide a protective coating, are recommended in all patients with atopic dermatitis. Additionally, emollients may reduce the need to use topical corticosteroids. Patients receiving desonide 0.05% plus an emollient achieved significant reductions in severity scores compared to those receiving desonide 0.05% as monotherapy (80% vs 70%; p < 0.01). Topical calcineurin inhibitors are not recommended as first-line therapy in pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis; however, their use in children above 2 years of age who fail to respond to topical corticosteroids may be considered.

Conclusions

Emollients are recommended in pediatric patients with a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis regardless of symptoms. Topical corticosteroids reduce the inflammation and pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis and are available in several formulations and strengths. Calcineurin inhibitors may be an alternative in children older than 2 years of age who do not respond to topical corticosteroids.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^117CxEZe]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) definition and epidemiology — AD is a chronic, pruritic inflammatory skin disease that occurs most frequently in children, but also affects many adults, follows a relapsing course, and is often associated with elevated serum immunoglobulin (IgE) levels and a personal or family history of type I allergies, allergic rhinitis, and asthma; atopic eczema is synonymous with AD. AD onset is most common between 3 and 6 months of age, with approximately 60% of patients developing the eruption in the first year of life and 90% by 5 years of age, and while the majority have resolution by adulthood, 10% to 30% do not. AD has a complex pathogenesis involving genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors that lead to a dysfunctional skin barrier and dysregulation of the immune system, notable clinical findings include erythema, edema, xerosis, erosions/excoriations, oozing and crusting, and lichenification, and pruritus is a hallmark of the condition that contributes substantially to disease burden.
