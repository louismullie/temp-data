## Question

how do you check for oligohydramnios on ultrasound

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to check for oligohydramnios on ultrasound. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the preferred measurement method and diagnostic thresholds. Then, I should verify the exact technique for obtaining those measurements. Next, I will consider when to use AFI versus SDP and why. After that, I need to check for confounders that can mimic or mask oligohydramnios. Finally, I will integrate how to document, when to repeat, and how this fits into management and surveillance pathways, making sure I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the preferred method and thresholds. The single deepest vertical pocket (SDP), also called the maximum vertical pocket or deepest vertical pocket, is the recommended primary approach to diagnose oligohydramnios, with oligohydramnios defined as SDP less than or equal to 2 cm, whereas the amniotic fluid index (AFI) less than or equal to 5 cm is an accepted alternative but tends to overcall oligohydramnios and increase interventions without improving outcomes, so I should prefer SDP when possible [^100863f4] [^b8f5543f] [^5fccdf61] [^71dd3641].

> Wait, let me verify the technique so I don't miss a pitfall. I need to ensure the pocket is truly vertical, at least 1 cm wide, and free of umbilical cord or fetal limbs; if cord or limbs are present, I should either gently nudge the fetus or use color Doppler to confirm and then choose a different pocket, because including cord or limbs falsely elevates the measurement and can miss true oligohydramnios [^5fccdf61] [^53a9d9ab] [^b6d5e48b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about AFI being "wrong". I should double-check the comparative evidence. Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses show that using AFI increases diagnoses of oligohydramnios and leads to more inductions and cesareans without improving peripartum outcomes, which supports favoring SDP in routine practice; however, some expert reviews argue AFI remains reasonable in certain contexts, so I need to align with ACOG's preference for SDP while acknowledging that AFI is still an accepted alternative when SDP cannot be reliably obtained or in specific protocols [^b7d4cddb] [^30fda341] [^5e27d9d4] [^100863f4].

> I need to ensure I account for confounders that can mimic or mask oligohydramnios. Maternal hydration status can transiently lower amniotic volume, so if the finding is unexpected, I should consider repeating after oral hydration; conversely, maternal obesity, suboptimal positioning, or poor acoustic windows can limit visualization and lead to underestimation, so I should optimize patient position, use appropriate transducer frequency, and consider alternative approaches if technical factors persist [^9ecb6e74] [^eefe92e2] [^e097b876].

> Let me consider special scenarios where AFI might still be useful. In multiple gestations, ACOG advises using SDP exclusively rather than AFI to avoid misleading summations across quadrants; in research or institutional protocols that historically used AFI, continuity may justify AFI, but I should document the rationale and recognize the higher false-positive rate for oligohydramnios with AFI compared with SDP [^5fccdf61] [^b7d4cddb].

> Next, I should review how to document and when to repeat. I will record the exact measurement in centimeters, the method used (SDP versus AFI), the quadrant or location of the pocket, and whether cord or limbs were excluded; if oligohydramnios is diagnosed, I should confirm with a repeat measurement on a separate scan when feasible, especially if the finding will change management, to mitigate operator or transient variability [^notfound].

> I will now examine how this integrates with management and surveillance. Isolated, persistent oligohydramnios (SDP ≤ 2 cm) in an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy warrants initiation of antepartum surveillance and consideration of delivery timing around 36 0/7 to 37 6/7 weeks or at diagnosis if later; if diagnosed before 36 weeks, management should be individualized based on gestational age and maternal–fetal condition, with repeat fluid assessment, NSTs, and growth surveillance if expectant management is chosen [^100863f4] [^1fb827cd] [^821e4410].

> But wait, what if the oligohydramnios is secondary to ruptured membranes or fetal anomalies? I should confirm membrane status clinically and, if needed, with testing, and I should perform a targeted fetal anatomical survey because oligohydramnios can be a marker of genitourinary anomalies, growth restriction, or placental insufficiency; in cases of suspected renal anomalies or severe oligohydramnios limiting ultrasound, fetal MRI can be considered as an adjunct to better define anatomy and pulmonary status [^518f3334] [^0248b774] [^d4ea3d2e].

> Let me reconsider the practical steps to ensure nothing is missed. First, optimize maternal position and use the appropriate transducer to visualize the largest clear pocket. Second, measure the vertical depth only, ensuring the pocket is at least 1 cm wide and free of cord or limbs. Third, diagnose oligohydramnios if SDP is 2 cm or less, and consider AFI 5 cm or less only if SDP cannot be reliably measured or if protocol dictates. Fourth, document the measurement, method, and exclusions. Fifth, correlate with clinical context, repeat if unexpected, and proceed with surveillance or delivery planning per gestational age and comorbidities [^5fccdf61] [^100863f4] [^b8f5543f].

---

Oligohydramnios is diagnosed on ultrasound by measuring the **single deepest vertical pocket (SDP) ≤ 2 cm** [^100863f4] or the **amniotic fluid index (AFI) ≤ 5 cm** [^71dd3641]. SDP is preferred because it reduces overdiagnosis and unnecessary interventions without worsening outcomes [^b8f5543f] [^b7d4cddb]. Measurements should exclude fetal parts and umbilical cord, and be repeated if the initial result is abnormal to confirm persistence [^b6d5e48b]. Oligohydramnios should prompt evaluation for causes such as ruptured membranes, fetal growth restriction, or renal anomalies, and guide management decisions [^518f3334] [^8045d461].

## Ultrasound techniques for assessing oligohydramnios

Two **primary ultrasound methods** are used to assess amniotic fluid volume: the single deepest vertical pocket (SDP) and the amniotic fluid index (AFI) [^5fccdf61].

| **Method** | **Definition** | **Diagnostic threshold for oligohydramnios** |
|-|-|-|
| Single deepest vertical pocket (SDP) | The largest vertical pocket of amniotic fluid measured in centimeters, excluding fetal parts and umbilical cord [^b6d5e48b] | ≤ 2 cm [^100863f4] |
| Amniotic fluid index (AFI) | The sum of the vertical depths of the largest fluid pockets in each of the four uterine quadrants [^7d5586e0] | ≤ 5 cm [^71dd3641] |

---

## Recommended method: single deepest vertical pocket (SDP)

Recent professional guidelines, including those from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM), **recommend SDP as the preferred method** for diagnosing oligohydramnios [^100863f4] [^b8f5543f]. This preference is based on evidence that SDP reduces the overdiagnosis of oligohydramnios and unnecessary interventions — such as induction of labor and cesarean delivery — without compromising perinatal outcomes [^b7d4cddb] [^30fda341].

---

## Clinical significance of oligohydramnios

Oligohydramnios is associated with **increased risks** of adverse perinatal outcomes, including:

- Fetal growth restriction (FGR) [^8045d461]
- Preterm birth [^2afac22b]
- Cesarean delivery for fetal distress [^b7d4cddb]
- Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission [^47f97aaa]
- Perinatal mortality [^notfound]

Therefore, **accurate diagnosis and appropriate management** are essential to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes [^100863f4].

---

## Factors influencing accuracy of ultrasound assessment

Several factors can influence the **accuracy of ultrasound assessment** of amniotic fluid volume:

- **Maternal hydration status**: Dehydration can reduce amniotic fluid volume, while hydration can increase it [^9ecb6e74].
- **Fetal position**: Fetal position can affect the distribution and measurement of amniotic fluid pockets [^notfound].
- **Operator experience**: Experienced sonographers are more likely to obtain accurate and consistent measurements [^notfound].
- **Gestational age**: Amniotic fluid volume naturally decreases with advancing gestational age, particularly after 40 weeks [^c55d181e].

---

## Clinical management implications

The diagnosis of oligohydramnios on ultrasound **guides clinical management**:

- **Expectant management**: For isolated oligohydramnios diagnosed before 36 weeks, expectant management with close surveillance is recommended, including serial ultrasound assessments, nonstress tests (NST), and fetal growth evaluations [^100863f4] [^1fb827cd].
- **Delivery timing**: For isolated oligohydramnios diagnosed at or beyond 36 weeks, delivery at 36 0/7 to 37 6/7 weeks is recommended [^100863f4] [^6b722a01].
- **Address underlying causes**: Oligohydramnios may be secondary to conditions such as ruptured membranes, fetal growth restriction, or renal anomalies, necessitating targeted evaluation and management [^518f3334] [^8045d461].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While ultrasound is the primary tool for diagnosing oligohydramnios, **limitations include**:

- **Operator dependence**: Accuracy depends on operator skill and experience [^notfound].
- **Variability**: Amniotic fluid volume is dynamic, and measurements can vary between examinations [^c61a5cd2].
- **False positives/negatives**: Technical factors and fetal position can lead to misinterpretation [^53bbf6cf].

---

Oligohydramnios is diagnosed on ultrasound by measuring the **single deepest vertical pocket (SDP) ≤ 2 cm** or the **amniotic fluid index (AFI) ≤ 5 cm**. SDP is the preferred method because it reduces overdiagnosis and unnecessary interventions without compromising outcomes. Accurate assessment and appropriate management are essential to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes.

### A review of amniotic fluid dynamics and the enigma of isolated oligohydramnios [^28a0e38a]. American Journal of Perinatology (2002). Low credibility.

Traditionally, oligohydramnios has been implemented as a sign of potential fetal compromise and associated with an increased incidence of adverse perinatal morbidity and mortality. Decreased amniotic fluid volume is especially of concern when it occurs in conjunction with structural fetal anomalies, fetal growth restriction, postdates pregnancies, and maternal disease. Consequently, following ultrasonographic diagnosis of oligohydramnios at term, delivery is routinely advocated even in otherwise uncomplicated pregnancies with an appropriate-for-gestational-age fetus, irrespective of the presence of reassuring fetal evaluation and the absence of maternal disease. Numerous factors complicate the ultrasonographic diagnosis of oligohydramnios. These include a lack of complete detailed understanding of the physiology of the dynamics of oligohydramnios, the transient condition at times of decreased amniotic fluid volume, generally poor performance of ultrasonography in detecting oligohydramnios, an array of different ultrasound diagnostic criteria, and varying ultrasonographic thresholds. In light of the latter and the lack of prospective randomized data, is unclear that the practice of effecting delivery for isolated oligohydramnios at term is justified. This article presents physiologic dynamics of amniotic fluid, factors that may affect amniotic fluid volume, possible pitfalls in the ultrasonographic assessment of amniotic fluid volume, and the clinical significance of oligohydramnios. In addition, the literature regarding perinatal outcome associated with oligohydramnios and current available data supporting expectant noninterventional management of cases complicated by isolated oligohydramnios at term are discussed.

### Neonatal outcomes are similar between patients with resolved and those with persistent oligohydramnios [^c61a5cd2]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Oligohydramnios (defined as amniotic fluid volume < 5cm or deepest vertical pocket < 2cm) is regarded as an ominous finding on prenatal ultrasound. Amniotic fluid, however, is not static, and to date, there have been no studies comparing perinatal outcomes in patients who are diagnosed with oligohydramnios that resolves and those who have persistent oligohydramnios.

Study Design

This is a secondary analysis of a National Institutes of Health-funded retrospective cohort study of singleton gestations delivered at a tertiary care hospital between 2002 and 2013 with mild hypertensive disorders and/or fetal growth restriction (FGR). Maternal characteristics, delivery, and neonatal information were abstracted by trained research nurses. Patients with a diagnosis of oligohydramnios were identified, and those with resolved versus persistent oligohydramnios at the time of delivery were compared. The primary outcome was a composite of neonatal resuscitation at delivery: administration of oxygen, bag-mask ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure, intubation, chest compression, or cardiac medication administration. Secondary outcomes included FGR, timing, and mode of delivery.

Results

Of 527 women meeting study criteria, 42 had oligohydramnios that resolved prior to delivery, whereas 485 had persistent oligohydramnios. There were no significant differences in patient demographics between groups. The gestational age at diagnosis was significantly lower for patients with resolved versus persistent oligohydramnios (median: 33.0 [interquartile range, IQR: 29.1–35.9] vs. 38.0 [IQR: 36.4–39.3], p < 0.001). There was not a substantial difference in rate of neonatal resuscitation (41 vs. 32%, p = 0.31). Patients with resolved oligohydramnios were more likely to have developed FGR than those with persistent oligohydramnios (55 vs. 36%, p < 0.02). There were no significant differences for gestational age at delivery, birth weight, or neonatal intensive care unit admission.

Conclusion

Patients whose oligohydramnios resolved were diagnosed earlier yet had similar rates of neonatal resuscitation but higher rates of FGR than those who had persistent oligohydramnios.

Key Points

· When diagnosed earlier in pregnancy, oligohydramnios was more likely to resolve prenatally. · Patients who were diagnosed with oligohydramnios earlier in pregnancy had higher rates of FGR. · There were no differences in the rates of the composite outcome of need for neonatal resuscitation when comparing those with resolved versus those with persistent oligohydramnios. No differences in composite neonatal morbidity were noted between those with resolved versus persistent oligohydramnios.

### The amniotic fluid index and oligohydramnios: a deeper dive into the shallow end [^5e27d9d4]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Second- and third-trimester obstetrical ultrasound examinations include an amniotic fluid volume assessment. Professional organizations' clinical guidance recommends using semiquantitative techniques, such as the single deepest vertical pocket or amniotic fluid index, for this purpose. The single deepest vertical pocket is described as the preferred method of assessing amniotic fluid volume based on fewer oligohydramnios diagnoses and labor inductions with no demonstrable difference in pregnancy outcomes compared with the amniotic fluid index. We offer an alternative interpretation of the evidence for this advice, drawn from 6 randomized clinical trials and 2 meta-analyses comparing the single deepest vertical pocket to the amniotic fluid index. Individually and collectively, these reports are underpowered to detect significant differences in maternal and perinatal outcomes by study group. Moreover, randomized clinical trials comparing maternal and perinatal outcomes resulting from a policy of labor induction at or beyond 37 weeks of gestation vs expectant care consistently favor labor induction, the very intervention paradoxically cited as favoring the single deepest vertical pocket vs the amniotic fluid index. We conclude that the amniotic fluid index should be considered a reasonable method for third-trimester amniotic fluid assessment and diagnosing oligohydramnios.

### Strip of the month: term oligohydramnios and prolonged decelerations… [^0e457b8d]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Electronic fetal monitoring is a popular technology used to establish fetal well-being. Despite its widespread use, the terminology used to describe patterns seen on the monitor has not been consistent until recently. In 1997, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Research Planning Workshop published guidelines for interpretation of fetal tracings. This publication was the culmination of 2 years of work by a panel of experts in the field of fetal monitoring and was endorsed in 2005 by both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses. In 2008, ACOG, NICHD, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine reviewed and updated the definitions for fetal heart rate patterns, interpretation, and research recommendations. Following is a summary of the terminology definitions and assumptions found in the 2008 NICHD workshop report.

### Management of oligohydramnios in pregnancy [^934418d2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The finding of oligohydramnios in pregnancy is problematic. The various mechanisms that control amniotic fluid, the inability to precisely measure and quantify the amount, and the relevance of a "decreased" amount of fluid make the management of this finding unclear. Given the limited amount of data, the single deepest vertical pocket may be a better method than the amniotic fluid index to define oligohydramnios. A large prospective study is needed to develop the most optimal management recommendations, especially for idiopathic oligohydramnios at or near term.

### Association of neonatal and fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios-introduction of a new "association factor" [^f75528ac]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

To date, ultrasound screening and targeted ultrasound examinations have played the most important role in the detection of fetal malformations. Ultrasound is the most widely used medical imaging procedure in the world, it is extremely safe, and with the development of ultrasound systems, it has been associated with increasing imaging performance. According to the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios are the two most commonly detected ultrasound abnormalities during pregnancy.

The possible causes of poly- and oligohydramnios are discussed in several publications. Polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios may be associated with fetal anatomical abnormalities, fetal chromosomal abnormalities. In a study spanning four years, Hentemann et al. investigated 140 pregnancies associated with various developmental abnormalities detected by ultrasound, the authors highlighted the importance of karyotyping from amniotic fluid in cases of detected developmental abnormalities and oligohydramnios. Kouamé et al. point out that when polyhydramnios is detected, particular care must be taken during ultrasound examination in order to detect any fetal abnormalities that may be present.

### Antepartum fetal surveillance: ACOG practice bulletin, number 229 [^100863f4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Oligohydramnios — definitions and delivery timing — Commonly used definitions of oligohydramnios include a single deepest vertical pocket of amniotic fluid of 2 cm or less and an amniotic fluid index of 5 cm or less, and the use of a percentile of amniotic fluid should not be used in management decisions; randomized controlled trials indicate that using the deepest vertical pocket measurement, as opposed to the amniotic fluid index, to diagnose oligohydramnios is associated with a reduction in unnecessary interventions without an increase in adverse perinatal outcomes. In the setting of otherwise uncomplicated isolated and persistent oligohydramnios (deepest vertical pocket measurement less than 2 cm), delivery at 36 0/7–37 6/7 weeks of gestation or at diagnosis if diagnosed later is recommended, whereas in pregnancies at less than 36 0/7 weeks of gestation with intact membranes the decision to proceed with expectant management or delivery should be individualized based on gestational age and the maternal and fetal condition; if delivery is not undertaken, follow-up amniotic fluid volume measurements, NSTs, and fetal growth assessments are indicated, and if the oligohydramnios results from fetal membrane rupture, follow-up amniotic fluid volume assessment often may be safely omitted.

### Medically indicated late-preterm and early-term deliveries: ACOG committee opinion, number 831 [^6b722a01]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion 831 — timing for fetal fluid abnormalities states: oligohydramnios (isolated or otherwise uncomplicated [deepest vertical pocket less than 2 cm]) is late preterm/early term with 36 0/7–37 6/7 weeks of gestation or at diagnosis if diagnosed later; polyhydramnios (mild, idiopathic) is full term with the note "early term birth not routinely recommended" and suggested specific timing 39 0/7–40 6/7 weeks of gestation.

### A rare cause of echogenic kidneys with oligohydramnios in the fetus: report of two different cases [^e0830f08]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Prenatal ultrasound findings of fetal bilateral echogenic kidneys accompanied by oligohydramnios can be highly stressful for both pregnant women and physicians. The diversity of underlying causes makes it challenging to confirm a prenatal diagnosis, predict postnatal outcomes, and counsel regarding recurrence risks in future pregnancies.

Case Presentation

We report two cases of abnormal fetal echogenic kidneys with oligohydramnios detected in the early third trimester. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), a rare genetic syndrome, was initially suspected in both cases. However, postnatal diagnoses differed: the first case was confirmed as glomerulocystic kidney disease (GCKD) through renal pathology, while the second case was diagnosed as ARPKD with a compound heterozygous likely pathogenic PKHD1 mutation.

Conclusion

Prenatal diagnosis of fetal echogenic kidneys with oligohydramnios should prioritize accurate diagnosis. Given the differences in the clinical spectrum, GCKD should be considered a differential diagnosis for this condition, particularly ARPKD. This study highlights the importance and benefits of molecular diagnosis and postnatal renal pathology for precise diagnosis and effective counseling.

### The role of amniotic fluid assessment in indicated preterm delivery [^69e12ae7]. Seminars in Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

Measuring amniotic fluid pockets with ultrasound is an efficient and reasonably reliable method of evaluating amniotic fluid volume and categorizing relative risk of perinatal morbidity. The most commonly used ultrasound criteria for oligohydramnios, SDP < 2 cm and AFI < 5 cm, assign approximately 2%-3% and 4%-5% of late preterm pregnancies into the "low amniotic fluid" category. The AFI offers somewhat greater sensitivity and greater precision but has less specificity for predicting perinatal morbidity than does the SDP. Thus, before 34 weeks, use of the AFI < 5 cm as a criterion for intensive fetal monitoring, but not as sole criteria for delivery, is recommended. In pregnancies beyond 34 weeks, use of either AFI or SDP to diagnose oligohydramnios can be expected to reliably identify fetuses at risk for compromised perinatal outcome especially if replicate measurements are confirmatory. In such cases, care must be taken to identify comorbid conditions that, together with oligohydramnios, may place the fetus at significant risk. In such cases, delivery is the recommended intervention.

### Isolated oligohydramnios in previous pregnancy is a risk factor for a placental related disorder in subsequent delivery [^708a366a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the current study points to a strong association between isolated oligohydramnios in previous delivery and any main placental disorder in the subsequent delivery, especially oligohydramnios recurrence and small for gestational age neonate. Based on our results the risk for a small for gestational age neonate is increased two-fold in subsequent delivery. Accordingly, isolated oligohydramnios may be the first sign of placental insufficiency even in the absence of overt fetal growth impairment and may be an independent manifestation of the placental related complications spectrum.

Randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm our hypothesis, and to define the proper management in cases of isolated oligohydramnios, including establishing guidelines for follow up in subsequent pregnancies.

### Planned early delivery versus expectant management of the term suspected compromised baby for improving outcomes [^515ce937]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fetal compromise in the term pregnancy is suspected when the following clinical indicators are present: intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), decreased fetal movement (DFM), or when investigations such as cardiotocography (CTG) and ultrasound reveal results inconsistent with standard measurements. Pathological results would necessitate the need for immediate delivery, but the management for 'suspicious' results remains unclear and varies widely across clinical centres. There is clinical uncertainty as to how to best manage women presenting with a suspected term compromised baby in an otherwise healthy pregnancy.

Objectives

To assess, using the best available evidence, the effects of immediate delivery versus expectant management of the term suspected compromised baby on neonatal, maternal and long-term outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing expectant management versus planned early delivery for women with a suspected compromised fetus from 37 weeks' gestation or more.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed trial quality. Two review authors independently extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Of the 20 reports identified by the search strategy, we included three trials (546 participants: 269 to early delivery and 277 to expectant management), which met our inclusion criteria. Two of the trials compared outcomes in 492 pregnancies with IUGR of the fetus, and one in 54 pregnancies with oligohydramnios. All three trials were of reasonable quality and at low risk of bias. The level of evidence was graded moderate, low or very low, downgrading mostly for imprecision and for some indirectness. Overall, there was no difference in the primary neonatal outcomes of perinatal mortality (no deaths in either group, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded moderate), major neonatal morbidity (risk ratio (RR) 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 2.81, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded low), or neurodevelopmental disability/impairment at two years of age (RR 2.04, 95% CI 0.62 to 6.69, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded low). There was no difference in the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (one trial, 333 infants) or meconium aspiration (one trial, 459 infants), There was also no difference in the reported primary maternal outcomes: maternal mortality (RR 3.07, 95% CI 0.13 to 74.87, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded low), and significant maternal morbidity (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.22, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded low). The gestational age at birth was on average 10 days earlier in women randomised to early delivery (mean difference (MD) -9.50, 95% CI -10.82 to -8.18, one trial, 459 women) and women in the early delivery group were significantly less likely to have a baby beyond 40 weeks' gestation (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.67, one trial, 33 women). Significantly more infants in the planned early delivery group were admitted to intermediate care nursery (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.61, two trials, 491 infants). There was no difference in the risk of respiratory distress syndrome, (one trial, 333 infants), Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (three trials, 546 infants), resuscitation required (one trial, 459 infants), mechanical ventilation (one trial, 337 infants), admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.23, three trials, 545 infants, evidence graded very low), length of stay in NICU/SCN (one trial, 459 infants), and sepsis (two trials, 366 infants). Babies in the expectant management group were more likely to be < 2.3rd centile for birthweight (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.73, two trials, 491 infants), however there was no difference in the proportion of babies with birthweight < 10th centile (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.10). There was no difference in any of the reported maternal secondary outcomes including: caesarean section rates (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.59, three trials, 546 women, evidence graded low), placental abruption (one trial, 459 women), pre-eclampsia (one trial, 459 women), vaginal birth (three trials 546 women), assisted vaginal birth (three trials 546 women), breastfeeding rates (one trial, 218 women), and number of weeks of breastfeeding after delivery one trial, 124 women). There was an expected increase in induction in the early delivery group (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.78 to 2.37, one trial, 459 women). No data were reported for the pre-specified secondary neonatal outcomes of the number of days of mechanical ventilation, moderate-severe hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy or need for therapeutic hypothermia. Likewise, no data were reported for secondary maternal outcomes of postnatal infection, maternal satisfaction or views of care.

Authors' Conclusions

A policy for planned early delivery versus expectant management for a suspected compromised fetus at term does not demonstrate any differences in major outcomes of perinatal mortality, significant neonatal or maternal morbidity or neurodevelopmental disability. In women randomised to planned early delivery, the gestational age at birth was on average 10 days earlier, women were less likely to have a baby beyond 40 weeks' gestation, they were more likely to be induced and infants were more likely to be admitted to intermediate care nursery. There was also a significant difference in the proportion of babies with a birthweight centile < 2.3rd, however this did not translate into a reduction in morbidity. The review is informed by only one large trial and two smaller trials assessing fetuses with IUGR or oligohydramnios and therefore cannot be generalised to all term pregnancies with suspected fetal compromise. There are other indications for suspecting compromise in a fetus at or near term such as maternal perception of DFM, and ultrasound and/or CTG abnormalities. Future randomised trials need to assess effectiveness of timing of delivery for these indications.

### Amniotic fluid and the clinical relevance of the sonographically estimated amniotic fluid volume: oligohydramnios [^53bbf6cf]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The amniotic fluid volume (AFV) is regulated by several systems, including the in-tramembranous pathway, fetal production (fetal urine and lung fluid) and uptake (fetal swallowing), and the balance of fluid movement via osmotic gradients. The normal AFV across gestation has not been clearly defined; consequently, abnormal volumes are also poorly defined. Actual AFVs can be measured by dye dilution techniques and directly measured at cesarean delivery; however, these techniques are time-consuming, are invasive, and require laboratory support, and direct measurement can only be done at cesarean delivery. As a result of these limitations, the AFV is estimated by the amniotic fluid index (AFI), the single deepest pocket, and subjective assessment of the AFV. Unfortunately, sonographic estimates of the AFV correlate poorly with dye-determined or directly measured amniotic fluid. The recent use of color Doppler sonography has not improved the diagnostic accuracy of sonographic estimates of the AFV but instead has led to overdiagnosis of oligohydramnios. The relationship between the fixed cutoffs of an AFI of 5 cm or less and a single deepest pocket of 2 cm or less for identifying adverse pregnancy outcomes is uncertain. The use of the single deepest pocket compared to the AFI to identify oligohydramnios in at-risk pregnancies seems to be a better choice because the use of the AFI leads to an increase in the diagnosis of oligohydramnios, resulting in more labor inductions and cesarean deliveries without any improvement in peripartum outcomes.

8.1.4 Ultrasound measurement of amniotic fluid volume

Professional societies do not recommend inclusion of isolated amniotic fluid volume assessment into management decisions for FGR. A decrease in amniotic fluid volume can occur as a result of fetal oliguria in response to progressive placental dysfunction and hypoxia, as well as rupture of membranes. 287, 288, 324 Accordingly, additional evaluation is required to determine the significance of decreased amniotic fluid volume. Oligohydramnios can be defined as an ultrasound measured four‐quadrant amniotic fluid index below or equal to 5 cm, or a maximum vertical amniotic fluid pocket below or equal to 2 cm. 325 Use of the latter reduces overdiagnosis of oligohydramnios and is preferred. Oligohydramnios is associated with an increased rate of intrapartum FHR abnormalities, need for cesarean section, and low 5‐minute Apgar scores, but not acidosis at birth. 326

### Outcome of pregnancies complicated by oligohydramnios or anhydramnios of renal origin [^a2f8a686]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the outcome of fetuses with oligohydramnios due to kidney anomalies.

Methods

A retrospective study was performed of all pregnancies diagnosed with oligohydramnios and associated kidney anomalies during the period 2000–2008. Outcome included pregnancy outcome, mortality, and morbidity. Morbidity included renal function based on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) during follow-up.

Results

A total of 71 pregnancies were evaluated; 36 fetuses presented on ultrasound with cystic dysplasia, 15 with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and 20 with hydronephrosis. Twenty-three (32%) had associated anomalies. In 49 fetuses (69%), the diagnosis had been made before 24 weeks of gestational age (GA); 41 of those pregnancies were terminated. Twenty-five neonates were live born: 10 survived, 15 died. Prognostic factors for survival included GA at diagnosis (32.2 weeks for survivors vs 28.1 weeks for non-survivors; P = 0.02), diagnosis of hydronephrosis (7 in the survivors vs 4 in the non-survivors: P = 0.05), isolated anomaly (9 in the survivors vs 7 in the non-survivors: P = 0.04). Severity of oligohydramnios (1 case of anhydramnios in the survivors vs 7 in the non-survivors: P = 0.08) was not significant. The 1-year GFR was below 50 mL/min.1.73 m(2) in four of the ten survivors.

Conclusion

The prognosis of early onset renal oligohydramnios is poor. Predictive determinants of survival are: GA at diagnosis, nature of renal anomaly (hydronephrosis vs other), and presence of associated anomalies.

### Association of neonatal and fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios-introduction of a new "association factor" [^e9e74c39]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our findings indicate that if the ultrasound examination reveals less or more amniotic fluid than the average, increased attention should be paid to ultrasound examination of the urogenital system, abdominal organs, skull and spine, and limbs and skeletal system of the intrauterine fetus. In the case of polyhydramnios, fetal echocardiography is recommended. The attention of the neonatologist or pediatrician should also be drawn to abnormalities in the volume of amniotic fluid at delivery, as further examination of the newborn may be warranted in these cases.

### How well do the amniotic fluid index and single deepest pocket indices (below the 3rd and 5th and above the 95th and 97th percentiles) predict oligohydramnios and hydramnios? [^6f8019b6]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to determine whether the amniotic fluid index (AFI) and single deepest pocket percentiles can reliably identify a dye-determined amniotic fluid volume.

Study Design

Ultrasound measurements and dye-determined volumes were prospectively collected. Oligohydramnios predictors included AFI and single deepest pocket below the 3rd and 5th percentiles, and hydramnios predictors were based on AFI and single deepest pocket above the 95th and 97th percentiles.

Results

Two hundred ninety-one women with singleton pregnancies participated, including 75 pregnancies (26%) with oligohydramnios and 31 pregnancies (10%) with hydramnios. The predictive ability of the AFI and single deepest pocket indices (< 3rd and 5th percentiles) to identify oligohydramnios was between 11% and 27% and to identify hydramnios (> 95th and 97th percentiles) ranged between 33% and 46%. The best prediction was for normal fluid volume with an accuracy of 83% to 94%.

Conclusion

Amniotic fluid indices perform best for the identifying normal AF volumes, whereas the identification of oligohydramnios or hydramnios is poor.

Association between intrauterine detectability of fetal abnormalities and amniotic fluid volume

Changes in amniotic fluid volume have been shown to affect the detectability of fetal anatomical abnormalities. Ultrasound screenings are also affected by the difficulty of the examination.

In the case of polyhydramnios, the fetus, and thus the fetal anatomical abnormalities, are easier to visualize during ultrasound examination, whereas in the case of oligohydramnios, ultrasound examination is more difficult. This explains why we have seen an upward trend in the detection of anatomical abnormalities in all organ groups in the case of polyhydramnios. Thus, a higher proportion of fetal anatomical abnormalities were detected with greater efficiency when associated with polyhydramnios. The difference was significant for craniofacial abnormalities, cardiovascular abnormalities, and thoracic abnormalities, with an increase in the rate of in utero detection from 32.57 to 51.85% for craniofacial abnormalities, from 62.1 to 79.69% for cardiovascular abnormalities, and from 56.41 to 74.19% for thoracic abnormalities.

Changes in amniotic fluid volume alone may also alert to an underlying fetal abnormality. It is often observed that the abnormality in amniotic fluid volume is the reason for sending the expectant mother for our genetic counselling, and that subsequent ultrasound scans and fetal echocardiography reveal additional fetal anatomical abnormalities.

Oligohydramnios, although it can raise awareness of fetal abnormalities, can also complicate ultrasound examination, which explains why we saw a non-significant upward trend in the detection of abnormalities only in cardiovascular, urogenital, limb and ossification disorders and disorders with subcutaneous oedema, and a downward trend in the detection of all other organ systems. This decreasing trend was significant in all cases, i.e. craniospinal, craniofacial, thoracic, abdominal and abdominal wall anomalies.

### Serial third-trimester ultrasonography compared with routine care in uncomplicated pregnancies: a randomized controlled trial [^4822df31]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Among uncomplicated pregnancies, serial third-trimester ultrasound examinations identified significantly more cases with a composite of fetal growth or amniotic fluid abnormalities (27%) than did routine fundal height measurements (8%).

Methods

Women without complications between 24 0/7 and 30 6/7 weeks of gestation were randomized (NCT0270299) to either routine care (control arm) or ultrasound examination every 4 weeks (intervention arm). The primary outcome was a composite of abnormalities of fluid volume and growth: oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios; fetal growth restriction; or large for gestational age. The secondary outcome was the presence of composite maternal or neonatal morbidity among the two groups. A total of 206 participants was needed to have 80% power to detect an increase in the primary composite outcome from 10% in control to 25% in the intervention group (baseline rate 10%; two-tailed; α = 0.05; loss to follow-up 5%). All women were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. Fisher exact, χ tests, or two-sample t tests were used to assess group differences.

Results

From July 11, 2016, to May 24, 2017, 852 women were screened for eligibility and 206 were randomized as follows: 102 in routine care and 104 in serial ultrasound examinations. The two groups were comparable in baseline characteristics. The primary composite outcome was significantly higher among women who were in the ultrasound examination group than the routine care group (27% vs 8%; relative risk 3.43, 95% CI 1.64–7.17); five women (95% CI 3–11) were needed to identify at least one of the composite ultrasound abnormalities. Although we were underpowered to detect a significant difference, the following secondary endpoints occurred with similar frequency in the ultrasound examination group than the routine care group: induction resulting from abnormal ultrasound examination findings (14% vs 6%), cesarean delivery in labor (5% vs 6%), and prespecified composite maternal morbidity (9% in both groups) and composite neonatal morbidity (1% vs 4%).

Conclusion

Among uncomplicated pregnancies between 24 0/7 and 30 6/7 weeks of gestation, serial third-trimester ultrasound examinations were significantly more likely to identify abnormalities of fetal growth or amniotic fluid than measurements of fundal height and indicated ultrasound examination. No differences in maternal and neonatal outcomes were noted, although we were underpowered for these endpoints.

### Reducing stillbirths: screening and monitoring during pregnancy and labour [^7d5586e0]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Amniotic fluid protects and supports the fetus during pregnancy. Both low amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios) and high amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios) are abnormal and potentially place the fetus at risk of adverse outcomes. Oligohydramnios can be associated with maternal conditions including pre-eclampsia, or with placental membrane rupture, fetal growth restriction, post-term pregnancy, fetal kidney problems, or fetal or placental abnormalities. Polyhydramnios is frequently associated with maternal diabetes mellitus, maternal cardiac problems, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, or fetal or placental malformations, but in 50–60% of cases, it is idiopathic. Until ultrasound became available, the invasive nature of amniotic fluid testing limited its clinical usefulness. Using ultrasound, multiple methods for measuring amniotic fluid have been developed and are used to identify at-risk pregnancies. The amniotic fluid index (AFI) is a measure of the amount of amniotic fluid which is calculated by summing centimeters of depth of 4 different pockets of fluid; alternatively, the single deepest vertical pocket or maximum pool depth may be used. At term, many clinicians will induce labour or perform Caesarean section after diagnosis of decreased amniotic fluid volume to prevent an adverse pregnancy outcome. However, using assessments of amniotic fluid volume to predict fetal complications is controversial, and the utility of amniotic fluid assessment is different when used prior to versus after the onset of labour. Here, we examine the potential for assessment of amniotic fluid volume, or interventions to achieve normal amniotic fluid volume, to effectively detect high-risk pregnancy or fetal distress and subsequent adverse perinatal outcomes. We also examined the impact of interventions to achieve normal amniotic fluid volume on perinatal outcomes

### Antepartum fetal surveillance: ACOG practice bulletin, number 229 [^1fb827cd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Antepartum fetal surveillance — Level C recommendations include that initiating antepartum fetal testing at 32 0/7 weeks of gestation or later is appropriate for most at-risk patients, though in higher-risk conditions testing might begin when delivery would be considered for perinatal benefit; when the clinical condition prompting testing persists, testing should be repeated periodically until delivery and tests are typically repeated at weekly intervals, with some investigators performing more frequent testing and no optimal regimen established; in the absence of obstetric contraindications, delivery of the fetus with an abnormal test result often may be attempted by induction of labor with continuous intrapartum monitoring of the fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contractions; and for otherwise uncomplicated isolated and persistent oligohydramnios with deepest vertical pocket less than 2 cm, delivery at 36 0/7–37 6/7 weeks of gestation or at diagnosis if diagnosed later is recommended, whereas at less than 36 0/7 weeks with intact membranes and oligohydramnios the decision should be individualized based on gestational age and maternal–fetal condition.

### Practice bulletin no. 175: ultrasound in pregnancy [^5fccdf61]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Amniotic fluid volume evaluation using ultrasonography — objective methods and diagnostic thresholds are detailed with preference for the deepest vertical pocket. It is recommended that objective, rather than subjective, measurements of amniotic fluid volume be used, especially in the third trimester. To qualify as a measurable amniotic fluid pocket with either method, the width of the pocket must be at least 1 cm. Oligohydramnios is described in various ways, including absence of a vertical pocket of at least 2 cm and an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of less than 5 cm; best available evidence supports using the deepest vertical pocket method of measurement because it leads to fewer interventions with no increase in poor perinatal outcomes compared with use of the AFI, and only the deepest vertical pocket method should be used with multiple pregnancies. Polyhydramnios commonly is described by an AFI greater than or equal to 24 cm or a maximum deepest vertical pocket of equal to or greater than 8 cm; idiopathic polyhydramnios represents 50–60% of cases.

### Clinical relevance of sonographically estimated amniotic fluid volume: polyhydramnios [^be125960]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Polyhydramnios is an excessive amount of amniotic fluid within the amniotic cavity. The etiology of polyhydramnios may be idiopathic, the consequence of fetal structural anomalies, or the consequence of various fetal and maternal conditions. The clinical importance of polyhydramnios is found in its association with adverse pregnancy outcomes and the risk of perinatal mortality. The antenatal management of polyhydramnios can be challenging as there are no formalized guidelines on the topic. The purpose of this review is to provide a literature-based overview on the subject of polyhydramnios in singleton pregnancies, demonstrate its clinical implications, and describe a practical approach to its management.

### Toward consistent terminology: assessment and reporting of amniotic fluid volume [^b6d5e48b]. Seminars in Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Amniotic fluid is typically measured by ultrasound using the amniotic fluid index (AFI) or the maximum vertical pocket (MVP). Although both parameters correlate poorly with the actual amniotic fluid volume measured with dye-dilution methods, cross-sectional studies have been used to establish gestational norms. The current acceptable definition of polyhydramnios in the late second and the third trimester in both singleton and multiple gestations is a MVP > 8 cm, while the definition of oligohydramnios is a MVP < 2 cm. The pocket to be measured should exclude the umbilical cord or fetal parts. Randomized clinical trials have indicated that defining oligohydramnios as a MVP < 2 cm will result in fewer obstetrical interventions and similar perinatal outcomes when compared to an AFI < 5 cm.

### Association of neonatal and fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios-introduction of a new "association factor" [^3c617e3b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Detection of fetal abnormalities and association with other abnormalities

For many organ systems, the detection rate was higher when the abnormality occurred alone. The results of the study raise the question of how to explain the lower detection rate when the anomaly is associated with a chromosomal abnormality or occurs as part of other multiplex abnormalities. It is important to consider that some of the abnormalities alone may justify the parents' request for termination of the pregnancy. Therefore, in such cases, no further investigations are carried out, and other abnormalities may be detected during the fetopathological examination. It is also important to note that some of these abnormalities may not be detected until later in pregnancy or until after birth, and therefore may not be detected during intrauterine ultrasound scans in association with other abnormalities.

Strength of the study is that the new information primarily relates to the fact that we determined the exact rate of polyhydramnios or oligohydramnios in each organ system using the same method, and we determined the association between anatomical abnormalities and the amount of amniotic fluid using both the traditional and the new method we developed. The new method introduced, the determination of the "Association Factor" (AF), may also be suitable for performing other association statistical studies.

A limitation of the study is that the new method has not yet been tested to examine the association of other abnormalities; this is planned in a further publication.

### Prevalence and associated factors of oligohydramnios in pregnancies beyond 36 weeks of gestation at a tertiary hospital in southwestern Uganda [^c55d181e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Oligohydramnios is associated with poor maternal and perinatal outcomes. In low-resource countries, including Uganda, oligohydramnios is under-detected due to the scarcity of ultrasonographic services. We determined the prevalence and associated factors of oligohydramnios among women with pregnancies beyond 36 weeks of gestation at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) in Southwestern Uganda.

Methods

We conducted a hospital-based cross-sectional study from November 2019 to March 2020. Included were women at gestational age > 36 weeks. Excluded were women with ruptured membranes, those in active labour, and those with multiple pregnancies. An interviewer-administered structured questionnaire was used to capture demographic, obstetric, and clinical characteristics of the study participants. We determined oligohydramnios using an amniotic fluid index (AFI) obtained using an ultrasound scan. Oligohydramnios was diagnosed in participants with AFI ≤ 5 cm. We performed multivariable logistic regression to determine factors associated with oligohydramnios.

Results

We enrolled 426 women with a mean age of 27 (SD ± 5.3) years. Of the 426 participants, 40 had oligohydramnios, for a prevalence of 9.4% (95%CI: 6.8–12.6%). Factors found to be significantly associated with oligohydramnios were history of malaria in pregnancy (aOR = 4.6; 95%CI: 1.5–14, P = 0.008), primegravidity (aOR = 3.7; 95%CI: 1.6–6.7, P = 0.002) and increasing gestational age; compared to women at 37–39 weeks, those at 40–41 weeks (aOR = 2.5; 95%CI: 1.1–5.6, P = 0.022), and those at > 41 weeks (aOR = 6.0; 95%CI: 2.3–16, P = 0.001) were more likely to have oligohydramnios.

Conclusion

Oligohydramnios was detected in approximately one out of every ten women seeking care at MRRH, and it was more common among primigravidae, those with a history of malaria in pregnancy, and those with post-term pregnancies. We recommend increased surveillance for oligohydramnios in the third trimester, especially among prime gravidas, those with history of malaria in pregnancy, and those with post-term pregnancies, in order to enable prompt detection of this complication and plan timely interventions. Future longitudinal studies are needed to assess clinical outcomes in women with oligohydramnios in our setting.

Amniotic fluid assessment in limited obstetric ultrasound specifies that the pocket must be at least 1 cm in width; oligohydramnios is defined as a DVP less than 2 cm or AFI of 5 cm or less; polyhydramnios is defined as a single DVP of 8 cm or greater or AFI of 24 cm or greater; and the single DVP is the preferred method of assessment for oligohydramnios.

### Association of neonatal and fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios-introduction of a new "association factor" [^94d57c4b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

In our study, we analyzed 12 years of data (2005–2016) from the I. Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Semmelweis University, where developmental anomalies were diagnosed in the fetopathological findings or during postnatal examination. We processed prenatal ultrasound findings, postnatal clinical data, and fetopathological findings. We investigated the proportion of each fetal anatomical abnormality associated with polyhydramnios or oligohydramnios on prenatal fetal ultrasound screenings.

From 2005 we introduced in our department the method of amniotic fluid index (AFI) for measuring polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios. During the period of 2005–2016 in almost all cases the amniotic fluid index was used. From 2017 to 2018 in our department the single deepest pocket (SDP) was used. In the study, we aimed to apply a uniform method, which is why we decided to examine the period 2005–2016.

Polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios were defined in almost all cases using amniotic fluid index (AFI) values measured during ultrasound examinations and categorized as oligohydramnios at the 5th percentile and polyhydramnios at the 95th percentile. In only few cases, if no AFI value was available, the value of the single deepest pocket (SDP) was used.

For comparability with literature data, abnormalities were grouped according to the criteria of the EUROCAT study. The abnormalities were classified into major groups: craniospinal, craniofacial, cardiovascular, other thoracic abnormalities, abdominal and abdominal wall abnormalities, urogenital abnormalities, limb abnormalities, and ossification disorders. We also examined disorders associated with subcutaneous oedema.

Prenatally we used Fenton growth chart for diagnosis of fetal growth restriction (FGR). The estimated weight below 10th percentile was categorised as FGR.

### Amniotic fluid abnormalities [^cac12d54]. Seminars in Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

The complex nature of amniotic fluid reflects contributions from many fetal systems, many functional roles, and multiple interactions with fetal maturation, obstetric, and maternal factors. Simple ultrasound measurement, probably done best with the maximum vertical pocket method, has a clinical role in fetal surveillance, substantiated by extensive level II and some level I evidence. Interventions (amnioinfusion for oligohydramnios, amnioreduction for polyhydramnios) have not been studied effectively in controlled fashion, with the exception of intrapartum applications, where effective reduction of cesarean delivery for fetal distress and perinatal impacts of meconium aspiration may follow amnioinfusion. A wealth of research opportunities exists into regulation of amniotic fluid constituents and their relation to preterm delivery.

Practice Points 8.6.1–8.6.3 — prenatal and fetal evaluation — Mild radiographic abnormalities in the fetus, observed prenatally or during routine follow-up of pregnancy, do not necessarily predict severe ADPKD in the child, and shared decision-making regarding the value and short- and long-term implications of confirmatory genetic testing is advised. Severe fetal bilateral structural kidney cystic disease and/or oligohydramnios portend a higher risk of poor neonatal outcome or early-onset childhood kidney dysfunction, and such severe cases may warrant proper genetic testing; Termination of pregnancy may be considered when significant fetal dysfunction leading to Potter sequence is present, and the latter situation suggests ARPKD, not ADPKD. Parents should be counseled that a normal fetal ultrasound does not exclude the diagnosis of ADPKD in an at-risk child, because The level of sensitivity of ultrasound in the fetus to detect ADPKD is low and a normal kidney ultrasound in fetal life, or even in childhood, does not exclude the diagnosis of ADPKD.

### Assessment of the fetal lungs in utero [^d4ea3d2e]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2022). Medium credibility.

Conditions resulting in oligohydramnios/anhydramnios

Conditions that result in second-trimester oligohydramnios may restrict fetal lung growth and result in pulmonary hypoplasia, as shown in both animal models and human fetuses. This may be because of congenital abnormalities such as bilateral renal agenesis or acquired abnormalities such as PPROM.
1 Renal tract abnormalities and early-onset oligohydramnios are associated. Pulmonary hypoplasia in these cases is thought to be attributable to low urine production that results in a decrease in intraamniotic pressure and increase in the alveolar–amniotic pressure gradient. A population-based study suggested a positive correlation between pulmonary hypoplasia and oligohydramnios, in which oligohydramnios-exposed children presented an 8% higher increased admissions rate with respiratory illness than nonexposed children. The exact mechanism by which lung hypoplasia ensues is unclear, but animal models suggest that oligohydramnios at the pseudoglandular stage reduces elastin deposition, alveolarization, and the amount of collagen in the fetal lung. There are limited data specifically evaluating lung development antenatally in cases of renal agenesis, but postnatal quantitative analysis has demonstrated a reduction in size of the pulmonary airways and growth within the acinar region, with resulting hypoplastic lungs.MRI images are less affected by oligo- and anhydramnios than ultrasound images. The role of MRI in assessing pulmonary development in urinary tract abnormalities in these cases of oligo- and anhydramnios has been assessed through several studies. One study yielded images from fast gradient-echo sequences and true fast imaging analyzed by an experienced observer for valuating signal intensity of the lungs to diagnose pulmonary hypoplasia. Low signal intensity in the lungs was thus identified in a fetus with Meckel–Gruber syndrome. Overall, MRI was deemed superior in detecting the bilateralism and severity of the renal diseases, and denoted better visualization of the fetal whole body in a single cut compared with ultrasound. Reaching a diagnostic accuracy of 96% for urinary tract anomalies in this study, MRI demonstrated its potential in characterizing the associated extrarenal fetal anomalies, such as pulmonary anomalies, with high accuracy.

### Clinical significance of borderline amniotic fluid index and oligohydramnios in preterm pregnancy [^2afac22b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in women with decreased amniotic fluid index (AFI) between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation, compared with outcomes in those with normal AFI.

Methods

This is a review of singleton pregnancies that received ultrasound examinations at 24–34 weeks from 1997 to 2008. If more than one ultrasound examination was performed, the lowest AFI was used for analysis. An AFI 5 cm or less was considered oligohydramnios, 5–8 cm was considered borderline, and more than 8 cm to 24 cm was considered normal. Women with hydramnios or ruptured membranes at time of ultrasound examination were excluded.

Results

A total of 28,555 pregnancies met inclusion criteria. Ultrasound examination had been performed to estimate gestational age or evaluate fetal growth in 78%. Major malformations were more common in pregnancies with oligohydramnios and borderline AFI than in those with normal fluid-25%, 10%, and 2%, respectively, P < .001. Among nonanomalous fetuses, complications that occurred more often in pregnancies with oligohydramnios and borderline AFI than in those with normal fluid included preterm birth (62%, 37%, 8%), either indicated (20%, 13%, 2%) or resulting from spontaneous preterm labor (42%, 24%, 6%); cesarean delivery for nonreassuring fetal status (9%, 9%, 4%), and birth weight below the third percentile (37%, 21%, 4%), all P < .001.

Conclusion

Pregnancies with decreased AFI between 24 and 34 weeks, including borderline AFI as well as oligohydramnios, were significantly more likely to be associated with major fetal malformations, and in the absence of malformations, to be complicated by fetal growth restriction and preterm birth.

### Indicated vs universal third-trimester ultrasound examination in low-risk pregnancies: a pre-post-intervention study [^f418c90b]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In low-risk pregnancies, a third-trimester ultrasound examination is indicated if fundal height measurement and gestational age discrepancy are observed. Despite potential improvement in the detection of ultrasound abnormality, prior trials to date on universal third-trimester ultrasound examination in low-risk pregnancies, compared with indicated ultrasound examination, have not demonstrated improvement in neonatal or maternal adverse outcomes.

Objective

The primary objective was to determine if universal third-trimester ultrasound examination in low-risk pregnancies could attenuate composite neonatal adverse outcomes. The secondary objectives were to compare changes in composite maternal adverse outcomes and detection of abnormalities of fetal growth (fetal growth restriction or large for gestational age) or amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios).

Study Design

Our pre-post intervention study at 9 locations included low-risk pregnancies, those without indication for ultrasound examination in the third trimester. Compared with indicated ultrasound in the preimplementation period, in the postimplementation period, all patients were scheduled for ultrasound examination at 36.0–37.6 weeks. In both periods, clinicians intervened on the basis of abnormalities identified. Composite neonatal adverse outcomes included any of: Apgar score ≤ 5 at 5 minutes, cord pH < 7.00, birth trauma (bone fracture or brachial plexus palsy), intubation for > 24 hours, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, seizure, sepsis (bacteremia proven with blood culture), meconium aspiration syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage grade III or IV, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotizing enterocolitis, stillbirth after 36 weeks, or neonatal death within 28 days of birth. Composite maternal adverse outcomes included any of the following: chorioamnionitis, wound infection, estimated blood loss > 1000 mL, blood transfusion, deep venous thrombus or pulmonary embolism, admission to intensive care unit, or death. Using Bayesian statistics, we calculated a sample size of 600 individuals in each arm to detect > 75% probability of any reduction in primary outcome (80% power; 50% hypothesized risk reduction).

Results

During the preintervention phase, 747 individuals were identified during the initial ultrasound examination, and among them, 568 (76.0%) met the inclusion criteria at 36.0–37.6 weeks; during the postintervention period, the corresponding numbers were 770 and 661 (85.8%). The rate of identified abnormalities of fetal growth or amniotic fluid increased from between the pre-post intervention period (7.1% vs 22.2%; P < .0001; number needed to diagnose, 7; 95% confidence interval, 5–9). The primary outcome occurred in 15 of 568 (2.6%) individuals in the preintervention and 12 of 661 (1.8%) in the postintervention group (83% probability of risk reduction; posterior relative risk, 0.69 [95% credible interval, 0.34–1.42]). The composite maternal adverse outcomes occurred in 8.6% in the preintervention and 6.5% in the postintervention group (90% probability of risk; posterior relative risk, 0.74 [95% credible interval, 0.49–1.15]). The number needed to treat to reduce composite neonatal adverse outcomes was 121 (95% confidence interval, 40–200). In addition, the number to reduce composite maternal adverse outcomes was 46 (95% confidence interval, 19–74), whereas the number to prevent cesarean delivery was 18 (95% confidence interval, 9–31).

Conclusion

Among low-risk pregnancies, compared with routine care with indicated ultrasound examination, implementation of a universal third-trimester ultrasound examination at 36.0–37.6 weeks attenuated composite neonatal and maternal adverse outcomes.

### Amniotic fluid index versus single deepest vertical pocket as a screening test for preventing adverse pregnancy outcome [^b7d4cddb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Amniotic fluid volume is an important parameter in the assessment of fetal well-being. Oligohydramnios occurs in many high-risk conditions and is associated with poor perinatal outcomes. Many caregivers practice planned delivery by induction of labor or caesarean section after diagnosis of decreased amniotic fluid volume at term. There is no clear consensus on the best method to assess amniotic fluid adequacy.

Objectives

To compare the use of the amniotic fluid index with the single deepest vertical pocket measurement as a screening tool for decreased amniotic fluid volume in preventing adverse pregnancy outcome.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (January 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2007) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (May 2007). We handsearched the citation lists of relevant publications, review articles, and included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials involving women with a singleton pregnancy, whether at low or high risk, undergoing ultrasound measurement of amniotic fluid volume as part of antepartum assessment of fetal well-being that compared the amniotic fluid index and the single deepest vertical pocket measurement.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors independently assessed eligibility and quality, and extracted the data.

Main Results

Four trials (3125 women) met the inclusion criteria. There is no evidence that one method is superior to the other in the prevention of poor peripartum outcomes, including: admission to a neonatal intensive care unit; an umbilical artery pH of less than 7.1; the presence of meconium; an Apgar score of less than 7 at five minutes; or caesarean delivery. When the amniotic fluid index was used, significantly more cases of oligohydramnios were diagnosed (risk ratio (RR, random) 2.33, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.24), and more women had inductions of labor (RR (fixed) 2.10, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.76) and caesarean delivery for fetal distress (RR (fixed) 1.45, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.97).

Authors' Conclusions

The single deepest vertical pocket measurement in the assessment of amniotic fluid volume during fetal surveillance seems a better choice since the use of the amniotic fluid index increases the rate of diagnosis of oligohydramnios and the rate of induction of labor without improvement in peripartum outcomes. A systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of both methods in detecting decreased amniotic fluid volume is required.

### Routine third-trimester ultrasound in low-risk pregnancies and perinatal death: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^367e929f]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to determine whether routine third-trimester ultrasounds in low-risk pregnancies decrease the rate of perinatal death compared with regular antenatal care with serial fundal height measurements.

Data Sources

This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials to identify relevant studies published from inception to October 2019. The databases used were Ovid, PubMed, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using a combination of key words related to "third trimester ultrasound" and "low-risk".

Study Eligibility Criteria

We included all randomized control trials of singleton, nonanomalous low-risk pregnancies that were randomized to either one or more third-trimester ultrasounds (ultrasound group) or serial fundal height (fundal height group). Exclusion criteria were patients with multiple gestations, maternal medical complications, or fetal abnormalities requiring a third-trimester ultrasound.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

The primary outcome was the rate of perinatal death. The secondary outcomes were rates of fetal growth restriction, suspected large for gestational age, polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios, fetal anomalies, antenatal interventions, stillbirth, neonatal death, cesarean delivery, induction of labor, and other neonatal outcomes. This meta-analysis was performed with the use of the random effects model of DerSimonian and Laird to produce relative risk or mean difference with a corresponding 95% confidence interval.

Results

A total of 7 randomized control trials with 23,643 participants (12,343 in the ultrasound group vs 11,300 in the fundal height group) were included. The total rate of perinatal death was similar among the groups (41 of 11,322 [0.4%] vs 34 of 10,285 [0.3%]; relative risk, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.68–1.89). The rate of fetal growth restriction was higher in the ultrasound group (763 of 10,388 [7%] vs 337 of 9021 [4%]; relative risk, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.86–2.39) and the rate of suspected large for gestational age (1060 of 3513 [30%] vs 375 of 3558 [11%]; relative risk, 2.84; 95% confidence interval, 2.6–3.2). Polyhydramnios was also significantly higher in the ultrasound group than the fundal height group (18 of 323 [6%] vs 4 of 322 [1%] relative risk, 3.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.4–11). The rates of the remainder of the secondary outcomes were similar among the groups.

Conclusion

Routine third-trimester ultrasounds do not decrease the rate of perinatal death compared with serial fundal height in low-risk pregnancies. Ideally, an adequately powered trial is warranted to determine whether perinatal mortality in the fundal height group can be reduced by one-third with third-trimester ultrasound.

### Polyhydramnios among women in a cluster-randomized trial of ultrasound during prenatal care within five low and low-middle income countries: a secondary analysis of the first look study [^3216d10c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Polyhydramnios, or an excessive accumulation of amniotic fluid, affects less than 2% of pregnancies in high-income countries. Polyhydramnios can be associated with adverse outcomes such as perinatal mortality, prematurity, shoulder dystocia, and respiratory distress syndrome, and is therefore an important health concern. Polyhydramnios can result from maternal conditions such as poorly controlled diabetes, infections and medication exposure. Fetal conditions that affect the fetus's ability to swallow or obstructive gastrointestinal pathologies can also result in polyhydramnios.

In many low and low-middle income countries (LMICs), the incidence of polyhydramnios is unknown. The use of ultrasound during prenatal care is limited in many LMICs due to the high cost of purchasing and maintaining ultrasound equipment, and lack of trained providers to perform and interpret these studies. As a result, certain pregnancy-related conditions that are usually detected by ultrasound go undiagnosed, including polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios and fetal growth abnormalities. These conditions can lead to adverse perinatal events, and therefore should be recognized in order to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. Maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with polyhydramnios may be worse in LMICs due to limitations in emergent obstetric care and intensive care for infants born prematurely. Understanding the epidemiology of polyhydramnios in LMICs might lead to strategies for reducing perinatal and peripartum morbidity and mortality.

Pregnant women in LMICs may have different underlying risk factors for polyhydramnios when compared to women in high-income countries. Women in LMICs have different nutritional status, infection exposures, prevalence of diabetes and incidence of fetal anomalies than women in high-income countries. These differences in exposure might alter the prevalence of polyhydramnios in these regions. These maternal characteristics might also contribute to worse perinatal outcomes.

In this paper, we report the incidence of polyhydramnios among women in five LMICs. We also report maternal characteristics associated with polyhydramnios and the pregnancy and neonatal outcomes among those affected.

### Should we offer prenatal testing for 17q12 microdeletion syndrome to all cases with prenatally diagnosed echogenic kidneys? Prenatal findings in two families with 17q12 microdeletion syndrome and review of the literature [^b287b915]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study is to report the prenatal ultrasound scan findings in four fetuses from two families postnatally diagnosed with 17q12 microdeletion syndrome on microarray CGH and review the literature.

Methods

We report two families presenting with prenatally detected hyperechogenic kidneys. In family 1, the mother had three pregnancies complicated by anhydramnios with bilateral hyperechogenic kidneys, hyperechogenic enlarged cystic kidneys, and bilateral hyperechogenic kidneys with polyhydramnios respectively. In family 2, prenatal ultrasound scans detected hyperechogenic kidneys. A pubmed search for all reported cases of 17q12 deletion between 2005 and 2015 was performed. All publications were reviewed, and findings summarised.

Results

Fourteen publications were deemed suitable for literature review; there was a diagnosis of 17q12 deletion with documented prenatal findings in 25 cases. Prenatal renal anomalies were reported in 88% of these cases. Anomalies were documented from 15weeks, and most common presentation was hyperechogenic, muticystic, or enlarged kidneys. Both oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios were seen. Postnatal renal ultrasound scan findings were of muticystic or multicystic dysplastic kidney. There did not appear to be correlation of prenatal presentation and severity of renal disease.

Conclusion

Prenatal testing should be offered to all cases of hyperechogenic kidneys, with unknown cause.

### Effects of maternal isolated oligohydramnios on blood metabolic profile in term neonates: a retrospective observational study [^47f97aaa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Amniotic fluid volume is an important indicator of fetal health, and its assessment is required during every ultrasound examination in the middle and third trimesters of pregnancy. The most commonly used techniques are the maximum vertical pocket (MVP) and amniotic fluid index (AFI) measurements. The MVP, also known as deepest vertical pocket (DVP) or single deepest vertical pocket (SDVP), is the maximal vertical pocket depth, which should not contain fetal limbs or umbilical cord, while the AFI is the summation of the vertical diameter of the largest pocket in each of the four quadrants, using the maternal umbilicus as a central reference point. The definition of oligohydramnios has been controversial for decades, including MVP < 2 cm, AFI < 5 cm, AFI < 8 cm, and or AFI < 5th percentile. In general, MVP < 2 cm or an AFI < 5 cm have been widely recognized, among which MVP is better than AFI in identifying oligohydramnios. The prevalence of oligohydramnios is 0.5–5%. However, less than half of the cases with oligohydramnios have no pathological factors and are called isolated oligohydramnios (IO). Currently, the cause of IO remains unclear. Changes in aquaporin expression may be among the pathophysiological mechanisms, and reduced placental perfusion and chronic hypoxia have been implicated.

IO is associated with increased labor induction and cesarean section rates. A meta-analysis identified increased risks of adverse outcomes at birth in low-risk pregnancies with IO, including meconium aspiration syndrome, cesarean section due to abnormal fetal heart rate, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. However, some studies have shown that IO has similar neonatal outcomes to those of normal amniotic fluid pregnancies. Therefore, the gestational management of full-term IO remains controversial. Notably, a retrospective cohort study on the long-term outcomes of children born with IO found a significant association between IO and long-term neurological disorders in the offspring, with common diseases such as movement disorders, pervasive developmental disorders and IO is an independent risk factor for long-term gastrointestinal morbidity in offspring, including gastroduodenal diseases and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The suspected increased risk of long-term neurodevelopmental abnormalities and gastrointestinal disease in these IO offspring suggests that there may be minor abnormalities during pregnancy that may not be detected by routine examination but potentially affect fetal health in the short or long term.

Antenatal UTD risk stratification and management — Thresholds are based on gestational age (< or > 28 weeks gestation); fetuses are classified as low-risk UTD A1 or increased risk UTD A2-3, with antenatal assessment also considering presence or absence of unexplained oligohydramnios and combining intermediate and high-risk groups. The most concerning abnormal finding determines risk; for example, if there is ureteral dilation but the APD is less than 10 mm at greater than 28 weeks gestation, the fetus is still considered UTD A2-3. Imaging follow-up is specified: if UTD is low-risk prior to 28 weeks, only one US is recommended after 32 weeks' gestation; if intermediate/high-risk, serial US every 4 weeks is recommended, and specialty consultation timing varies by severity.

### Isolated oligohydramnios in previous pregnancy is a risk factor for a placental related disorder in subsequent delivery [^162fecd6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This was a historic cohort at a single university-affiliated center – the Edith Wolfson Medical Center between November 2008 and December 2019. The center serves a population of half a million citizens from the area, and, in similar to alternative center in the area, offers a maternal fetal division and neonatal intensive care if needed. Women with a first and second livebirth singleton delivery at our center during these years were included in the cohort. All singleton pregnancies with a diagnosis of isolated oligohydramnios were identified from electronic medical records and cases reviewed to exclude any secondary causes for oligohydramnios, including premature rupture of membranes, intrauterine fetal growth retardation (FGR), maternal chronic illness, fetal malformations and chromosomal anomalies. We excluded women with any delivery complicated by fetal chromosomal or genetic abnormalities, by birth before 24 weeks, women with lack of prenatal care and cases of current or past intrauterine fetal death. We also excluded women whose first delivery was complicated by small for gestational age, preeclampsia, preterm birth or placental abruption, all placental related complications that are known to recure in subsequent pregnancies.

We compared pregnancy and neonatal outcomes of two groups – second deliveries of women with isolated oligohydramnios in their first delivery (previous oligohydramnios group), and second deliveries of women without isolated oligohydramnios in their first delivery (control group).

As per institutional protocol, all women admitted to our obstetric emergency room and delivery ward underwent assessment of amniotic fluid amount by ultrasound as an integral part of obstetric evaluation. Amniotic fluid was assessed by obstetricians, with the use of abdominal probes (Voluson E8, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). Oligohydramnios was determined in the presence of a DVP of less than two centimeters or an AFI of less than 5 cm, and coding was entered to the computerized system as per the ICD9 (code 658.03).

### Isolated oligohydramnios in previous pregnancy is a risk factor for a placental related disorder in subsequent delivery [^de8a4b66]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Amniotic fluid amount is an important parameter for the evaluation of fetal well-being. There is no consensus regarding the best method to estimate the amount of amniotic fluid, and the definition of oligohydramnios. Some define oligohydramnios by a deepest vertical pocket (DVP) of less than 2 cm, while others prefer calculating a four-quadrant amniotic fluid index (AFI) and define oligohydramnios as a value of 5 cm or less.

Amniotic fluid volume is dynamic. Its production increases gradually until 32 weeks of pregnancy and remains stable until term. The main sources of amniotic fluid are fetal urination and lung secretions. Oligohydramnios most commonly occurs secondary to premature rupture of membranes. Yet, it has also been related to post-term pregnancies, intrauterine fetal growth retardation (FGR), maternal chronic illness, fetal malformations and chromosomal anomalies. Finally, oligohydramnios may be isolated. Overall incidence of isolated oligohydramnios is between 0.5 and 5%, and depends on local definitions and target population. Isolated oligohydramnios is a diagnosis of exclusion, after comprehensive assessment of the fetus to exclude malformations, genetic anomalies and FGR. Moreover, a detailed and thorough maternal examination is necessary to rule out premature rupture of membranes, intrauterine infection or chronic maternal illness. Often oligohydramnios itself serves as an indication for induction of labor and entails an increased risk of operative delivery and cesarean section for fetal distress. Other studies have not demonstrated an increased risk of obstetric interventions or immediate neonatal outcome impairment.

The pathogenesis of isolated oligohydramnios is unclear, yet it has been viewed by some as an expression of placental insufficiency, and as such is regarded as an additional placental related obstetrical syndrome, in similar to FGR and preeclampsia. Others view this condition as a benign finding, necessitating intervention only in the presence of additional findings. It is well established that placental syndromes such FGR and preeclampsia tend to recur and increase the overall risk of placental complications in subsequent pregnancy. We therefore set to examine if isolated oligohydramnios displays similar recurrence risks as other placental mediated complications and may be regarded as risk factor for subsequent pregnancies. Our objectives were to evaluate the correlation between isolated oligohydramnios in previous pregnancy and its recurrence in subsequent pregnancy, and the incidence of placental-related complications in subsequent pregnancy.

### Assessment of amniotic fluid volume in pregnancy [^518f3334]. Radiographics (2023). Medium credibility.

Amniotic fluid (AF) is an integral part of the fetal environment and is essential for fetal growth and development. Pathways of AF recirculation include the fetal lungs, swallowing, absorption through the fetal gastrointestinal tract, excretion through fetal urine production, and movement. In addition to being a marker for fetal health, adequate AF is necessary for fetal lung development, growth, and movement. The role of diagnostic imaging is to provide a detailed fetal survey, placental evaluation, and clinical correlation with maternal conditions to help identify causes of AF abnormalities and thereby enable specific therapy. Oligohydramnios prompts evaluation for fetal growth restriction as well as genitourinary issues, including renal agenesis, multicystic dysplastic kidneys, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, and bladder outlet obstruction. Premature preterm rupture of membranes should also be clinically excluded as a cause of oligohydramnios. Clinical trials evaluating amnioinfusion are underway as a potential intervention for renal causes of oligohydramnios. Most cases of polyhydramnios are idiopathic, with maternal diabetes being a common cause. Polyhydramnios prompts evaluation for fetal gastrointestinal obstruction and oropharyngeal or thoracic masses, as well as neurologic or musculoskeletal anomalies. Amnioreduction is performed only for maternal indications such as symptomatic polyhydramnios causing maternal respiratory distress. Polyhydramnios with fetal growth restriction is paradoxical and can occur with maternal diabetes and hypertension. When these maternal conditions are absent, this raises concern for aneuploidy. The authors describe the pathways of AF production and circulation, US and MRI assessment of AF, disease-specific disruption of AF pathways, and an algorithmic approach to AF abnormalities. © RSNA, 2023 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Antenatal ultrasound risk stratification for urinary tract dilation (UTD) — classification and parameters are as follows: Stratification is based upon the most concerning ultrasound finding. Low Risk (A1) includes < 28 weeks APD 4 to < 7 mm or ≥ 28 weeks APD 7 to < 10 mm and/or central calyceal dilation. Increased Risk (A2-3) includes < 28 weeks APD ≥ 7 mm or ≥ 28 weeks APD ≥ 10 mm and/or any abnormal ultrasound parameter of UTD (except central calyceal dilation). Ultrasound parameters cited include large anterior-posterior renal pelvis diameter (APD), central or peripheral calyceal dilation, abnormal parenchymal thickness or appearance, ureteral dilation, abnormal bladder or urethra, and unexplained oligohydramnios.

### A comparison of 3 criteria of oligohydramnios in identifying peripartum complications: a secondary analysis [^21b5631c]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to ascertain the diagnostic accuracy of 3 criteria of oligohydramnios in identifying 4 peripartum complications.

Study Design

The 3 definitions of oligohydramnios were amniotic fluid index (AFI) 5.0 cm or less and AFI < 5% for gestational age (GA) using nomograms by Moore and Cayle or Magann et al. Likelihood ratio (LR) and guidelines by the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group were used in the secondary analysis of previously published reports. AFI obtained during antepartum and intrapartum periods were analyzed separately.

Results

The 95% confidence intervals for the prevalence of oligohydramnios using the 3 criteria are significantly different in the antepartum or intrapartum analysis. The LR was < 6 for ante- and intrapartum AFI to identify cesarean delivery for nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracing, Apgar score 3 or less at 5 minutes, umbilical arterial pH < 7.00, and newborns' weight 5% or less for GA.

Conclusion

The 3 criteria for determining the adequacy of amniotic fluid are not fungible, and they are not useful diagnostic tests for identifying peripartum complications because LR is < 10.

### Perinatal urinary tract dilation: recommendations on pre-/ postnatal imaging, prophylactic antibiotics, and follow-up: clinical Report [^7d4a4f1d]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Technique and limitations of antenatal ultrasonography — Adherence to a standardized technique for antenatal ultrasound (US) is recommended, and the measurement of the anteroposterior renal pelvis diameter (APD) prenatally should be performed with the fetal spine in the 6 o'clock or 12 o'clock position, and position should remain consistent from US to US; specific antenatal values (ie, all 7 UTD parameters) should be communicated to all postnatal providers. In most instances it should be used as a screening modality that sets the stage for in-depth postnatal evaluation, and fetal MRI could be useful in certain cases when US fails (such as anhydramnios or oligohydramnios), although there is not sufficient evidence to support wide adoption.

Modified biophysical profile (BPP) criteria — The modified BPP combines the nonstress test (NST) with amniotic fluid assessment; results are considered normal if the NST is reactive and the deepest vertical pocket is greater than 2 cm, and abnormal if the NST is nonreactive or the deepest vertical pocket is 2 cm or less. Oligohydramnios is commonly defined as a single deepest vertical pocket of 2 cm or less and an amniotic fluid index of 5 cm or less, and randomized trials support using a deepest vertical pocket of 2 cm or less to diagnose oligohydramnios.

### Effects of maternal isolated oligohydramnios on blood metabolic profile in term neonates: a retrospective observational study [^dff4b940]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Design and setting

This study adopted a retrospective observational design. Participants were recruited from two medical centers between January 2017 and December 2023. The discovery cohort comprised 60 neonates with IO and 60 healthy controls (HC) from The Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, while the validation included 50 IO and 60 HC from The Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital of Huadu.

Participants

Inclusion criteria: (1) Ultrasound-based assessment of amniotic fluid volume was performed before the delivery and between 37 + 0 ~41 + 6 gestation weeks, and IO was diagnosed; (2) neonates with no congenital anomalies or inherited metabolic disorders confirmed by prenatal ultrasound and postnatal screening; (3) Parental absence of metabolic disease or substance abuse history (tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs).

Exclusion criteria: (1) Preterm (< 37 weeks) or post-term (≥ 42 weeks) delivery. (2) Neonatal critical conditions (e.g. respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis). (3) Maternal comorbidities during pregnancy (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, thyroid dysfunction, infectious diseases). (4) Parental refusal to participate.

Diagnostic parameters

Ultrasound-based assessment of amniotic fluid volume was performed according to standardized protocols: The MVP is defined as the maximal vertical pocket depth, which should not contain fetal limbs or umbilical cord. AFI is the summation of the vertical diameter of the largest pocket in each of the four quadrants, which was divided by the umbilical horizontal line and abdominal white lines, using the maternal umbilicus as a central reference point. IO is diagnosed as MVP < 2 cm or an AFI < 5 cm, validated by two independent sonographers.

### Study details | NCT03935607 | The added contribution of… [^6cd4e1a1]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

The Added Contribution of Transvaginal Sonographic Evaluation of Amniotic Fluid IndexClinicalTrials. gov ID. The MVP measurement may be preferred over the AFI method. A 2008 systematic review of randomized trials found that use of the AFI increased the rate of diagnosis of oligohydramnios, induction of labor, and cesarean delivery for fetal distress. Rationale and Hypothesis of the Study Recently, our group observed that when transvaginal ultrasound is being performed to non-laboring pregnant women at term for other obstetrical indications, there is a large amniotic fluid pocket above the internal cervical os and below the fetal presenting part. Due to the unique location of this pocket, we hypothesized that transvaginal ultrasound may provide better information than transabdominal ultrasound on amniotic fluid volume, particularly in cases when suspecting abnormal low amniotic fluid volume.

Data Collection
- Maternal and fetal characteristics Data related to the fetomaternal antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum course will be recorded prospectively.
- Ultrasound assessment Each eligible woman in the study population group will be asked to undergo prenatal ultrasound examination twice. The first ultrasound examination is a routine transabdominal ultrasound examination that is carried out to assess fetal growth and well-being. This is to be continued with a second transvaginal ultrasound, with a specific focus on the amniotic fluid pocket, that is; the distance in centimetres between the fetal presenting part and the internal cervical os. The second transvaginal ultrasound will be performed for the purpose of the study only, and by one other research team member that is blinded to the first routine transabdominal ultrasound. The entire length of the study, combining the transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasounds, is expected to take on the average around 15 min.

Public Health Interest Identifying new ultrasound variables that can assist in quantifying amniotic fluid volume, as the one suggested in the current study, is of great importance and may provide invaluable information into the overall future care and decision-making around the time of delivery, especially whether or not to induce labor in women with suspected oligohydramnios. Thus, it may assist in creating future recommendations for pregnant women and improved healthcare standards during the delivery process. Diagnostic Test: Transvaginal sonography

### The utility of ultrasound surveillance of fluid and growth in obese women [^eefe92e2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of ultrasound surveillance in obese women.

Study Design

This is a retrospective cohort of all obese women who underwent sonography at a single center from 2005–2013. Inclusion criteria were body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m(2), singleton, ≥ 1 ultrasound scan performed at < 20 weeks of gestation, and ≥ 1 ultrasound scan performed at ≥ 24 weeks of gestation. Pregnancies with medical complications, fetal anomalies, or preterm premature rupture of membranes were excluded. Outcomes that were considered were small for gestational age, large for gestational age (LGA), macrosomia, oligohydramnios, and polyhydramnios. We calculated the number needed to screen (NNS) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for scans that were performed during 3 gestational age ranges (24–31 weeks 6 days, 32–35 weeks 6 days, and ≥ 36 weeks).

Results

Two thousand two sonograms were performed in 1164 obese women at ≥ 24 weeks of gestation. Small for gestational age was diagnosed in 59 pregnancies (5.1%); 7 pregnancies (0.6%) were diagnosed at < 32 weeks of gestation (NNS, 159; 95% CI, 69–490). LGA was diagnosed in 38 cases (3.3%); only 1 case was identified at < 32 weeks of gestation and was not LGA at birth. For every 29 (95% CI, 19–46) scans performed at > 36 weeks of gestation, 1 case of macrosomia was identified. Amniotic fluid abnormalities were diagnosed in 44 pregnancies (3.8%; oligohydramnios, 19; polyhydramnios, 25); 34.1% abnormalities were diagnosed at < 32 weeks of gestation (NNS: oligohydramnios, 113; 95% CI, 55–282 for oligohydramnios; polyhydramnios, 100; 95% CI, 50–230). At ≥ 36 weeks of gestation, 7 (95% CI, 6–8) scans were needed to diagnose any fluid or growth abnormality.

Conclusion

In obese women without comorbidities, few sonographic diagnoses of amniotic fluid or fetal growth abnormalities are made at < 32 weeks of gestation. Therefore, if a policy of serial sonographic surveillance is used, we suggest ultrasound scans for fluid and growth in obese women to begin at ≥ 32 weeks of gestation.

### Trial of labor following cesarean among patients with oligohydramnios at term: a multicenter retrospective study [^6e992c59]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

4.5 Strengths and limitations

The main strength of our study was the large cohort from two obstetrical centers with high annual delivery volumes, in a developed country with advanced medical services and relatively high rates of TOLAC attempts. This enabled us to evaluate this specific subgroup of patients with oligohydramnios. The uniformity in inclusion criteria, reflected by the strict definition of oligohydramnios only according to one method (MVP) and the timing of diagnosis by qualified ultrasound units within the hospital, along with consistent TOLAC management protocols in our centers, reduces the likelihood of confounders and increases the reliability and generalizability of our findings. The use of computerized medical records updated in real‐time provided comprehensive data and minimized bias.

Our study specifically assessed success rates and complications of TOLAC in the presence of oligohydramnios. Additionally, the diagnosis of oligohydramnios in our study was close to delivery, whereas, in the previous studies discussed above, the timing of diagnosis was not specified and relied on medical record ICD codes.

The main limitation of our study was its retrospective design, which carries inherent limitations. For instance, we did not have sufficient data to stratify according to the causes of oligohydramnios or the indications for the previous CD, which could be important factors in successful TOLAC. Additionally, the unique population in our centers, characterized by patients who tend toward large families and prefer vaginal delivery over CD, may influence both the physicians' and patients' preferences regarding the mode of delivery. Despite these limitations, we addressed this through the inclusion of a large sample size and comparison of our results with other studies conducted in different populations that showed similar success rates. The rates of maternal and neonatal complications were similar to those reported in previous worldwide publications, including uterine rupture, PPH, puerperal fever, maternal ICU admissions, and maternal respiratory complications. This similarity suggests that our study's conclusions may be generalizable to other populations.

### Prevalence and associated factors of oligohydramnios in pregnancies beyond 36 weeks of gestation at a tertiary hospital in southwestern Uganda [^dfe8509a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the poor perinatal outcomes attributable to oligohydramnios, there are few data on prevalence and factors associated with oligohydramnios in the East African Region, and Uganda in particular. Establishing the prevalence of oligohydramnios and associated factors in the third trimester is crucial to inform the index of suspicion among healthcare workers during antenatal care so as to plan appropriate interventions, including mode and timing of deliveries. In Uganda, many missed opportunities for prompt detection of oligohydramnios exist; only 30% of pregnant women requiring ultrasonography services access them. When oligohydramnios is missed and patients do not receive appropriate and timely treatment, outcomes are often poor.

Prior to conducting this study, data from review of medical records for a six-month period (April–September 2018) in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) revealed that 45 mothers had oligohydramnios-related complications. All the 45 mothers had cesarean sections, 6% had fresh stillbirths, and 17% had babies with birth asphyxia (APGAR scores of < 7 at 5 min). Furthermore, oligohydramnios may be contributing to the high rates of cesarean section deliveries; fetal distress caused by oligohydramnios has been identified as one of the leading indications for cesarean section deliveries in Uganda. MRRH, in particular, has been found to have high cesarean section delivery rates of more than 25%. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of oligohydramnios among women attending antenatal care at > 36 weeks of gestation at MRRH in Southwestern Uganda.

### Ketoprofen [^40a0efc6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal

impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment,

although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID

initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation.

Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and

delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function,

invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required.

If NSAID treatment is necessary between about 20 weeks and 30 weeks gestation, limit

ketoprofen capsules use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider

ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if ketoprofen capsules treatment extends beyond 48

hours. Discontinue ketoprofen capsules if oligohydramnios occurs and follow up according to

clinical practice [see PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy].

### Telmisartan and amlodipine [^1bcc40de]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk:

Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.

Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions:

Use of drugs that act on the RAS in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: oligohydramnios, reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure, fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension, and death. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus.

In patients taking telmisartan and amlodipine tablets during pregnancy, perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of gestation. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue telmisartan and amlodipine tablets, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury.

### Amniotic fluid index versus single deepest vertical pocket: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^30fda341]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the use of the amniotic fluid index with the single deepest vertical pocket measurement, during antepartum fetal surveillance, in preventing adverse pregnancy outcome.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (January 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2008), and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (May 2008). We handsearched the citation lists of relevant publications, review articles, and included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials involving women with a singleton pregnancy, whether at low or high risk, undergoing ultrasound measurement of amniotic fluid volume as part of antepartum assessment of fetal well-being that compared the amniotic fluid index and the single deepest vertical pocket measurement.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors independently assessed eligibility and quality, and extracted the data.

Results

Four trials (3125 women) met the inclusion criteria. When the amniotic fluid index was used, significantly more cases of oligohydramnios were diagnosed (risk ratio (RR) 2.33, 95% CI 1.67–3.24), and more women had inductions of labor (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.60–2.76) and cesarean delivery for fetal distress (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.07–1.97). There is no evidence that one method is superior to the other in the prevention of poor peripartum outcomes, including: admission to a neonatal intensive care unit; an umbilical artery pH of less than 7.1; the presence of meconium; an Apgar score of less than 7 at 5 minutes; or cesarean delivery.

Conclusion

Single deepest vertical pocket measurement is the method of choice for the assessment of amniotic fluid volume.

### Fetal growth restriction: ACOG practice bulletin, number 227 [^8045d461]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Fetal growth restriction — delivery timing by risk factors, percentile, and Doppler — is outlined as follows: Delivery at 34 0/7 weeks to 37 6/7 weeks of gestation is noted for cases with additional risk factors for adverse outcome, including oligohydramnios, abnormal Doppler studies, maternal risk factors, or comorbidities; the 2020 Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) categorizes isolated fetal growth restriction by estimated fetal weight, with delivery suggested at 38 0/7 and 39 0/7 weeks of gestation when the estimated fetal weight is between the 3rd and 10th percentile with normal umbilical artery Doppler, and delivery recommended at 37 0/7 weeks of gestation or at diagnosis if earlier when the estimated fetal weight is less than the third percentile; earlier delivery is indicated in cases of absent or reverse umbilical artery flow.

### Fetal MRI of the urinary system [^0248b774]. European Journal of Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

The assessment of the urinary system is typically performed by ultrasound. Nevertheless, an ultrasound may be inconclusive in fetuses with renal diseases that result in anhydramnios or oligohydramnios. In such cases, and in other cases in which ultrasound is limited, further investigation with MR should be considered. In the following article, we will provide an overview of the most commonly encountered disorders of the urinary system and their appearance on fetal MR imaging. Fetal MR imaging can accurately diagnose a wide variety of urinary tract disorders and must be seen as a valuable complementary tool to ultrasound in the assessment of the urinary system, particularly in cases of inconclusive ultrasound findings.

### The diagnostic utility of growth ultrasound for the indication of maternal overweight or obesity [^7480124f]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of serial growth ultrasounds for the indication of maternal overweight or obesity.

Study Design

This is a retrospective cohort study of all women with a body mass index ≥ 25kg/m 2 who underwent at least one growth ultrasound at ≥ 24 weeks gestation and delivered at a single tertiary care institution between January 2010 and December 2013. Women were excluded if they had other medical indications for growth ultrasounds. Ultrasounds were divided into three gestational age epochs: 24 to 31 6/7 weeks, 32 to 35 6/7 weeks, and ≥ 36 weeks. Outcomes examined included the accuracy of sonographic detection of fetal growth restriction (FGR) and fetal overgrowth compared with diagnoses of small for gestational age (SGA) and large for gestational age (LGA) based on the birth weight. The test characteristics of ultrasound and the number needed to screen (NNS) to detect growth abnormalities at the time of birth were estimated for each condition and gestational age epoch. The NNS for the detection of fluid abnormalities was also assessed.

Results

During the study period, 3,945 eligible sonograms were performed in 2,928 women. FGR was identified on ultrasound in 42 (1.4%) women, fetal overgrowth in 94 (3.2%) women, oligohydramnios in 35 (1.2%) women, and hydramnios in 41 (1.4%) women. The NNS for the diagnoses of SGA, LGA, oligohydramnios, and hydramnios at delivery was at least 137 prior to 32 weeks of gestation and decreased (i.e., at least 45 and 16, for 32 to 35 6/7 weeks and ≥ 36 weeks, respectively) with advancing gestational age epochs.

Conclusion

If growth ultrasounds are to be performed for the sole indication of maternal overweight or obesity, consideration should be given to delaying initiation until at least 32 weeks of gestation given the infrequency of growth and fluid abnormalities identified earlier.

Key Points

· There are limited data to support serial growth ultrasounds in overweight and obese women. · The sensitivity of ultrasound for growth abnormalities at < 32 weeks is low in women with BMI ≥ 25. · Consideration should be given to delaying initiation of growth ultrasounds until at least 32 weeks.

### Association of amniotic fluid volume and fetal cardiac and cerebrovascular parameters in fetal growth restriction [^f6394bcb]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the prevalence of oligohydramnios, brain sparing, and cardiac dysfunction among a cohort of fetal growth restriction (FGR).

Methods

To assess the prevalence of oligohydramnios amongst a large sample of FGR fetuses, we screened a database of ultrasounds of FGR pregnancies from our maternal-fetal medicine clinics (clinical cohort) for diminished amniotic fluid volume. Using a threshold of a maximum vertical pocket (MVP) of < 2cm for "oligohydramnios", and 2 to 3cm as a "reduced fluid" group, trends of Doppler values and cardiac parameters were assessed from pregnancies in an ongoing research study (comprehensive cohort).

Results

In the clinical cohort, oligohydramnios was identified in only 2/229 (0.8%) and reduced fluid in 19/229 (8%). In the comprehensive cohort, oligohydramnios was seen in 3/126 (2.3%) and reduced fluid in 14/126 (11.1%). A high rate of cardiac and Doppler abnormalities were observed in the oligohydramnios group of the comprehensive cohort. The patients with oligohydramnios had a distinctly different cardiac phenotype with small (2/3 with cardiac area < 5th%) (P = 0.01) and round (3/3 with global sphericity index < 5th%) (P = 0.02) hearts.

Conclusion

Oligohydramnios, when present with FGR, is accompanied by high rates of cerebral and cardiovascular abnormalities.

### Indications for outpatient antenatal fetal surveillance: ACOG committee opinion, number 828 [^821e4410]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Antenatal fetal surveillance — placental and cord abnormalities: For chronic placental abruption, begin At diagnosis with Once or twice weekly surveillance; for vasa previa, timing and frequency are Individualized. For velamentous cord insertion and single umbilical artery, begin at 36 0/7 weeks with Weekly surveillance. For isolated oligohydramnios (single deepest vertical pocket less than 2 cm), begin At diagnosis with Once or twice weekly surveillance. For polyhydramnios, moderate to severe (deepest vertical pocket equal to or greater than 12 cm or AFI equal to or greater than 30 cm), begin at 32 0/7–34 0/7 weeks with Once or twice weekly surveillance, with footnote guidance Or at diagnosis if diagnosed after 32 0/7–34 0/7 weeks. The guidance offered in this table should be construed only as suggestions, not mandates, and individualization about if and when to offer antenatal fetal surveillance is advised.

### Amniotic fluid disorders and the effects on prenatal outcome: a retrospective cohort study [^1ee646ee]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Amniotic Fluid Volume (AFV) reflects the state of pregnancy and possible adverse complications and outcome, due to which assessment of AFV has been part of every second and third trimester ultrasound examination. There are three standard methods for AFV assessment, first includes qualitative and other two are semiquantitative. Qualitative assessment is the first step in which the ultrasonographer subjectively report if the pregnancy is normal, oligo or polyhydramnios. With experienced examiners, the quality of the test can be equal to the semiquantitative tests [single deepest pocket (SDP), amniotic fluid index (AFI)] which are performed when there is an abnormality found in the qualitative test, specifically among patients with increased risk of pregnancy complications and patients in third trimester. Both SDP and AFI are good indicators for normal AFV. However, AFI overly diagnose oligohydramnios, and SDP overly diagnose polyhydramnios.

Due to the observed increase in cases of poly and oligohydramnios, this study estimated the effect of amniotic fluid disorders on prenatal outcome and reassess the reasons associated with it in Saudi Arabia. Besides, the relationship between maternal demographics and its effect on amniotic fluid disorders in Saudi Arabia are further observed.

Specific objectives

To identify the maternal risk factors associated with amniotic fluid disorders.
To assess the effect of amniotic fluid disorders on maternal and fetal outcome.
To identify the mode of delivery in pregnancy complicated with amniotic fluid disorders.

### Nontraditional sonographic pearls in estimating gestational age [^e2973a83]. Seminars in Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

Accurate gestational dating is one of the most important assessments obstetrical providers make in pregnancy, given that all of the various management strategies are dependent on knowing where the patient is in gestation. In addition to traditional biometry, ancillary biometric and nonbiometric measurements can help narrow the biologic variability between fetuses. Moreover, one can employ these nontraditional measurements both in late gestation to assist in determining appropriate gestational age and fetal lung maturity, and in other specific clinical situations-such as oligohydramnios, in which compression of the fetal head and abdomen can lead to difficulty in obtaining an accurate biparietal diameter and abdominal circumference. This chapter focuses on nontraditional fetal ultrasound measurements, including the transverse cerebellar diameter, fetal foot length, ratios of biometric and nonbiometric measurements, epiphyseal ossification centers, amniotic fluid volume, placental grading, and other miscellaneous markers in the context of evaluating a fetus with possible intrauterine growth restriction.

### Sporadic larsen syndrome in a preterm female originally diagnosed as positional deformities due to oligohydramnios [^ea876d4d]. American Journal of Perinatology (2006). Low credibility.

Few reports describe incidental prenatal diagnosis of sporadic Larsen syndrome by ultrasound, but none of these discuss coincidental oligohydramnios or an association with fetal growth restriction. A 28-year-old woman had prolonged rupture of membranes causing marked oligohydramnios at 32 weeks gestation in her first pregnancy. Labor was induced by vaginal prostaglandins and oxytocin infusion after dexamethasone administration because of concern about placental abruption. She delivered vaginally a live female infant weighing 1960 g (< 10th percentile) with multiple skeletal malformations and characteristic facies originally suspected as positional. Newborn x-rays, however, established the diagnosis of Larsen syndrome with bilateral dislocations of the hips, knees (genu recurvatum), and ankles (club foot). The neonatal karyotype was 46, XX. Parental examination and family history were unremarkable. The newborn did well with bilateral lower extremities cast. Postnatal diagnosis of Larsen syndrome should be suspected in neonates with multiple skeletal abnormalities following oligohydramnios.

Targeted neonatal echocardiography in NICUs — chronic pulmonary hypertension (PH): Suggestive clinical concerns include routine evaluation in at-risk preterm neonates at 36 wk postmenstrual age with features such as moderate to severe chronic lung disease, small for gestational age, previous history of acute PH, or oligohydramnios, and in preterm neonates with moderate to severe chronic lung disease demonstrating signs of significant pulmonary vascular disease including frequent hypoxemic episodes, unexpected worsening, or lack of expected improvement in respiratory course. Specific goals are to confirm diagnosis and establish severity, evaluate RV size and systolic function, evaluate for presence of left-to-right shunts, and rule out pulmonary vein disease/ stenosis.

### Ultrasound findings in trisomy 22 [^50dbe55f]. American Journal of Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

We sought to identify the characteristic sonographic findings of fetal trisomy 22 by performing a retrospective review of nine cases of fetal trisomy 22. All cases of chromosomal mosaicism were excluded, as were first-trimester losses. Indications for sonography, gestational age, and sonographically detected fetal anomalies were analyzed. The majority of patients were referred for advanced maternal age or abnormal ultrasound findings on screening exam. Oligohydramnios was the most common sonographic finding, present in 55% of affected fetuses. Intrauterine growth restriction and increased nuchal thickness were slightly less frequent.

### Irbesartan (Avapro) [^801fe269]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk Summary

AVAPRO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death [see Clinical Considerations]. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue AVAPRO as soon as possible.

All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes regardless of drug exposure. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo-fetal risk

Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section and postpartum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.

Fetal/neonatal adverse reactions

Oligohydramnios in pregnant women who use drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure, fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension, and death.

In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus.

Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. If oligohydramnios is observed, consider alternative treatment. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to AVAPRO for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia and other symptoms of renal impairment. In neonates with a history of in utero exposure to AVAPRO, if oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusion or dialysis may be required as means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function.

### Caesarean deliveries in China [^a0bc23a3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

The non-indicated caesarean section rate would be even higher if some diagnoses that we included in the "indicated" category such as preeclampsia/eclampsia/HELLP, oligohydramnios, third trimester bleeding (previa/accrete/abruption placenta), multiple gestation, and suspected macrosomia were further analyzed and re-categorized since they are not globally accepted and evidence based indications for caesarean section. In this analysis we were unable, for example, to discern which pregnancies had placenta previa (an accepted caesarean section indication) versus an abruptio placenta without intrauterine foetal death (not a caesarean section indication) or which multiple gestation cases had a non-vertex presenting twin, higher order multiples or non-concordant breech second twins (all accepted caesarean section indications). Thus with rigorous auditing of the "indicated" category of cases, many would be reclassified as "non-indicated", raising the overall non-indicated caesarean section rate.

Isolated oligohydramnios is also not an evidence based indication for caesarean section.

Consistent with previous research in China, our study showed that isolated oligohydramnios was one of the major indications for caesarean section in China, accounting for 3.9% of all caesarean section. A prior study involving 2326 women of rural eastern China showed that, during antenatal care, 46.8% women received at least 3 ultrasound scans and the maximum number reached 11. It showed a statistically significant association between the number of antenatal ultrasound scans and caesarean section rates. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that isolated oligohydramnios in the absence of other maternal or foetal risk factors is not associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Caesarean section for preeclampsia could also be reassigned to non-indicated caesarean section if we were able to analyze the cases with more clinical information.

### Reducing stillbirths: screening and monitoring during pregnancy and labour [^9ecb6e74]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Only one intervention RCT compared AFI to no amniotic fluid assessment. Comparing AFI on admission (intervention) to no AFI (controls), Chauhan et al found that women in the intervention group with a diagnosis of low AFI (measured as ≤ 5 cm or ≤ 5 th percentile) were no more likely to have Caesarean section for fetal distress, neonatal acidosis, or Apgar score < 7 at 5 minutes than untested controls or women with normal AFI results; no perinatal mortality statistics were reported [LOE: 1+].

One intervention strategy to improve perinatal outcomes is to augment amniotic fluid volume in cases of oligohydroamnios. Hofmeyr and Gülmezoglu undertook a systematic review of RCTs (2 trials, N = 78 women) assessing the impact of maternal hydration status (requesting that women drink 2 litres of water prior to a repeat ultrasound) on AFI (Additional file 16). In women with and without oligohydramnios, drinking water was associated with an increase in amniotic volume (WMD for women with oligohydramnios = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.43–2.60; WMD for women with normal AFI = 4.5, 95% CI: 2.92–6.08). Intravenous hypotonic hydration in women with oligohydramnios was associated with an increase in amniotic fluid volume (WMD = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.36–3.24), but isotonic intravenous hydration had no measurable effect.

### Multifetal gestations: twin, triplet, and higher-order multifetal pregnancies: ACOG practice bulletin, number 231 [^fa8b4898]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Monochorionic pregnancy complications and twin–twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) — Monochorionic pregnancies are followed more closely due to higher risk of complications including TTTS; fetal echocardiogram is recommended at 18–22 weeks in monochorionic pregnancies, and TTTS occurs in approximately 10–15% of monochorionic–diamniotic pregnancies; serial ultrasonographic evaluation is recommended approximately every 2 weeks beginning at approximately 16 weeks of gestation to monitor for TTTS; diagnostic criteria on ultrasonography require a monochorionic–diamniotic gestation with oligohydramnios (maximum vertical pocket less than 2 cm) in one sac and polyhydramnios (maximum vertical pocket greater than 8 cm) in the other, and routine umbilical artery Doppler is not supported in the absence of growth or fluid discordance; staging is commonly via the Quintero system, and interventions including laser coagulation, amnioreduction, or selective reduction by radiofrequency ablation may be considered in collaboration with an experienced clinician.

### Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^13eaaa47]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions

Telmisartan

Use of drugs that act on the RAS in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: oligohydramnios, reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure, fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension, and death. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus.

In patients taking telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide during pregnancy, perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of gestation. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury.

Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. If oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and replacing renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### Clinical practice guidelines for the antenatal management of dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies: a systematic review [^414a973d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

One CPG highlighted a 20% growth discordance as a marker to distinguish pregnancies at increased risk of adverse outcome. One CPG defined FGR as ≥ 20% difference in the estimated fetal weight while 2 other CPGs defined growth discordance as the presence of either a > 20% difference in estimated fetal weight or an absolute measurement difference in abdominal circumference. Recommendations differed in the type of surveillance for growth discordance and included increased surveillance, umbilical artery Doppler assessment, and biophysical profile, cardiotocography (CTG), growth monitoring every 14 days, and scans every 1–2 weeks with AFI, UAD and biophysical profile.

Eighteen recommendations across eight CPGs were specific to the DCDA twin management following the identification of sFGR or discordant growth. Two CPGs supported the involvement of a fetal medicine specialist following identification of a first trimester CRL discordance > 10%. Three CPGs supported seeking an underlying cause of the discordance with ISUOG detailing the search should include an anatomy scan, screening for viral infections, and an amniocentesis may be required to exclude chromosomal abnormalities. AWFM agrees with ISUOG but does not detail the method for genetic testing and includes a family history and doppler sonography as part of the investigations.

Five CPGs made recommendations on procedures following identification of discordant growth which varied from referral to tertiary hospitals, to specialist services with adequate facilities, intense ultrasound monitoring without specifying the location, to the same or next day referral to a fetal medicine specialist to advise on and coordinate care. Five CPGs recommend the appropriate calculation for EFW discordance and application of the same method to ascertain this (Supplementary File 3). The SOGC ultrasound in twin pregnancy guideline was the only guideline that provided a recommendation for defining oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios. Three CPGs referred to the appropriateness of fetal echocardiography in DCDA twin pregnancies; no consensus was reached with one CPG stating it should not be offered while two CPGs recommended it could be considered in certain circumstances.

Seven recommendations over six CPGs gave guidance on the use of fetal growth charts. FIGO is the only CPG supporting the use of a twin specific growth chart because 'it may reduce unnecessary medical intervention', while three CPGs supported using singleton growth charts (9,37,40,53). Another CPG supported the use of the singleton growth chart but only until 32–35 weeks gestation. Only one guideline specified the appropriate growth chart in the case of unknown gender (a singleton female growth chart is recommended).

### Effect of a labor triage checklist and ultrasound on obstetric referral at three primary health centers in Eastern Uganda [^5a8fb9df]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Unlike checklist plus ultrasound, however, the Phase 2 checklist increased sensitivity without changing PPV or specificity, suggesting increased correct identification (i.e. more true positives without more false positives). Standardized checklists and locally tailored guidelines have demonstrated improved outcomes and uptake of evidence‐based practices, such as a recent labor management intervention in Tanzania 18 and the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist, 10 respectively. Hence, checklists may be useful cognitive aids to standardize triage practices. 19

Although our findings suggest that focused, midwife‐performed ultrasound at PHC triage can increase appropriate inter‐facility referral for complicated cases, several limitations exist. First, follow up among those referred varied across phases, reducing complete assessment of the primary outcome, appropriate referral for correctly identified conditions. As the number of referrals with known outcomes was smaller in Phase 1 than subsequent phases, the baseline rate could have been higher. Moreover, for Phases 2 and 3, if condition‐related referrals with missed outcome had the condition confirmed (true positive), the effect would be larger; conversely, incorrect diagnosis at outcome (false positive) would have decreased the effect. We attempted to link referrals from the PHCs to the DH and identify final diagnoses from maternity registers, but the data were not collected in the registers in a standardized manner. Additionally, many referred women self‐reported going to private facilities or traditional birth attendants, which hindered follow up and acquisition of provider‐confirmed delivery data. Improved capacity for follow up within the health system is needed to better understand maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity data, and opportunities for intervention.

Other study limitations include potential suspicion bias, given that the midwives identified both intake and outcome diagnoses, and inaccuracy of the outcome diagnoses used to determine sensitivity and PPV. Under‐reporting of the conditions at outcome, whether due to misdiagnosis or data quality, could have compromised the study results. To this end, we conducted post‐hoc analyses excluding oligohydramnios from the primary and secondary outcomes, given the subjective nature of oligohydramnios assessment post‐delivery without the use of ultrasound, 20, 21 as well as the inconsistent assessment or documentation of premature rupture of membranes. Trends in referral remained the same upon exclusion of oligohydramnios (Table S5A), but Phase 3 PPV was no longer significantly lower for any maternal or fetal condition compared to Phase 1 when oligohydramnios was excluded (Table S5B). The latter finding suggests that false‐positive diagnosis of oligohydramnios contributed to the initial results of decreased PPV for the composite variable.

### Assessing the optimal definition of oligohydramnios associated with adverse neonatal outcomes [^13654858]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to compare the use of an amniotic fluid index (AFI) less than 5 cm to the use of an AFI less than the fifth percentile for gestational age in predicting adverse perinatal outcomes.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study from 1998 to 2008. Patients with an AFI less than 5 cm and those with an AFI less than the fifth percentile were compared to patients with a normal AFI. The primary outcome measure was neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission.

Results

A total of 17,887 patients had complete information for analysis. There were 145 NICU admissions in patients with an AFI less than 5 cm (relative risk, 2.2) compared to 235 in patients with an AFI less than the fifth percentile for gestational age (relative risk, 2.37). The sensitivity and specificity for NICU admission using an AFI less than 5 cm were 10.9% and 95.2% compared to 17.6% and 92.5% for an AFI less than the fifth percentile for gestational age.

Conclusions

Oligohydramnios defined as an AFI less than the fifth percentile better predicts fetuses at risk for adverse perinatal outcomes compared to an AFI less than 5 cm.

### Detection and nonoperative management of pediatric developmental dysplasia of the hip in infants up to six months of age [^092de3b8]. AAOS (2022). High credibility.

Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in early infancy — detection rates, imaging timing, and risk factors are described as follows: The rate of detection of dislocation as confirmed by ultrasound was 13/1000 (7 to 24) vs 87/1000 (57 to 126/1000) respectively. There is no substantiation in the literature of the optimal age for imaging studies in these infants with risk factors, with one study performing hip radiographs at 4 months of age and two studies performing ultrasound between 2–6 weeks of age. Regarding other quoted risk factors, evidence was not found to include foot abnormalities, gender, oligohydramnios, and torticollis as risk factors for DDH. Risks and harms note that there is a potential risk of over diagnosis and treatment.

### Trial of labor following cesarean among patients with oligohydramnios at term: a multicenter retrospective study [^e110b3c4]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted using electronic medical records from two university‐affiliated medical centers in Jerusalem, Israel — Shaare Zedek Medical Center (SZMC) and Bikur Holim Medical Center (BHMC), spanning the years 2017 to 2021. These centers collectively account for approximately 16% of all deliveries in Israel, averaging 22 000 births annually during the study period.

Although oligohydramnios is usually defined as an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of ≤ 5 cm or a maximum vertical pocket (MVP) of < 2 cm measured by ultrasound, as AFI overcalls oligohydramnios leading to more interventions without any improvement in outcomes, for the purpose of the present study our criteria was restricted to cases in which oligohydramnios diagnosed by MVP was < 2 cm.

### Association of neonatal and fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios-introduction of a new "association factor" [^f52c603c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

The ultrasound examinations were performed in the Ultrasound Laboratory of the Clinic using Medison Sonoace X8 (Medison Co. LTD, Samsung Medison UGEO H60 (Samsung Medison Co. LTD), Samsung Medison WS80A (Samsung Medison Co. LTD), Philips ® HD 11XE (Philips Ultrasound) ultrasound machines.

To characterize the co-occurrence of polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios with fetal organ system abnormalities, we first used a linkage analysis. The Yule's coefficient was used:

Where:

AB: Fetal malformation + polyhydramnios/oligohydramnios.
Aβ: Fetal malformation without polyhydramnios/oligohydramnios.
αB: Polyhydramnios/oligohydramnios without fetal malformation.
αβ: Cases without polyhydramnios/oligohydramnios and fetal malformation.

For evaluation:

- −1 < Y < 1

° Y = 0 - independent.
° Y = 1 - full definition.
° Y < 0.3 - weak association.
° 0.3 ≤ Y ≤ 0.7 - medium association.
° Y > 0.7 - strong association.

In order to find a more accurate and sensitive characteristic than the Yule's coefficient, which better describes the association between a given disorder and polyhydramnios or oligohydramnios, we developed a new statistical parameter, the "Association Factor" (AF). In the following, we used the new "Association Factor" (AF) to characterize the intersection (F ∩ P or F ∩ O) of the sets F and P or O (where F: fetal malformations, P: polyhydramnios, O: oligohydramnios) in the statistical calculations.

### Celecoxib [^9750a992]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the general U.S. population, the estimated background risk of major birth
defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Premature closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus:

Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including celecoxib, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus (see Data).

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment:

If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If celecoxib treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs,
discontinue celecoxib and follow up according to clinical practice (see Data).

Labor or Delivery

There are no studies on the effects of celecoxib during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDs, including celecoxib, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth.

### Management of late-term pregnancy in midwifery-and obstetrician-led care [^784a86e4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

In the Netherlands, individual and local protocols are made on management of care in women reaching 41.0 weeks of gestation because of the absence of an interdisciplinary national guideline regulating management of late-term pregnancy. Timing, frequency, content of antenatal monitoring in late-term pregnancy and timing of induction differs within and between obstetric caregivers in midwifery-led care and obstetrician-led care. Women in midwifery-led care receive more membrane sweeping in comparison to women in obstetrician-led care at 41.0 weeks. There is no consensus within and between midwifery-led care and obstetrician-led care regarding the optimal management in late-term pregnancy.

Comparison to other studies

If a policy of expectant management until 42.0 weeks is chosen, regular antenatal checks in late-term pregnancy (41.0–42.0) are advised, though there is inconsistent evidence regarding the effectiveness of antenatal monitoring for the prevention of adverse perinatal outcome. Studies are varying in timing, frequency and content of these antenatal checks. Some international guidelines advise to perform a transabdominal ultrasound measurement of amniotic fluid for timely detection of an oligohydramnios and to detect small-for-gestational age foetus. Determining foetal growth restriction by ultrasound at term is challenging but is regularly used in third trimester or prior to induction to detect foetal growth restriction. There is conflicting evidence regarding the detection of small for gestational age (< p10) neonates when ultrasounds are performed in routine or on indication at term. The DIGITAT-trial (n = 650), on induction or expectant management for term suspected intra uterine growth restriction, showed that most neonates in this study had a birth weight < p10, but still 26–34% were > p10. In the late-term period, a retrospective cohort study (n = 71,050) described the results of a comparison between a policy using a routine ultrasound examination (routine scan of biometry and amniotic fluid index) at 41 gestational weeks with a policy using ultrasound on clinical indication (e.g. suspicion on small for gestational age) at 41 weeks. A policy of routine screening lowered the incidence of an adverse perinatal outcome at term, probably due to timely detection of SGA-foetus.

Factors associated with oligohydramnios

In the multivariable analysis (Table 2), the odds of oligohydramnios were 2.5 times higher among participants with a history of malaria in pregnancy, compared to those who had no malaria in pregnancy. Prime gravidas were 3.7 times more likely to be diagnosed with oligohydramnios compared to multigravidas. There was an association between increasing gestational age and oligohydramnios; compared to mothers at 37–39 weeks, the odds of oligohydramnios were 2.5 times higher among participants who were at 40–41 weeks, and 6 times higher among participants who were at > 41 weeks of gestation.

### Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide [^179a306a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Losartan:

Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: oligohydramnios, reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure, fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension, and death.

In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue losartan and hydrochlorothiazide, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of gestation. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe neonates with histories of in utero exposure to losartan and hydrochlorothiazide for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. In neonates with a history of in utero exposure to losartan and hydrochlorothiazide, if oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and replacing renal function.

### First trimester diagnosis of sirenomelia [^d4916086]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2006). Low credibility.

We present a case of sirenomelia diagnosed on a first trimester ultrasound at 10 weeks' gestation and confirmed on 3D-ultrasound and MRI. The pregnancy was terminated at 15 gestational weeks and the post-mortem examination, including RX and microscopy, is presented. The sirenomelia sequence is a rare and lethal anomaly characterized by fusion, rotation, hypotrophy or atrophy of the lower limbs and severe urogenital abnormalities leading to oligohydramnios in the second half of pregnancy. Our case illustrates that the diagnosis of sirenomelia can be reliably made in the first trimester.

### Association of neonatal and fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios-introduction of a new "association factor" [^2bc2a682]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

In 12 years, 41,069 deliveries and 1,957 mid-term abortion were recorded at the I. Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Of the 1,957 mid-term abortions 1,440 were induced (TOP-termination of pregnancy), and 517 were spontaneous miscarriages. A total of 2,825 fetuses had some form of malformation during the observed period. Of the 2,825 cases, 203 cases were excluded from the study. Cases where no ultrasound examination was performed and the abnormality was detected only after delivery/miscarriage were excluded.

In total, data from 2,622 fetuses were processed, of which 1,256 resulted in a delivery. Of the 1,256 newborns born with malformations, 644 were born before 37 weeks of gestation, with a premature birth rate of 51.3%. Of the 2,622 cases studied, 1,366 were mid-term abortions, and post-miscarriage fetopathological examination was performed. Sixty-seven cases were spontaneous miscarriages, and in case of 1,299 fetuses, TOP was performed.

Craniospinal abnormalities occurred in 530 fetuses, and facial and neck malformations in 218 cases. The highest number of cases was cardiac and large vessel anomalies (818 cases). 156 cases of other thoracic anomalies were observed, 404 cases were included in the abdominal and abdominal wall anomalies, 432 cases in the urogenital anomalies group, while 255 cases were classified in the limb and ossification anomalies group. Abnormalities with subcutaneous oedema occurred in 243 fetuses (Table 1).

Table 1
Cumulative efficacy of fetal malformation detection for all fetuses

Not all abnormalities are detected during pregnancy, and in some cases, the developmental abnormality is only detected after birth or during a fetopathological examination following a miscarriage. Over 50% of anatomical abnormalities in intrauterine fetuses were detected in craniospinal, cardiovascular, thoracic, abdominal, and abdominal wall anomalies, as well as in cases of subcutaneous oedema (Table 1).

### Advances in fetal imaging [^e097b876]. American Journal of Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

While ultrasound (US) has been a part of prenatal care for almost 40 years, technical progress over the last two decades has resulted in improved image quality and detection rate of congenital anomalies. The past 15 years have also seen the expansion of three-dimensional (3D) US, providing enhancements over with 2D US, and more realistic images of babies to parents and providers. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was first performed over 30 years ago, and has undergone major technical improvement over the past 15 to 20 years. Fetal MRI complements US by providing better visualization in the fetus when US is limited such as in oligohydramnios or severe maternal obesity. It offers a larger field of view and better tissue contrast than US and is not limited by shadowing from osseous structures. However, MRI has a limited resolution compared with US, is less readily available, and more expensive. While indications for fetal MRI have been clearly established for some abnormalities, such as neurological anomalies, other indications especially for fetal body imaging are not as clearly defined. In this article, we discuss recent developments in fetal MRI and 3D US and their common and newest indications.

### Telmisartan (Micardis) [^0cf71601]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions

Use of drugs that act on the RAS in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: oligohydramnios, reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure, fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension, and death. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus.

In patients taking MICARDIS during pregnancy, perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of gestation. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue MICARDIS, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury.

Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to MICARDIS for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. If oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### Fetal megacystis: a systematic review [^90baf77d]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Fetal megacystis is variably defined and understood. The literature on fetal megacystis was systematically reviewed, focusing on prenatal diagnosis, associations and outcomes. This yielded a total of 18 primary references and eight secondary references. Fetal megacystis has an estimated first-trimester prevalence of between 1:330 and 1:1670, with a male to female ratio of 8:1. In the first trimester, megacystis is most commonly defined as a longitudinal bladder dimension of ≥ 7 mm. Later in pregnancy, a sagittal dimension (in mm) greater than gestational age (in weeks) + 12 is often accepted. Megacystis can be associated with a thickened bladder wall, which has been objectively defined as > 3 mm. Oligohydramnios is present in approximately half of all cases. The most common underlying diagnosis is posterior urethral valves (57%), followed by urethral atresia/stenosis (7%), prune belly syndrome (4%), megacystis-microcolon-intestinal-hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) (1%), and cloacal anomalies (0.7%). Karyotype anomalies are found in 15%, and include trisomy 18, trisomy 13 and trisomy 21. Ultrasound imaging alone is often insufficient to enable a definitive diagnosis, although it may indicate that a specific diagnosis is more likely. Overall, about 50% of reported fetuses with megacystis are terminated, but this proportion varies considerably between countries and over time. Prognostic stratification is evolving, with the most important factors being oligohydramnios, gestational age at diagnosis, degree of bladder enlargement, renal hyperechogenicity, karyotype, and sex.

Conclusions

This review demonstrated some consensus on the ultrasound criteria for defining fetal megacystis, and illustrated the spectrum of pathologies and their relative frequencies that can cause this condition. It also underlined important associated karyotype anomalies. To progress understanding of the natural history of enlarged fetal bladders, more accurate diagnostics are required, and risk stratification needs to be refined to facilitate prenatal counseling.

### Dilemma after termination of pregnancy due to urogenital fetal anomalies: discrepancy between prenatal ultrasonographic diagnosis and autopsy [^a41de86d]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Complete agreement between fetal ultrasound and autopsy diagnoses was evident in only 40.2% of our cases. Partial agreement with additional minor findings on autopsy in 14.6% of cases seems to be explained by the concomitant presence of oligohydramnios in urogenital anomalies, which may cause suboptimal assessment of ultrasound imaging due to reduced image quality. Additional minor findings may also be overlooked because of maternal abdominal fat tissue as well as the primary focus of prenatal assessment on the major anomaly.

In eight pregnancy terminations, the final diagnosis as well as the risk of recurrence have changed after autopsy examination. This seems to emphasize the importance of avoiding dilemmas in pregnancy terminations by informing parents before termination about the potential discrepancy between fetal ultrasound and autopsy findings and the likelihood of ultrasound‐based anomaly diagnosis not to be confirmed by autopsy in some cases. Nonetheless, it should also be emphasized that autopsy is the only method to test the accuracy of prenatal ultrasound‐based diagnosis and hence is the reference standard to provide genetic counseling regarding the likelihood of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies in the case of a confirmed diagnosis of fetal anomaly.

The major strength of the present study seems to be the inclusion of pregnancy terminations before the 24th week of pregnancy for congenital anomalies, specifically urogenital anomalies, and the consideration of our center as a reference tertiary care center with fetal ultrasound and fetal autopsy examinations performed by the same perinatologist and perinatal pathologist for at least 16 years. Certain limitations to this study should be considered. However, our findings support that fetal autopsy (providing information about abnormalities of clinical importance, genetic guidance, and epidemiologic data) is of vital importance in improving the quality of prenatal ultrasound (dynamic examination providing additional information about functional anomalies) and complementing the prenatal diagnosis.,

In conclusion, our findings revealed complete to partial agreement between prenatal ultrasound and autopsy diagnoses on fetal urogenital anomalies in half of pregnancy terminations, whereas autopsy findings that revealed either altered diagnosis or additional minor anomalies were at least as severe as the sonographic findings, emphasizing that the information and advice given to the parents and the management was correct. Accordingly, our findings indicate fetal autopsy to be a method of crucial importance in complementing prenatal diagnosis, which may add valuable information that may improve subsequent pregnancy management and counseling of parents, and hence prenatal ultrasound and fetal autopsy should be regarded as complementary techniques.

### Effect of a labor triage checklist and ultrasound on obstetric referral at three primary health centers in Eastern Uganda [^92e2cac5]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To test whether introduction of a midwife-performed triage checklist and focused ultrasound improves diagnosis and referral for obstetric conditions, including multiple gestation, placenta previa, oligohydramnios, preterm birth, malpresentation, and abnormal fetal heart rate.

Methods

We implemented an intake log (Phase 1), a checklist (Phase 2), and a checklist plus ultrasound scan (Phase 3) at three primary health centers in Eastern Uganda for women presenting in labor. Intake diagnoses, referral status, and delivery outcomes were assessed, as well as sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV).

Results

Between February 2018 and July 2019, 1155, 961, and 603 women were enrolled across the three phases (n = 2719); 2339 had outcome data. Incidence of any outcome-confirmed condition was 8.8%, 7.9%, and 7.1% (P = 0.526) for each phase, respectively. The proportion of referred women with a condition did not change between Phases 1 and 2 (7.8% versus 8.6%, P = 0.855), but increased in Phase 3 (48.4%, P < 0.001). Sensitivity improved with each intervention; PPV decreased with ultrasound.

Conclusion

Use of ultrasound plus checklist increased referrals and sensitivity for high-risk conditions, with decreased PPV. The checklist alone improved correct diagnosis, but not referral. Further evaluation of these triage interventions to maximize diagnostic accuracy, referral decisions, and outcomes are warranted.

### Outcomes from polyhydramnios with normal ultrasound [^bce2081c]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the short- and long-term outcomes of children from pregnancies complicated with polyhydramnios, defined as amniotic fluid index (AFI) > 24 cm, and with a normal detailed ultrasound examination.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study examined 134 children aged 4 to 9 years with polyhydramnios and normal detailed ultrasound examination during pregnancy compared with 268 controls with normal AFI and normal detailed ultrasound examination matched for maternal age, year of delivery, gestational week at delivery, and presence or absence of diabetes. The primary outcome was the rate of malformations diagnosed postnatally. Additional outcomes were obstetrics outcomes, genetic syndromes, and neurodevelopment.

Results

Polyhydramnios was associated with increased risk for cesarean delivery (CD) and birth weight > 90th percentile. This elevation in CD was attributed to increased rate of elective CD due to suspected macrosomia. Polyhydramnios was associated with increased risk for congenital malformations (n = 25 [19%] compared with 27 [10%], respectively; P = 0.016) without a statistically significant increase in the rate of major malformations (11 [8%] vs. 10 [4%]; P = 0.057). Genetic syndromes were more prevalent in the polyhydramnios group (5 [3.7%] vs. 2 [0.75%]; P = 0.043), as were neurologic disorders and developmental delay (9.7% vs. 3%; P = 0.004).

Conclusions

Despite a normal detailed ultrasound examination, polyhydramnios is associated with increased rate of fetal malformations, genetic syndromes, neurologic disorders, and developmental delay, which may be diagnosed only after birth.
