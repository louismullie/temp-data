## Question

What is the effect of lvh on lvedp

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) affects left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of LVH and how it alters diastolic properties. Then, I should verify the direct hemodynamic consequences for LVEDP at rest and during exercise. Next, I will consider the role of myocardial fibrosis and stiffness. After that, I should review noninvasive correlates like E/e' and pulmonary pressures that track LVEDP. I will then examine exceptions where LVEDP may be normal despite LVH. Finally, I will integrate clinical implications and therapeutic modifiers that can lower LVEDP in LVH, making sure I anchor each step to guideline-level sources and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the core pathophysiology. LVH arises as an adaptive response to chronic pressure overload (e.g., hypertension, aortic stenosis) and involves myocyte hypertrophy, interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, and coronary microvascular changes. Over time, these structural changes impair active relaxation and increase passive stiffness, which are the hemodynamic hallmarks of diastolic dysfunction in hypertensive heart disease [^113fFgGd] [^116Va1Mm] [^111w46qF].

> I should now examine the direct hemodynamic consequence. Wait, let me verify the link to LVEDP. In diastolic dysfunction due to LVH, LVEDP rises out of proportion to volume because the ventricle requires higher pressures to achieve the same filling volume; this can be evident at rest in advanced disease and characteristically rises with exertion, producing exertional dyspnea and heart failure symptoms even when ejection fraction is preserved [^113fFgGd] [^11314jCT].

> Next, I should review the contribution of myocardial stiffness. Hold on, I should verify whether stiffness is quantifiably increased in LVH. In high-risk LVH with elevated biomarkers, invasive pressure-volume studies show approximately 30% greater myocardial stiffness than controls, translating to higher LVEDP for a given volume; this stiffened, fibrotic myocardium is a key substrate for elevated filling pressures and HFpEF risk [^116opLj3] [^116KXpQL].

> Let me consider noninvasive correlates that track LVEDP. I need to ensure I'm using validated indices. Echocardiographic E/e' correlates with invasively measured filling pressures, and in hypertensive LVH, higher E/e' reflects elevated LVEDP; additionally, elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure derived from the tricuspid regurgitation jet strongly suggests elevated LV filling pressures unless pulmonary vascular disease is present, reinforcing the link between LVH and increased LVEDP in clinical practice [^116Va1Mm] [^112fjsoW].

> But wait, what if LVEDP is normal despite LVH? I should double-check exceptions. Early, mild LVH may show impaired relaxation with preserved compliance and normal resting LVEDP; in such cases, LVEDP becomes abnormal only with stress or exercise, which is why exercise hemodynamics can unmask diastolic dysfunction in LVH, particularly in conditions like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy where LVEDP may rise markedly during exertion despite a non-dilated LV [^113fFgGd] [^1154g2SU] [^11314jCT].

> I will now examine clinical implications and modifiers. Elevated LVEDP in LVH drives symptoms of pulmonary congestion and exercise intolerance and portends worse outcomes. Importantly, therapies that reduce LV mass and fibrosis can lower LVEDP and improve diastolic function beyond blood pressure effects, with randomized data showing valsartan improves diastolic relaxation velocity and that sacubitril/valsartan reduces interstitial volume and estimated filling pressures more than valsartan alone, while intensive blood pressure lowering regresses LVH and may mitigate the rise in LVEDP over time [^1144QuYq] [^1115GFmp] [^112dWuXx].

> Let me synthesize and make sure nothing contradicts the core conclusion. LVH increases LVEDP primarily via impaired relaxation and increased passive stiffness from myocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis, producing a pressure–volume relationship in which higher diastolic pressures are required for the same filling volume. This manifests as elevated LVEDP at rest in more advanced disease and characteristically with exertion, with supportive noninvasive correlates such as E/e' and pulmonary pressures, while recognizing that early LVH may have normal resting LVEDP until stressed [^113fFgGd] [^116Va1Mm] [^116opLj3] [^112fjsoW].

---

LVH increases LVEDP by **impaired relaxation** and **reduced compliance** from myocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis, leading to higher diastolic pressures at a given volume [^113fFgGd] [^116KXpQL]. This rise in LVEDP is typically modest at rest but becomes more pronounced during exercise or stress, contributing to dyspnea and heart failure symptoms [^1154g2SU] [^11314jCT]. The magnitude of LVEDP elevation correlates with the severity of LVH and fibrosis, and can be assessed noninvasively by echocardiography (E/e') and invasively by catheterization [^115uGuPJ] [^1175BYqP]. LVH regression with antihypertensive therapy can lower LVEDP and improve diastolic function [^113G9r1o] [^1144QuYq].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking LVH to increased LVEDP

Several **interconnected mechanisms** explain how LVH elevates LVEDP:

---

### Myocardial hypertrophy and impaired relaxation

- **Increased wall thickness**: LVH increases wall thickness, which impairs active relaxation and delays early diastolic filling, raising LVEDP [^113fFgGd].

- **Reduced compliance**: Hypertrophied myocardium is stiffer, requiring higher pressures to achieve the same volume, thereby increasing LVEDP [^116opLj3].

---

### Myocardial fibrosis and structural remodeling

Interstitial and perivascular **fibrosis** increase passive stiffness and reduce compliance, elevating LVEDP at a given volume [^113fFgGd]. Extracellular matrix remodeling further increases stiffness and impairs relaxation, contributing to higher LVEDP [^116KXpQL].

---

### Coronary microvascular dysfunction and ischemia

Coronary microvascular dysfunction in LVH reduces subendocardial perfusion, causing **ischemia** that impairs relaxation and increases LVEDP [^11314jCT]. Ischemia-related relaxation abnormalities further elevate LVEDP, especially during stress or exercise [^1154g2SU].

---

### Hemodynamic consequences of increased LVEDP

Elevated LVEDP in LVH has **important hemodynamic consequences**:

- **Increased left atrial pressure**: Higher LVEDP raises left atrial pressure, promoting pulmonary congestion and dyspnea [^115LuCTn].

- **Pulmonary hypertension**: Chronic elevation can cause pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension [^114sNQuX].

- **Right ventricular strain**: Elevated pulmonary pressures increase right ventricular afterload, leading to RV hypertrophy and dysfunction [^114sNQuX].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the relationship between LVH and elevated LVEDP

Multiple studies and guidelines confirm that LVH is associated with **elevated LVEDP**:

- **Echocardiographic guidelines**: The ASE/EACVI note that pathologic LVH is consistent with diastolic dysfunction and elevated filling pressures [^1158bQ9J].

- **Invasive studies**: Patients with LVH and elevated biomarkers show increased myocardial stiffness and higher LVEDP than controls [^116opLj3].

- **Exercise studies**: In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, LVEDP rises abnormally during exercise, reflecting impaired relaxation and compliance [^1154g2SU].

---

## Factors influencing the magnitude of LVEDP elevation in LVH

The degree of LVEDP elevation in LVH is influenced by:

| **Factor** | **Influence on lvedp** |
|-|-|
| Degree of myocardial hypertrophy | Greater hypertrophy increases stiffness and LVEDP [^116opLj3] |
| Extent of myocardial fibrosis | More fibrosis reduces compliance and raises LVEDP [^116KXpQL] |
| Presence of coronary artery disease | Ischemia exacerbates diastolic dysfunction and LVEDP [^1149sBg3] |
| Exercise or stress conditions | Increased demand accentuates diastolic dysfunction and LVEDP [^1154g2SU] |

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Recognizing the link between LVH and elevated LVEDP has **important clinical implications**:

- **Symptom management**: Elevated LVEDP causes dyspnea, exercise intolerance, and heart failure symptoms [^11314jCT].

- **Prognostic significance**: Elevated LVEDP in LVH is associated with adverse outcomes, including heart failure and arrhythmias [^113fFgGd].

- **Therapeutic interventions**: Antihypertensive therapy, particularly RAAS blockade, can promote LVH regression, reduce LVEDP, and improve diastolic function [^1144QuYq] [^113fFgGd].

---

## Conclusion

LVH increases LVEDP through impaired relaxation, reduced compliance, and fibrosis, with the rise amplified by exercise or stress. This elevation contributes to symptoms and adverse outcomes, and **targeted therapy can reverse these changes** by promoting regression and lowering LVEDP [^113fFgGd] [^1115GFmp].

### Management of hypertension in patients with cardiac disease: use of renin-angiotensin blocking agents [^114zdrmk]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Inhibition of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) is beneficial in patient populations with left ventricular dysfunction or systolic heart failure (HF) and other forms of heart disease. In high-risk patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), treatment with these agents reduces the mortality rate and improves secondary outcomes. Individuals with stable CHD who are at lower risk benefit less from treatment. RAS inhibition also provides some clinical benefit to patients with diastolic HF and preserved left ventricular function. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in patients with hypertension. Treatment with an ARB reduces the risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertension and LVH. The benefits correlate with regression of LVH, and the effect is independent of the degree of blood pressure lowering. Finally, studies indicate that a history of hypertension in patients who have not had a myocardial infarction (MI) increases the risk for HF after MI; the risk is decreased in patients with hypertension who receive treatment with a RAS inhibitor.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Medium credibility.

Mitral E velocity — left ventricular (LV) diastolic function assessment notes that E-wave velocity reflects the left atrium–left ventricle (LA-LV) pressure gradient during early diastole and is affected by alterations in the rate of LV relaxation and left atrial pressure (LAP); it is feasible and reproducible and, in dilated cardiomyopathy with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), mitral velocities correlate better with LV filling pressures, functional class, and prognosis than LVEF; limitations include poor correlation with LV filling pressures in coronary artery disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) when LVEF is > 50%, greater challenge in arrhythmias, direct effects of LV volumes and elastic recoil, and age dependence with decreasing values with age.

### Effect of nicorandil on left ventricular end-diastolic pressure during exercise in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^1154g2SU]. European Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

Impaired coronary microcirculation is thought to contribute to myocardial ischaemia, causing an abnormal increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure during exercise in individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The effects of nicorandil on left ventricular end-diastolic pressure during exercise were examined in patients with this condition.

Methods and Results

Left ventricular pressures and dimensions were measured simultaneously during supine bicycle exercise in 23 patients with nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, before and after intravenous injection of either nicorandil (0.1 mg/kg) or propranolol (0.15 mg/kg). Exercise thallium-201 scintigraphy was also performed. Patients were grouped according to the changes in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure during exercise before treatment. Group I comprised 13 patients in whom left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased progressively to abnormal values during exercise; group II comprised 10 patients in whom left ventricular end-diastolic pressure changed biphasically. The extents of both left ventricular hypertrophy and ischemic burden during exercise were greater in group I than in group II. Of the eight group I patients who received nicorandil, four individuals exhibited biphasic changes in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure during exercise after its administration whereas four subjects showed no such effect of the drug. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased progressively during exercise after propranolol treatment in all 6 group II patients given this drug.

Conclusion

Nicorandil has a salutary effect on the changes in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure during exercise in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

### Clinical impact of left ventricular hypertrophy and implications for regression [^1127QKJY]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an independent risk factor and predictor of cardiovascular (CV) events and all-cause mortality. Patients with LVH are at increased risk for stroke, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, and sudden cardiac death. Left ventricular hypertrophy represents both a manifestation of the effects of hypertension and other CV risk factors over time as well as an intrinsic condition causing pathologic changes in the CV structure and function. We review the risk factors for LVH and its consequences, concentric remodeling, and its prognostic significance, clinical benefits and supporting evidence for LVH regression, and its implications for management. We conclude our review summarizing the various pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapeutic options approved for the treatment of hypertension and LVH regression and the supporting clinical trial data for these therapeutic strategies.

### Left ventricular hypertrophy: reduction of blood pressure already in the normal range further regresses left ventricular mass [^115Tw44W]. Heart (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) confers high cardiovascular risk. Regression of LVH reduces risk. Patients with blood pressure in the normal range and LVH are common. We investigated whether further reduction in blood pressure would further regress LVH.

Methods

51 subjects with blood pressure in the normal range and echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy were randomly assigned to active treatment (antihypertensive medication) or placebo in a ratio of 2:1. The aim was to maintain office systolic blood pressure at 10 mm Hg less than baseline in the active arm and at baseline level in the placebo arm. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure change in left ventricular mass index over 12 months.

Results

35 subjects completed the study (active 23: placebo 12). Average mean baseline office systolic blood pressure was 122 (SD 9) mm Hg in the active group and 124 (9) mm Hg in the placebo group (p = 0.646). The mean baseline left ventricular mass index was 65.88 (11.87) g/m(2) in the active group and 59.16 (11.13) g/m(2) in the placebo group (p = 0.114). The mean difference between baseline and end of study office systolic blood pressure was -9.33 (8.56) mm Hg in the active group and -0.08 (9.27) mm Hg in the placebo group (p = 0.007). The mean change in left ventricular mass index was -4.68 (7.31) g/m(2) in the active group and +1.97 (6.68) g/m(2) in the placebo group (p = 0.014).

Conclusions

Reduction in office systolic blood pressure, already in the normal range, of approximately 9 mm Hg, leads to a reduction in left ventricular mass. Further work is required to see if this also leads to a reduction in cardiovascular events.

### Novel index of maladaptive myocardial remodeling in hypertension [^1141Zvmo]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertensive heart disease is a syndrome characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), systolic and diastolic dysfunction alongside the clinical manifestations of heart failure. In susceptible patients, the myocardium progressively thickens in response to elevated arterial pressure to minimize myocardial wall stress (σ) according to the LaPlace's Law: σ = [P × r]/2 h, where P is the left ventricular (LV) pressure, r is the LV radius, and h is the myocardial wall thickness. These changes are initially adaptive to maintain cardiac output and function. Over time, the LV can decompensate and fail. – Two major processes drive the transition from ventricular adaptation to decompensation: cardiac myocyte dysfunction/death and myocardial fibrosis. Myocyte dysfunction/death occurs in response to chronic exposure to neurohormonal factors and progressive myocardial ischemia associated with elevated wall stress. Myocardial fibrosis, a common final pathology in all heart failure causes, is characterized by an increase in collagen volume fraction of myocardial tissue that can be assessed noninvasively using contrast-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) techniques.

See Clinical Perspective

Hypertensive LVH is associated with adverse prognosis, above and beyond the effects of blood pressure (BP). – Four LV geometric patterns have conventionally been described: normal, concentric remodeling, concentric hypertrophy, and eccentric hypertrophy, but the 3-dimensional (3D) phenotype of LVH shows the true situation to be far more nuanced. Both concentric and eccentric LVH patterns are associated with increased cardiovascular events. LV geometry has limited incremental prognostic value when LV mass and other cardiovascular risk factors are considered.– Therefore, a better marker of adverse remodeling is needed to identify high-risk hypertensive LVH phenotypes.

Ventricular dilatation and myocardial thickening are 2 important determinants of increased LV mass and myocardial wall stress. We hypothesize that an index of LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) and wall thickness (Remodeling Index [RI]) may provide a more clinically relevant readout of adverse ventricular remodeling by combining the effects of LV volumes and wall thickness in a single metric. Using multi-imaging techniques (CMR and echocardiography), ECG, comprehensive BP assessment (office and 24-hour ambulatory), and cardiac biomarkers (high-sensitive cardiac troponin I/T [hsTnI/T], NT-proBNP [N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide], and galectin-3), we aim to examine the myocardial response and the potential role of RI in hypertensive patients.

### Metformin improves cardiac metabolism and function, and prevents left ventricular hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats [^1178Nywz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) we observed profound myocardial metabolic changes during early hypertension before development of cardiac dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy. In this study, we evaluated whether metformin improved myocardial metabolic abnormalities and simultaneously prevented contractile dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy in SHR. Methods and Results SHR and control Wistar-Kyoto rats were treated with metformin from 2 to 5 months of age, when SHR hearts exhibit metabolic abnormalities and develop cardiac dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy. We evaluated the effect of metformin on myocardial glucose uptake rates with dynamic 2-[18 F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography. We used cardiac MRI in vivo to assess the effect of metformin on ejection fraction, left ventricular mass, and end-diastolic wall thickness, and also analyzed metabolites, AMP-activated protein kinase and mammalian target-of-rapamycin activities, and mean arterial blood pressure. Metformin-treated SHR had lower mean arterial blood pressure but remained hypertensive. Cardiac glucose uptake rates, left ventricular mass/tibia length, wall thickness, and circulating free fatty acid levels decreased to normal, and ejection fraction improved in treated SHR. Hearts of treated SHR exhibited increased AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation and reduced mammalian target-of-rapamycin activity. Cardiac metabolite profiling demonstrated that metformin decreased fatty acyl carnitines and markers of oxidative stress in SHR. Conclusions Metformin reduced blood pressure, normalized myocardial glucose uptake, prevented left ventricular hypertrophy, and improved cardiac function in SHR. Metformin may exert its effects by normalizing myocardial AMPK and mammalian target-of-rapamycin activities, improving fatty acid oxidation, and reducing oxidative stress. Thus, metformin may be a new treatment to prevent or ameliorate chronic hypertension-induced left ventricular hypertrophy.

### Hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy [^11681SNL]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

In the initial stage, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is adaptive, but in time, it transforms to maladaptive LVH which is specific for the development of various phenotypes that cause heart failure, initially with preserved, but later with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Pathophysiological mechanisms, which are characteristic for remodeling procedure, are numerous and extremely complex, and should be subjected to further research with the aim of making a comprehensive overview of hypertensive heart disease (HHD) and discovering new options for preventing and treating HHD. The contemporary methods, such as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and computed tomography (CT) provide very accurate morphological and functional information on HHD. The objective of this review article is to summarize the available scientific information in terms of prevalence, pathophysiology, diagnostics, prevention, contemporary therapeutic options, as well as to present potential therapeutic solutions based on the research of pathological mechanisms which are at the core of HHD.

### New insights into the relationship of left ventricular geometry and left ventricular mass with cardiac function: a population study of hypertensive subjects [^112fjsoW]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

Remodelling of the left ventricle (LV) is associated with adverse cardiovascular events, but the mechanisms of these effects remain undefined. We investigated the relationship of LV mass and geometry to LV function in a large cohort of hypertensive subjects.

Methods and Results

We studied 1074 hypertensive individuals without cardiovascular disease recruited from the London Life Sciences Prospective Population (LOLIPOP) study. All subjects underwent echocardiography for derivation of LV mass index (LVMI), measurement of transmitral filling pattern, and LV ejection fraction (EF). The tissue Doppler parameters of peak myocardial systolic velocity (Sa), diastolic velocity (Ea), and of LV filling pressure (E/Ea) were measured. Left ventricular function was correlated with degree of concentric remodelling, determined by relative wall thickness, and with LV geometric pattern. The presence of LV hypertrophy was independently associated with significantly worse systolic function, diastolic function, and higher LV filling pressure when compared with subjects with normal LV geometry or non-hypertrophic concentric remodelling. After adjustment for covariates including LVMI, peak Sa velocity and EF increased (P < 0.001), whereas peak Ea velocity decreased significantly (P < 0.001) with increasing degrees of concentric remodelling.

Conclusion

In hypertensives, hypertrophic remodelling is independently associated with impaired LV function and increased LV filling pressure. Increasing degrees of non-hypertrophic concentric remodelling are associated with attenuated diastolic function, but augmented systolic function, possibly representing an adaptive response to pressure overload physiology.

### Left ventricular chamber dilation and filling pressure may help to categorise patients with type 2 diabetes [^111HbZQM]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus is a well-known risk factor for the development of heart alterations both in the structure and in the function. The Framingham Heart Study demonstrated that the frequency of heart failure is five times higher in diabetic women and two times greater in diabetic men compared with age-matched control subjects. The most frequent heart alteration in type 2 diabetes is heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (EF). However, heart failure with preserved EF was recently questionedas the EF parameter alone roughly reflects heart performance. A MRI study found lower left ventricular (LV) EF, higher values of troponin and other surrogate markers of cardiovascular risk in patients with left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) dilation compared with those without LVEDV dilation independently of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) pattern, concentric or eccentric. Consequently, the authors suggested reclassifying concentric and eccentric LVH into two further groups based on the absence or presence of LVEDV dilation.

Early diastolic dysfunction is generally referable to an impaired relaxation filling pattern in patients with preserved LVEF. As reported in the recommendations for the evaluation of LV diastolic function, it is the combination of elevated LV diastolic pressure and the absence of an increased LVEDV that represents a strong evidence in favour of well-developed diastolic dysfunction. It may be misleading to consider isolated diastolic dysfunction without investigating LV dimension, as LV dilation is an important aspect of LV geometric remodelling.

Evidences showed that standard echocardiographic parameters, such as left ventricular end-diastolic volume and E/e′ ratio, are well validated from the pathophysiological and prognostic points of view. Therefore, we believe that heart failure with preserved EF may be a quite heterogeneous class and we hypothesise that stratification according to diastolic filling pressure estimated (E/e′ ratio) and LVEDV may help to categorise type 2 diabetes patients. Consequently, the aim of this study was to test whether stratification of patients affected by type 2 diabetes with preserved LVEF according to E/e′ ratio and LVEDV would be able to separate different phenotypes.

### Effect of rosuvastatin on cardiac remodeling, function, and progression to heart failure in hypertensive heart with established left ventricular hypertrophy [^117WjwPV]. Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) are the most common high-risk group to develop heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Recent reports have noted the favorable effect of statins on LVH. We evaluated the effect of rosuvastatin on cardiac remodeling, function, and progression to heart failure in a hypertensive rat model with established LVH. Dahl salt-sensitive rats were fed a high-salt diet until 13 weeks of age. After LVH was confirmed by echocardiography, rats were randomly assigned to control and statin treatment (n = 18 each group). The statin-treated group was treated with rosuvastatin until 21 weeks of ages. Serial echocardiography, blood pressure monitoring, and miniaturized conductance catheter hemodynamic monitoring were performed at 21 weeks. Echocardiographic parameters were not significantly different between the groups. On hemodynamic monitoring, systolic performance parameters were similar between the groups, whereas end diastolic pressure-volume relationships were lower in the statin-treated group (0.014 ± 0.008 versus 0.008 ± 0.004 mm Hg/muL, P < 0.05), suggesting improvement in myocardial stiffness. Pathological analysis showed attenuation of perivascular and interstitial fibrosis in the statin-treated group (P < 0.02). Rosuvastatin therapy did not alleviate LVH in hypertensive rats with established LVH, but it attenuated myocardial fibrosis and LV stiffness. It seems that rosuvastatin has limited therapeutic value when used to prevent progression from LVH to heart failure in hypertensive hearts.

### Progression from concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and normal ejection fraction to left ventricular dysfunction [^116jY3Te]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy develops in response to a chronically increased LV afterload and is associated with increased cardiovascular events. Although the progression to systolic and diastolic heart failure is a known consequence of LV hypertrophy, few data are available on the frequency of deterioration to systolic dysfunction in patients with LV hypertrophy who originally had a normal LV ejection fraction. We evaluated the baseline and follow-up characteristics in 1,024 patients with concentric LV hypertrophy and a normal ejection fraction who had paired echocardiograms that were separated by ≥ 1 year. Systolic dysfunction occurred in 134 patients (13%) after a mean follow-up of 33 ± 24 months. The most common associated variable was interval myocardial infarction, which occurred in 43% of patients. Other risk factors for developing LV systolic dysfunction included QRS prolongation (> 120 ms) and elevated follow-up arterial impedance defined as a value > 4.0 mm Hg/ml/m(2). Patients with either a prolonged QRS interval or an elevated follow-up arterial impedance had twice the likelihood of developing LV systolic dysfunction, and, if both factors were present, there was a greater than fourfold increased risk of developing systolic dysfunction. Blood pressure measurements alone did not adequately reflect an elevated arterial impedance. In conclusion, 13% of patients with a normal ejection fraction and concentric LV hypertrophy progress to systolic dysfunction during approximately 3 years of follow-up. The risk factors for loss of function were interval myocardial infarction, prolonged QRS, and chronically elevated arterial impedance.

### Pharmacotherapy for hypertension-induced left ventricular hypertrophy [^1124eMWh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension is the leading preventable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and premature death worldwide. One of the clinical effects of hypertension is left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), a process of cardiac remodelling. It is estimated that over 30% of people with hypertension also suffer from LVH, although the prevalence rates vary according to the LVH diagnostic criteria. Severity of LVH is associated with a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease and an increased risk of death. The role of antihypertensives in the regression of left ventricular mass has been extensively studied. However, uncertainty exists regarding the role of antihypertensive therapy compared to placebo in the morbidity and mortality of individuals with hypertension-induced LVH.

Objectives

To assess the effect of antihypertensive pharmacotherapy compared to placebo or no treatment on morbidity and mortality of adults with hypertension-induced LVH.

Search Methods

Cochrane Hypertension's Information Specialist searched the following databases for studies: Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register (to 26 September 2020), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library; 2020, Issue 9), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 22 September 2020), and Ovid Embase (1974 to 22 September 2020). We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. We also searched Epistemonikos (to 19 February 2021), LILACS BIREME (to 19 February 2021), and Clarivate Web of Science (to 26 February 2021), and contacted authors and funders of the identified trials to obtain additional information and individual participant data. There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least 12 months' follow-up comparing antihypertensive pharmacological therapy (monotherapy or in combination) with placebo or no treatment in adults (18 years of age or older) with hypertension-induced LVH were eligible for inclusion. The trials must have analysed at least one primary outcome (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, or total serious adverse events) to be considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened the search results, with any disagreements resolved by consensus amongst all review authors. Two review authors carried out the data extraction and analyses. We assessed risk of bias of the included studies following Cochrane methodology. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the body of evidence.

Main Results

We included three multicentre RCTs. We selected 930 participants from the included studies for the analyses, with a mean follow-up of 3.8 years (range 3.5 to 4.3 years). All of the included trials performed an intention-to-treat analysis. We obtained evidence for the review by identifying the population of interest from the trials' total samples. None of the trials provided information on the cause of LVH. The intervention varied amongst the included trials: hydrochlorothiazide plus triamterene with the possibility of adding alpha methyldopa, spironolactone, or olmesartan. Placebo was administered to participants in the control arm in two trials, whereas participants in the control arm of the remaining trial did not receive any add-on treatment. The evidence is very uncertain regarding the effect of additional antihypertensive pharmacological therapy compared to placebo or no treatment on mortality (14.3% intervention versus 13.6% control; risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.40; 3 studies; 930 participants; very low-certainty evidence); cardiovascular events (12.6% intervention versus 11.5% control; RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.55; 3 studies; 930 participants; very low-certainty evidence); and hospitalisation for heart failure (10.7% intervention versus 12.5% control; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.17; 2 studies; 915 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Although both arms yielded similar results for total serious adverse events (48.9% intervention versus 48.1% control; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.16; 3 studies; 930 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and total adverse events (68.3% intervention versus 67.2% control; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.34; 2 studies; 915 participants), the incidence of withdrawal due to adverse events may be significantly higher with antihypertensive drug therapy (15.2% intervention versus 4.9% control; RR 3.09, 95% CI 1.69 to 5.66; 1 study; 522 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analyses limited to blinded trials, trials with low risk of bias in core domains, and trials with no funding from the pharmaceutical industry did not change the results of the main analyses. Limited evidence on the change in left ventricular mass index prevented us from drawing any firm conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain about the effects of adding additional antihypertensive drug therapy on the morbidity and mortality of participants with LVH and hypertension compared to placebo. Although the incidence of serious adverse events was similar between study arms, additional antihypertensive therapy may be associated with more withdrawals due to adverse events. Limited and low-certainty evidence requires that caution be used when interpreting the findings. High-quality clinical trials addressing the effect of antihypertensives on clinically relevant variables and carried out specifically in individuals with hypertension-induced LVH are warranted.

### Diastolic dysfunction: pathophysiology, clinical features, and assessment with radionuclide methods [^1149sBg3]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Basic to our understanding of heart failure is the distinction between systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction. Diastolic dysfunction implies that the ventricle cannot accept blood at normally low pressures. The ventricular filling pattern and the relation between ventricular diastolic pressure and volume reflect a dynamic interaction between time course of relaxation, conversion of elastic forces into elastic recoil, and the passive properties of the ventricle. In the early part of diastolic filling, the pressure-volume relationship is influenced primarily by relaxation; in the latter part of diastole, passive filling properties are important. Mitral inflow patterns reflect these time-varying filling dynamics and are commonly assessed with echocardiography. Disorders of diastolic filling are observed in patients with heart failure with normal ejection fraction, myocardial ischemia, and even dilated cardiomyopathy. Patients with concentric ventricular hypertrophy, normal ejection fraction, and heart failure are the prototype of patients with diastolic dysfunction. In this article we review the physiology and pathophysiology of diastole and the main clinical disorders associated with diastolic dysfunction, and we outline in brief the application of radionuclide techniques in the assessment of diastolic dysfunction.

### Effect of angiotensin type I-receptor blockade on left ventricular remodeling in pressure overload hypertrophy [^11284k9k]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The renin-angiotensin system is involved in cardiac remodeling. In contrast to the well-recognized salutary effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, the value of angiotensin II type I (AT(1))-receptor blockade on left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and dysfunction is controversial.

Methods and Results

Descending thoracic aorta-banded and sham-operated guinea pigs were given either losartan (30 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) intraperitoneally) or vehicle for 8 weeks (n = 7 in each group). LV end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions and wall thicknesses were measured echocardiographically, and LV fractional shortening, relative wall thickness, and LV mass normalized by body weight were calculated. Isolated heart function (Langendorff perfusion) was studied 8 weeks after surgery, and LV performance was assessed by maximum LV pressure and ± dP/dt normalized by LV mass. Eight weeks after banding guinea pigs developed concentric LV hypertrophy and had decreased maximum LV pressure and ± dP/dt normalized by LV mass; LV end-diastolic dimension and LV fractional shortening were unchanged. In band-operated guinea pigs treatment with losartan had no significant effects on any of these measurements.

Conclusions

In guinea pigs with descending aortic banding, treatment with losartan for 8 weeks neither attenuates progression of pressure overload hypertrophy nor significantly improves impaired mass-normalized pressure-derived indices of LV contraction and relaxation.

### Effect of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy on left ventricular systolic function in systemic hypertension (the LIFE study). Losartan intervention for endpoint [^114MUmrV]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction is normal in most patients with uncomplicated hypertension, but the prevalence and correlates of decreased LV systolic chamber and myocardial function, as assessed by midwall mechanics, in hypertensive patients identified as being at high risk by the presence of LV hypertrophy on the electrocardiogram has not been established. Therefore echocardiograms were obtained in 913 patients with stage I to III hypertension and LV hypertrophy determined by electrocardiographic (Cornell voltage duration or Sokolow-Lyon voltage) criteria after 14 days' placebo treatment. The 913 patients' mean age was 66 years, and 42% were women. Fourteen percent had subnormal LV endocardial shortening, 24% had subnormal midwall shortening, and 13% had reduced stress-corrected midwall shortening. Nineteen percent had normal LV geometry, 11% had concentric remodeling, 47% had eccentric hypertrophy, and 23% had concentric hypertrophy. LV systolic performance evaluated by LV endocardial shortening and midwall shortening was impaired in 10% of patients with normal geometry, 20% with concentric remodeling, 27% with eccentric hypertrophy, and 42% with concentric hypertrophy. Relative wall thickness, an important independent correlate of LV chamber function, was related directly to endocardial shortening and negatively to midwall shortening and stress-corrected midwall shortening. LV mass was the strongest independent correlate of impaired endocardial shortening, midwall shortening, or both. In hypertensive patients with electrocardiographic LV hypertrophy, indexes of systolic performance are subnormal in 10% to 42% with different LV geometric patterns. Depressed endocardial shortening is most common in patients with eccentric LV hypertrophy, whereas impaired midwall shortening is most prevalent in patients with concentric remodeling or hypertrophy. Thus, in hypertensive patients with electrocardiographic LV hypertrophy, impaired LV performance occurs most often, and is associated with greater LV mass and relative wall thickness and may contribute to the high rate of cardiovascular events.

Ancillary indicators — left ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary pressures — note that the finding of pathologic left ventricular hypertrophy is consistent with diastolic dysfunction, and elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure calculated from the tricuspid regurgitation jet is strongly suggestive of elevated left ventricular filling pressure unless pulmonary parenchymal or vascular disease is known to be present.

### Increased myocardial stiffness in patients with high-risk left ventricular hypertrophy: the hallmark of stage-B heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116opLj3]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Individuals with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and elevated cardiac biomarkers in middle age are at high risk for the development of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, it is unknown what the pathophysiological underpinnings of this high-risk state may be. We tested the hypothesis that patients with LVH and elevated cardiac biomarkers would demonstrate elevated left ventricular (LV) myocardial stiffness in comparison with healthy controls as a key marker for future HFpEF.

Methods

Forty-six patients with LVH (LV septum > 11 mm) and elevated cardiac biomarkers (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide [> 40 pg/mL] or troponin T [> 0.6 pg/mL]) were recruited, along with 61 age- and sex-matched (by cohort) healthy controls. To define LV pressure-volume relationships, right heart catheterization and 3-dimensional echocardiography were performed while preload was manipulated using lower body negative pressure and rapid saline infusion.

Results

There were significant differences in body size, blood pressure, and baseline pulmonary capillary wedge pressure between groups (eg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure: LVH, 13.4 ± 2.7 versus control, 11.7 ± 1.7 mm Hg, P < 0.0001). The LV was less distensible in LVH than in controls (smaller volume for the same filling pressure). When preload was expressed as transmural filling pressure (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure - right atrial pressure), LV myocardial stiffness was nearly 30% greater in LVH than in controls (LVH stiffness constant, 0.053 ± 0.027 versus controls, 0.042 ± 0.020, P = 0.028).

Conclusions

LV myocardial stiffness in patients with LVH and elevated biomarkers (stage-B HFpEF) is greater than in age- and sex-matched controls and thus appears to represent a transitional state from a normal healthy heart to HFpEF. Although the LV myocardial stiffness of patients with LVH is greater than that of healthy controls at this early stage, further studies are required to clarify whether interventions such as exercise training to improve LV compliance may prevent the full manifestation of the HFpEF syndrome in these high-risk individuals.

### Intensive blood pressure lowering improves left ventricular hypertrophy in older patients with hypertension: the STEP trial [^112dWuXx]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

NOVELTY AND RELEVANCE

See related article, pp

Hypertension is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease worldwide, and the left ventricle is a primary target of the end-organ damage caused by elevated blood pressure (BP). The long-term increase in afterload causes the enlargement and hypertrophy of myocardium and cardiac remodeling, which results in decreased cardiac function at some point in the natural history of hypertension, despite being initially beneficial. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a well-documented pivotal biomarker of cardiac damage and an harbinger of incident cardiovascular events and mortality.

Successful antihypertensive management can limit LVH and improve the clinical prognosis. – However, LVH often develops in patients receiving standard BP control. Emerging evidence suggests an early change in the structure and geometry of the left ventricle in patients with high normal BP, defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 120 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic BP of 80 to 89 mm Hg, indicating that an intensified antihypertensive strategy might be better able to prevent cardiac hypertrophy. – Thus far, 3 randomized controlled trials consistently reported a favorable effect of intensive SBP lowering on the incidence of LVH. – However, evidence for this effect remains scant in the Asian population in which cardiac remodeling was less significant under the context of hypertension. Noteworthy, despite the strong association of LVH with adverse outcomes, its role in the context of intensive SBP lowering is still not well understood and whether LVH mediates the cardiovascular benefits associated with intensive SBP deserves further interrogation.

The Strategy of Blood Pressure Intervention in the Elderly Hypertensive Patients (STEP) trial randomly assigned older patients with hypertension to intensive treatment (SBP target, 110– < 130 mm Hg) or standard treatment (130– < 150 mm Hg) to observe the long-term clinical prognosis, all enrolled patients were provided with standard 12-lead ECG tests at baseline during follow-up. Thus, this trial provided a unique opportunity to examine the effect of intensive SBP lowering on LVH assessed by ECGand the clinical prognostic value of LVH beyond intensive SBP reduction in older patients with hypertension.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Medium credibility.

Mitral "L" velocity — markedly delayed LV relaxation with elevated LV filling pressures allows ongoing mid-diastolic LV filling and thus an L velocity and patients usually have bradycardia; when present in known cardiac disease (e.g. LV hypertrophy [LVH], HCM) it is specific for elevated LV filling pressures but overall sensitivity is low; it is rarely seen in normal LV diastolic function when the subject has bradycardia and is then usually < 20 cm/sec.

Eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy — mechanism and echocardiographic features: It is associated with volume, rather than pressure overload, usually due to significant valvular regurgitation or high cardiac index as seen in elite athletes; systemic pressure is normal and peripheral resistance is not increased; echocardiography shows increased LV cavity size, normal LV wall thickness, and increased LVM; patients share similar changes in diastolic and longitudinal/radial function as in concentric hypertrophy, but generally have low normal or mildly impaired systolic function due to chronic volume overload.

### Cardiovascular risk in relation to a new classification of hypertensive left ventricular geometric abnormalities [^113tTitM]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

In 2010, the Dallas Heart Study proposed an upgrade of the left ventricular geometric classification proposed in 1991, by using left ventricular mass combined with end diastolic volumes, and introducing the new categories of dilated left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). We adopted the new method to test the prognostic impact of the left ventricular geometric patterns from the new classification.

Methods

We evaluated baseline anthropometric, laboratory and echocardiographic parameters of 8848 hypertensive patients from the Campania Salute Network (53 ± 12 years, 56% male), free of prevalent cardiovascular disease, valve disease and with ejection fraction ≥ 50%. Cut points for left ventricular mass index, relative wall thickness and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (cm/m) were derived from our historical normal reference population. Composite cardiovascular end-points were cardiac death, fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke.

Results

Independent of confounders, eccentric dilated LVH, concentric nondilated LVH and concentric dilated LVH were associated with higher cardiovascular risk (hazard ratios between 2 and 9, all P < 0.01), mostly depending on the magnitude of LVM index. A volume load was present especially in dilated forms of LVH, the extent of which was important in the determination of harmful types of left ventricular geometry.

Conclusion

Consideration of left ventricular dilatation in the evaluation of risk related to hypertensive left ventricular geometry reveals the importance of the extent of the volume load coexisting with the typical hypertensive pressure overload. At a given normal ejection fraction, the balance between the two hemodynamic components influences the shape of left ventricular geometric adaptation, the amount of left ventricular mass and the impact on prognosis.

### Prognostic implications of left ventricular hypertrophy [^117RKmBU]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was one of the earliest studied echocardiographic characteristics of the left ventricle. As the myriad of measurable metrics has multiplied over recent years, this reliable and relevant variable can often be overlooked. In this paper, we discuss appropriate techniques for accurate analysis, underlying pathophysiology, and the contributions from various risk factors. The prognostic implications of LVH on stroke, serious arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death are reviewed. Finally, we examine the effect of therapy to reduce LVH and the resultant clinical outcomes.

### Four-group classification of left ventricular hypertrophy based on ventricular concentricity and dilatation identifies a low-risk subset of eccentric hypertrophy in hypertensive patients [^113ELADf]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH; high LV mass [LVM]) is traditionally classified as concentric or eccentric based on LV relative wall thickness. We evaluated the prediction of subsequent adverse events in a new 4-group LVH classification based on LV dilatation (high LV end-diastolic volume [EDV] index) and concentricity (mass/end-diastolic volume [M/EDV](2/3)) in hypertensive patients.

Methods and Results

In the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction (LIFE) echocardiography substudy, 939 hypertensive patients with measurable LVM at baseline were randomized to a mean of 4.8 years of losartan- or atenolol-based treatment. Patients with LVH (LVM/body surface area ≥ 116 and ≥ 96 g/m(2) in men and woman, respectively) were divided into 4 groups-concentric nondilated (increased M/EDV, normal EDV), eccentric dilated (increased EDV, normal M/EDV), concentric dilated (increased M/EDV and EDV), and eccentric nondilated (normal M/EDV and EDV)-and compared with patients with normal LVM. Time-varying LVH classes were tested for association with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and a composite end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular death in multivariable Cox analyses. At baseline, the LVs were categorized as eccentric nondilated in 12%, eccentric dilated in 20%, concentric nondilated in 29%, concentric dilated in 14%, and normal LVM in 25%. Treatment changed the prevalence of 4 LVH groups to 23%, 4%, 5%, and 7%; 62% had normal LVM after 4 years. In time-varying Cox analyses, compared with normal LVM, those with eccentric dilated and both concentric nondilated and dilated LVH had increased risks of all-cause or cardiovascular mortality or the composite end point, whereas the eccentric nondilated group did not.

Conclusions

Hypertensive patients with relatively mild LVH without either increased LV volume or concentricity have similar risk of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular events because hypertensive patients with normal LVM seem to be a low-risk group.

### The effect of hypertension and obesity on left ventricular geometry and cardiac functions in children and adolescents [^112auHmJ]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Obesity and hypertension are associated with structural and functional cardiac change in children and adults. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of hypertension and obesity on left ventricular geometric patterns and cardiac functions assessed by conventional and Doppler echocardiography.

Methods

Four hundred and thirty obese children, aged 6–17 years and 150 age and sex-matched healthy controls, were included in the study. Left ventricular geometry was classified as concentric hypertrophy, eccentric hypertrophy, concentric remodeling and normal geometry.

Results

Concentric hypertrophy group had the worst subclinical systolic and diastolic cardiac functions among all left ventricular geometric patterns. BMI and total adipose tissue mass are the predictors of abnormal ventricular geometry. Apart from the increase in carotid intima-media and epicardial adipose tissue thicknesses in different left ventricular geometry patterns, they are not predictable for abnormal geometry.

Conclusion

The variety of alterations in cardiac function and morphology that has been observed in obese adults, appears to start earlier in life. Obesity and hypertension were clearly associated with the left ventricular geometry. Also, subclinical systolic and load-depended diastolic dysfunctions can be detected in obese hypertensive children with concentric hypertrophy.

Results

Echocardiographic results

A total of 16 rats in sham, 16 in PAB, 15 in LAD, and 13 in LAD + PAB groups survived until experiment termination. Early after arterial ligation (week 1), LAD and LAD + PAB rats displayed LV dilatation, impaired LV contractility, and deteriorated LV diastolic function compared to sham and PAB groups (Supplemental Figure 1). With PAB treatment, LV dilatation was reduced in LAD + PAB compared to LAD animals; in the latter, LV chamber enlargement persisted until the experiment termination (Figures 2A and 2B, Supplemental Figure 2). LV fractional area change and ejection fraction substantially improved with PAB in the LAD + PAB group, whereas, in the LAD group, LV contractile function remained impaired (Figures 2C and 2D, Supplemental Figure 2). Similarly, mitral valve inflow Doppler E/A and LV myocardial performance index was reduced after PAB treatment in the LAD + PAB group compared to LAD animals (Figures 2E and 2F), suggesting combined improvement in LV diastolic and systolic performance. At week 4, RV dilatation was observed in LAD + PAB and PAB groups, with a small impairment of RV contractile function (Supplemental Figure 3). PAB induced significant RV pressure overload (as measured by continuous-wave Doppler across the PAB), RV hypertrophy, and LV posterior wall hypertrophy, which occurred in the absence of LV outflow tract obstruction (Supplemental Figures 3 and 4). With all metrics, we did not observe any sex-specific differences between the groups. These findings suggest a beneficial effect of PAB in reducing pathological LV dilatation after an ischemic insult and ameliorating LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction consistent with the induction of a compensated hypertrophic phenotype in the LV.

### Diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction relies on detection of increased diastolic filling pressure, but how? [^115uGuPJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

LVEDP is elevated in all patients with increased mean LV diastolic pressure, but the reverse is not always true. Mean LV diastolic pressure can be normal with elevated LVEDP. When atrial contraction contributes significantly to LV filling, LVEDP can increase without an increase in mean LV diastolic pressure (Figure 1), which happens during an early stage of diastolic dysfunction with delayed LV relaxation resulting in a reduced LV filling during early diastole. This is the invasive correlate to grade 1 diastolic dysfunction assessed by echo‐Doppler. Grade 1 diastolic dysfunction is associated with a worse prognosis when compared with the presence of normal LV diastolic function. Thus, it is not surprising that the clinical outcomes of the patients with increased LVEDP are worse than in patients with normal values. However, hemodynamically, not all patients with increased LVEDP should be diagnosed with HFpEF. Typical examples are young patients with severe aortic regurgitation or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In these scenarios, it is not uncommon to observe large pulmonary vein atrial reversals (ie, elevated LVEDP) with normal E/e′ ratios and pulmonary pressures. Mean left atrial pressures remain normal, and the patients are asymptomatic despite the abnormal LV relaxation.

### Left ventricular hypertrophy and hypertension [^115ft7Ft]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertension (HTN) is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. The left ventricle (LV) is a primary target for HTN end-organ damage. In addition to being a marker of HTN, LV geometrical changes: concentric remodeling, concentric or eccentric LV hypertrophy (LVH) are major independent risk factors for not only CVD morbidity and mortality but also for all-cause mortality and neurological pathologies. Blood pressure control with lifestyle changes and antihypertensive agents has been demonstrated to prevent and regress LVH. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of literature on the relationship between HTN and LV geometry abnormalities with a focus on diagnosis, prognosis, pathophysiological mechanisms, and treatment approaches.

### Effects of eplerenone, enalapril, and eplerenone / enalapril in patients with essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy: the 4E-left ventricular hypertrophy study [^115wk8ah]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity correlates with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and cardiovascular risk, but the relative contributions of angiotensin II and aldosterone remain unclear. This study compared LVH regression during treatment with the selective aldosterone blocker eplerenone, enalapril, and their combination in patients with hypertension.

Methods and Results

A 9-month, double-blind, randomized study was performed in 202 patients with LVH and hypertension who received eplerenone 200 mg daily, enalapril 40 mg daily, or eplerenone 200 mg and enalapril 10 mg daily. At week 8, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg and/or amlodipine 10 mg was added if diastolic blood pressure was > 90 mm Hg. Change in left ventricular (LV) mass as assessed by MRI was the primary end point. Change in blood pressure, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system hormones, albuminuria, and safety were also assessed. Eplerenone significantly reduced LV mass from baseline (-14.5 ± 3.36 g; n = 50) similarly to enalapril (-19.7 ± 3.20 g; n = 54; P = 0.258), but eplerenone/enalapril (-27.2 ± 3.39 g; n = 49) was more effective than eplerenone alone (P = 0.007). All treatments reduced systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure from baseline (eplerenone, -23.8 and -11.9 mm Hg; enalapril, -24.7 and -13.4 mm Hg; and eplerenone/enalapril, -28.7 and -14.4 mm Hg, P = 0.048, in systolic blood pressure compared with eplerenone alone). Cough was more common with enalapril than with eplerenone (P = 0.033), and elevated potassium was more common with eplerenone.

Conclusions

Eplerenone was as effective as enalapril in LVH regression and blood pressure control. The combination of eplerenone and enalapril was more effective in reducing LV mass and systolic blood pressure than eplerenone alone.

### Losartan potassium [^112vnCMM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Hypertensive Patients with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy

The LIFE study was a multinational, double-blind study comparing losartan potassium and atenolol in 9193 hypertensive patients with ECG-documented left ventricular hypertrophy. Patients with myocardial infarction or stroke within six months prior to randomization were excluded. Patients were randomized to receive once daily losartan potassium 50 mg or atenolol 50 mg. If goal blood pressure (< 140/90 mmHg) was not reached, hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) was added first and, if needed, the dose of losartan potassium or atenolol was then increased to 100 mg once daily. If necessary, other antihypertensive treatments (e.g., increase in dose of hydrochlorothiazide therapy to 25 mg or addition of other diuretic therapy, calcium-channel blockers, alpha-blockers, or centrally acting agents, but not ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, or beta-blockers) were added to the treatment regimen to reach the goal blood pressure.

Of the randomized patients, 4963 (54%) were female and 533 (6%) were Black. The mean age was 67 with 5704 (62%) age ≥ 65. At baseline, 1195 (13%) had diabetes, 1326 (14%) had isolated systolic hypertension, 1469 (16%) had coronary heart disease, and 728 (8%) had cerebrovascular disease. Baseline mean blood pressure was 174/98 mmHg in both treatment groups. The mean length of follow-up was 4.8 years. At the end of study or at the last visit before a primary endpoint, 77% of the group treated with losartan potassium and 73% of the group treated with atenolol were still taking study medication. Of the patients still taking study medication, the mean doses of losartan potassium and atenolol were both about 80 mg/day, and 15% were taking atenolol or losartan as monotherapy, while 77% were also receiving hydrochlorothiazide (at a mean dose of 20 mg/day in each group). Blood pressure reduction measured at trough was similar for both treatment groups but blood pressure was not measured at any other time of the day. At the end of study or at the last visit before a primary endpoint, the mean blood pressures were 144.1/81.3 mmHg for the group treated with losartan potassium and 145.4/80.9 mmHg for the group treated with atenolol; the difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 1.3 mmHg was significant (p < 0.001), while the difference of 0.4 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was not significant (p = 0.098).

Diffuse interstitial fibrosis is associated with adverse outcomes in hypertensive heart disease and may be reversible. Sacubitril/valsartan could offer greater anti-fibrotic effects than valsartan alone. In the REVERSE-LVH phase 2 open-labelled trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT: 03553810; funded by the National Medical Research Council of Singapore), 78 patients with essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) were randomized 1:1 to sacubitril/valsartan or valsartan for 52 weeks. Primary endpoint was a change in interstitial volume, assessed using cardiovascular magnetic resonance. Despite similar 24-hour systolic blood pressure at 52 weeks (125 ± 11 vs. 126 ± 11 mmHg; P = 0.762), sacubitril/valsartan resulted in a greater absolute reduction in interstitial volume compared to valsartan (−5.2 ± 5.4 vs. −2.5 ± 3.1 mL; P = 0.006). Secondary endpoints showed significant differences favoring sacubitril/valsartan in LV mass, left atrial volume, estimated LV filling pressure, and improved cardiac circulating biomarkers (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and high-sensitivity troponin T). Other markers of cardiac volumes, function and mechanics were similar between the two treatment arms. Here we show the potential myocardial benefits of sacubitril/valsartan beyond blood pressure control, though larger studies are needed to confirm their clinical relevance.

### Left ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: mechanisms and treatment [^116KXpQL]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for nearly half of all heart failure cases and is characterized by phenotypical heterogeneity with a high prevalence of multiple, often overlapping cardiometabolic disorders. Comorbidities such as hypertension, obesity, or diabetes are present in many HFpEF patients and are hypothesized to contribute to adverse cardiac remodelling and myocardial fibrosis through a variety of haemodynamic and metabolic impairments, with nearly half of all HFpEF patients exhibiting left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy or concentric remodelling. Myocardial fibrosis and its surrogate changes in LV structure and geometry lead to functional impairments such as increased diastolic stiffness and elevated filling pressures and are associated with reduced exercise tolerance and poor prognosis in patients with HFpEF. Despite recent therapeutic progress, there are currently no evidence-based therapies mechanistically focusing solely on myocardial fibrosis and LV hypertrophy in HFpEF. Recognizing myocardial fibrosis and LV hypertrophy as key features of the heterogeneous HFpEF pathophysiology may contribute to the development of promising targets for future clinical trials. This review elaborates on the pathophysiological role of fibrotic remodelling and LV hypertrophy in HFpEF, outlines contemporary diagnostic standards, and discusses emerging therapeutic strategies, aiming at directly modulating myocardial fibrosis and hypertrophy in HFpEF.

### Diagnosis and management of patients with left ventricular hypertrophy: role of multimodality cardiac imaging. A scientific statement of the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^116Y21WG]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy consists in an increased LV wall thickness. LV hypertrophy can be either secondary, in response to pressure or volume overload, or primary, i.e. not explained solely by abnormal loading conditions. Primary LV hypertrophy may be due to gene mutations or to the deposition or storage of abnormal substances in the extracellular spaces or within the cardiomyocytes (more appropriately defined as pseudohypertrophy). LV hypertrophy is often a precursor to subsequent development of heart failure. Cardiovascular imaging plays a key role in the assessment of LV hypertrophy. Echocardiography, the first-line imaging technique, allows a comprehensive assessment of LV systolic and diastolic function. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance provides added value as it measures accurately LV and right ventricular volumes and mass and characterizes myocardial tissue properties, which may provide important clues to the final diagnosis. Additionally, scintigraphy with bone tracers is included in the diagnostic algorithm of cardiac amyloidosis. Once the diagnosis is established, imaging findings may help predict future disease evolution and inform therapy and follow-up. This consensus document by the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology provides an overview of the role of different cardiac imaging techniques for the differential diagnosis and management of patients with LV hypertrophy.

### The assessment of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension [^113UMVSD]. Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertension, as detected by the electrocardiogram or echocardiography, is associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity several times above and beyond the risk of hypertension alone. The LIFE (Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension) study confirmed that pharmacological agents, which reduce LVH, confer further reduction in morbidity and mortality. This makes the identification of patients with LVH all the more important. In this article we describe the various methods available to diagnose the presence of LVH in patients with hypertension, and consider their strengths and their place in clinical practice and in research.

### From left ventricular hypertrophy to congestive heart failure: management of hypertensive heart disease [^113fFgGd]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Other than age, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is the most potent predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in the hypertensive population, and is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, sudden death, heart failure and stroke. Although directly related to systolic blood pressure, other factors including age, sex, race, body mass index and stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems play an important role in the pathogenesis of LVH. LVH involves changes in myocardial tissue architecture consisting of perivascular and myocardial fibrosis and medial thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries, in addition to myocyte hypertrophy. The physiologic alterations which occur as a result of these anatomical changes include disturbances of myocardial blood flow, the development of an arrhythmogenic myocardial substrate and diastolic dysfunction. The latter is directly related to the degree of myocardial fibrosis and is the hemodynamic hallmark of hypertensive heart disease. When diastolic dysfunction is present, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increases out-of-proportion to volume and may be elevated at rest or with exertion leading to clinical heart failure. At least one third of heart failure patients in the United States can be considered to have heart failure related to diastolic dysfunction. Compared to heart failure patients with systolic dysfunction, diastolic heart failure patients are more likely to be older, female, and to be hypertensive at the time of presentation. Although it has been assumed that LVH may lead to systolic dysfunction, evidence is lacking that LVH resulting from hypertension is a major risk factor for systolic heart failure independent of coronary artery disease. Treatment of hypertension greatly attenuates the development of LVH and significantly decreases the incidence of heart failure. In patients with established LVH, regression is both possible and desirable and results in a significant reduction in adverse clinical endpoints.

### The role of blood pressure, body weight and fat distribution on left ventricular mass, diastolic function and cardiac geometry in children [^117MoxSk]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension and obesity in childhood are related to early cardiac damage, as left ventricular hypertrophy. Few studies have analyzed the independent effects of hypertension and weight excess on diastolic function and left ventricular geometry.

Objective

We studied the effects of weight, waist circumference (as an index of fat distribution) and blood pressure on left ventricular mass index, the risk of left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic function and left ventricular geometry in 526 children (237 girls, age range 6–15 years).

Methods

Children were divided into normotensive, prehypertensive and hypertensive (US Nomograms) groups, and into normal-weight, overweight, and obese (International Obesity Task Force classification) groups. Left ventricular mass index, diastolic function and left ventricular geometry were assessed.

Results

SBP z-scores and blood pressure categories significantly influenced cardiac mass (P < 0.001 and P = 0.02, respectively) and the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively). Obesity, BMI, and waist circumference z-scores were significantly associated with an increment in E/Em ratio (P < 0.001, P < 0.01, and P < 0.01, respectively). Increasing blood pressure values and the presence of prehypertension (P < 0.05) and hypertension (P < 0.003), but not weight excess, were associated with concentric cardiac remodeling. In contrast, concentric hypertrophy was associated with hypertension (P < 0.01), obesity (P < 0.001), and increasing waist circumference (P < 001).

Conclusions

Blood pressure values and hypertension are independently associated with an increase of cardiac mass and the presence of cardiac hypertrophy. Obesity and waist circumference, but not hypertension, are associated with a worsening of diastolic function, whereas only hypertensive children show high prevalence of concentric remodeling. Blood pressure and body weight and fat distribution have an independent and different impact on left ventricular structure and function in children.

### Left ventricular hypertrophy and clinical outcomes in hypertensive patients [^1151nXsg]. American Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

The prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) rises with severity of hypertension (HT), age, and obesity. Its prevalence ranges from 20% in mildly hypertensive patients to almost 100% in those with severe or complicated HT. However, the diagnosis of LVH is not straightforward, and the definitions and criteria used in clinical studies lack consistency. While many factors play a role in the onset and progression of LVH, blood pressure (BP) is recognized as a central factor. Twenty-four-hour BP measurements are more closely related to LVH than conventional BP readings taken in the clinician's office. Increased renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity also plays an important role in the development of LVH, and various studies show a correlation between plasma renin activity and left ventricular mass (LVM). LVH is a recognized marker of HT-related target organ damage, and a strong and independent risk factor for adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. CV risk increases with increasing LVM, and decreases with regression of LVH in response to antihypertensive treatment. Therefore the detection, prevention, and reversal of LVH are important goals in HT management. Most antihypertensive drugs can attenuate BP and LVH. However, each drug class may induce LVH regression to a different extent and these extents seldom correlate with the degree of BP reduction achieved. Data from the few large comparative studies in this area suggest that certain classes of antihypertensive drugs and/or their combinations are more effective than others. In particular, calcium channel blockers and drugs that target the RAS, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), appear to have a specific effect on LVH, independent of BP reduction. Guidelines, therefore, have recommended these drug classes for the treatment of hypertensive patients with LVH.

### Effects of carvedilol on left ventricular function, mass, and scintigraphic findings in isolated left ventricular non-compaction [^114JaNar]. Heart (2001). Low credibility.

A four month old infant with isolated left ventricular non-compaction was treated with carvedilol. Haemodynamic studies and various types of imaging-including echocardiography, radiographic angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and single photon emission computed tomography with (201)Tl, (123)I-beta-methyliodophenylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP), and (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG)-were performed before and 14 months after treatment. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 30% to 57%, and left ventricular end diastolic volume, end systolic volume, and end diastolic pressure showed striking reductions during treatment. Left ventricular mass decreased to about two thirds of the baseline value after treatment. Per cent wall thickening increased after carvedilol in the segments corresponding to non-compacted myocardium. A mismatch between (201)Tl and BMIPP uptake in the area of non-compaction observed before carvedilol disappeared after treatment. Impaired sympathetic neuronal function shown by MIBG recovered after treatment. Thus carvedilol had beneficial effects on left ventricular function, hypertrophy, and both metabolic and adrenergic abnormalities in isolated left ventricular non-compaction.

Left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension — regression and prevalence. LV hypertrophy represents an important end-organ consequence of hypertension and therefore LVH has been proposed as a surrogate marker of outcome, with LVH shown to be reversed or prevented by a variety of haemodynamic, non-haemodynamic, and pharmacological factors; however, hypertrophy occurs in 36–41% of hypertensive subjects, but hypertension is not the only cause of this problem.

### Is hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy a cause of sustained ventricular arrhythmias in humans? [^111eepsE]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims and hypothesis

The aim of this review was to assess whether systemic hypertension in combination with LVH is an independent risk factor for VAs in those without established CAD. We hypothesised that hypertensive heart disease on its own does not contribute to the risk of VAs or SCD. We therefore reviewed the published literature on hypertension and VAs and critically appraised the data to determine whether hypertensive LVH on its own causes VAs.

### BP control and left ventricular hypertrophy regression in children with CKD [^113Rwb5R]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

In adult patients with CKD, hypertension is linked to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, but whether this association exists in children with CKD has not been determined conclusively. To assess the relationship between BP and left ventricular hypertrophy, we prospectively analyzed data from the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children cohort. In total, 478 subjects were enrolled, and 435, 321, and 142 subjects remained enrolled at years 1, 3, and 5, respectively. Echocardiograms were obtained 1 year after study entry and then every 2 years; BP was measured annually. A linear mixed model was used to assess the effect of BP on left ventricular mass index, which was measured at three different visits, and a mixed logistic model was used to assess left ventricular hypertrophy. These models were part of a joint longitudinal and survival model to adjust for informative dropout. Predictors of left ventricular mass index included systolic BP, anemia, and use of antihypertensive medications other than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Predictors of left ventricular hypertrophy included systolic BP, female sex, anemia, and use of other antihypertensive medications. Over 4 years, the adjusted prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy decreased from 15.3% to 12.6% in a systolic BP model and from 15.1% to 12.6% in a diastolic BP model. These results indicate that a decline in BP may predict a decline in left ventricular hypertrophy in children with CKD and suggest additional factors that warrant additional investigation as predictors of left ventricular hypertrophy in these patients.

### Prevention of heart failure in hypertension-disentangling the role of evolving left ventricular hypertrophy and blood pressure lowering: the ALLHAT study [^1165sWjY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension (HTN) is a major risk factor for heart failure (HF). 1 HTN triggers cardiac remodeling and development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), leading to subclinical organ damage, which evolves to clinically manifest HF and, ultimately, to death. 2 The beneficial effect of antihypertensive treatment on HF risk is well known 3 and reflected in the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults. 4 HTN treatment is associated with an ≈20% to 25% reduction in risk of incident HF. 5

ALLHAT (the Antihypertensive and Lipid‐Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) 6 was a multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, active‐controlled trial designed to compare cardiovascular outcomes in high‐risk antihypertensive patients assigned to the angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril, the calcium channel blocker amlodipine, and the α‐blocker doxazosin, in comparison to a thiazide‐type diuretic (chlorthalidone). Incident HF was a prespecified ALLHAT outcome. The rationale for the ALLHAT hypothesis was based on the previous demonstrations that angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers are more effective than diuretics in reducing left ventricular (LV) mass index measured by echocardiography. 7 Contrary to expectations, the ALLHAT showed that chlorthalidone was superior to amlodipine, lisinopril, and doxazosin in preventing HF. 8, 9 The subsequent ALLHAT HF validation study reinforced the original ALLHAT results. 10, 11, 12

Although ALLHAT answered questions about the comparative effectiveness of antihypertensive treatments for HF prevention, the mechanisms behind this HF prevention remain incompletely understood. The extent to which the effect of a calcium channel blocker, an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor, and an α‐blocker (as compared with a diuretic) on incident HF is mediated by evolving LVH and blood pressure (BP) lowering per se remains unknown. This study aimed to quantify the extent to which the effects of lisinopril, amlodipine, and doxazosin (as compared with chlorthalidone) on incident HF are mediated by evolving LVH and BP lowering. We hypothesized that evolving ECG LVH and BP lowering are mechanisms behind previously observed differences in the rate of incident HF in hypertensive ALLHAT participants randomized to lisinopril, amlodipine, and doxazosin in comparison to those randomized to chlorthalidone.

### Effects of acute left ventricular unloading on right ventricular function in normal and chronic right ventricular pressure-overloaded lambs [^1126Yoa7]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Right ventricular pressure overload occurs in several types of (congenital) heart disease, as well as in pulmonary disease. Clinical outcome in some of these patient groups might in part be related to left ventricular loading conditions. The effects of left ventricular unloading on the function of the hypertrophic right ventricle have not been studied. We aimed to study the effects of left ventricular unloading on right ventricular hemodynamics and contractility in an animal model of chronic right ventricular pressure overload.

Methods

In lambs the pulmonary artery was chronically banded to increase right ventricular pressure to systemic levels. After 8 weeks, right ventricular contractility and hemodynamic function were assessed in these lambs, as well as in age-matched control animals, by using a combined pressure-conductance catheter in the right ventricle during baseline conditions and during complete bypass of the left ventricle.

Results

In both groups acute left ventricular unloading significantly decreased left ventricular pressure to low levels while aortic pressure was maintained. In the right ventricle of the control group, both end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes increased with left ventricular unloading (P < .01) while end-systolic pressure was maintained. Cardiac output was unchanged despite decreased right ventricular contractility. In the banding group acute left ventricular unloading also decreased right ventricular contractility but increased cardiac output. During acute left ventricular unloading, diastolic stiffness was unchanged in the control group, whereas it was significantly decreased in the banding group.

Conclusions

Both in normal hearts and in hearts subject to chronic right ventricular pressure overload, acute left ventricular unloading decreases right ventricular contractility. Although no effects on cardiac output are encountered in normal hearts during left ventricular bypass, cardiac output is improved in right ventricular pressure-overloaded hearts, most likely related to improved right ventricular diastolic compliance.

### Left ventricular hypertrophy and angiotensin II antagonists [^113mgprb]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with hypertension is an important condition. It is associated with significant mortality and carries increased risk for developing nonfatal cardiovascular complications, including coronary heart disease. The pathogenesis of left ventricular hypertrophy is linked to activation of the renin-angiotensin system, with excessive production of angiotensin II believed to be responsible. The therapeutic benefit of blocking angiotensin II at the receptor with selective angiotensin II antagonists, a relatively new class of antihypertensive agents, is therefore considered for regression of left ventricular hypertrophy. Clinical evidence shows significant efficacy in reversing left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients after treatment with angiotensin II antagonists. Published data include open-label and randomized studies with losartan treatment for left ventricular hypertrophy, with fewer studies investigating the effects of valsartan, irbesartan, and candesartan.

### Impact of long-term burden of body mass index and blood pressure from childhood on adult left ventricular structure and function [^115GdjeH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Echocardiographic LV Structure and Function Measurements

LV structure and function were assessed by 2‐dimensional guided M‐mode, Doppler and tissue Doppler echocardiography measurements with 2.25‐ and 3.5‐MHz transducers according to American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) recommendations. 17 Parasternal long‐ and short‐axis views were collected for measuring LV end‐diastolic and end‐systolic measurements in duplicate, and the mean was calculated.

LV mass (LVM) was calculated from a necropsy‐validated formula on the basis of a thick‐wall prolate ellipsoidal geometry. 18 To take body size into account, LVM was indexed for body height (m 2.7) as LVM index (LVMI). LV relative wall thickness (RWT) was calculated as septal wall thickness plus posterior wall thickness divided by LV end‐diastolic diameter. 19 The presence of LVH was defined by LVMI > 46.7 g/m 2.7 in women and > 49.2 g/m 2.7 in men; LV geometry was considered concentric when RWT was > 0.42. 20 Four patterns of LV geometry were defined: (1) normal LV geometry (normal RWT with no LVH), (2) concentric remodeling (increased RWT but no LVH), (3) eccentric hypertrophy (EH; normal RWT with LVH), and (4) concentric hypertrophy (CH; increased RWT with LVH). 19, 20, 21, 22

LV systolic function was evaluated by LV ejection fraction (LVEF), which was calculated using the modified Simpson rule from LV end‐diastolic volume and LV end‐systolic volume obtained from the apical 4‐chamber view based on ASE recommendations. 23 LV diastolic function was evaluated using E/A and E/e′ ratios, which were measured by pulsed‐wave Doppler and pulsed‐wave tissue Doppler imaging. Peak velocities of the early phase (E) and late phase (A) at the level of mitral valve leaflet tips were assessed by pulsed‐wave Doppler and the E/A ratio was calculated. Using tissue Doppler imaging, early peak diastolic mitral annular velocity (e′) was measured from the average of the septal and lateral tissue velocities in the apical 4‐chamber view. The E/e′ ratio was calculated as an index of LV filling pressures. 24

### Long-term cardiac effects of adrenalectomy or mineralocorticoid antagonists in patients with primary aldosteronism [^112W5dvs]. Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Exposure to excess aldosterone results in cardiac damage in hypertensive states. We evaluated the long-term cardiac structural and functional evolution in patients with primary aldosteronism after surgical or medical treatment. Fifty-four patients with primary aldosteronism were enrolled in a prospective study and were followed for a mean of 6.4 years after treatment with adrenalectomy (n = 24) or spironolactone (n = 30). At baseline, echocardiographic measurements of patients with primary aldosteronism were compared with those of 274 patients with essential hypertension. Patients with primary aldosteronism had greater left ventricular mass, more prevalent left ventricular hypertrophy, lower early:late-wave diastolic filling velocities ratio, and longer deceleration time than patients with essential hypertension but no differences in relative wall thickness and systolic function. During follow-up, average blood pressure was 135/82 and 137/82 mm Hg in patients treated with adrenalectomy and spironolactone, respectively. In the initial 1-year period, left ventricular mass decreased significantly only in adrenalectomized patients. Subsequent changes in left ventricular mass were greater in patients treated with spironolactone, with an overall change from baseline to the end of follow-up that was comparable in the 2 groups. Prevalence of hypertrophy decreased in both treatment groups, whereas diastolic parameters had only mild and nonsignificant improvement. Changes in blood pressure and pretreatment plasma aldosterone were independent predictors of left ventricular mass decrease in both treatment groups. Thus, in the long-term, both adrenalectomy and spironolactone are effective in reducing left ventricular mass in patients with primary aldosteronism, with effects that are partially independent of blood pressure changes.

Ventricular pressure–volume loops

To remove and control the influence of changes in preload and afterload, several groups of investigators studied isolated perfused hearts with loading conditions controlled using servo systems. Starling's very early work demonstrated that increasing end-diastolic pressure and volume increased stroke volume. The effect of afterload was considered next. Weber, Janicki, and colleagues found that stroke volume decreased linearly with increasing end-systolic pressure. Suga, Sagawa, and colleagues put these concepts together within a ventricular pressure–volume diagram (Fig. 3) which illustrates the pressure–volume trajectory of the left ventricle throughout the cardiac cycle and, in particular, illustrates the effect of altered preload and altered afterload. The key feature is that, at the same contractile state, all contractions end on the same end-systolic pressure–volume relationship (ESPVR).

Left ventricular pressure volume relationships. A cardiac cycle is illustrated by the loop labeled as "a", "b", "c", and "d". ESPVR end-systolic pressure–volume relationship, LV left ventricular

Figure 3 illustrates that during diastole the heart fills at quite low pressures along the normally compliant diastolic pressure–volume relationship of the ventricle (labeled "a"). With the onset of isovolumic systole the ventricle contracts, raising intraventricular pressure at constant volume (in the absence of regurgitant valvular heart disease; labeled "b"). When ventricular pressure exceeds aortic pressure the aortic valve opens and ejection occurs (labeled "c") and continues to an end-systolic pressure–volume point that lies on the ESPVR. Intraventricular pressure decreases during the isovolumic relaxation phase (labeled "d") and the cardiac cycle starts again.

Pericardial Resection

Constrictive pericarditis is commonly treated surgically via pericardial excision, and in 2017, it was suggested that minimally invasive pericardial resection could probably become a promising strategy for treating HFpEF. Currently, there are still relatively few studies related to this approach, with only animal experimental evidence that in both healthy canines and a porcine model with characteristics of HFpEF, pericardial excision using a subxiphoid method promotes improvement of left ventricular diastolic function. In both normal dogs and a porcine model with characteristics of HFpEF, pericardiotomy using a minimally invasive subxiphoid approach with the chest intact improves left ventricular diastolic reserve during saline loading. Elevated left ventricular filling pressure is a major feature of HFpEF, while during cardiac diastole, most of the pressure in the left atrium can be attributed to the pressure in the pericardium and the squeezing effect from the right heart. Based on these ideas, pericardial constraints may be removed to improve exercise hemodynamics in HFpEF. Our conjecture about the potential mechanism, informed by relevant studies, is illustrated in the accompanying figure. We propose that in HFpEF, diverse etiologies contribute to a spectrum of pathophysiological changes. These changes include myocardial hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension and diastolic dysfunction. Pericardial resection, by alleviating ventricular compression, may reduce elevated end-diastolic ventricular filling pressures. Such a reduction has the potential to mitigate the consequences of these pressures, such as pulmonary venous congestion, which can lead to symptoms like dyspnea, as well as complications including atrial fibrillation and compromised right ventricular function. In addition, studies have also shown an improvement in exercise-induced increases in output per beat, cardiac output and maximal exercise capacity in normal animals after pericardiotomy. These studies suggest that, with a minimally invasive surgical approach and safe prognostic performance, pericardiotomy may be a promising potential nonpharmacological treatment for HFpEF. Nevertheless, research on this treatment is currently limited to a few animal studies, as animal models of HFpEF simulate only some features of HFpEF, including elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, hypertension, oxidative stress and coronary microvascular dysfunction, – which may not be representative of actual clinical patient outcomes, and experiments have used saline loading to simulate left ventricular filling. The results of the study are still unclear as to whether pericardial resection in clinical HFpEF patients can actually reduce LV filling pressures and thus lead to improvements in indicators such as exercise capacity and dyspnea status, as well as the long-term safety of this surgical approach, and more in-depth studies are urgently needed to determine this (Figure 7).

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — assessment of left ventricular (LV) diastolic function and filling pressures is recommended using a comprehensive approach that includes E/e' ratio, left atrial (LA) volume index, pulmonary vein atrial reversal velocity, and peak velocity of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet by continuous-wave (CW) Doppler; individual variables alone have modest correlations with LV filling pressures, while 2D and Doppler indices provide incremental prognostic information, with septal E/e' predicting adverse outcomes in children and similar adverse associations in adults (enlarged LA, abnormal diastolic function by E/e', or restrictive LV filling).

### Effect of adjustable passive constraint on the failing left ventricle: a finite-element model study [^113gvVLg]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Passive constraint is used to prevent left ventricular dilation and subsequent remodeling. However, there has been concern about the effect of passive constraint on diastolic left ventricular chamber stiffness and pump function. This study determined the relationship between constraint, diastolic wall stress, chamber stiffness, and pump function. We tested the hypothesis that passive constraint at 3 mm Hg reduces wall stress with minimal change in pump function.

Methods

A three-dimensional finite-element model of the globally dilated left ventricle based on left ventricular dimensions obtained in dogs that had undergone serial intracoronary microsphere injection was created. The model was adjusted to match experimentally observed end-diastolic left ventricular volume and midventricular wall thickness. The experimental results used to create the model were previously reported. A pressure of 3, 5, 7, and 9 mm Hg was applied to the epicardium. Fiber stress, end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship, end-systolic pressure-volume relationship, and the stroke volume-end-diastolic pressure (Starling) relationship were calculated.

Results

As epicardial constraint pressure increased, fiber stress decreased, the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship shifted to the left, and the Starling relationship shifted down and to the right. The end-systolic pressure-volume relationship did not change. A constraining pressure of 2.3 mm Hg was associated with a 10% reduction in stroke volume, and mean end-diastolic fiber stress was reduced by 18.3% (inner wall), 15.3% (mid wall), and 14.2% (outer wall).

Conclusions

Both stress and cardiac output decrease in a linear fashion as the amount of passive constraint is increased. If the reduction in cardiac output is to be less than 10%, passive constraint should not exceed 2.3 mm Hg. On the other hand, this amount of constraint may be sufficient to reverse eccentric hypertrophy after myocardial infarction.

Effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors on cardiac function

SGLT-2 inhibitors have also been shown to improve cardiac function in diabetic cardiomyopathy models and myocardial ischemic models of mice and rats as summarized in Table 3. In genetic diabetic mice, 8-week treatment of dapagliflozin improved ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening. It also attenuated the increase in end-systolic volume (ESV), end-diastolic volume (EDV), interventricular septal thickness in systole and diastole. Dapagliflozin also improved the E/A (early/late diastolic) ratio, EF, isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), deceleration time (DT) and end diastolic wall thickness (EDWT) in a diabetic non-obese mouse model. These reports indicated that dapagliflozin could improve both systolic and diastolic LV function in diabetic mice.

### Lack of reduction of left ventricular mass in treated hypertension: the strong heart study [^1169EViG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Clinical trials almost invariably indicate that reduction of hypertensive left ventricular mass (LVM) is an achievable goal during antihypertensive management – and that this reduction results in a decreased incidence of cardiovascular (CV) events, – independently of reduction in blood pressure (BP) and other factors that decrease CV risk. However, the translation of these findings into clinical practice is made difficult by a number of critical issues, including selection of patients, definition of hypertensive LV hypertrophy (LVH), and relation to BP control. There are also issues related to the standardized trial environment, which is not automatically reproducible in real life clinical practice; thus observational studies are sometimes needed to assess the applicability of randomized study findings to the general population. –

The reduction of LVM reported in randomized clinical trials is variable in relation to selected populations, type of medication, duration of trial, and type of design, but can be estimated to be 8% to 14% over 2 to 48 months of treatment. Whether such an effective reduction of LVM can be achieved in usual clinical contexts or in unselected free‐living populations is often assumed, but remains to be proven. Accordingly, this analysis has been designed to compare changes in LVM over a 4‐year follow‐up in the unselected cohort of treated hypertensive participants in the Strong Heart Study (SHS), and to identify predictors of modifications in LVM.

### Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^11314jCT]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy:

- **Definition**: HCM is a genetic disorder characterized by LVH and a non-dilated left ventricle with preserved or increased ejection fraction.
- **Pathophysiology**: HCM is most frequently caused by genetic mutations in genes (β-myosin heavy chain [MYH7] and myosin binding protein C [MYBPC3]) encoding sarcomere proteins. LVH leads to diastolic dysfunction, reduced systolic output volume, decreased peripheral and myocardial perfusion, cardiac arrhythmia and/or HF and finally increased risk of SCD.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of HCM in the US is low, with an estimated 200 cases per 100,000 population. HCM incidence is bimodal (peak incidence in the second decade and third decade of life).
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include symptoms due to increased LV end-diastolic pressure (exertional dyspnea, exercise intolerance, orthopnea, peripheral edema, and HFpEF), LV outflow obstruction (exertional or immediately post-exertional syncope, ventricular arrhythmia), chest pain, palpitations, VT. Disease progression may lead to AF, hypertension, valvular disease, HF, and SCD.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: HCM is associated with an annual mortality rate of 0.5%, and mortality is higher in children. However, SCD is often the first clinical manifestation.

### Left ventricular failure produces profound lung remodeling and pulmonary hypertension in mice: heart failure causes severe lung disease [^114sNQuX]. Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic left ventricular failure causes pulmonary congestion with increased lung weight and type 2 pulmonary hypertension. Understanding the molecular mechanisms for type 2 pulmonary hypertension and the development of novel treatments for this condition requires a robust experimental animal model and a good understanding of the nature of the resultant pulmonary remodeling. Here we demonstrate that chronic transverse aortic constriction causes massive pulmonary fibrosis and remodeling, as well as type 2 pulmonary hypertension, in mice. Thus, aortic constriction-induced left ventricular dysfunction and increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure are associated with a ≤ 5.3-fold increase in lung wet weight and dry weight, pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Interestingly, the aortic constriction-induced increase in lung weight was not associated with pulmonary edema but resulted from profound pulmonary remodeling with a dramatic increase in the percentage of fully muscularized lung vessels, marked vascular and lung fibrosis, myofibroblast proliferation, and leukocyte infiltration. The aortic constriction-induced left ventricular dysfunction was also associated with right ventricular hypertrophy, increased right ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and right atrial hypertrophy. The massive lung fibrosis, leukocyte infiltration, and pulmonary hypertension in mice after transverse aortic constriction clearly indicate that congestive heart failure also causes severe lung disease. The lung fibrosis and leukocyte infiltration may be important mechanisms in the poor clinical outcome in patients with end-stage heart failure. Thus, the effective treatment of left ventricular failure may require additional efforts to reduce lung fibrosis and the inflammatory response.

### Associations of left ventricular structure and function with blood pressure in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: analysis of the TOPCAT trial [^116ANpgj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Similar mechanisms as currently described might also be at play in the early stages of LV dysfunction. Indeed, heart failure is a progressive condition that begins with risk factors for LV dysfunction (eg, hypertension), proceeds to asymptomatic changes in cardiac structure (eg, LV hypertrophy) and function (eg, impaired LV relaxation), and then evolves into clinically overt heart failure, disability, and death. 27 The 5‐year mortality rate of symptomatic heart failure is ≈60%. 28 Diastolic heart failure is characterized by slow LV relaxation, increased LV stiffness, increased interstitial deposition of collagen, and modified extracellular matrix proteins. 21 Diastolic heart failure accounts for 40% to 50% of all heart failure cases and has a prognosis as ominous as systolic heart failure. 21 In randomly recruited European population samples, the frequency of asymptomatic echocardiographically diagnosed diastolic LV dysfunction (early stage) is as high as 27%, 29, 30 with a 5‐year progression rate of 10%, 31 resulting in 22.5 hospitalization days per 1000 citizens (2017). Over a 5‐ to 8‐year horizon, both diastolic 32 and systolic 33 LV dysfunction predict the incidence of cardiovascular complications. Along similar lines, electrocardiographic 34 and echocardiographic 35 LV hypertrophy predict fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular outcomes.

### Is electrocardiography-left ventricular hypertrophy an obsolete marker for determining heart failure risk with hypertension? [^113uoTcX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The results from Johnson et al 2 offer new insights indicating how much we still do not understand about the complex underlying pathophysiology leading to HF and the importance of addressing not only BP control, but also other potential contributors to HF. At this time, routine imaging evaluation of LVH is not recommended because of limited data on the cost‐effectiveness for risk classification and management 1; in fact, routine evaluation of hypertension with echocardiogram received a score of 3 on the Appropriate Use Criteria from 2011, considering it inappropriate. 20 Contrarily, imaging can be helpful in young individuals, those with secondary hypertension, uncontrolled hypertension, or HF symptoms. 1

For curtailing the persistent morbidity and mortality because of uncontrolled hypertension, the most prevalent and potent CVD risk factor, some questions related to LVH determination remain unanswered. Future research should help clarify whether beyond ECG‐LVH measurements, screening for LVH with echocardiogram, or even CMR, in patients with hypertension is useful, how we can adjust for factors that affect accuracy, and what is the best way and time to follow up and approach these patients therapeutically.

### Effect of cilnidipine on left ventricular function in hypertensive patients as assessed by tissue Doppler tei index [^117WqVqY]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Tissue Doppler Tei index is pointed to be more effective in the evaluation of global cardiac function than systolic and diastolic measurements alone in various heart diseases. This study was designed to assess the effect of cilnidipine on left ventricular function in hypertensive patients by using this index. A group of 40 hypertensives (mean age 55 ± 8 years, range: 35–65) and 16 controls (mean age 52 ± 9 years, range: 36–65) were included. Hypertensives were classified into non-left ventricular hypertrophy (NLVH) group (25 patients) and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) group (15 patients), and treated with cilnidipine for 2 months. Before and after treatment, the participants were examined by echocardiography. Tissue Doppler Tei index was calculated as diastolic time interval measured from end of late diastole to origin of early diastole (a') minus systolic Sm duration (b') divided by b', that is Tei index = (a'-b')/b'. Thirty-seven hypertensive patients finished the treatment. Tei index was significantly higher in NLVH and LVH groups than in control group, and in LVH group than in NLVH group (0.44 ± 0.07 vs 0.28 ± 0.06, P < 0.001; 0.51 ± 0.13 vs 0.28 ± 0.06, P < 0.001; 0.51 ± 0.13 vs 0.44 ± 0.07, P < 0.05). After treatment, Tei index was significantly decreased (0.40 ± 0.11 vs 0.46 ± 0.10, P < 0.0001); systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were also decreased significantly. In conclusion, Tei index is impaired in hypertensives before development of ventricular hypertrophy and impairment is more prominent in hypertrophy. Cilnidipine can improve left ventricular function. Tissue Doppler Tei index is gaining importance in evaluating LV function after drug intervention in hypertensive patients.

### A novel mechanism of heart failure with normal ejection fraction [^111GiMGm]. Heart (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with heart failure and a normal left ventricular ejection fraction have significantly reduced left ventricular long-axis function. This paper proposes an explanation for this apparent paradox and suggests a new mechanism of "diastolic" heart failure.

Method

The effect of changes in left ventricular hypertrophy on stroke volume and ejection fraction in non-dilated left ventricles was calculated using the area-length method. Further, the effect of a reduction in long-axis shortening on these parameters was determined.

Results

Increasing left ventricular hypertrophy resulted in augmentation of systolic wall thickening and ejection fraction but not stroke volume when long-axis shortening was normal. In the presence of abnormal long-axis function, stroke volume was reduced but ejection fraction was preserved.

Conclusion

The model predicts that the normal ejection fraction in patients with heart failure may be explained by the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy. The resulting amplified radial thickening in the setting of reduced long-axis shortening explains the preservation of ejection fraction. The reduced stroke volume in the precompensated state rather than diastolic dysfunction may be the cause of heart failure.

### Irbesartan and atenolol improve diastolic function in patients with hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy [^117UThNs]. Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives and Design

An abnormal diastolic filling is common in hypertensive left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, a condition that may lead to heart failure and death. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has been implicated in the development of LV hypertrophy. This study examines the effects of 48 weeks of double-blind treatment with the AT1 receptor blocker irbesartan and the beta-blocker atenolol on diastolic function.

Methods

Diastolic function was evaluated in 115 hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy by Doppler echocardiography mitral inflow velocities calculated from the peak of early (E) and peak of late (A) diastolic velocities (E/A ratio), the E-wave deceleration time, the isovolumic relaxation time, the pulmonary venous flow velocity, and by the atrioventricular valve plane displacement method.

Results

By similar reductions in blood pressure both groups progressively reduced the LV mass index, with a greater reduction in the irbesartan group (P = 0.024). Diastolic function was improved similarly by irbesartan and atenolol; for example, the E/A ratio by 12 and 14% (P = 0.022 and P < 0.001), and the pulmonary venous flow velocity by 10 and 7% (P = 0.036 and P = 0.001), respectively. The isovolumic relaxation time was improved by irbesartan (P = 0.040) only, and was related to changes in LV geometry (P < 0.001). For atenolol, improvement in diastolic function was associated only with the reduction in blood pressure (P = 0.048). An improvement in diastolic function appeared greater in concentric LV hypertrophy than in eccentric LV hypertrophy.

Conclusions

Treatment based on atenolol or irbesartan improves diastolic function in patients with hypertensive LV hypertrophy to the same degree, but through different mechanisms.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and arrhythmias: a meta-analysis of 38 randomized controlled trials [^116QoEoH]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

SGLT2i have been widely acknowledged for their cardioprotective properties, which can be attributed to a range of interconnected pathways that may collectively reduce the risk of SCD. These pathways involve multiple mechanisms: firstly, the induction of hemodynamic effects leading to plasma volume contraction and subsequent blood pressure reduction, which effectively lessens both preload and afterload on the heart. Secondly, the inhibition of sodium-hydrogen exchange within myocardial cells has been associated with mitigating myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, adverse remodeling, systolic dysfunction, and HF. Lastly, there is the potential for suppressing the sympathetic nervous system, adding to the overall cardioprotective impact of SGLT2i. Altogether, these intricate mechanisms underscore the considerable cardioprotective benefits of SGLT2i, offering a promising avenue for decreasing the incidence of SCD.

Our study showed that the use of SGLT2i did not result in a significant difference in the incidence of VAs. This may be due to a small number of studies; hence, reflecting a lack of power rather than a lack of effect. It has been established that left ventricular volumes, both end-diastolic and end-systolic, serve as surrogate indicators for unfavorable ventricular remodeling in HF, showing a strong correlation with the efficacy of specific drug or device therapies on patient survival. Furthermore, RCTs on mortality suggest a higher likelihood of neutral or favorable effects with increasing mean left ventricular ejection fraction. As a result, it is reasonable to speculate that the impact of SGLT2i therapy on left ventricular end-diastolic volume and left ventricular ejection fraction may not be substantial. Consequently, its potential as an anti-arrhythmic agent for VAs might be relatively modest overall. Nevertheless, further rigorously designed clinical studies with ample statistical power and extended follow-up periods are imperative to draw definitive conclusions regarding the potential reduction of VA incidence by SGLT2is.

### Hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy risk: beyond adaptive cardiomyocytic hypertrophy [^117ALDdZ]. Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

The heart is a remarkably adaptive organ, capable of increasing its minute output and overcoming short-term or prolonged pressure overload. The structural response, in addition to the foregoing functional demands, is that of myocardial hypertrophy. Then, why should an adaptive response increase cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)? Evidence shows that the functional performance of hypertrophied cardiomyocytes is impaired, and that additional alterations develop in cardiomyocytes themselves, the extracellular matrix and the intramyocardial vasculature, leading to myocardial remodelling and providing the basis for the adverse prognosis associated with pathological LVH in hypertensive patients (i.e., hypertensive heart disease, HHD). As molecular information accumulates, the pathophysiological understanding and the clinical approach to HHD are changing. The time has come to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies aimed at improving the prognosis of HHD on the basis of reversing or even preventing the aforementioned changes in the ventricular myocardium.

### Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor simvastatin prevents cardiac hypertrophy induced by pressure overload and inhibits p21ras activation [^1143bJhB]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with cardiac hypertrophy are at increased cardiovascular risk. It has been hypothesized that hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors may exert beneficial effects other than their cholesterol-lowering actions. The aims of the study were to assess the in vivo effects of simvastatin (SIM) on cardiac hypertrophy and on Ras signaling in rats with ascending aorta banding.

Methods and Results

Wistar rats were randomized to receive either treatment with SIM or placebo, and then short-term (group I) and long-term (group II) left ventricular pressure overload was performed by placing a tantalum clip on ascending aorta. At the end of treatment period, left and right ventricular weight, body weight, and tibial length were measured and echocardiographic evaluations were performed. Ras signaling was investigated by analyzing Ras membrane localization and activation, ERK2 phosphorylation, and p27(kip1) and cdk4 levels. In SIM-treated rats, a significant reduction of left ventricular weight/body weight, echocardiographic left ventricular mass, and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and end-diastolic pressure was found. In rats with pressure overload, SIM treatment significantly reduced Ras membrane targeting, Ras in vivo activation, ERK2 phosphorylation, and the ratio cdk4/p27(kip1).

Conclusions

HMG CoA inhibitor SIM inhibits in vivo Ras signaling and prevents left ventricular hypertrophy development in aortic-banded animals.

### Lean mass in childhood obesity: a key determinant of ventricular mass? [^1129yXRV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Hemodynamic Effects and Morphologic Adaptation to Obesity

Theories for the hemodynamic implications of being overweight or obese predate the era of noninvasive imaging, but our understanding has evolved. At one time, it was thought that obesity directly opposed the effects of essential hypertension and that concentric myocardial hypertrophy in obesity was only possible with concurrent hypertension. 6 In fact, an increased circulating blood volume is required to perfuse greater body mass, thereby increasing preload and stroke volume. With a larger vascular bed and increased cardiac output also comes lower systemic vascular resistance. However, initial conclusions that these effects would result in purely eccentric hypertrophy with predominant ventricular dilation have been modified.

The use of cardiac MRI to provide accurate and reproducible cardiac volumetric and functional assessment has significantly advanced the study of morphologic adaptations to obesity. Without the limitations of echocardiography in obese patients, even small‐scale use of cardiac MRI demonstrated significant elevations in both left and right ventricular mass, end‐diastolic volume, and cardiac output. 7 The MESA (Multi‐Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) applied cardiac MRI on a large scale to > 5000 adult subjects and found that the morphology of left ventricular hypertrophy was independently associated with incident outcomes. 8 Specifically, concentric hypertrophy with a greater left ventricular mass to volume ratio was associated with coronary heart disease and stroke. Further evaluation of the obese cohort in the MESA study found a positive association between left ventricular mass to volume ratio and all measures of obesity. 9 Interestingly, though left ventricular systolic function was preserved, the MESA study demonstrated decreased right ventricular ejection fraction in overweight and obese patients. 10 This finding was confirmed by Toemen et al 4 and raises interesting questions regarding the unique susceptibility of the ill‐prepared right ventricle to the hemodynamic challenges of obesity.

### Recommendations on the use of echocardiography in adult hypertension: a report from the European association of cardiovascular imaging (EACVI) and the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) [^116UVLJo]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) — prognostic associations across cohorts are quantified as follows: For every 50 g/m^2 higher left ventricular mass index, there was a relative risk of death of 1.73 (95% CI 1.19–2.52) independent of blood pressure; among African-Americans in ARIC, LVH was linked to cardiovascular events with HR of 1.88 in men and 1.92 in women; and in the Strong Heart Study, echocardiographic LVH prevalence was 9.5% with a seven-fold increase in cardiovascular mortality and a four-fold increase in all-cause mortality. Concentric LVH on echocardiography identifies a high risk phenotype with abnormal flow-mediated dilation and decreased myocardial flow reserve.

### Rapid reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy and intracardiac volume overload in patients with resistant hypertension and hyperaldosteronism: a prospective clinical study [^112DQ272]. Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

We have shown previously that patients with resistant hypertension and hyperaldosteronism have increased brain natriuretic peptide suggestive of increased intravascular volume. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that hyperaldosteronism contributes to cardiac volume overload. Thirty-seven resistant hypertensive patients with hyperaldosteronism (urinary aldosterone ≥ 12 microg/24 hours and plasma renin activity ≤ 1.0 ng/mL per hour) and 71 patients with normal aldosterone status were studied. Both groups had similar blood pressure and left ventricular mass, whereas left and right ventricular end-diastolic volumes measured by cardiac MRI were greater in high versus normal aldosterone subjects (P < 0.05). Spironolactone treatment (19 patients in the high aldosterone group and 15 patients from the normal aldosterone group participated in the follow-up) resulted in a significant decrease in clinic systolic blood pressure, right and left ventricular end diastolic volumes, left atrial volume, left ventricular mass, and brain natriuretic peptide at 3 and 6 months of follow-up in patients with high aldosterone, whereas in those with normal aldosterone status, spironolactone decreased blood pressure and left ventricular mass without changes in ventricular or atrial volumes or plasma brain natriuretic peptide. Hyperaldosteronism causes intracardiac volume overload in patients with resistant hypertension in spite of conventional thiazide diuretic use. Mineralocorticoid receptor blockade induces rapid regression of left ventricular hypertrophy irrespective of aldosterone status. In subjects with high aldosterone, mineralocorticoid receptor blockade induces a prominent diuretic effect compared with a greater vasodilatory effect in subjects with normal aldosterone status.

### Effects of preemptive enoximone on left ventricular diastolic function after valve replacement for aortic stenosis [^117XQYYw]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is associated with increased diastolic chamber stiffness early after aortic valve replacement for valve stenosis. Enoximone, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, has been shown to improve myocardial contractility and relaxation when administered as a single dose after cardiac surgery. The present study investigated, by analysis of transmitral flow velocity patterns and end-diastolic pressure-area relations, whether enoximone administered before aortic valve surgery has an effect on LV diastolic properties.

Design

Prospective, randomized study.

Setting

Referral center for cardiothoracic surgery at a university hospital.

Participants

Thirty-four patients undergoing aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis.

Interventions

Patients in the enoximone group (n = 17) received a bolus dose of 0.35 mg/kg (0.15 mg/kg before aortic cross-clamping and 0.2 mg/kg added to the cardioplegic solution). Individual pressure-area relations (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure v left ventricular end-diastolic area) were obtained by using volume loading by leg elevation before and after surgery with closed chest.

Measurements and Main Results

The pressure-area relation on the pressure-area plot was shifted to the left after surgery, indicating decreased LV diastolic distensibility in the enoximone and control groups and providing evidence of decreased LV diastolic function. Indices of LV diastolic chamber stiffness, LV operating stiffness (K(LV)) derived from the deceleration time of early ventricular filling, and the constant of chamber stiffness (beta) derived from pressure-area relations were not different after enoximone treatment. Systolic LV function was unaltered after cardiac surgery in both groups. Analysis of changes in transmitral flow patterns identified an increased atrial filling fraction in enoximone-treated patients, suggesting increased atrial systolic function. The unaltered systolic pulmonary venous flow velocity compared with the decrease in the control group after volume loading further supports preservation of left atrial reservoir function with enoximone in the absence of evidence for decreased LV stiffness.

Conclusion

Preemptive enoximone did not change LV diastolic function based on diastolic filling patterns or LV stiffness indices (K(LV) and beta) derived from Doppler early filling deceleration time and pressure-area relations. Doppler data suggested improvement of left atrial systolic function and preservation of left atrial reservoir function with enoximone.

### Effect of angiotensin receptor blockade and antihypertensive drugs on diastolic function in patients with hypertension and diastolic dysfunction: a randomised trial [^1144QuYq]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

Diastolic dysfunction might represent an important pathophysiological intermediate between hypertension and heart failure. Our aim was to determine whether inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which can reduce ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis, can improve diastolic function to a greater extent than can other antihypertensive agents.

Methods

Patients with hypertension and evidence of diastolic dysfunction were randomly assigned to receive either the angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan (titrated to 320 mg once daily) or matched placebo. Patients in both groups also received concomitant antihypertensive agents that did not inhibit the renin-angiotensin system to reach targets of under 135 mm Hg systolic blood pressure and under 80 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure. The primary endpoint was change in diastolic relaxation velocity between baseline and 38 weeks as determined by tissue doppler imaging. Analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00170924.

Findings

186 patients were randomly assigned to receive valsartan; 198 were randomly assigned to receive placebo. 43 patients were lost to follow-up or discontinued the assigned intervention. Over 38 weeks, there was a 12.8 (SD 17.2)/7.1 (9.9) mm Hg reduction in blood pressure in the valsartan group and a 9.7 (17.0)/5.5 (10.2) mm Hg reduction in the placebo group. The difference in blood pressure reduction between the two groups was not significant. Diastolic relaxation velocity increased by 0.60 (SD 1.4) cm/s from baseline in the valsartan group (p < 0.0001) and 0.44 (1.4) cm/s from baseline in the placebo group (p < 0.0001) by week 38. However, there was no significant difference in the change in diastolic relaxation velocity between the groups (p = 0.29).

Interpretation

Lowering blood pressure improves diastolic function irrespective of the type of antihypertensive agent used.

### Current perspectives on left ventricular geometry in systemic hypertension [^112uUQF9]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Hypertension (HTN) is a global health problem and a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. The hemodynamic overload from HTN causes left ventricular (LV) remodeling, which usually manifests as distinct alterations in LV geometry, such as concentric remodeling or concentric and eccentric LV hypertrophy (LVH). In addition to being a common target organ response to HTN, LV geometric abnormalities are well-known independent risk factors for CVD. Because of their prognostic implications and quantifiable nature, changes in LV geometric parameters have commonly been included as an outcome in anti-HTN drug trials. The purpose of this paper is to review the relationship between HTN and LV geometric changes with a focus on (1) diagnostic approach, (2) epidemiology, (3) pathophysiology, (4) prognostic effect and (5) LV response to anti-HTN therapy and its impact on CVD risk reduction.

### Metformin improves cardiac metabolism and function, and prevents left ventricular hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats [^111XPQS4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In spontaneously hypertensive rats we observed profound myocardial metabolic changes during early hypertension before development of cardiac dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy. In this study, we evaluated whether metformin improved myocardial metabolic abnormalities and simultaneously prevented contractile dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy in.

Methods and Results

and control Wistar–Kyoto rats were treated with metformin from 2 to 5 months of age, whenhearts exhibit metabolic abnormalities and develop cardiac dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy. We evaluated the effect of metformin on myocardial glucose uptake rates with dynamic 2‐[18 F] fluoro‐2‐deoxy‐D‐glucose positron emission tomography. We used cardiacin vivo to assess the effect of metformin on ejection fraction, left ventricular mass, and end‐diastolic wall thickness, and also analyzed metabolites,‐activated protein kinase and mammalian target‐of‐rapamycin activities, and mean arterial blood pressure. Metformin‐treatedhad lower mean arterial blood pressure but remained hypertensive. Cardiac glucose uptake rates, left ventricular mass/tibia length, wall thickness, and circulating free fatty acid levels decreased to normal, and ejection fraction improved in treated. Hearts of treatedexhibited increased‐activated protein kinase phosphorylation and reduced mammalian target‐of‐rapamycin activity. Cardiac metabolite profiling demonstrated that metformin decreased fatty acyl carnitines and markers of oxidative stress in.

Conclusions

Metformin reduced blood pressure, normalized myocardial glucose uptake, prevented left ventricular hypertrophy, and improved cardiac function in. Metformin may exert its effects by normalizing myocardialand mammalian target‐of‐rapamycin activities, improving fatty acid oxidation, and reducing oxidative stress. Thus, metformin may be a new treatment to prevent or ameliorate chronic hypertension–induced left ventricular hypertrophy.

### Cardiovascular disease in the dialysis population: prognostic significance of arterial disorders [^114NGayf]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Cardiovascular disease is a major factor in the high mortality of patients with end-stage renal disease, and this population is particularly appropriate to analyse the impact of cardiovascular risk markers on outcome.

Recent Findings

Cardiovascular risk markers in end-stage renal disease include age, left ventricular mass, carotid intima-media thickness, blood pressure and aortic stiffness (pulse wave velocity). Aortic pulse wave velocity has been shown to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease and the general population. Aortic pulse wave velocity has the highest sensitivity and specificity as a predictor of cardiovascular death in end-stage renal disease patients. Pulse wave velocity is an integrated index of vascular function and structure, and is a major determinant of systolic hypertension, thereby increasing left ventricular afterload, left ventricular hypertrophy and left ventricular oxygen consumption. Decreased diastolic blood pressure, another consequence of arterial stiffening, is associated with decreased coronary perfusion contributing to ischaemic heart disease and evolution of adaptive into maladaptive left ventricular hypertrophy.

Summary

Aortic stiffness measurements could serve as an important tool in identifying end-stage renal disease patients at higher risk of cardiovascular disease. The ability to identify these patients would lead to better risk stratification and earlier and more cost-effective preventive therapy.

### Reverse remodeling in infarct cardiomyopathy: a role for temporary mechanical circulatory support? [^116v1sFB]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Overall, this study provides important novel mechanistic insight into the hemodynamic, functional, and pathologic observations associated with high-capacity transvalvular support in the subacute setting. Consistent with current understanding of the concept of transvalvular unloading, prolonged support reduced end-diastolic and -systolic left ventricular volumes.

However, that this is correlated with an improvement in the remote zone regional systolic function and reduction in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, which could be potentially pathologic, is a novel finding. Notably, prolonged unloading initiated 2 months after infarction did not reduce infarct size relative to total left ventricular area, which is also consistent with prior reports that pre-emptive unloading (ie, before reperfusion) may be required to minimize ischemia reperfusion injury. Further interpretation of ischemic zone recovery is limited because several animals in this study required repeat coronary ligation and the relative area at risk was not evaluated.

Regarding hemodynamic effects, although left ventricular unloading has been previously shown to acutely reduce end-diastolic pressure, prolonged unloading at maximal pump flows did not significantly reduce end-diastolic pressure, potentially reflective of the wide variation in readings in control animals (6.3 ± 4.1 mm Hg vs 12.8 ± 12.7 mm Hg; P = 0.59). Additionally, though nonsignificant in the cohort analysis, immediately after pump removal the mean left ventricular end-systolic pressure in the unloaded group was 24-mm Hg lower than sham control subjects (61 ± 16 mm Hg vs 85 ± 12 mm Hg; P = 0.079), albeit with similar mean arterial pressures. Whether this translates to relative systemic hypoperfusion, may limit the ability to initiate goal-directed medical therapy and how to best wean off support once there is evidence of reverse remodeling is unknown.

### Association of concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with subsequent change in left ventricular end-diastolic volume: the Dallas heart study [^115fBN4P]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In the conventional paradigm of the progression of left ventricular hypertrophy, a thick-walled left ventricle (LV) ultimately transitions to a dilated cardiomyopathy. There are scant data in humans demonstrating whether this transition occurs commonly without an interval myocardial infarction.

Methods and Results

Participants (n = 1282) from the Dallas Heart Study underwent serial cardiac magnetic resonance ≈7 years apart. Those with interval cardiovascular events and a dilated LV (increased LV end-diastolic volume [EDV] indexed to body surface area) at baseline were excluded. Multivariable linear regression models tested the association of concentric hypertrophy (increased LV mass and LV mass/volume 0.67) with change in LVEDV. The study cohort had a median age of 44 years, 57% women, 43% black, and 11% (n = 142) baseline concentric hypertrophy. The change in LVEDV in those with versus without concentric hypertrophy was 1 mL (-9 to 12) versus -2 mL (-11 to 7), respectively, P < 0.01. In multivariable linear regression models, concentric hypertrophy was associated with larger follow-up LVEDV (P ≤ 0.01). The progression to a dilated LV was uncommon (2%, n = 25).

Conclusions

In the absence of interval myocardial infarction, concentric hypertrophy was associated with a small, but significantly greater, increase in LVEDV after 7-year follow-up. However, the degree of LV enlargement was minimal, and few participants developed a dilated LV. These data suggest that if concentric hypertrophy does progress to a dilated cardiomyopathy, such a transition would occur over a much longer timeframe (eg, decades) and perhaps less common than previously thought.

### Effects of age, gender, and left ventricular mass on septal mitral annulus velocity (E') and the ratio of transmitral early peak velocity to E' (E/e') [^112NiF9i]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

The ratio of the transmitral early peak velocity (E) evaluated by conventional Doppler imaging over early diastolic mitral annulus velocity (E') evaluated by tissue Doppler imaging has been proposed as a noninvasive marker for left ventricular filling pressure. We evaluated 174 normal patients and 86 patients with hypertension and LV hypertrophy to assess the effects of age, gender, and left ventricular hypertrophy on E' and E/E'. Age appeared to be the strongest determinant of E' and E/E', suggesting that in normal patients and in those with left ventricular hypertrophy, age-dependent cut-off values should be considered.

### Hypertensive heart disease [^115qZm1S]. Hypertension Research (2005). Low credibility.

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and diastolic dysfunction (CHF-D) are the early manifestations of cardiovascular target organ damage in patients with arterial hypertension and signify hypertensive heart disease. Identification of hypertensive heart disease is critical, as these individuals are more prone to congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. Regression of left ventricular (LV) mass with antihypertensive therapy decreases the risk of future cardiovascular events. The goal of antihypertensive therapy is to both lower blood pressure (BP) and interrupt BP-independent pathophysiologic processes that promote LVH and CHF-D. The purpose of this review is to summarize current and emerging approaches to the pathophysiology and treatment of hypertensive heart disease.

### Recommendations on the use of echocardiography in adult hypertension: a report from the European association of cardiovascular imaging (EACVI) and the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) [^115AssQq]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Adult hypertension — role of echocardiography in decisions to intensify treatment: The decision to intensify treatment is guided by clinic and home blood pressure monitoring, and in hypertensive heart disease with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and normal systolic function the value of periodic echocardiographic follow-up is not established, with an Appropriate Use Task Force score of 4 (may be appropriate). Patients who become symptomatic require follow-up echocardiography to evaluate systolic and diastolic function, dissociation between blood pressure and LVH is an indication for further testing, high blood pressure without hypertrophy should prompt ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or central aortic pressure measurement, and apparent LVH despite blood pressure control should prompt more detailed blood pressure evaluation or assessment for other causes such as infiltrative disease.

### Therapeutic cardiac-targeted delivery of miR-1 reverses pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and attenuates pathological remodeling [^116PrVDh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Echocardiographic Analysis

Transthoracic echocardiography was performed using a Vivid 7 (GE Healthcare) echocardiography apparatus with a 14‐MHz probe (i13L probe; General Electric). Animals were sedated with ketamine (up to 80 mg/kg) injected intraperitoneally. Long‐axis parasternal views and short‐axis parasternal 2‐dimensional (2D) views, at the mid‐papillary level, of the left ventricle were obtained to calculate the LV end‐diastolic (LVEDV) and end‐systolic (LVESV) volumes as well as the ejection fraction of the left ventricle. Volumes were calculated by using the formulae of the area‐length method (V = 5/6×A×L, where V is the volume in mL, A is the cross‐sectional area of the LV cavity in cm 2, obtained from the mid‐papillary short parasternal image in diastole and in systole, and L is the length of the LV cavity in cm, measured from the long‐axis parasternal image as the distance from the endocardial LV apex to the mitral‐aortic junction in diastole and in systole). M‐mode images were obtained by 2‐dimensional guidance from the parasternal short‐axis view for the measurements of LV wall thickness of the septum (cm) and of the posterior wall (cm), LV end‐diastolic diameter (cm), and LV end‐systolic diameter (cm), as well as to calculate the LV fractional shortening (FS, %).

### Ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial dilatation persist and are associated with reduced survival after valve replacement for aortic stenosis [^1147heiU]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to understand the factors modulating left heart reverse remodeling after aortic valve replacement, the relationship between the preoperative symptoms and modulators of left heart remodeling, and their influence on long-term survival.

Methods

From October 1991 to January 2008, 4264 patients underwent primary aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis. Changes in the time course of left ventricular reverse remodeling were assessed using 5740 postoperative transthoracic echocardiograms from 3841 patients.

Results

Left ventricular hypertrophy rapidly declined after surgery, from 137 ± 42 g/m(2) preoperatively to 115 ± 27 by 2 years and remained relatively constant but greater than the upper limit of normal. The most important risk factor for residual left ventricular hypertrophy was greater preoperative left ventricular hypertrophy (P < .0001). Other factors included a greater left atrial diameter (reflecting diastolic dysfunction), a lower ejection fraction, and male gender. An increased postoperative transprosthesis gradient was associated with greater residual left ventricular hypertrophy; however, its effect was minimal. Preoperative severe left ventricular hypertrophy and left atrial dilatation reduced long-term survival, independent of symptom status.

Conclusions

Severe left ventricular hypertrophy with left atrial dilatation can develop from severe aortic stenosis, even without symptoms. These changes can persist, are associated with decreased long-term survival even after successful aortic valve replacement, and could be indications for early aortic valve replacement if supported by findings from an appropriate prospective study.

### Impact of long-term burden of body mass index and blood pressure from childhood on adult left ventricular structure and function [^116jYUGU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background Data are limited regarding the relationship between the life-course burden of risk factors and adult cardiac function. This study sought to examine the impact of long-term burden of body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure (BP) levels on changes in adult left ventricular (LV) structure and function in a community-based cohort. Methods and Results The longitudinal study cohort consisted of 1108 adult patients (726 White; 41.9% men; mean age, 48.2 years in the last survey) who had been examined 4 to 16 times for BMI and BP and echocardiographic LV structure and function in adulthood, with a mean follow-up period of 38.8 years. The area under the curve was used as a measure of long-term burden of BMI and BP. Adult LV mass index was significantly associated with childhood and adulthood BMI and systolic BP (SBP), and their area under the curve values (β = 0.07–0.37; P < 0.05 for all). Adult LV ejection fraction was negatively associated with childhood BMI (β = -0.08), adult BMI (β = -0.07) and BMI area under the curve (β = -0.07) (P < 0.05 for all); the effects of SBP measures were not significant. Adult E/A ratio was negatively associated with adulthood SBP (β = -0.13; P < 0.01) and total area under the curve of SBP (β = -0.13; P < 0.01). E/e' ratio was positively associated with BMI and SBP measures. The effects of diastolic BP measures were substantially similar to those of SBP measures. Participants with LV hypertrophy, eccentric hypertrophy, and concentric hypertrophy had significantly lower LV ejection fraction and higher E/e' ratio. Conclusions These observations provide strong evidence that early-life adiposity and BP levels and their life-course cumulative burdens are associated with subclinical changes in adult LV structure and function in the general population.

Left ventricular geometry classification — A proposed subdivision based on LVM, LV volume, and relative wall thickness (RWT) or mass-to-volume ratio categorizes dilated ventricles without LVH as eccentric remodeling (RWT < 0.32) and dilated ventricles with LVH as eccentric hypertrophy (RWT < 0.32), mixed hypertrophy (RWT > 0.42), or physiological hypertrophy (RWT 0.32–0.42).

Concentric remodelling — causes and echocardiographic phenotype: It is a late stage response that can be caused by chronic pressure, volume overload, or MI; it is most commonly associated with coronary artery disease and is also associated with longstanding hypertension, especially untreated hypertension; like eccentric hypertrophy, it is associated with LV systolic dysfunction, with echocardiographic features of normal or small LV cavity size, usually increased or normal LV wall thickness and sphericity; it becomes more rounded rather than bullet shaped and results in more dramatic degradation of diastolic function with loss of radial and longitudinal function.

### Left heart failure with a normal ejection fraction: identification of different pathophysiologic mechanisms [^111pVyiA]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Although heart failure with a normal ejection fraction (HFNEF) is a clinically heterogeneous syndrome, a single pathophysiologic mechanism, diastolic dysfunction, is often ascribed to explain this condition. In view of the clinical heterogeneity of these patients, we hypothesized that subgroups of HFNEF patients may have different underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.

Methods and Results

Freehand 3-dimensional echocardiography was used to measure left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes in 99 asymptomatic normal controls and 2 groups with chronic heart failure: 35 patients with normal ejection fraction with longstanding hypertension (hypertensive HFNEF) and 11 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without a history of hypertension (nonhypertensive HFNEF). These data, combined with cuff sphygmomanometry and Doppler estimates of LV end-diastolic pressure (EDP) yielded estimated pressure-volume loops and slope (E es, sb) of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship, a load independent index of chamber contractility. Nonhypertensive HFNEF patients required high EDPs (21 ± 2 versus 15 ± 3 mm Hg in normals, P < .0001) to achieve normal EDVs (98 ± 25 versus 95 ± 21 mL in normals, P = NS). Although systolic function (E es, sb) did not differ from normal, systolic blood pressure was lower than normal in these patients (114 ± 10 versus 124 ± 14 mm Hg in normals, P < .05). Hypertensive HFNEF patients also had increased EDP (20 ± 2 mm Hg), but this was observed at higher than normal EDVs (118 ± 29 mL, P < .05). Among patients with hypertensive HFNEF, 2 subgroups emerged, 1 with a high E es, sb (4.23 ± 0.54 versus 2.1 ± 0.7 mm Hg/mL) and 1 with normal E es, sb (2.31 ± 0.51 mm Hg/mL). The former group was composed of elderly women with small body size (body surface area 1.7 ± 0.2 versus 1.9 ± 0.2 m 2, P = 0.02) who had concentrically remodeled ventricles and low stroke volumes. The latter group was more diverse in age, body size, and included patients of both genders with increases in ventricular volumes, stroke volume, and mass consistent with a volume overload state.

Conclusion

Although HFNEF is commonly thought of as being the result of a single hemodynamic mechanism, these data indicate that subgroups exist with distinctly different underlying pathophysiologies.

### Evaluation of subclinical target organ damage for risk assessment and treatment in the hypertensive patients: left ventricular hypertrophy [^111Bxdsw]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

At some point in the natural history of hypertension, the compensatory increase in left ventricular mass ceases to be beneficial. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) becomes a preclinical disease and an independent risk factor for congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, arrhythmia, sudden death, and stroke. In addition to elevated BP, several mechanisms are involved, including body size, age, gender, race, fibrogenic cytokines, and neurohumoral factors, notably angiotensin II, which favor interstitial collagen deposition and perivascular fibrosis. These tissue changes are responsible for the insidious contractile dysfunction that is associated with LVH, consequent to decreased coronary reserve and altered diastolic ventricular filling and relaxation. The cardinal investigations are echocardiography and electrocardiography. All antihypertensive drugs regress LVH, notably those that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which also could target the detrimental tissue changes. Regression enhances systolic midwall performance, normalizes autonomic function, and restores coronary reserve. The resulting improvement in prognosis has enshrined the detection, prevention, and reversal of LVH in the current guidelines of hypertension management.
