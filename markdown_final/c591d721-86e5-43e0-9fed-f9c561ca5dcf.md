## Question

What information can pathways provide me on diseases, differential diagnosis, medications and novel therapies?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how pathways can provide information on diseases, differential diagnosis, medications, and novel therapies, and how to apply this information in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and the distinction between clinical pathways and molecular pathways. Then, I should verify how each contributes to disease understanding and differential diagnosis. Next, I will examine how pathways guide medication selection, including pharmacogenetics and biomarker-guided therapy. After that, I should review how pathways accelerate discovery and validation of novel therapies. Finally, I will synthesize practical applications, implementation considerations, and limitations, anchoring the reasoning in high-quality sources and examples from cardiology, dermatology, neurology, oncology, and respiratory medicine.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions so I don't conflate terms. Clinical pathways are structured, multidisciplinary plans that translate guidelines into local, time-bound, criteria-based care processes to standardize treatment for a defined population, whereas molecular pathways are networks of interacting genes, proteins, and metabolites that mechanistically explain disease biology and can reveal therapeutic targets and biomarkers. I should double-check that both senses are represented in the literature, and yes, clinical pathway frameworks emphasize structure, evidence translation, and standardization, while systems biology and network medicine describe molecular pathways as the mechanistic substrate for precision medicine [^112YGUax] [^114EZc3f] [^115yQ6EJ].

> Next, I should review how clinical pathways enhance disease understanding and differential diagnosis. Hold on, let me verify concrete examples: the ACC myocarditis pathway operationalizes a 5-step evaluation from suspicion to longitudinal surveillance, including triage, pivotal diagnostics (CMR, EMB), and staged management, which codifies how clinicians should think through mimics and complications. Similarly, HFpEF pathways explicitly structure the differential of dyspnea into cardiac, pulmonary, and other causes, reducing premature closure. And in dermatology, precision frameworks highlight overlapping clinicopathologic features between diseases like atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, prompting clinicians to reconsider diagnoses when expected responses fail, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy and timeliness [^117AjYPN] [^1111NMMw] [^117XxzGn].

> I will now examine how molecular pathways deepen mechanistic understanding and refine differential diagnosis. Let me consider a few exemplars: in COVID-19, proteomic analyses uncovered actionable pathways that distinguish subphenotypes and suggest repurposing or targeted strategies. In ILD, proteomics delineates dysregulated complement, humoral immunity, and matrix remodeling pathways that vary by subtype, aiding both diagnosis and prognosis. In neurodegeneration, converging genetics and pathology reveal overlapping pathways across diseases, supporting a shift from phenotype-first to mechanism-first nosology. And in cancer, pathway-based subnetworks enable cross-disease biomarker discovery and molecular subtyping that can reclassify disease and anticipate treatment response, all of which enrich the differential by linking clinical syndromes to underlying biology [^1117mnJE] [^116gaHPW] [^112nPR7E] [^116RYZyD] [^116WXtEX].

> Now, how do pathways guide medication selection? Wait, let me verify the hierarchy: clinical pathways translate guidelines into stepwise algorithms for drug initiation, titration, sequencing, and monitoring. For example, HFrEF pathways operationalize quadruple GDMT with explicit titration and monitoring steps, and HFpEF pathways emphasize careful attribution of dyspnea and comorbidity-driven therapy. In parallel, molecular pathways enable mechanism-matched pharmacotherapy, such as IL-4/IL-13 blockade with dupilumab for atopic dermatitis and JAK/S1P/anti-integrin options in IBD, where aligning drug target to dominant pathway improves outcomes. Additionally, pharmacogenetic guidance embedded in pathways (e.g. FDA pharmacogenomic associations) supports dose selection and avoidance of toxicity, and biomarkers like natriuretic peptides in HF guide both diagnosis and longitudinal therapy adjustments, reinforcing a precision approach to medication management [^1178McUz] [^113gupUz] [^111FbnBC] [^117Mbrmc] [^115dqbHN].

> But wait, what if the patient doesn't fit neatly into a single pathway or fails standard therapy? I should confirm that contemporary frameworks explicitly address heterogeneity and nonresponse. In inflammatory skin disease, precision medicine argues for matching drug to molecular phenotype rather than empirical selection; in COPD, moving from symptom-based phenotypes to endotypes defined by distinct inflammatory pathways supports targeted anti-inflammatory therapy; and in atypical neuroinflammation, expert algorithms advocate broad biomarker workups and mechanism-informed immunotherapy when antibody-defined diagnoses are absent, with iterative reassessment if response is suboptimal, all of which operationalize a pathway-informed, hypothesis-testing approach to medication selection and adjustment [^117XxzGn] [^1177njLN] [^111A7vVx].

> Next, I should review how pathways accelerate discovery and validation of novel therapies. Let me think about this carefully: unbiased pathway discovery from omics datasets can rank dysregulated pathways and nominate new targets. For example, ensemble pathway tools benchmarked against large-scale experimental data improve the reliability of discovered targets. Network and pathway-based drug repositioning expands target space beyond single genes. And adaptive regulatory frameworks (MAPPs) enable iterative evidence generation and earlier access for well-selected populations, while Alzheimer's disease exemplifies a shift toward biomarker-guided, pathway-targeting disease-modifying therapies with evolving definitions of clinical and biological benefit, collectively shortening timelines and improving alignment of novel agents with mechanistic disease drivers [^113Jo99F] [^111tqSnG] [^111YK8PB] [^1133hcnB] [^115aL5ZG].

> I should double-check practical implementation considerations so these concepts are usable at the bedside. Clinical pathways require multidisciplinary authorship, governance safeguards, and explicit scope to remain actionable; the ACC ECDP methodology details evidence synthesis, consensus building, and rapid updates, while data-driven clinical evidence-based pathways (CEBPWs) aim to integrate real-world data and payment reform to close the loop on adherence and quality; digital tools and CDS can embed pathways into workflow, but uptake depends on usability and alignment with local resources; and equity considerations must be built in, as seen in myocarditis pathways addressing access, coverage, and genetic counseling disparities, ensuring that pathway implementation reduces, not widens, outcome gaps [^112YGUax] [^113zXHSY] [^115vVK1g] [^113veEcE].

> Hold on, I should verify limitations and pitfalls so we don't overstate what pathways can deliver. Traditional CPWs can oversimplify complex, heterogeneous diseases and may lag behind evolving evidence; manual development is slow and costly; and without integration of local data, pathways risk low adherence and limited individualization; conversely, molecular pathway inference from omics can generate noise and false leads without rigorous validation, and many biomarkers lack reproducibility across cohorts; thus, iterative validation, integration of multimodal data, and feedback loops from real-world outcomes are essential to refine both clinical and molecular pathways over time [^115vVK1g] [^116RYZyD] [^113zXHSY].

> Let me synthesize the practical value proposition so it's clinically actionable. Pathways, in the clinical sense, provide a standardized yet adaptable roadmap that reduces unwarranted variation, improves timeliness, and embeds evidence-based checkpoints for diagnosis, risk stratification, treatment sequencing, and follow-up; pathways, in the molecular sense, decode disease mechanisms, enable earlier and more precise diagnosis, match patients to mechanism-targeted therapies, and surface new drug targets; together, they operationalize precision medicine by aligning what we do clinically with why we do it biologically, and they offer a scaffold for continuous learning as new evidence and technologies emerge [^112YGUax] [^1133hcnB] [^1177njLN].

> Finally, I should confirm a few concrete clinical takeaways with examples. In suspected myocarditis, follow the ACC 5-step pathway: recognize the syndrome, obtain initial labs and echo, exclude obstructive CAD, pursue CMR/EMB when indicated, and stage management with early referral for advanced therapies. In HF, use natriuretic peptides to support diagnosis and titrate GDMT within a team-based optimization framework. In atopic dermatitis, consider IL-4/IL-13 blockade for moderate-to-severe disease and reassess if the clinical course deviates from expected pathway responses. And when facing diagnostic uncertainty or treatment resistance, pivot to a pathway-informed differential and, where feasible, leverage omics or targeted biomarkers to surface alternate mechanisms and redirect therapy, documenting outcomes to strengthen the evidence base for future pathways [^117AjYPN] [^115dqbHN] [^113gupUz] [^117XxzGn].

Pathways provide a **structured, evidence-based approach** to disease management by mapping diagnostic and therapeutic steps, standardizing care, and reducing variability [^114EZc3f]. They support **differential diagnosis** by guiding clinicians through symptom-based branches and highlighting red flags that prompt alternative diagnoses or urgent actions [^111sLkhK]. Pathways also align medication selection with guideline-directed therapy, including dosing, titration, and monitoring, and incorporate pharmacogenomic considerations where relevant [^117Mbrmc]. For novel therapies, pathways integrate emerging evidence, biomarkers, and adaptive regulatory frameworks to enable timely, safe adoption and personalized care [^1133hcnB] [^111YK8PB].

---

## Disease information within pathways

Pathways distill **core disease knowledge** — epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and staging — to inform decisions and counseling [^112YGUax]. They also define **diagnostic criteria and staging** using standardized thresholds and biomarkers to enable consistent classification and severity assessment [^115dqbHN].

---

## Differential diagnosis support

Pathways guide clinicians through **branching logic** based on symptoms, signs, and test results, narrowing the differential and suggesting next steps [^111sLkhK]. They also flag **red flags** — high-risk features that trigger alternative diagnoses or urgent escalation — to reduce missed serious disease [^111weqGa].

---

## Medication guidance

Pathways specify **guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT)** — drug choice, dosing, titration, and monitoring — to improve adherence and outcomes [^1178McUz]. They also incorporate **pharmacogenomic considerations**, including genotype-informed dosing and drug–drug interactions, to personalize therapy and reduce adverse effects [^117Mbrmc].

---

## Novel therapies and emerging evidence

Pathways integrate **emerging evidence** by updating with new trials, biomarkers, and regulatory approvals to support timely adoption of novel therapies [^114FME3X]. They also leverage **adaptive regulatory frameworks** (e.g. MAPPs) to enable early, iterative access while evidence accrues [^111YK8PB].

## Clinical examples

| **Clinical condition** | **Pathway features** | **Clinical impact** |
|-|-|-|
| Heart failure (HFrEF) | - GDMT <br/> - Biomarker-guided titration <br/> - Team-based care | Improved outcomes and reduced hospitalizations [^1178McUz] |
| Myocarditis | - Diagnostic algorithm <br/> - Risk stratification <br/> - Activity guidance | Early diagnosis and safe return-to-play decisions [^117AjYPN] [^113yK7YX] |
| Alzheimer's disease | - Biomarker-guided staging <br/> - Novel therapies integration | Personalized care and early intervention [^1133hcnB] [^115aL5ZG] |

Prelaunch adaptive pathways moment

Once the initial, agreed‐upon evidence package has matured and provided the product has performed as expected with regard to benefits and harms, the developer will trigger the prelaunch adaptive pathways moment.

A key goal of this adaptive pathway moment would be to reach final agreement among all stakeholders on the treatment‐eligible population. Definition of the treatment‐eligible population will likely be driven by the preagreed development plan (i.e. patient selection criteria in the clinical trials) but also by the product's (under/over)‐performance as judged at the time of launch.

It is anticipated that marketing authorization (MA) may be conditional (i.e. CMA), unless a full MA in a well‐defined (sub‐)population is agreed upon based on evidence generated. Under MAPPs, local HTA recommendations and reimbursement decisions will hopefully rapidly follow the regulatory decision since HTA bodies and some payers would have been involved in the early and iterative adaptive pathways moments. If so, the MAPPs goal of timely access for patients with a high unmet need would have been achieved.

### Current concepts in targeting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pharmacotherapy: making progress towards personalised management [^1177njLN]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, complex, and heterogeneous disorder that is responsible for substantial and growing morbidity, mortality, and health-care expense worldwide. Of imperative importance to decipher the complexity of COPD is to identify groups of patients with similar clinical characteristics, prognosis, or therapeutic needs, the so-called clinical phenotypes. This strategy is logical for research but might be of little clinical value because clinical phenotypes can overlap in the same patient and the same clinical phenotype could result from different biological mechanisms. With the goal to match assessment with treatment choices, the latest iteration of guidelines from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease reorganised treatment objectives into two categories: to improve symptoms (ie, dyspnoea and health status) and to decrease future risk (as predicted by forced expiratory volume in 1 s level and exacerbations history). This change thus moves treatment closer to individualised medicine with available bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory drugs. Yet, future treatment options are likely to include targeting endotypes that represent subtypes of patients defined by a distinct pathophysiological mechanism. Specific biomarkers of these endotypes would be particularly useful in clinical practice, especially in patients in which clinical phenotype alone is insufficient to identify the underlying endotype. A few series of potential COPD endotypes and biomarkers have been suggested. Empirical knowledge will be gained from proof-of-concept trials in COPD with emerging drugs that target specific inflammatory pathways. In every instance, specific endotype and biomarker efforts will probably be needed for the success of these trials, because the pathways are likely to be operative in only a subset of patients. Network analysis of human diseases offers the possibility to improve understanding of disease pathobiological complexity and to help with the development of new treatment alternatives and, importantly, a reclassification of complex diseases. All these developments should pave the way towards personalised treatment of patients with COPD in the clinic.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^1168XTUA]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) cardiovascular care — priorities and gaps: Cardiovascular (CV) specialists have a key role and are positioned to address screening for T2D in patients with or at high risk of CV disease, aggressive treatment of CV risk factors, and incorporation of newer glucose‑lowering agents with evidence for improving CV outcomes. In contemporary practice, only 13% of outpatients with coronary artery disease cared for primarily by cardiologists are screened for T2D. Comprehensive CV risk factor control reduces events and improves survival in patients with T2D, yet only a minority of patients with diabetes achieve these key benchmarks; encounters with CV specialists are an ideal time to review overall management and consider initiating these novel agents to favorably impact care and outcomes.

Expert Consensus Decision Pathway timeline and scope — The timeline for development is more compressed than a Clinical Practice Guideline, usually in the range of 8 to 12 months, during which time the Work Group tracks emerging evidence and incorporates it into the pathway. Determination of the scope is a critical early step, and the Work Group should keep the scope wide enough to provide guidance on the most important clinical questions yet not so broad as to be unmanageable within the narrow timeframe typically allotted for content development.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for treatment of heart Failure with reduced ejection Fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^115dqbHN]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Natriuretic peptides in HFrEF — BNP and NT-proBNP are the most studied biomarkers in heart failure and inform diagnosis and prognostication, with higher concentrations in ambulatory HFrEF indicating high risk, particularly when rising. Current clinical practice guidelines give a Class 1 recommendation to measure BNP or NT-proBNP to support diagnosis, assess disease severity, or establish prognosis. Trends in concentrations inform prognosis, congestion severity, and the trajectory of left ventricular remodeling and track with health status; thus, measuring BNP or NT-proBNP at each clinical evaluation may inform clinical decisions, with more frequent measurement appropriate during rapid medication titration or when symptoms are unstable.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on strategies and criteria for the diagnosis and management of Myocarditis: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^113veEcE]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Myocarditis social determinants of health — inequities and research needs include documented inequity in access to screening, evaluation, and treatment; underinsured/not insured patients, low-income patients, people of color, and rural residents may not be referred for screening, imaging, testing, and/or advanced therapies; reliance on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) with heterogeneous uptake and variable wait times presents equity concerns; more widespread and equitable genetic testing is desired given lower clinical testing rates in Black populations and higher genetic diversity in individuals of African ancestry; genomic studies in diverse and inclusive populations should be a priority; and because social determinants of health have been implicated in altered immunity and inflammation, these variables may impact myocarditis course and outcomes, warranting further research on intersections of clinical variables, genetic risk, and social determinants.

### Translating guidelines into practice: interpreting the 2016 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the role of non-statin therapies for LDL-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk [^113be8JN]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2016, the American College of Cardiology released a decision pathway, based on expert consensus, to guide use of non-statin agents in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. The purpose of this article is to assist practitioners, health systems and managed care entities with interpreting this consensus statement in order to simplify implementation of the recommendations into patient care.

Methods

Major themes from the consensus statement are briefly summarized and explained. Drug therapy recommendations are condensed into a single algorithm, while tables correlate each recommended regimen with the appropriate patient population from both a patient-level and systems-level perspective. Finally, a patient case with evidence-based decision support is explored.

Results

These tools allow practitioners to make appropriate patient-specific decisions about the use of non-statin pharmacotherapy and enable health systems and managed care entities to more readily identify guideline-appropriate use of these agents upon review of patient profiles or prescribing patterns.

Conclusion

This article provides resources for healthcare providers that facilitate uptake of these recommendations into clinical practice.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on strategies and criteria for the diagnosis and management of Myocarditis: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^111weqGa]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Top 10 key takeaway points — staging and referral: A novel 4-stage classification of myocarditis is proposed, with stage A referring to those having or exposed to risk factors, stage B to those asymptomatic but with evidence of myocardial inflammation, stage C to those with symptomatic myocarditis, and stage D to those with advanced myocarditis (hemodynamic or electrical instability requiring intervention). Risk stratification in patients with symptomatic myocarditis guides the decision whether to refer to an advanced HF center with a multidisciplinary myocarditis team, and there should be a low threshold to transfer patients with high-risk features, such as severely reduced ventricular function, symptomatic HF, hemodynamic instability, or electrical instability (either ventricular arrhythmias or heart block).

### A taxonomy of early diagnosis research to guide study design and funding prioritisation [^114B8X8j]. British Journal of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

How long does the diagnostic process take? (Diagnostic interval studies)

The diagnostic interval for an individual patient is the period between first presentation and diagnosis and is a measure of how long it takes for them to be correctly diagnosed. The 'total' interval, from symptom onset to diagnosis or treatment, can be further split into subcomponents, such as the patient interval and the primary care interval (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
An illustration of the overall milestones and time intervals in the route from first symptom until start of treatment for cancer.

Reused from Weller et al. adapted from Olesen et al.

Considering diagnostic intervals at population-level allows identification of whether patients with the as-yet-undiagnosed condition are likely to experience diagnostic delay, and quantification of the distribution of any delays. Further, examining changes in average diagnostic intervals can support the evaluation of diagnosis improvement initiatives - such as the introduction of clinical guidelines - and can help to compare performance between and across healthcare systems. However, diagnostic intervals should be triangulated with other measures of diagnostic delay to understand whether comorbidities may be artefactually prolonging interval length.

The main limitation of both diagnostic pathway and diagnostic interval studies is that, generally, pathways or intervals alone are not sufficient to determine if anything could have been done differently to ensure a specific patient was diagnosed sooner. However, by examining variation with other factors, they can provide an understanding of which patients are at the highest risk of experiencing diagnostic delay and where in the healthcare system delay is most likely to occur. Depending on the disease and healthcare context, these studies may require linkage of multiple datasets to track patient pathways, determine pathway optimality, or measure intervals.

### Advancing precision medicine in inflammatory skin disease [^117XxzGn]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction to Precision Medicine for Inflammatory Skin Disease

Medications inhibiting specific inflammatory pathways are now so commonly prescribed to treat chronic skin conditions that precisely matching drug to disease presentations is deterministic in patient outcomes. Despite a growing arsenal of targeted immunomodulatory therapies, treatment selection remains largely empirical. Within well-defined disease categories, molecular heterogeneity leads to varying drug responses. In other cases, overlapping clinicopathologic features complicate diagnosis and medication selection. As a result, therapeutic decisions are often shaped more by trial-and-error and insurance constraints than by underlying biology. This disconnect between disease heterogeneity and therapeutic strategy not only undermines clinical outcomes, it also contributes to escalating costs, as biologic medications represent a substantial share of prescription drug expenditures.

Precision medicine offers a framework to address these challenges by tailoring diagnosis and treatment to the key molecular features of each patient's disease. We identify three clinical contexts where such approaches can be transformative. First, overlapping features of distinct conditions (such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis) complicate diagnosis in some cases and increase the risk of erroneous drug selection (Fig. 1 A). Second, as in most cases where the diagnosis is clear (e.g. psoriasis), therapeutic response varies. While many patients with psoriasis respond to either tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or interleukin (IL)-23 inhibitors, a subset responds to neither. Identifying these individuals in advance could avoid delays in effective care (Fig. 1 B). Finally, for clinical presentations lacking a clear diagnosis or diseases without a defined mechanism, molecular testing can provide partial yet actionable insight into disease presentations whose etiology is unclear. In such unusual cases, a growing number of existing targeted treatments can be redirected to inhibit the candidate abnormality (Fig. 1 C).

### New drug therapy approvals 2022… [^1137cXo3]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Our report highlights CDER's novel approvals of 2022 that will make a difference in people's lives. The report also illustrates the ways we evaluated drug safety and efficacy, as well as the regulatory tools we used to review and approve drug applications. We approved almost all of these therapies on or before their goal dates, or congressionally authorized agreements with industry. More than half were approved in the U. S. before any other country. The New Drug Therapy Approvals report summarizes CDER's 2022 approvals and spotlights examples of notable treatments. FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research also approves important therapies. Please visit CBER's webpage for 2022 Biological Product Approvals for information on these actions. We hope this report helps demonstrate CDER's unrelenting commitment to improving patient care through the approval of safe and effective treatments. Patrizia Cavazzoni, M. D. Director, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.

Innovation Across Medical Conditions In 2022, we approved 37 new drugs never before approved or marketed in the U. S., known as "novel" drugs. We also approved previously approved drugs in new settings, such as for new indications and patient populations. The 2022 actions, both novel drug approvals and drugs approved in new settings, target diseases and conditions such as: New Drugs for Patients with Rare Diseases Patients with rare diseases are often in critical need of new therapies, as these individuals generally have few or no existing treatment options. In 2022, 20 of 37, or 54% of our novel drug approvals, were for rare diseases, including: Drugs for Rare Diseases In 2022, 20 of CDER's 37 novel drug approvals, were approved to treat rare or "orphan" diseases. Patients with rare diseases often have few or no drugs available to treat their conditions.

Innovation: Expedited Development and Review Pathways CDER used diverse regulatory approaches to enhance and expedite drug review in 2022. These approaches enable increased flexibility, efficiency, and interactions between CDER staff and drug developers. These approaches often also allow shorter review times to speed the availability of new therapies to patients with serious conditions, especially in cases where there are no satisfactory alternative therapies, while preserving FDA's rigorous standards for safety and effectiveness.

### Pathway-based subnetworks enable cross-disease biomarker discovery [^112NE2Sg]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Precision molecular medicine is predicated on the concept of giving each patient the right drug in the right dose at the right time. This type of personalized treatment requires the development of robust biomarkers that precisely predict clinical phenotypes. Current clinical biomarkers are typically derived from a small number of genes, and do not yet recapitulate the full complexity of disease. SIMMS takes a step towards integrating diverse cellular processes into a singular model, and is well-positioned to take into account the influx of clinical sequencing data now being generated. However, as -omic techniques evolve to rapidly analyze and quantify cellular metabolites, network models may need to change from being gene-centric to including metabolites as core nodes. Further, single-cell analysis methods may allow accurate interrogation of the interactions between different cell-types, perhaps requiring simultaneous fitting of multiple distinct, but interacting network models. The continued development of robust, general biomarker discovery algorithms is thus required to generate the accurate and reproducible biomarkers needed for transforming medical care.

### Update on atopic dermatitis: diagnosis, severity assessment, and treatment selection [^113gupUz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases affecting children and adults. The intense pruritus and rash can be debilitating, significantly impairing quality of life. Until recently, treatment was largely nonspecific and, in severe disease, sometimes ineffective and/or fraught with many side effects. Now, multiple agents targeting specific disease pathways are available or in development. Two new therapies, crisaborole and dupilumab, have become available since 2016, and dupilumab has dramatically improved outcomes for adults with severe AD. This article provides an overview of AD, including strategies for differential diagnosis and assessment of disease severity to guide treatment selection. Key clinical trials for crisaborole and dupilumab are reviewed, and other targeted treatments now in development are summarized. Two cases, representing childhood-onset and adult-onset AD, are discussed to provide clinical context for diagnosis, severity assessment, and treatment selection and outcomes.

Clinically suspected acute myocarditis initial evaluation and follow-up include that biomarkers and an echocardiogram should be obtained if not already done, obstructive coronary artery disease should be excluded by coronary angiography (invasive or via CT) as clinically appropriate, and triage decisions should be made based on acuity including whether hospitalization, referral to an advanced heart failure center, or emergent circulatory support or pacemaker is needed; next, 2 pivotal tests to establish the diagnosis can be considered — a CMR including T1 and T2 parametric mapping if the patient is stable and, in select cases, an endomyocardial biopsy (EMB), with EMB able to confirm specific myocarditis subtypes; pharmacological treatment is initiated once the diagnosis is established and, in some cases with clinical instability, when highly suspected, and if the patient's condition has deteriorated the need for temporary circulatory support should be considered, recognizing a small minority will require transition to a durable LVAD or heart transplantation; patients in the outpatient setting should be educated to refrain from strenuous physical activity and competitive sports until cleared, required care does not end even if symptoms resolve after 2–3 weeks, and patients need longitudinal surveillance.

American College of Cardiology Expert Consensus Decision Pathways (ECDPs) role and scope — ECDPs represent a key component of solution sets and are not intended to provide single correct answers to clinical questions; rather, they encourage clinicians to consider a range of important factors as they define treatment plans for their patients, seek to provide unified articulation of clinical practice guidelines, appropriate use criteria, and other related ACC clinical policy, and note that in some cases topics will be addressed in subsequent clinical practice guidelines as the evidence base evolves, whereas in other cases they will serve as stand-alone policy.

Noninvasive cardiovascular diagnostic testing — objectives and target population are defined: the primary role of subsequent testing is for evaluation of patients classified as intermediate risk according to the initial CDP evaluation; low-risk patients have a very low event rate and can usually be discharged without in-hospital testing, whereas high-risk patients should usually be admitted and initiated on guideline-based therapies if type 1 MI is considered; goals are accurate diagnosis or exclusion of clinically significant CAD or other cardiovascular conditions, risk-stratification to determine which patients require immediate treatment versus those for whom it can be delayed or deferred, and identification of abnormalities such as nonobstructive coronary atherosclerosis or left ventricular hypertrophy requiring follow-up, underscoring the importance of consistent post-test reporting.

Cancer Genomics Overview The field of cancer genomics is constantly growing and changing, fueled by the development of new laboratory and computational technologies for interrogating the molecular and cellular details of cancer. By characterizing not only the DNA, but also gene expression, proteins, and many other molecular features of cancer, researchers can identify key changes that may cause the disease. By taking advantage of new types of data, improvements in data quality, and reductions in cost for sequencing, researchers are gaining a fuller understanding of cancer. Once cancer-causing changes are identified, scientists can gain a better understanding of the molecular basis of cancer growth, metastasis, and drug resistance. This is done using clinical data that describes how patients responded to cancer treatment, laboratory experiments using cell lines and model organisms, and big data analysis techniques.

Putting large genomic datasets together and sharing them with researchers worldwide is an increasingly important strategy for cancer research, as this boosts the power of the data and opens new opportunities for discovery. Importance of Cancer Genomics in Precision Cancer Medicine Genomic information about cancer is leading to better diagnoses and treatment strategies that are tailored to patients' tumors, an approach called precision medicine. As a result of research into the genomic changes associated with cancer, drugs have been developed to fight the disease in several ways:

- Inhibiting enzymes that trigger the abnormal growth and survival of cancer cells
- Blocking aberrant gene expression characteristic of cancer cells
- Halting molecular signaling pathways that are in overdrive in cancer cells. Cancer genomics research also contributes to precision medicine by defining cancer types and subtypes based on their genetics.

This molecular taxonomy of cancer can provide patients with a more precise diagnosis, and therefore a more personalized treatment strategy. There are several ways in which the molecular definition of cancer already benefits patients:

- Diffuse large B cell lymphoma can be subdivided into the ABC and GCB subtypes by genomic profiling, identifying patients that respond differently to current chemotherapy regimens and to molecularly targeted therapies.
- In 2013, The Cancer Genome Atlas project identified four subtypes of endometrial cancer – POLE ultramutated, microsatellite instability hypermutated, copy-number low, and CN high – that correlate with patient survival. This research has already given rise to new clinical trials that investigate how these subtypes can improve the future of endometrial cancer care.

### Medicines adaptive pathways to patients: why, when, and how to engage? [^117XFqbf]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Preliminary evidence adaptive pathways moment

As more evidence about the product is accruing, the MAPPs interactions are expected to intensify. Once initial clinical data become available, all of the questions listed in Table 1 become relevant. Importantly, does the promise of truly addressing the unmet need still hold? Are stakeholders still committed to dedicate the necessary resources to continue the process? Is there institutional support?

At this juncture, the key deliverable from the process will be a mutually acceptable iterative development plan. An "iterative development plan" is a development plan initiated by the developer, which integrates the feedback from the stakeholders and outlines the development of the medicine during its lifespan, including the phase after initial authorization and P&R; it supports an adaptive pathway approach from beginning to end. As described above, it is envisaged that development planning discussions likely begin as interactions without committments 11 and progress to more formal interactions such as, e.g. parallel consultation procedure with EMA and HTABs.

The development plan should clarify what evidence package must be available before product launch. The initial evidence package would support the regulatory authorization (i.e. provide evidence of a positive benefit–risk profile according to current scientific standards) but at the same time support HTA and enable the initial P&R negotiations and design of suitable managed entry agreements (MEAs; or alternative P&R approaches) across the different healthcare systems.

The development plan should also lay out what data and information will have to be provided after the initial marketing authorization and reimbursement decisions. It would be expected to consider many aspects of product development and evidence generation such as biomarkers, surrogate and composite endpoints, subpopulations, CMC issues, adaptive trial design, patient reported outcomes (PROs), and key milestones to review postauthorization evidence requirements. It should be clarified whether there is adequate infrastructure available for postlaunch monitoring of the product (e.g. existing disease registries) or whether new infrastructure needs to be put in place.

At this stage, payers, and perhaps other stakeholders, will likely wish to start considering issues of appropriate product utilization and workable strategies for payers with clearly defined decision points in case the product underperforms (Table 1 and below).

Given that clinical development from the preliminary evidence adaptive pathways moment up to initial authorization may take several years, unexpected findings or environmental changes may necessitate one or more reassessment moments or loops (Figure 2).

### What is a clinical pathway? Development of a definition to inform the debate [^114v1S91]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical pathways are tools used to guide evidence-based healthcare that have been implemented internationally since the 1980s. However, there is widespread lack of agreement on the impact of clinical pathways on hospital resources and patient outcomes. This can be partially attributed to the confusion for both researchers and healthcare workers regarding what constitutes a clinical pathway. This paper describes efforts made by a team of Cochrane Review authors to develop criteria to assist in the objective identification of clinical pathway studies from the literature.

Methods

We undertook a four-stage process aiming to develop criteria to define a clinical pathway: (1) identify publications exploring the definition of a clinical pathway; (2) derive draft criteria; (3) pilot test the criteria; and (4) modify criteria to maximise agreement between review authors.

Results

Previous literature and liaison with the European Pathways Association resulted in five criteria being used to define a clinical pathway: (1) the intervention was a structured multidisciplinary plan of care; (2) the intervention was used to translate guidelines or evidence into local structures; (3) the intervention detailed the steps in a course of treatment or care in a plan, pathway, algorithm, guideline, protocol or other 'inventory of actions'; (4) the intervention had timeframes or criteria-based progression; and (5) the intervention aimed to standardise care for a specific clinical problem, procedure or episode of healthcare in a specific population. After pilot testing it was decided that if an intervention met the first criteria (a structured multidisciplinary plan of care) plus three out of the other four criteria then it was included as a clinical pathway for the purposes of this review. In all, 27 studies were included in the final review. The authors of the included studies referred to these interventions as 'clinical pathways', 'protocols', 'care model', 'care map', 'multidisciplinary care', evidence-based care' and 'guideline'.

Conclusions

The criteria used for the identification of relevant studies for this Cochrane Review can be used as a foundation for the development of a standardised, internationally accepted definition of a clinical pathway.

### What is a clinical pathway? Development of a definition to inform the debate [^111oYftK]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Application of criteria

The weighted criteria were applied to 260 full text articles. Two review authors independently screened articles to assess which studies met the criteria for a clinical pathway and the Cochrane methodological quality criteria. The Cochrane methodological criteria relates to minimum quality standards for quantitative studies using randomised controlled trial, controlled clinical trial, controlled before and after and interrupted time series study designs. Unresolved disagreements on inclusion were referred to a third review author. In all, 63 papers were excluded as they did not meet the criteria defining a clinical pathway. Only two studies needed to be referred to a third review author because of disagreement on a study meeting the minimum definition criteria.

A total of 27 studies were included on both definition and methodological criteria in the final review. In all, 14 studies termed their intervention a clinical pathway whilst 8 others referred to their intervention as a 'protocol'. No other term was used more than once. The remaining terms used for what we included as a clinical pathway were 'care model', 'care map', 'multidisciplinary care', 'evidence-based care' and 'guideline'.

### 2019 methodology for creating expert consensus decision pathways: a report of the American college of cardiology [^112YGUax]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Expert Consensus Decision Pathways methodology — purpose and scope are described as complementing Clinical Practice Guidelines by providing "the how", including practical guidance that transforms recommendations into clinically actionable information, clinical guidance to make sense of quickly-evolving evidence, and dissemination of new information not yet incorporated into guidelines. Expert Consensus Decision Pathways are situated within the American College of Cardiology's "actionable knowledge" strategy and are an important component of "solution sets", articulating concise and focused practical guidance around high-value clinical topics. Of note, the goal of an Expert Consensus Decision Pathway is not to provide a single correct answer, but to encourage clinicians to ask certain questions and consider key factors as they come to their own decision on a treatment plan to be recommended and discussed with their patients. Topics have spanned lipid disorders, antithrombotic therapy and bleeding, valvular heart disease, heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiovascular risk reduction in type 2 diabetes, and tobacco cessation, with scope widening to include guidance on management of conduction disturbances for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and same-day discharge after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), as well as other topics.

### Development of data-driven clinical pathways: the big data clinical evidence-based pathways [^113TKNeM]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2025). High credibility.

The second key element is the correct classification of evidence. The objective and reasonable classification of large amounts of chaotic clinically produced data can convert it into evidence. Evidence can be divided into two categories: diagnosis and therapy. Diagnosis items can be subdivided into imaging, examination, endoscopy, pathology, nuclear medicine, etc, and therapy items can be divided into surgery, anaesthesia, intervention, drugs and consumables. An evidence bank was established according to the classification of diagnosis and therapy items, and the evidence was integrated into CEBPWs for different disease groups according to different needs.

The third key element is evidence value weight. Different 'diagnosis+therapy' groups have different diagnosis and therapy methods, which involve a large number of diagnosis and therapy items. As the diagnosis and therapy items pose huge challenges to medical insurance payment and medical management, it is necessary to analyse the cost of each item based on data. According to a few key principles, the diagnosis of a DIP group accounts for 80% of the total examination cost, corresponding to 20% of the examination items, and these items were clustered and summarised as the evidence of diagnosis value weight. The evidence of therapy value weight is also formed in the same way for therapy items. These key core items must exist in the corresponding disease group to standardise the disease diagnosis and therapy process, ensure the quality of care and objectively fit the cost and medical technology level. Using weight of evidence value makes the formulation of CEBPWs simplified, and the use of data is more targeted and applicable.

### Signaling pathways and potential therapeutic targets in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [^115wbg1W]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common condition associated with critically ill patients, characterized by bilateral chest radiographical opacities with refractory hypoxemia due to noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Despite significant advances, the mortality of ARDS remains unacceptably high, and there are still no effective targeted pharmacotherapeutic agents. With the outbreak of coronavirus disease 19 worldwide, the mortality of ARDS has increased correspondingly. Comprehending the pathophysiology and the underlying molecular mechanisms of ARDS may thus be essential to developing effective therapeutic strategies and reducing mortality. To facilitate further understanding of its pathogenesis and exploring novel therapeutics, this review provides comprehensive information of ARDS from pathophysiology to molecular mechanisms and presents targeted therapeutics. We first describe the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of ARDS that involve dysregulated inflammation, alveolar-capillary barrier dysfunction, impaired alveolar fluid clearance and oxidative stress. Next, we summarize the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways related to the above four aspects of ARDS pathophysiology, along with the latest research progress. Finally, we discuss the emerging therapeutic strategies that show exciting promise in ARDS, including several pharmacologic therapies, microRNA-based therapies and mesenchymal stromal cell therapies, highlighting the pathophysiological basis and the influences on signal transduction pathways for their use.

### A taxonomy of early diagnosis research to guide study design and funding prioritisation [^111HE5hR]. British Journal of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

How do patients progress from presentation to diagnosis? (Diagnostic pathway studies)

Diagnostic pathways comprise the sequence of different healthcare encounters, investigations, and decisions in a patient's journey to diagnosis. For example, in symptomatic lung cancer patients, different pathways might encompass visiting a GP with a prodromal feature, being sent for a chest X-ray, referred to a respiratory outpatient department or having an emergency admission.

A diagnostic pathway begins when a patient first recognises a symptom and ends when the correct diagnosis is made. During this pathway patients typically present to healthcare in three ways, as described in Fig. 1. A small number of additional patients who experience minimal or no prodromal features may have unheralded diagnoses, only recorded on their death certificate. Variation in the proportion of patients presenting through each route may be indicators of our ability to diagnose a condition electively.

Fig. 1
Typical presentations that may be encompassed in the diagnostic pathway.

Patients may experience one or more of these presentations during their diagnostic pathway.

Walter et al. note two initial patient-dependent stages of the diagnostic pathway – the "appraisal" and "help-seeking" stages. These stages cannot be identified from structured electronic health record data, and require alternative approaches, such as free-text or qualitative interviews with patients and clinicians which may be more susceptible to bias. As such, diagnostic pathway studies using EHRs will typically focus on identifying pathways from first presentation through to diagnosis.

Identifying patient-level diagnostic pathways and analysing patterns at population-level produces a map of the routes through which patients typically first present and then progress towards a final diagnosis via tests, prescriptions, and referrals. In the context of diseases with diagnostic guidelines, the proportion of patients diagnosed via guideline-concordant pathways can help assess the success of quality improvement initiatives. Similarly, the "optimality" of different pathways can be assessed by comparing their associations with prognosis and patient experience, or through clinician ranking.

### Equity in cancer care: pathways, protocols, and guidelines [^113mRj3x]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2012). Low credibility.

The quality of patient care varies based on numerous factors, such as health care setting, geographic location, access to medications, insurance coverage, and treatment protocols. Recently, the issue of whether use of clinical pathways can reduce costs and inappropriate variability in care has been the subject of much debate. As clinical treatment guidelines and pathways are increasingly deployed in oncology practice, they have a growing impact on the quality of treatment and how it is delivered. To fulfill the current need to discuss the use of pathways and clinical treatment guidelines in oncology and to address how patient care is impacted by their use, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network convened the NCCN Oncology Policy Summit: Equity in Cancer Care-Pathways, Protocols, and Guidelines. The summit was a forum to discuss the use and implementation of pathways, including how much flexibility pathways should allow in care, pathways' impact on public and private health insurance benefit design, what data is used to select pathway regimens and protocols, and ultimately what impact pathways may have on variation in care. The use and implementation of clinical treatment guidelines in practice was also explored from a variety of perspectives.

Overcoming barriers to delivery of care in HFpEF — diagnosis and management are challenging due to multifactorial etiologies and a heterogeneous population, leading to difficulties communicating diagnoses and uncertainty in managing older individuals with more comorbidities and less consistency in guideline-directed medical therapy. Improvements in care delivery require overcoming perception bias, improving access to knowledgeable clinicians, understanding when referral to cardiovascular and HF specialists may be warranted, effective team-based care, clear communication at transitions, and appropriate timing of palliative care.

Much has changed in the treatment of cancer since the first NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) were rolled out for 8 different tumor types in November 1996. NCCN Guidelines now include involved algorithms often containing multiple treatment alternatives and detailed pathways of care that depend on more-specific patient characteristics and molecular tumor diagnostics. With 47 different individual NCCN panels, all members of the cancer care team are now better informed than ever to guide patients through the often complex decision-making required to improve the odds of successful outcomes. At the NCCN 20th Annual Conference, a distinguished panel assembled to take a closer look at these invaluable clinical practice guidelines, first glancing backward to how it all started and then forward to explore the key ingredients of trustworthy guidelines.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic care pathway for fibromyalgia [^111tKsUY]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Early diagnosis and timely and appropriate treatments positively influence the history of fibromyalgia syndrome (FM), with favourable repercussions at clinical, psychological, social and economic levels. Notwithstanding, there are still significant problems with timeliness of diagnosis, access to pharmacological therapies - particularly to innovative ones - and appropriate and effective taking in charge of patients. All the aforementioned factors have a great impact on FM patients' quality of life. Indeed, even though the World Health Organisation recognised FM as a chronic condition in the International Classification of Diseases 10th edition (ICD-10), many countries still fail to recognise the syndrome, and this negatively influences the capability to appropriately protect and care for patients. This is the case in several European Countries. In Italy, a few Regions have started to put in place precise indications for people suffering from FM, aiming at the implementation of diagnostic-therapeutic pathways. The Diagnostic-Therapeutic Care Pathway (DTCP) provides an important tool to meet the needs of patients suffering from chronic diseases. They present the organisation of an integrated assistance network. This includes a seamless path for disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment, by means of cooperation among physicians and other healthcare professionals.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on strategies and criteria for the diagnosis and management of Myocarditis: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^115RJbX3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway — scope, diagnostic framework, and management principles — states that the principal focus is on adults with acute myocarditis, provides new diagnostic criteria, and proposes a new 4-stage classification; management varies by severity, stage, and specific etiology, and identification of specific etiologies is important to allow prompt initiation of appropriate treatment strategies and supportive care. It emphasizes that timely referral of severe myocarditis patients to specialists and medical centers with advanced diagnostic and management capabilities such as transplant and mechanical circulatory support is critically important, and defines indications for referral to allow timely consideration of advanced therapies in high-risk patients. Surveillance strategy, monitoring for recovery, and recommended activity restrictions vary according to severity of presentation, specific etiology, comorbidities, and clinical trajectory, and the document addresses indications for surveillance of recovery and guidance for return to activity. The document also notes that health insurance coverage may not include repeat imaging and/or testing following myocarditis diagnosis or initial testing with advanced imaging in the outpatient setting, even though patients may require repeat diagnostic evaluation to ascertain resolution of previously documented cardiac abnormalities, to define prognosis, and/or for consideration of additional therapies such as guideline-directed management of cardiomyopathy or HF should they develop cardiac dysfunction.

### Emerging systemic treatments for asthma and allergic diseases: new tricks, same dog? [^111akFfW]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma and allergic diseases are heterogeneous conditions driven by complex immunological pathways, with type 2 (T2) inflammation being a key but not exclusive component. Advances in immunology have spurred interest in a breadth of mechanisms and innovative therapeutic strategies, including novel targets, extended dosing intervals, and combined-target therapies. This clinical commentary provides a critical overview of ongoing clinical trials and emerging evidence supporting the use of these therapies in asthma and other allergic conditions. We evaluate and summarize emerging systemic treatments across four mechanistic categories: T2 cytokine inhibitors, alarmin blockers, effector cell modulators, and therapies targeting unconventional, broad immune, and non-T2 inflammation pathways. For each category, we present balanced perspectives on therapeutic potential and limitations. While certain therapies demonstrate promise, particularly in T2-high phenotypes, challenges remain in identifying predictive biomarkers, understanding long-term safety, and addressing non-T2 mechanisms. The commentary concludes with outcomes measurement recommendations and outlines urgent knowledge gaps requiring targeted research to optimize precision treatment strategies for diverse patient populations with asthma and allergic diseases.

### The promise of metabolic phenotyping in gastroenterology and hepatology [^112gDfbH]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Medium credibility.

Disease risk and treatment response are determined, at the individual level, by a complex history of genetic and environmental interactions, including those with our endogenous microbiomes. Personalized health care requires a deep understanding of patient biology that can now be measured using a range of '-omics' technologies. Patient stratification involves the identification of genetic and/or phenotypic disease subclasses that require different therapeutic strategies. Stratified medicine approaches to disease diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response monitoring herald a new dimension in patient care. Here, we explore the potential value of metabolic profiling as applied to unmet clinical needs in gastroenterology and hepatology. We describe potential applications in a number of diseases, with emphasis on large-scale population studies as well as metabolic profiling on the individual level, using spectrometric and imaging technologies that will leverage the discovery of mechanistic information and deliver novel health care solutions to improve clinical pathway management.

### What is a clinical pathway? Refinement of an operational definition to identify clinical pathway studies for a cochrane systematic review [^116RqJQS]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Worldwide CPW implementation and usage in healthcare is on the rise. The lack of an agreed-upon definition of a CPW and what is not a CPW remains a significant challenge for many CPW researchers and clinicians. This paper describes the process of developing, refining, and pilot testing a set of criteria to be used for a practical operational definition for CPWs in healthcare, following the Kinsman et al. and Wieland et al. approach.

Future researchers considering the development, implementation, and evaluation of CPWs should adopt the developed definition or modify them to fit into their future research. This will advance the discourse towards an internationally agreed-upon definition of what constitutes a CPW in healthcare.

### Network medicine in disease analysis and therapeutics [^115yQ6EJ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Two parallel trends are occurring in drug discovery. The first is that we are moving away from a symptom-based disease classification system to a system based on molecules and molecular states. The second is that we are shifting from targeting a single molecule toward targeting multiple molecules, pathways, or networks. Network medicine is an approach to understanding disease and discovering therapeutics looking at many molecules and how they interrelate, and it may play a critical role in the adoption of both trends.

### Pathway and network-based strategies to translate genetic discoveries into effective therapies [^111tqSnG]. Human Molecular Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

One way to design a drug is to attempt to phenocopy a genetic variant that is known to have the desired effect. In general, drugs that are supported by genetic associations progress further in the development pipeline. However, the number of associations that are candidates for development into drugs is limited because many associations are in non-coding regions or difficult to target genes. Approaches that overlay information from pathway databases or biological networks can expand the potential target list. In cases where the initial variant is not targetable or there is no variant with the desired effect, this may reveal new means to target a disease. In this review, we discuss recent examples in the domain of pathway and network-based drug repositioning from genetic associations. We highlight important caveats and challenges for the field, and we discuss opportunities for further development.

### Designing the next-generation clinical care pathway for Alzheimer's disease [^1133hcnB]. Nature Aging (2022). High credibility.

The reconceptualization of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a clinical and biological construct has facilitated the development of biomarker-guided, pathway-based targeted therapies, many of which have reached late-stage development with the near-term potential to enter global clinical practice. These medical advances mark an unprecedented paradigm shift and requires an optimized global framework for clinical care pathways for AD. In this Perspective, we describe the blueprint for transitioning from the current, clinical symptom-focused and inherently late-stage diagnosis and management of AD to the next-generation pathway that incorporates biomarker-guided and digitally facilitated decision-making algorithms for risk stratification, early detection, timely diagnosis, and preventative or therapeutic interventions. We address critical and high-priority challenges, propose evidence-based strategic solutions, and emphasize that the perspectives of affected individuals and care partners need to be considered and integrated.

### Proteomic analyses unveil actionable disease pathways in COVID-19: a step toward targeted therapies [^1117mnJE]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2022). Medium credibility.

There has been an important progress in the pursuit of precision COVID-19 treatments over the past year. This study adds important information on actionable pathways that could serve to repurpose medications and investigate novel therapies. Unfortunately, crude treatment assignments based on clinical inclusion criteria rather than genetic and biomarker data are still the norm. Thus, several patients are left behind at the moment of considering targeted therapies for critical situations. Therefore, validation of actionable pathways of disease in COVID-19 and identification of subphenotypes based on biomarker/multimodal data could offer new opportunities to reapproach targeted medicine. This unbiassed approach could potentially assist in providing the most benefit to our patients with the least harm.

Personalized treatment strategy

Managing IBD requires personalized strategies due to its diverse phenotypes, variable disease progression, and outcomes. AI has the potential to revolutionize IBD care by processing patient data, including medical history and treatment outcomes, to generate tailored treatment recommendations that align with individual needs and preferences. This not only enhances patient adherence and clinical outcomes but also optimizes direct and indirect costs including payers' financial returns. By integrating omics data, historical records, and predictive treatment responses, AI can uncover patterns and biomarkers that guide the selection of the most effective therapies for each patient. Additionally, as the medicine cabinet for IBD expands, offering novel therapeutic options such as Janus kinase inhibitors, S1P receptor modulators, and anti-integrin therapies. AI can integrate emerging data on these agents to refine their positioning within treatment algorithms and ensure their appropriate use in clinical practice.

It has been reported that single therapeutic agents often reach a plateau with limited remission ratesrecognized as the "therapeutic ceiling". This could be due to multiple pathological pathways driving the inflammatory process in the IBD. Treatment strategies involving combination of established single agents could be an alternative approach to address the complex inflammatory pathways. The existing biologic therapies for IBD are supported by predictive models and clinical decision-support tools, yet there is room to improve their evaluation and application.– AI's capacity to refine these tools and assess their predictive performance can lead to more precise treatment strategies, resulting in better patient outcomes and more effective disease management.

AI and ML algorithms can forecast disease trajectories from diagnosis, enabling clinicians to determine the most suitable treatment pathways. These algorithms excel at detecting patterns within structured data while MLP tools provide insights from unstructured sources such as clinical notes and patient-reported outcomes, supporting the creation of highly individualized management and treatment care plans.

Current Therapies

There are several inhibitors of neurohormonal and adrenergic pathways with well-proven efficacy to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with DCM associated with reduced systolic function. Recent trials of inhibitors of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 have unexpectedly shown additive benefit in patients, independent of the presence of diabetes. None of these trials have included genetic information, and therefore it is unclear whether specific genetic subtypes of familial DCM derive differential benefit. For HCM and ACM, there is no currently proven disease-modifying benefit of any of these classes of drugs, and medical treatment of these conditions is limited to medications and procedures that provide symptomatic relief.

### Imaging pathways: will they be well trodden or less traveled? [^111sXbpK]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Evidence of inappropriate investigations is not hard to find, and these result in a range of adverse clinical and economic outcomes. An online, evidence-based education and decision support application called Diagnostic Imaging Pathways (DIP) has been developed to assist clinicians to request the most appropriate examinations in the best sequence to achieve diagnoses. The development of the clinical and academic content of DIP and its continuous review and revision involve a network of specialists and general practitioners coordinated by an editorial panel. A research fellow is employed to search the literature, evaluate the evidence, and draft pathways for review. An information technologist develops the Web site, including new functionality, as the scope of the application is expanded. Dissemination is straightforward, with DIP being freely available on the Web (http://www.imagingpathways.health.wa.gov.au). Raising awareness of DIP beyond the immediate clinical environment is challenging. This is assisted through the development of partnerships with national and international entities, which have the core purpose of encouraging evidence-based clinical practice. The greatest challenge, however, is implementation; that is, achieving compliance between requesting practice and recommendations. There is a need to embed DIP into the clinical workflow such that clinicians are guided to choose the "correct" examination. One strategy is to replace paper-based referral processes with an electronic process and to progressively link "electronic requesting" to decision support. Evaluated trials are planned to bring the strategy to the stage of "proof of concept" in Australia.

### Pathways to new drug discovery in neuropsychiatry [^113Txuu3]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Future direction and conclusions

The receding tide of infective disorders, trauma, and many major medical disorders, resulting from improved general medical preventative, diagnostic and treatment strategies, leaves psychiatric disorders exposed as the predominant burden of disability in the developed world. The imperative to discover new treatments is clear, not only because of the aforementioned issues, but because of the limitations of established treatments. It is clear that we need to move beyond high-throughput screening of compounds aimed at historical targets; we need to explore fundamentally different pathways to drug discovery such as genetics. However, as noted, this is a high-risk, very low-probability, albeit high-return scenario. Increasing attention to biomarker-indicated targets is likely to be a very promising avenue, but we must not lose sight of the fact that serendipity and keen clinical and scientific observation remains the most fruitful pathway for the discovery of novel therapies.

### Improving the diagnosis of hyperphagia in melanocortin-4 receptor pathway diseases [^114onVzj]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Dysfunction of the MC4R pathway results in hyperphagia and reduced energy expenditure, contributing to early‐onset, severe obesity. The associated hyperphagia is a pathophysiological driver of severe obesity in patients with MC4R pathway diseases. It has significant negative effects on health and quality of life for patients and their families. There is a need to understand when and how a patient with obesity should be assessed for hyperphagia. Although clinical assessments for hyperphagia are available, they are limited, and validated tools for such evaluation need to be developed and implemented, including across a spectrum of developmental ages. A better understanding of the features of genetic diseases can help identify and diagnose an individual's MC4R pathway disease and hyperphagia. Recommended guidelines and appropriate diagnostic tools should be adapted, especially as our understanding and continued advances in genetics identify novel genes that are associated with early‐onset, severe obesity.

### What is a clinical pathway? Development of a definition to inform the debate [^116LXYQ8]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This paper described the developmental process undertaken to devise criteria to define a clinical pathway. Researchers who are developing and evaluating clinical pathways or attempting to synthesise the existing literature should consider the usefulness of these criteria for their studies. It is also recommended that these criteria be used as a basis for ongoing development of a standardised, internationally accepted definition of a clinical pathway.

### What is the clinical value of mHealth for patients? [^112DKrjw]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The scope of mHealth functionalities that have shown clinical evidence for patient care

One approach to categorization of mHealth apps which is used in the UK by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the National Health Service (NHS) is by their functionality. This functional classification is a basis for comparisons of levels of evidence for apps in clinical medicine. The functional categories of mHealth apps most relevant to use in clinical practice are addressed within this article and include the following:
support clinical diagnosis and/or decision making;
improve clinical outcomes from established treatment pathways through behavior change and enhancement of patient adherence and compliance with treatment;
act as standalone digital therapeutics; and
primarily to deliver disease related education.

In this section we consider the value to patients of mHealth apps in each of these categories. Other categories of mHealth apps with functionalities such as care coordination, health information portals, and those designed for rehabilitation are not included in this review.

### What is a clinical pathway? Refinement of an operational definition to identify clinical pathway studies for a cochrane systematic review [^114EZc3f]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical pathways (CPWs) are a common component in the quest to improve the quality of health. CPWs are used to reduce variation, improve quality of care, and maximize the outcomes for specific groups of patients. An ongoing challenge is the operationalization of a definition of CPW in healthcare. This may be attributable to both the differences in definition and a lack of conceptualization in the field of clinical pathways. This correspondence article describes a process of refinement of an operational definition for CPW research and proposes an operational definition for the future syntheses of CPWs literature. Following the approach proposed by Kinsman et al. (BMC Medicine 8(1):31, 2010) and Wieland et al. (Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine 17(2):50, 2011), we used a four-stage process to generate a five criteria checklist for the definition of CPWs. We refined the operational definition, through consensus, merging two of the checklist's criteria, leading to a more inclusive criterion for accommodating CPW studies conducted in various healthcare settings. The following four criteria for CPW operational definition, derived from the refinement process described above, are (1) the intervention was a structured multidisciplinary plan of care; (2) the intervention was used to translate guidelines or evidence into local structures; (3) the intervention detailed the steps in a course of treatment or care in a plan, pathway, algorithm, guideline, protocol or other 'inventory of actions' (i.e. the intervention had time-frames or criteria-based progression); and (4) the intervention aimed to standardize care for a specific population. An intervention meeting all four criteria was considered to be a CPW. The development of operational definitions for complex interventions is a useful approach to appraise and synthesize evidence for policy development and quality improvement.

### The biomarkers consortium: on the critical path of drug discovery [^114yXhkQ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Recent advances in science have provided a variety of genetic, genomic, and protein-based methods to treat human diseases. These advances, and equally great strides in in vivo imaging and methods of tissue collection, have created an unprecedented opportunity to discover and develop biological markers of human disease. A biomarker is defined as a molecular, biological, or physical characteristic that indicates a specific physiologic state (see Table 1 for definitions). It is used in clinical practice to identify risk for disease, diagnose disease and its severity, guide intervention strategies, and monitor patient responses to therapy. When used in a clinical research setting, biomarkers may predict whether a drug or other intervention is safe and effective in a shorter time and at lower cost than clinical outcomes studies. For these and other reasons, including the ability to stratify patient groups based on objective criteria, biomarkers help promote regulatory approval of new therapeutic entities by pharmaceutical, biological, and device development teams.

Discussions and implications of the pathway — The primary objective of this updated ECDP is "to provide a framework for the many decisions required in the management of patients with HFrEF", and its checklists and algorithms "should be applied only in the context of the most recent update to the AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline" with the caution that "No guideline, pathway, or algorithm should ever supersede clinical judgment". Management of HFrEF "often involves multidisciplinary care, may require complex decision-making", and broader clinician experience in GDMT "would be expected to significantly benefit affected patients". In light of evolving diagnostics, therapeutics, and guidelines, the document notes that "we have highlighted important literature citations explaining the rationale for this changing picture in HFrEF care, candidate best practices, and, where evidence or best practices are lacking, templates for clinical decision-making to manage patients rationally", and that "As more evidence emerges, many more topics will be clarified".

### What is a clinical pathway? Development of a definition to inform the debate [^1157Wft4]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In 2003, it was reported that clinical pathways had been implemented in more than 80% of hospitals in the USA. This represents an enormous resource commitment both in the development of pathways, the training of staff, and in the ongoing implementation of pathways in the hospital setting. In this era of evidence informed practice, it is therefore problematic that individual studies of the impact of clinical pathways are varied and contradictory and that there is still no standardised definition of what a 'clinical pathway' actually constitutes. In fact, a recent literature review identified 84 different terms that may mean a clinical pathway. These included (amongst others) care map, care pathway, critical pathway, integrated care pathway, protocol and guideline.

This lack of a uniformly accepted definition of what constitutes a clinical pathway impacts on capacity to empirically test the evidence base and compromises planning, resourcing, development and implementation of clinical pathways. A lack of consensus regarding research outcomes is not surprising given the lack of agreement regarding what defines a clinical pathway.

Our team of researchers faced this issue when devising the protocol for a Cochrane systematic review of the impact of clinical pathways in hospitals. The development of minimum criteria to define a clinical pathway was required to ensure that appropriate studies were sourced and included in the review. The aim of this paper is to describe the developmental process undertaken and the resulting criteria so that other researchers who are developing and evaluating clinical pathways or attempting to synthesise the existing literature can consider the usefulness of these criteria for their studies.

Top 10 key takeaway points — genetics and return to activity: Given the increasing recognition of genetic predisposition to myocarditis, genetic counseling and testing is advised for all consenting patients, and discovery of a pathogenic variant should be followed by cascade screening of family members for clinical surveillance and, when appropriate, guideline-directed medical management and therapy. Safety for return to strenuous physical activity is guided by a follow-up CMR, 24-hour monitoring for arrhythmia, and exercise testing.

In an attempt to bridge these gaps, the consortium has produced two technical documents: "Discussion paper on Engagement Criteria for MAPPs" 9 is essentially about prioritization ("why to engage"), while "Seamless Process and Decision Points of an Adaptive Pathway" 10 is process focused ("when and how to engage").

In this article we describe the background and divergent starting points of the discussions and synthesize the broad lines of consensus delineated in the documents. Other elements of the MAPPs concept, such as the pros and cons of MAPPs for individual stakeholder groups or methodological considerations for knowledge generation, managed entry agreements, or on‐market monitoring and ensuring appropriate utilization, have been addressed by the consortium 1 but are outside the scope of this article.

### Standardize to excellence: improving the quality and safety of care with clinical pathways [^111nTHwY]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Providing practitioners with locally developed, consensus-driven, evidence-based clinical pathways can improve the quality of care by (1) incorporating national guidelines and recommendations into routine care practices, increasing the use of validated practice; 2) reducing unnecessary variation in care by a single physician or group of physicians, improving efficiency and timeliness and reducing disparities; and (3) standardizing care processes, improving safety. Pathways make it easier to identify opportunities for future improvements in care processes while simultaneously making those improvements easier to enact. Pediatric hospitalists have a vital role in creating, implementing, evaluating, and improving clinical pathways. Involving house staff enriches the scholarly components of pathway development while actively engaging them in the science and practice of quality improvement.

### Pharmacological treatment of chorea in Huntington's disease-good clinical practice versus evidence-based guideline [^111sJvGg]. Movement Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

From Evidence-Based to Expert Opinion: Is There a Need for Both?

In conclusion, the guideline in its current form may be misleading and does not provide reference to treatment recommendations by experts or to standards established in common clinical practice.–Uncritical application of this guideline may result in an increased incidence of side effects and potential harm to patients.

In part, this may be due to the fact that, in the process applied during the development of this AAN guideline, results of secondary endpoints from randomized clinical trials primarily designed to answer other questions were included. Although this may be useful for scientific discussion, clinical conclusions from these results may be biased and should not be directly translated into clinical guidelines. Accordingly, a recent Cochrane review applying criteria of evidence-based medicine concluded that no statement can be made regarding the best medical practice for the control of motor and nonmotor symptoms in HD.

In this context, it should be considered that treatment recommendations in diseases with lower prevalence often lack the necessary clinical trials to document effects of clinically well-established therapies, as required by current evidence-based medicine criteria. Thus, expert opinions may be preferable to obtain meaningful guidelines. Although the authors of AAN guidelines are certainly aware of these limitations, it may be worth discussing whether formally correct analyzes like that under discussion here should be published as "guidelines" — a title suggestive of direct translatability into clinical practice.

Yet how can meaningful, less disputed recommendations be established and provide a readily accessible reference for clinical practice? Recently, a pragmatic pathway for treating chorea in HD was developed based on a questionnaire that was presented to 52 HD experts mainly from North America and Europe, as mentioned above. The results guided the design of a clinical pathway based on this expert experience; a slightly modified version is provided as flow-chart in Figure 1 to guide clinicians through the currently established options and criteria for selecting available pharmacologic interventions. In contrast to the original pathway, this revision includes the option to change from an antipsychotic drug (off-label) to tetrabenazine, or vice versa. It also forces a decision in favor of antipsychotics in case depression, psychosis, aggression, or noncompliance are present. Recommended antipsychotic drugs and their starting and maximal doses are listed in Table 1.

Method

We undertook a four-stage process aiming to develop evidence-informed and practical criteria to define a clinical pathway. The four stages were: (1) identify publications exploring the scope and definition of clinical pathways (or similar terms); (2) synthesise previously suggested components and derive draft criteria for testing; (3) pilot test the level of agreement between review authors when applying criteria to identified studies; and (4) modify criteria to maximise agreement between review authors.

Diagnosis of myocarditis — clinical symptoms: The initial step for a clinician in the assessment of a patient with possible myocarditis is to recognize that a clinical scenario is consistent with this diagnosis, and clinicians should be aware of 3 classic presentations — chest pain, arrhythmia, or heart failure (HF)/cardiogenic shock. The history of an antecedent viral infection in a young person, a prior diagnosis of myocarditis or autoimmune disease, a family history of cardiomyopathy or unexplained sudden death, or exposure to known cardiotoxin followed by related symptoms should raise the suspicion for this condition.

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on comprehensive multidisciplinary care for the patient With cardiac amyloidosis: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^113JQnzh]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

American College of Cardiology Expert Consensus Decision Pathway methods — process and governance: The ACC created the Heart House Roundtables, a structured format of interactive discussion among a broad group of stakeholders, to address high-value topics and issues that clinicians and patients face daily, such as the diagnosis and management of cardiac amyloidosis, and recognizing the impact of trials and approved medications, discussions focused on real-world challenges for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. To bridge a communication gap, a writing committee of multidisciplinary experts was convened in 2022 to develop an ECDP providing guidance on diagnosis, management, identification of extracardiac manifestations, and timely referral; for this update, the writing committee convened in mid-2022 via conference calls attended only by writing committee members and ACC staff. Differences were resolved by consensus, and no portions of the ECDP required administrative decision overrides; the work was supported only by the ACC with no commercial support, and writing committee members were all unpaid volunteers.

Disease gene expression profiles can be utilized as biomarkers for diagnostic, prognostic, and targeted therapeutic purposes, although individual data sets may be of limited generic value. To develop broader clinical relevance from disease gene signatures, Inkeles et al. demonstrate how mining publically available microarray data from a range of skin disorders can elucidate disease pathways, generate a multi-disease classifier, and identify potential therapeutic targets. This integrative molecular classification and functional analysis offers a new approach to understanding disease pathogenesis, with significant implications for diagnostics and the development of personalized medicine.

### Diagnostic pathways in Crohn's disease [^113imicT]. Clinical Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

The management of Crohn's disease (CD) is shifting from a stepwise, incremental approach based on symptom control to more aggressive early combined immunosuppression in an attempt to induce remission more rapidly and avoid long-term bowel damage. Accurately defining disease activity is a major challenge, as there is often a disconnect between symptomatology and underlying disease status. The role of imaging in CD has evolved such that it now plays a central role establishing the initial diagnosis, characterising disease phenotype, activity assessment, disease surveillance, and assessing response to therapy. Furthermore, the "treat-to-target" approach is being investigated in CD, with resolution of transmural inflammation on cross-sectional imaging being the treatment goal. In this review, we summarise the principal imaging techniques available to the radiologist, the key findings, and provide some guidance on the preferred imaging option in the diagnostic pathway. We consider the relative merits and drawbacks of each imaging technique before offering a brief discussion of some current developments and research avenues in CD imaging. We discuss how imaging may be useful in a "treat-to-target" approach. Finally, we highlight some practical considerations around service configuration and delivery to optimise imaging in CD in an accurate, cost-effective manner.

### Table of pharmacogenetic associations… [^117Mbrmc]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Pharmacogenetic tests, along with other information about patients and their disease or condition, can play an important role in drug therapy. When a health care provider is considering prescribing a drug, knowledge of a patient's genotype may be used to aid in determining a therapeutic strategy, determining an appropriate dosage, or assessing the likelihood of benefit or toxicity. On this page:

- About the Table
- **Section 1**: Pharmacogenetic Associations for which the Data Support Therapeutic Management Recommendations
- **Section 2**: Pharmacogenetic Associations for which the Data Indicate a Potential Impact on Safety or Response
- **Section 3**: Pharmacogenetic Associations for which the Data Demonstrate a Potential Impact on Pharmacokinetic Properties Only
- Updates to the Table
- Additional Resources.

About the Table For the pharmacogenetic associations listed in this table, the FDA has evaluated and believes there is sufficient scientific evidence to suggest that subgroups of patients with certain genetic variants, or genetic variant-inferred phenotypes, are likely to have altered drug metabolism, and in certain cases, differential therapeutic effects, including differences in risks of adverse events. The FDA recognizes that practitioners will take into account different sources and strengths of evidence and will make prescribing decisions based on their judgment about which treatments are appropriate for individual patients.

In particular, each patient's genetic makeup is only one of many factors that may impact drug concentrations and response, highlighting the fact that information provided in this table is limited to certain pharmacogenetic associations only and does not provide comprehensive information needed for safe and effective use of a drug. This version of the table is limited to pharmacogenetic associations that are related to drug metabolizing enzyme gene variants, drug transporter gene variants, and gene variants that have been related to a predisposition for certain adverse events. The FDA recognizes that various other pharmacogenetic associations exist that are not listed here, and this table will be updated periodically with additional pharmacogenetic associations supported by sufficient scientific evidence.

The FDA has opened a docket for stakeholders — including scientific and medical communities, patients, providers, and industry — to offer specific comments on pharmacogenetic associations that the FDA should or should not include in this table, along with the rationale and underlying evidence that supports the pharmacogenetic association. Please submit all comments to the open docket. Please submit any questions to PGx@fda. hhs. gov. Select initial dosage, taking into account clinical and genetic factors.

### What is a clinical pathway? Refinement of an operational definition to identify clinical pathway studies for a cochrane systematic review [^112W6HGw]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Refined criteria for CPW operational definition

The four criteria derived from the refinement process described above are (1) Is it a structured multidisciplinary care plan? (2) Is it used to channel the translation of guidelines or evidence into local structures? (3) Does it detail the steps in a course of treatment or care in a plan, pathway, algorithm, guideline, protocol or other 'inventory of actions' (i.e. the intervention had time frames or criteria based progression)? (4) Does it aim to standardize care for a specific clinical problem, procedure or episode of care in a specific population?

Henceforth, an intervention was considered a CPW if it contained all of the four criteria in the new operational definition. Subsequently, the new definition will be applied to identify (1) relevant titles and abstracts for an on-going update of a Cochrane systematic review on CPWs in hospitals, and (2) a new Cochrane systematic review on CPWs in primary care.

Prospectively, the systematic review will follow the validated Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) methodology for complex interventions, and will consider randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, controlled before and after, and interrupted time series study designs.

### Unbiased discovery of cancer pathways and therapeutics using pathway ensemble tool and benchmark [^113Jo99F]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The pathogenesis of complex diseases is often underpinned by dysregulation of several cellular pathways. This is well exemplified by neoplastic diseases, where abnormalities in multiple pathways contribute to cancerous transformation or in which cancer-disposing events perturb multiple cellular pathways. Despite notable successes in some cancers, limited therapeutic gains have been made by identification and targeting of single contributory genes. Precisely pinpointing key dysregulated celluar pathways in cancer and ranking them by order of importance is, therefore, of major biological and clinical significance. Doing so would enable molecular subtyping, determination of diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and inform choice of effective and cancer-specific drug regimens. This is especially important at the present time because the incidence of cancer is increasing.

The contemporary approach to elucidate aberrations in biological pathways is dominated by omics methods, such as RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). As expected, vast amounts of omics data have been generated for most cancers. However, unlocking their full potential has remained challenging. Biological pathway analysis, a computational search to identify and rank by importance the key relevant and/or dysregulated pathways among the thousands of known potential biological pathways, is a critical means for deciphering these data. Numerous in silico methods (reviewed here,), for example GSEAand Enrichr, have been developed and broadly applied to conduct pathway analyses. One common application of these methods has been to test whether specific pathways hypothesized by researchers are, in fact, enriched in a dataset. In this approach, pathway enrichment analyses have generally proven successful, but pre-suppose a priori knowledge or hypothesis. An alternative, highly desired application, especially in the context of exponentially growing omics datasets, is the adoption of unbiased discovery-based approaches. Here, the objective is to rank the "correct pathways" above all other pathways in the reported results without imparting bias from a priori knowledge. However, the performance and suitability of existing pathway analysis methods for this form of blinded or unbiased discovery remains largely unknown. In other words, it is not known how often the top pathway(s) returned by an analysis method represent(s) the most important perturbation. This is likely due to the fact that most methods were developed and evaluated ("benchmarked") using computer simulated pathwaysor verified only in very small scale biological datasets from historical, low-resolution microarray technology. Therefore, a key limitation is lack of proper benchmarking and assessment of the capacity of these tools for pathway discovery under experimental settings, which often contain substantial "noise" due to stochastic events and biological variations. Such lack of a suitable evaluation platform predicated on large-scale experimental data significantly impedes informed deployment of pathway analysis tools for blinded discovery of perturbations in cancer.

### An update on autophagy disorders [^116aMbvL]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

6 CONCLUSION

Monogenic disorders of autophagy are a group of inherited diseases that affect core and selective autophagy as well as intricately linked pathways, leading to a multitude of clinical manifestations. While the clinical features of monogenic disorders of autophagy are diverse and can affect multiple organ systems, there are common clinico‐pathological signatures that may prompt clinicians to consider this important and evolving group of (neuro)metabolic conditions in their differential diagnosis. Recent basic and translational studies have enabled a deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying these complex and variable disorders and may enable future therapy development.

### Advances in the diagnosis of inherited neuromuscular diseases and implications for therapy development [^115BYVse]. The Lancet: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Advances in DNA sequencing technologies have resulted in a near doubling, in under 10 years, of the number of causal genes identified for inherited neuromuscular disorders. However, around half of patients, whether children or adults, do not receive a molecular diagnosis after initial diagnostic workup. Massively parallel technologies targeting RNA, proteins, and metabolites are being increasingly used to diagnose these unsolved cases. The use of these technologies to delineate pathways, biomarkers, and therapeutic targets has led to new approaches entering the drug development pipeline. However, these technologies might give rise to misleading conclusions if used in isolation, and traditional techniques including comprehensive neurological evaluation, histopathology, and biochemistry continue to have a crucial role in diagnostics. For optimal diagnosis, prognosis, and precision medicine, no single ruling technology exists. Instead, an interdisciplinary approach combining novel and traditional neurological techniques with computer-aided analysis and international data sharing is needed to advance the diagnosis and treatment of neuromuscular disorders.

### What is a clinical pathway? Refinement of an operational definition to identify clinical pathway studies for a cochrane systematic review [^112pnwb7]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale for refinement of the operational definition for CPWs

A recent attempt by the review team to conduct a systematic review on CPWs in primary care was hampered by the challenge of applying the above operational definition in a primary care setting, with the major problem during the protocol development for the systematic review being the identification of relevant CPW studies in a primary care context.

This is due to the requirements of criteria numbers 3 and 4. The application of these two criteria is problematic, because several articles explicitly met criterion 3 but not criterion 4, or vice versa, and thus had to be excluded.

TR and LK pilot tested the new criteria on five CPWs studies in primary care identified during the protocol development for a systematic review on CPWs in primary care. Consensus was reached among review authors that, by merging the two criteria, the definition would be more inclusive. Thus, the new operational definition for CPWs was narrowed to a four criteria checklist.

### Promising targets for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases [^112nPR7E]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Genetics and pathology have proven to be an effective combination to identify an evolving and deepening landscape of pathways and potential therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative diseases. Initially this landscape appeared to be populated with distinct therapeutic targets but with potentially overlapping mechanisms in each neurodegenerative disease. Our understanding has expanded to recognize that multiple pathologies are common in neurodegenerative disease, and that there is considerable overlap in pathways and targets driving neurodegenerative diseases. This potentially opens the way for future treatments to be indicated by tissue pathology and genetic basis rather than clinical phenotype. The potential to treat neurodegenerative disease by addressing underlying pathophysiology is still in the early days and challenges remain, especially the likely need to address pathologies early in disease. This will require redefinition of diagnosis and the tools to enable earlier diagnosis.

### Pathway-based subnetworks enable cross-disease biomarker discovery [^116RYZyD]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Most human disease is complex, caused by interaction of genetic, epigenetic and environmental insults. A single disease phenotype can often arise in many ways, allowing a diversity of molecular underpinnings to yield a smaller number of phenotypic consequences. This molecular heterogeneity within a single disease is believed to underlie poor clinical trial results for some therapiesand the modest performance of many genome-wide association studies –.

Researchers thus face two challenges. First, molecular markers are needed to personalize and optimize treatment decisions by predicting patient outcome (prognosis/residual risk) and response to therapy. Second, clinical heterogeneity in patient phenotypes needs to be molecularly rationalized to allow targeting of the mechanistic underpinnings of disease. For example, if a single pathway is dysregulated in multiple ways, drugs targeting the pathway could be applied.

Several approaches have been taken to solve these challenges. The most common has been to measure mRNA abundances as a snapshot of cellular state, and to construct a predictive model from them. Unfortunately, these studies have been limited by noise and disease heterogeneity. Several groups have integrated multiple data types using network and systems biology approaches identifying patient subtypes, with limited post-hoc clinical evaluation –. These algorithms have not yet clearly shown how the interplay between different pathways underpins disease etiology, nor generated biomarkers with systematically demonstrated reproducibility on independent patient cohorts across multiple indications.

There is thus an urgent need to generate accurate and actionable biomarkers that integrate diverse molecular, functional and clinical information. We developed a subnetwork-based approach, called SIMMS, which uses arbitrary molecular data types to identify dysregulated pathways and create functional biomarkers. We validate SIMMS across five tumor types and 11,392 patients, using it to create biomarkers from a diverse range of molecular assays and uncovering unanticipated pan-cancer similarities.

### Diagnosis and management of children with atypical neuroinflammation [^111A7vVx]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric neuroimmune disorders comprise a heterogeneous group of immune-mediated CNS inflammatory conditions. Some, such as multiple sclerosis, are well defined by validated diagnostic criteria. Others, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, can be diagnosed with detection of specific autoantibodies. This review addresses neuroimmune disorders that neither feature a diagnosis-defining autoantibody nor meet criteria for a distinct clinicopathologic entity. A broad differential in these cases should include CNS infection, noninflammatory genetic disorders, toxic exposures, metabolic disturbances, and primary psychiatric disorders. Neuroimmune considerations addressed in this review include seronegative autoimmune encephalitis, seronegative demyelinating disorders such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, and genetic disorders of immune dysregulation or secondary neuroinflammation. In such cases, we recommend a broad diagnostic workup to support the presence of neuroinflammation, exclude non-neuroimmune disorders, detect autoantibodies and other biomarkers of known diseases, identify any potential genetic drivers of neuroinflammation, and provide case-specific insights into pathophysiologic mechanisms of inappropriate immune pathway activation or dysregulation. This review includes an extensive list of useful diagnostic tests and potential implications thereof, as well as a proposed algorithm for the diagnosis and management of the pediatric patient with atypical neuroimmune disorders. In general, first-line acute treatment of neuroimmune disorders begins with steroids, along with consideration of plasmapheresis or IV immunoglobulin. Selection of second-line or maintenance therapy is challenging without a definite, specific diagnosis and the associated benefit of established evidence-based treatment options. Immunotherapies may be considered based on the suspected mechanism of neuroinflammation and the likelihood of relapse. For example, rituximab may be considered for possible antibody-mediated or B-cell-mediated inflammation while anti-interleukin (IL)-6 agents, anti-IL-1 agents, or JAK inhibitors may be considered for certain cases of cytokine-mediated inflammation or innate immune system dysregulation. Care should be taken to monitor response and disease activity, revisit the differential diagnosis in the case of unexpected findings or poor treatment response, and weigh the risks of immunotherapy with the benefits of empiric treatment. Over time, further advancements in biomarker identification and omics research may define specific new clinicopathologic diagnoses and thus obviate the need for "n of 1" approaches to what are currently heterogeneous groups of atypical seronegative neuroimmune disorders.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for treatment of heart Failure with reduced ejection Fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^1178McUz]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Heart failure (HF) team-based care — essential skills and program roles are outlined, noting that necessary skills include proficiency in monitoring for HF progression and exacerbation, care coordination, treatment prescription and monitoring, and education for patients and their caregivers; Table 7 lists HF diagnosis and monitoring for progression; treatment prescription, titration, and monitoring; patient and caregiver education on disease and treatments; lifestyle prescription (eg, diet, exercise), education, and monitoring; access to genetic testing and counseling programs; psychological and social support assessment, treatment, and monitoring; palliative and end-of-life counseling and care; coordination of care for concomitant comorbidities; and nutritional counselling. Effective team-based HF care may be possible with small teams if the requisite skills are available. Referral of HFrEF patients to team-based HF medication optimization clinics focused on rapidly initiating and titrating quadruple guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) to target doses can minimize clinical inertia and capitalize on reductions in hospitalizations and mortality, and in one study patients with HFrEF receiving usual care were 3 times more likely to incur a HF hospitalization than patients managed in a medication optimization clinic.

### Proteomics in interstitial lung disease: new insights into pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^116gaHPW]. Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Interstitial lung disease (ILD), representing a heterogeneous group of diffuse parenchymal lung disorders, is characterized by inflammation and/or fibrosis within the alveolar interstitium of the lung. The overlapping clinical manifestations and progressive patterns of ILD subtypes pose substantial challenges for accurate diagnosis and effective disease management. In recent years, application of diverse omics approaches in clinical research has yielded promising insights into complex disease pathophysiology. Among the spectrum of omics technologies, proteomics enables comprehensive characterization of dynamic protein alterations, providing a direct snapshot of the functional state of biological systems, including disease-specific biomarkers and dysregulated pathways. This review highlights recent proteomic discoveries in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), autoimmune ILDs, exposure-related ILDs, sarcoidosis, and other ILDs, along with emerging therapeutic avenues. The key dysregulated pathways and candidate biomarkers that are critical for differential diagnosis, prognosis, disease monitoring, and treatment response assessment are outlined. Most of the proteomic studies are reported in IPF, given its increasing prevalence and heterogeneous disease progression. In summary, pathogenesis of ILD involves a complex interplay among complement activation, humoral immune responses, and extracellular matrix remodeling, with the dysregulation of key pathway mediators varying across disease stages and subtypes. Large cohort studies following uniform experimental methods across diverse ethnic population are essential for validation of these pathways and mediators to advance disease understanding and develop "true" clinical biomarkers with diagnostic and therapeutic utility.

### Role of biomarkers for the prevention, assessment, and management of heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113uDzSt]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Natriuretic peptides have led the way as a diagnostic and prognostic tool for the diagnosis and management of heart failure (HF). More recent evidence suggests that natriuretic peptides along with the next generation of biomarkers may provide added value to medical management, which could potentially lower risk of mortality and readmissions. The purpose of this scientific statement is to summarize the existing literature and to provide guidance for the utility of currently available biomarkers.

Methods

The writing group used systematic literature reviews, published translational and clinical studies, clinical practice guidelines, and expert opinion/statements to summarize existing evidence and to identify areas of inadequacy requiring future research. The panel reviewed the most relevant adult medical literature excluding routine laboratory tests using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science through December 2016. The document is organized and classified according to the American Heart Association to provide specific suggestions, considerations, or contemporary clinical practice recommendations.

Results

A number of biomarkers associated with HF are well recognized, and measuring their concentrations in circulation can be a convenient and noninvasive approach to provide important information about disease severity and helps in the detection, diagnosis, prognosis, and management of HF. These include natriuretic peptides, soluble suppressor of tumorgenicity 2, highly sensitive troponin, galectin-3, midregional proadrenomedullin, cystatin-C, interleukin-6, procalcitonin, and others. There is a need to further evaluate existing and novel markers for guiding therapy and to summarize their data in a standardized format to improve communication among researchers and practitioners.

Conclusions

HF is a complex syndrome involving diverse pathways and pathological processes that can manifest in circulation as biomarkers. A number of such biomarkers are now clinically available, and monitoring their concentrations in blood not only can provide the clinician information about the diagnosis and severity of HF but also can improve prognostication and treatment strategies.

### Interpreting biologically informed neural networks for enhanced proteomic biomarker discovery and pathway analysis [^115CSEmP]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The continuous technological advancements in mass spectrometry-based proteomics have enabled the quantification of hundreds to thousands of proteins in clinical samples extending its reach in biomedical and clinical research. The increasing ability to rapidly analyze a large number of clinical samples provides new opportunities to profile complex biological systems and bridge the gap between translational and clinical research through the investigation of disease mechanisms and the identification of biomarkers. These advances are of interest for many disease areas, such as the study of infectious diseases where the identification of distinct clinical and molecular subphenotypes may impact the development of new treatment regimes. Subphenotypes are typically identified using clinical parameters based on the presented severity of different symptoms of the disease and are difficult to distinguish. Previous work has proposed clinical subphenotypes for COVID-19 – and sepsis –, but the development of targeted treatments for the different subphenotypes remains challenging as the underpinning molecular mechanisms are poorly characterized. To understand these molecular mechanisms, it is therefore critical to analyze the proteins and associated biological pathways of a disease to support the development of precision treatments and provide the best patient care possible.

Currently, a common strategy to identify candidate diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers is based on significantly differentially expressed (DE) proteins between subphenotypes. Substantial research has been conducted on how to optimize DE detection algorithms –, but the process of selecting proteins for further investigation remains unstandardized. In most cases, proteins that pass a p- value and fold-change threshold are considered the most informative, but these thresholds are rule based and potentially eliminate important biological signal. To understand the systemic impact of DE proteins, it is also pertinent to identify which pathways are enriched based on the difference in abundance of the DE proteins. Several tools and databases have been developed to automate this process and to select the most significant pathways based on the proteins that have been identified in DE analysis –. Commonly, the significance of a pathway is determined by counting the number of DE proteins that are connected to the pathway in a database and calculating a p- value based on these connections. This type of analysis typically omits crucial information such as protein abundance, protein co-expression, and pathway co-regulation, and selects the most interesting pathways using p- value cut-offs.

### Development of data-driven clinical pathways: the big data clinical evidence-based pathways [^115vVK1g]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

According to the 2010 WHO report, the key characteristics of good health service delivery include improvements in both the efficiency and quality of healthcare. Optimising the quality of healthcare services, regulating medical behaviour, reducing costs and innovating hospital management and operations while balancing the relationship between the price and quality of medical services remain the primary focus for many countries in the healthcare sector. Clinical pathways (CPWs), the diagnosis-related groupand Big Data Diagnosis & Intervention Packets (BD-DIPs)are important tools for hospital payment and management.

Originating in the USA, CPWs have been used in healthcare since the 1980s. The widespread use and prevalence of CPWs in hospitals is reported in the USA, Australia, Canada, Europe and Asia. However, with the advent of digitalisation and information, CPWs have also shown many limitations and shortcomings. First, CPWs are subjective criteria based on the practical experience of clinical experts and manual methods rather than objective criteria based on the characteristics of big data of patients. In the era of medical science and technology and precision therapy, a huge number of disease combination clusters and variables are generated, whereby the formulation of CPWs exceeds the scope of manual ability and thus entails a huge, low-efficiency, long-term and high-cost project. Second, a novel hospital payment system and standard, BD-DIPs, has been developed and future reform of payments and hospital management will rely more on real-world data analysis, yet diagnostic and therapeutic standards based on big data have not been developed. Therefore, under the premise of DIP payment reform, CPWs have not yet been deeply integrated with DIPs to maximise their effectiveness. Third, because CPWs are a set of standardised treatment modes, the number of cases entering clinical pathway management is low and CPWs have not been sufficiently implemented in hospitals, which generates variability and bias that do not allow them to be adapted to individual patient needs. Four, CPWs cannot use digital intelligence systems to provide visual presentations and quickly offer intuitive recommendations to hospitals, departments and doctors. Finally, the incentive mechanism is imperfect and medical staff are not highly motivated.

### Integrative diagnostics: the time is now-a report from the international society for strategic studies in radiology [^111Atixr]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Diagram describing (A) segregated diagnostics versus (B) integrative diagnostics

In ID, radiologists, pathologists, and other diagnosticians work as teams with shared access to continuously updated patient data, from which experts and CDS tools extract relevant clinical information and formulate dynamic differential diagnosis and management pathways (Fig. 1 B). Given our in-depth knowledge of our test data, understanding of the pathobiochemical and physiological basis of our diagnostic findings, technological skills, and strong informatics resources and expertise, radiology and pathology should strive for leadership roles in the ID environment.

Predictive analytic tools based on aggregated clinical data can streamline care pathways so that appropriate diagnostic tests (including those performed by radiology, laboratory medicine, and pathology) are expedited on the basis of reason for referral, even in advance of a patient's visit with a provider. This requires real-time data entry from all sources, continual analytics, and timely interactive communication among laboratories, providers, and patients. Triaging patients in this manner could streamline and more appropriately prioritize health care access. For example, by identifying patients who need to be seen sooner, a decrease in wait times for specialists would provide reassurance to patients earlier in their care journey and prevent them from turning to high-cost settings such as the emergency department for care. ID could direct patients to the correct therapy sooner, modify treatment when appropriate and terminate it when not effective, ultimately decreasing morbidity, improving outcomes, and avoiding unnecessary cost. Earlier access and more appropriate care are increasingly rewarded in value-based care payment arrangements. Additionally, ID could assess information that affects both individual patient well-being and population health, including identification of emerging infections, antibiotic resistance, exposure to toxic substances, and chemical or biologic threats.

Despite a clear need and sound theoretical reasons for expanding the role of radiologists and pathologists in ID, real-world efforts remain meager. Our purpose is to stimulate more ID activity in our specialties by presenting the rationale for such efforts, highlighting successful ID programs that might be emulated at other sites, and recommending specific endeavors that are feasible now and should be prioritized in our departments and institutions.

### Statistical challenges in the development and evaluation of marker-based clinical tests [^112iiBcg]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

It is increasingly recognized that many therapies will benefit only a subgroup of patients. Indeed, many new therapies are being engineered to target specific biological features of disease which, in turn, identify particular patient subgroups most likely to benefit from the therapy. In oncology, for example, the genetic makeup of a tumor might determine the biological pathways upon which it is dependent for survival and growth, and targeting components of that pathway with a new therapy might be the key to eradicating the tumor or arresting its growth. Tumors not dependent on that pathway might be unaffected by the new therapy. Variations in germline DNA resulting in deficiency of drug metabolizing enzymes might dramatically influence a patient's risk of serious toxicities from certain drugs. Therefore, clinical tests based on biological markers can be useful for making therapeutic decisions for patients newly diagnosed with a disease or for informing clinical management decisions throughout course of treatment.

The main types of marker-based tests for guiding therapy decisions at time of initial diagnosis are predictive tests, and to a lesser extent, prognostic tests. In oncology terms, predictive markers are those associated with response (benefit) or lack of response to a particular therapy relative to other available therapy. In other medical specialties, terms such as treatment effect modifier, treatment-guiding marker, or treatment-selection marker are often used.

For some diseases there can be wide variation in the natural course of the disease process. Some patients may have very indolent disease with symptoms so mild that no, or minimal, therapy is recommended, whereas other patients might have a very aggressive form of the disease requiring intensive treatment. In these cases, prognostic markers may be useful in making these distinctions. These predict natural history of disease in the absence of further therapy. Sometimes this definition of prognostic marker is extended to natural history in the context of standard therapy that all patients are likely to receive. Marker-based tests that provide clinically important prognostic or predictive information are rapidly becoming integral to development and optimal utilization of therapeutics.

### Defining benefit: clinically and biologically meaningful outcomes in the next-generation Alzheimer's disease clinical care pathway [^115aL5ZG]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

At present, however, there is a need to reevaluate these concepts so that they are centered more around the complex and comprehensive understanding of biomarker‐guided, targeted therapies that have an impact on both the clinical and biological course of the disease. In the context of AD, there is a lack of precise criteria to distinguish one class of therapeutics from another. Although the newer generation of investigational compounds is often considered to be biomarker‐guided, neuroprotective interventions targeting underlying disease mechanisms, the use of terms such as "biomarker‐guided therapies" or "molecular pathway‐targeting therapies" may better convey the richness and subtlety of emerging classes of drugs in AD. In the following sections, we use the term "DMTs" to address current therapeutics as referenced and discussed in the existing literature, whereas "biomarker‐guided therapies" will be used when alluding to future therapeutics and associated concepts. Ultimately, this terminology must be further differentiated to better describe the evolution of treatment options and combinations for diverse biological subgroups of patients in future clinical trials and the achievement of precision medicine in neurology and psychiatry.

It is critical that clinicians understand the potential benefits of new therapies and their effects on AD‐related biological changes, and better recognize treatment efficacy beyond measures used with previously approved AD treatments. Moreover, treatment decisions should be better informed by available biomarkers and diagnostic assessments that match the evolving understanding of AD. Implementing clear definitions and collecting necessary evidence will facilitate proper care of individuals treated with DMTs for AD and enhance the understanding of the precise meaningfulness and treatment effects such agents exert.

The current concept of clinical meaningfulness — which can be defined as descriptive and observable effects of treatment on aspects of cognition, function, and/or behavior — is limited and fails to take into account underlying biology, nosology, and patient centricity. In addition, finding consensus as to what constitutes treatment benefit for individuals with AD is challenging due to the complex and varied nature of the disease, different perspectives of important stakeholders, and the influence of measures and analyses used to explore meaningfulness. For instance, sporadic AD follows a nonlinear and dynamic progression pattern across a complex disease continuum. In AD, the clinical presentation of signs, symptoms, and diverse pathophysiological alterations affect different biological systems at different times. Therefore, an integrative, comprehensive, and multidimensional approach, taking into account spatial and temporal (ideally staging) information, is needed to define what constitutes meaningful biological and clinical benefits associated with biomarker‐guided targeted therapies for AD.

### Defining benefit: clinically and biologically meaningful outcomes in the next-generation Alzheimer's disease clinical care pathway [^1166x8Y6]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

10 FUTURE OUTLOOK

Cumulative evidence suggests that a crucial step in the onset of AD is dysregulation, compensation, and decompensation in Aβ homeostasis. These produce a cascade of neuronal and glial molecular events that ultimately lead to complex systems failure with cognitive deficits (MCI‐AD) and ultimately the late‐stage AD dementia syndrome. A clearer picture of disease progression and biologically meaningful treatment‐related change, conceptually capturing target engagement, mechanism of action, impact on mechanism of disease, and surrogate function, may complement clinical outcomes in future clinical trials by serving as additional evidence of biological disease modification.

Future precision medicine in AD and in neurology more broadly may also be facilitated by differentiated multimodal and multidomain outcome development across the AD continuum. This can be achieved by taking into account meaningful subsets and groups (e.g. biological staging, molecular subtyping, genetics, ethnicities, sex, and other classifiers) as well as research into subgroups. Additional long‐term follow‐up of real‐world evidence‐generation studies is required to establish, develop, validate, and standardize biologically and clinically meaningful outcomes. The ROADMAP (Real‐world Outcomes across the AD continuum for better care: Multi‐modal Data Access Platform) project aims to evaluate the feasibility of using real‐world evidence to identify key disease and patient outcomes to enable stakeholders to make informed funding and treatment decisions. The project also aims to provide advice on data integration methods and standards, and to develop conceptual cost‐effectiveness and disease models to assess whether early treatment provides long‐term benefit. There is a need for registries (e.g. Alzheimer's Network for Treatment and Diagnostics (ALZ‐NET), A personalized medicine approach for Alzheimer's disease (ABOARD)) to act as a means of capturing more uniform data across therapies in the real world.

### Development of data-driven clinical pathways: the big data clinical evidence-based pathways [^113zXHSY]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2025). High credibility.

The above analysis shows that CPWs provide diagnostic and therapy standards, but it can be seen that digital technology has subverted the traditional CPWs, which do not fully reflect the real-world overview, through big data characteristics. Payment standards based on DIPs have been established, but diagnosis and therapy standards based on big data have not yet been established to integrate and support DIPs. Our research question is how to use big data to establish diagnostic and therapy standards, objectively reflect the path of diagnosis and therapy in the real-world data, identify the relationship between different combinations of multiple variables, support them together through medical insurance payment standards and provide objective evidence for hospital management and medical insurance payment.

Objective

This study aims to develop a novel type of clinical pathway that we call clinical evidence-based pathways. We describe the key elements of CEBPWs and their rationales and also share our initial experiences in piloting this platform. CEBPWs are both diagnostic and therapy standards and hospital management tools for monitoring irregularities in patient care. CEBPWs and insurance payment support each other, forming a closed-loop management of medical process standardisation, cost control and medical insurance payment.
