## Question

Suggesting for weaning off of beta blocker

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to wean off beta-blockers safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether there is a compelling indication that mandates continuation. Then, I should verify the risks of abrupt withdrawal and confirm the pharmacologic rationale for tapering. Next, I will stratify by clinical scenario, define a tapering protocol with monitoring, and address special populations. Finally, I will outline documentation, patient education, and a contingency plan if withdrawal symptoms occur, making sure each step aligns with guideline and label evidence.

> Let me first confirm the indication landscape before even contemplating a taper, because if there is a strong guideline-backed indication, stopping is inappropriate. In HFrEF, one of bisoprolol, carvedilol, or metoprolol succinate is recommended long term to reduce mortality and hospitalizations, and abrupt withdrawal worsens outcomes, so continuation is preferred unless there is a compelling reason to stop [^113roJAv] [^112mBNXd]. After myocardial infarction, especially with reduced LVEF or ongoing ischemia, beta-blockers remain foundational for secondary prevention, and contemporary guidance still supports their use in high-risk patients while acknowledging uncertainty in low-risk, preserved EF populations, which argues against routine discontinuation without individualized risk assessment [^113TKBHw] [^117Dmf3q]. For chronic coronary disease with LVEF 40% or less, beta-blockers reduce major adverse cardiovascular events, reinforcing continuation in that phenotype [^117Dmf3q]. In perioperative care, continuation of chronic beta-blockade is a Class I recommendation, and abrupt withdrawal is associated with increased myocardial infarction and mortality, so stopping perioperatively is unsafe unless absolutely necessary [^111v6X9L] [^111t2hR2] [^112VKHCx]. Hold on, I should verify arrhythmic indications too: in long QT syndrome, beta-blockers are first-line to reduce arrhythmic events, so stopping them exposes patients to torsades risk and should be avoided without a plan for alternative therapy [^115C8f4r] [^116MPQ97].

> Now, I need to check the pathophysiology and magnitude of risk if I taper too fast or stop abruptly. The beta-blocker rebound phenomenon includes upregulated beta-receptor sensitivity with catecholamine surge, precipitating angina, myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmias, and decompensated heart failure, with observational perioperative cohorts showing markedly higher mortality and MI when beta-blockers are discontinued, and multiple labels explicitly warning against abrupt cessation [^112bnTy3] [^111t2hR2] [^117L9reS] [^114svzXb]. Wait, let me verify the perioperative signal: in vascular surgery cohorts, withdrawal was associated with 50% mortality versus 1.5% when continued, and similar signals appear in broader perioperative datasets, underscoring the danger of stopping chronic therapy around the time of surgery [^117QQgiM] [^111t2hR2].

> Next, I should review scenario-based guidance to tailor the taper. In HFrEF, abrupt withdrawal is contraindicated; if there is acute decompensation requiring inotropes, temporary dose reduction or hold is reasonable, with reintroduction once stabilized, and even inotrope-dependent patients can often be bridged onto beta-blockers with careful planning [^113roJAv] [^111dZCmj] [^111ZoN61]. For post-MI patients, I should confirm LVEF and ongoing ischemia; if LVEF is preserved and there are no arrhythmias or residual ischemia, a cautious deprescribing trial may be reasonable, but if LVEF is reduced or there are ongoing ischemic or arrhythmic features, continuation is indicated [^113TKBHw] [^117Dmf3q]. In perioperative patients, continuation through the operative period and discharge is preferred, with dose titration to heart rate 60–80 bpm while avoiding hypotension or bradycardia, and initiation of new beta-blockers on the day of surgery is discouraged due to harm signals in POISE and related analyses [^111v6X9L] [^113nvXgt] [^112VKHCx]. For HFpEF with chronotropic incompetence, emerging randomized data suggest short-term withdrawal can improve exercise capacity in selected patients, but this is investigational and should be done under specialist supervision with close monitoring [^113EjGW6] [^113J8GYT]. For thyrotoxicosis managed surgically, beta-blockers are typically weaned over several days post-thyroidectomy once euthyroidism is achieved, which is a distinct, time-limited indication for withdrawal [^1154RNhL] [^117LoSCf].

> I will now examine a practical tapering protocol, but wait, I should double-check label specifics because different agents have slightly different recommended taper durations. A general framework is to reduce the dose by about 50% for 3–7 days, then by another 50% for 3–7 days, then stop if stable, totaling 1–2 weeks, with longer tapers for high-risk patients or those on high doses; metoprolol tartrate labeling advises 1–2 weeks, bisoprolol about one week, and betaxolol around two weeks, and if withdrawal symptoms occur, therapy should be reinstituted temporarily and the taper slowed further [^117L9reS] [^114svzXb]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with deprescribing principles: the ESC polypharmacy statement supports slow tapering for agents with adverse withdrawal syndromes, which fits beta-blockers, and it emphasizes monitoring for rebound phenomena during the process [^notfound].

> Monitoring during the taper is critical, so I need to ensure a structured plan. I should confirm daily home blood pressure and heart rate during dose changes, with in-clinic checks every 3–7 days to assess for rebound tachycardia, hypertension, ischemic symptoms, or heart failure signs, and I should educate patients to report chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, or dizziness promptly; if heart rate rises above 100 bpm or systolic blood pressure increases by more than 20 mm Hg from baseline, I should pause the taper and consider reinstating the prior dose temporarily before proceeding more slowly [^1157xMnw]. Let me reconsider whether any labs are needed: in patients with heart failure or on diuretics, checking BNP and renal function during dose changes is reasonable to detect early decompensation, though this is not universally mandated for all patients [^notfound].

> Special populations require extra caution, so I should verify adjustments case-by-case. In COPD, cardioselective beta-blockers can generally be continued when there is a cardiovascular indication, but if I must taper for intolerance, I should do so slowly with bronchodilators available and monitor for wheeze or dyspnea escalation [^112rK4vM] [^114ssMAJ]. In diabetes, I need to remember that beta-blockers can mask hypoglycemia symptoms, so during withdrawal I should reinforce glucose monitoring and hypoglycemia recognition plans, even though the primary withdrawal risk remains cardiovascular rebound rather than glycemic instability per se [^117L9reS]. In older adults, I should anticipate higher sensitivity to hemodynamic changes and consider a longer taper with closer follow-up, integrating shared decision-making around symptom burden and fall risk [^117Vs2mW].

> Documentation and communication are essential, so I should confirm that the indication for stopping is clearly recorded, the taper schedule is written and shared, and the patient understands warning symptoms. I will document the rationale for deprescribing, the exact taper dates and doses, the monitoring plan, and the contingency to restart if symptoms occur, and I will provide written instructions to avoid inadvertent abrupt cessation during transitions of care, which is a common cause of withdrawal-related events [^1157xMnw] [^113x1YBd].

> If withdrawal symptoms occur, I should act quickly and verify the response. Temporarily reinstating the prior beta-blocker dose, or an equivalent dose of a different agent, typically reverses rebound within 24–48 hours; if angina or ischemia is present, I should treat antianginally and observe inpatient if unstable, and if heart failure symptoms emerge, I should intensify diuretics and reassess volume status before attempting any further dose reduction [^117L9reS] [^114svzXb] [^111dZCmj]. Hold on, I should verify that switching within class is acceptable during this process: labels note that transferring directly to comparable doses of another beta-blocker without interruption can be done when clinically appropriate, which can be useful if intolerance to a specific agent prompted the taper [^113JYp7c].

> Finally, I need to ensure a post-withdrawal plan. After the last dose, I should continue monitoring for at least 2–4 weeks, given the risk of delayed rebound, and I should schedule a follow-up within 1–2 weeks to reassess heart rate, blood pressure, functional status, and symptoms; if the original indication resurfaces, I should be prepared to restart therapy and, in complex cases, involve cardiology or heart failure specialists to optimize management and mitigate risk [^1157xMnw] [^113roJAv].

Beta-blocker weaning should be **gradual and individualized** to prevent rebound hypertension, angina, or arrhythmias [^112bnTy3]. The general approach is to **reduce the dose by 25–50% every 3–7 days** over 1–2 weeks, with longer tapers (2–4 weeks) for high-risk patients or those on high doses. Monitor heart rate, blood pressure, and symptoms at each step; if withdrawal symptoms occur, return to the prior dose and slow the taper. In HFrEF, avoid stopping unless absolutely necessary; if needed, taper over 2–4 weeks with close follow-up. For perioperative patients, continue beta-blockers and avoid abrupt withdrawal [^112VKHCx]. Educate patients on symptoms and ensure close follow-up during the taper [^1157xMnw].

## Indications for beta-blocker weaning

Beta-blocker weaning is indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Lack of ongoing indication**: Patients without clear cardiovascular indications (e.g. resolved arrhythmias, stable hypertension without other comorbidities) [^113TKBHw].

- **Adverse effects**: Patients experiencing significant side effects such as bradycardia, fatigue, or bronchospasm [^113WzpsB].

- **Perioperative management**: Patients undergoing surgery who were started on beta-blockers perioperatively without a long-term indication [^111SQ4Ln].

- **Patient preference**: Patients who prefer to discontinue therapy after shared decision-making [^1157xMnw].

---

## Risks associated with abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal

Abrupt withdrawal of beta-blockers can lead to **significant adverse effects**, including:

- **Rebound hypertension**: Increased sympathetic activity causing elevated blood pressure [^notfound].

- **Exacerbation of angina**: Increased myocardial oxygen demand leading to chest pain or myocardial infarction [^111iUfe5].

- **Arrhythmias**: Increased risk of tachyarrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias [^114svzXb].

- **Worsening heart failure**: Increased sympathetic tone exacerbating heart failure symptoms [^113Pdmji].

---

## General principles of beta-blocker weaning

To minimize risks, **follow these principles**:

- **Gradual dose reduction**: Reduce the dose by 25–50% every 3–7 days over 1–2 weeks [^notfound].

- **Individualized approach**: Tailor the tapering schedule to patient-specific factors, including indication, dose, duration of therapy, and comorbidities [^1157xMnw].

- **Close monitoring**: Regularly monitor heart rate, blood pressure, and symptoms during the tapering process [^117L9reS].

- **Patient education**: Inform patients about potential withdrawal symptoms and the importance of adherence to the tapering schedule [^114svzXb].

---

## Specific weaning strategies by clinical scenario

### Hypertension

For hypertension, **taper over 1–2 weeks** by reducing the dose by 25–50% every 3–7 days, and monitor blood pressure and heart rate at each step. If rebound hypertension occurs, return to the previous dose and slow the taper.

---

### Heart failure

For heart failure, **avoid abrupt withdrawal** unless absolutely necessary; taper over 2–4 weeks with close follow-up. Monitor for worsening heart failure symptoms, including weight gain, edema, and dyspnea [^113roJAv].

---

### Coronary artery disease

For coronary artery disease, **taper over 2–4 weeks** with careful monitoring for angina or ischemic symptoms. Educate patients to report chest pain or discomfort promptly [^113JYp7c].

---

### Perioperative management

For perioperative management, **continue beta-blockers** perioperatively and avoid abrupt withdrawal [^112VKHCx]. If discontinuation is necessary, taper gradually over 1–2 weeks with close monitoring [^117L9reS].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

During the weaning process, **monitor the following parameters**:

| **Parameter** | **Frequency** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Heart rate | Every visit | Monitor for rebound tachycardia |
| Blood pressure | Every visit | Monitor for rebound hypertension |
| Symptoms | Every visit | Monitor for angina, dyspnea, fatigue, palpitations |
| Weight (HF patients) | Daily | Monitor for fluid retention |
| Electrolytes (if applicable) | As indicated | Monitor for electrolyte disturbances |

---

## Patient education

Patients should be educated about:

- **Withdrawal symptoms**: Potential symptoms include rebound hypertension, angina, palpitations, and fatigue [^notfound].

- **Importance of adherence**: Emphasize adherence to the tapering schedule and avoidance of abrupt discontinuation [^117L9reS].

- **When to seek medical attention**: Instruct patients to seek immediate medical attention if they experience chest pain, severe headache, shortness of breath, or palpitations.

---

## Special considerations

- **High-risk patients**: Patients with coronary artery disease, heart failure, or arrhythmias may require longer tapering periods (2–4 weeks) and closer monitoring [^113JYp7c].

- **Drug interactions**: Consider potential interactions with other medications, such as calcium channel blockers, which may exacerbate bradycardia or hypotension [^113WfUdP].

- **Alternative therapies**: If beta-blockers are discontinued, consider alternative medications (e.g. calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors) based on the underlying indication [^notfound].

### Optimal preoperative assessment of the geriatric surgical patient: a best practices guideline from the American college of surgeons national surgical quality improvement program and the American Geriatrics Society [^111SQ4Ln]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2012). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA guidelines for perioperative beta blockers — The guidelines support administration of beta blockers to patients who are already on beta blockers, particularly those with independent cardiac indications for these medications, and to patients undergoing intermediate risk or vascular surgery with known coronary artery disease or with multiple clinical risk factors for ischemic heart disease. If beta blockers are indicated, when feasible, they should be started at least days to weeks before elective surgery, titrated to a heart rate of 60–80 beats/minute in the absence of hypotension, and titrated rate control with beta blockers should continue during the intraoperative and postoperative periods. Beta blockers should be tapered off slowly to minimize risk of withdrawal. The current ACC/AHA guidelines state that routine administration of high-dose beta-blockers in the absence of dose titration is not useful and may be harmful to patients not currently taking beta-blockers who are undergoing noncardiac surgery.

### Beta-blocker therapy after myocardial Infarction [^113TKBHw]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This review has demonstrated that although beta-blocker therapy has been a fundamental part of secondary prevention post-MI for decades, recent evidence suggests its effectiveness in patients with preserved LVEF is inconclusive. Variability across observational studies, RCTs, and meta-analyses, due to differences in study populations, limits comparability. An umbrella review focused on populations with similar LVEF could improve generalizability and inform future research and clinical guidelines.

Many questions remain, including the most useful type of beta-blocker agent, optimal dosage, which patients benefit most, and its role across different ACS types. The role of beta-blocker therapy in contemporary MI management is evolving, with evidence suggesting their use should be more selective and tailored to high-risk patients. Ongoing trials are expected to clarify their optimal use in the era of modern reperfusion therapies.

Ceasing beta-blocker therapy in patients without a clear benefit could streamline treatment, reduce side effects, and lessen the overall burden on patients and health care systems. In addition, it could mitigate the negative effects of polypharmacy and enhance medication adherence. However, before discontinuing beta-blocker therapy, it is critical to undertake a thorough risk-benefit clinical evaluation, similar to the protocols applied to patients with recovered heart failure with reduced LVEF.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Practical use of beta-blockers — initiation and maintenance in chronic heart failure (HF) states that treatment with a beta-blocker should be initiated at very low doses, followed by gradual increments in dose if lower doses have been well tolerated, and patients should be monitored closely for changes in vital signs and symptoms during this uptitration period; physicians should ask patients to weigh themselves daily and to manage any increase in weight by immediately increasing the dose of concomitantly administered diuretic until weight is restored to pretreatment levels, and planned increments in the dose of a beta-blocker should be delayed until any side effects observed with lower doses have disappeared; most patients (approximately 85%) enrolled in clinical trials were able to tolerate short- and long-term treatment and achieve the maximum planned trial dose, beta-blockers can be safely started before discharge in patients hospitalized for HF provided they do not require intravenous therapy for HF, clinical responses are generally delayed and may require 2 to 3 months to become apparent, and abrupt withdrawal can lead to clinical deterioration and should be avoided.

### Beta-blockers in noncardiac surgery: did observational studies put us back on safe ground? [^114GrXMb]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Based on landmark trials, international guidelines had for years promoted the use of beta-blockers in the setting of non-cardiac surgery. In 2011, concerns were raised regarding the integrity of some of the landmark trials, as the Dutch Erasmus Medical Center found some of them to be scientifically incorrect. Based on the remaining studies that were to be trusted, investigations showed that, in contrast to prior beliefs, the widespread use of perioperative beta-blockers might be harmful. A call for further investigations into the matter ushered in several observational studies evaluating the safety of perioperative beta-blocker therapy in specific patient subgroups. Within this review, we discuss important aspects for making these decisions, and compare the major observational studies and specific estimates of risk in subgroups of interest. We conclude that patients at high risk with heavy co-morbidities, such as heart failure, may benefit from beta-blocker therapy, whereas low-risk patients, such as patients with uncomplicated hypertension, may be at increased risk with beta-blocker therapy. We provide a critical review of current perioperative guidelines in view of the new observational data, suggesting that the recommended schematics, such as the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, for risk stratification of patients in this setting may be suboptimal. Further, we provide discussions of other aspects, including risk of sepsis, type of beta-blocker, and the potential of perioperative beta-blocker withdrawal, which may be important in guiding future studies. Summarising the current evidence, we argue that, after a precarious decade, we may just now, be back on safe ground.

### The effect of beta blocker withdrawal on adenosine myocardial perfusion imaging [^1153DL1b]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The question of whether beta blockers need to be stopped before vasodilator stress testing cannot be answered for a diverse CAD population with a universal "no" or "yes". As adenosine MBF without beta blockers is higher than with, the clinical pathway recommending the stop of beta blockers prior to stress testing in order to ensure the highest MBF remains advisable. However, if a temporary beta blocker withdrawal is unfeasible due to complications, contraindications, a tight clinical schedule, or because a patient simply forgot to withhold the medication, it is appropriate to perform adenosine stress testing in such cases.

Study Limitations

In this study, patients with known CAD, comorbidities, and cardiac co-medication were considered. The results may not be directly transferable to low or moderate risk groups scheduled for exclusion of CAD with MPI.

The cardiac co-medication may have interfered with perfusion to a different extent between both adenosine studies. A potential bias is not assessable. By leaving the co-medication unchanged between the studies, an attempt was made to minimize any co-medication effects.

The patients took a total of four different beta blockers, three of them cardioselective. An optimal study condition would have been with one single beta blocker in all patients. However, 95% of the patients had cardioselective beta blockers with comparable working profiles. Thus, a confounding effect by the different beta blockers is thought to be low.

The overall sample size of this studied population is very small. Thus, it is very difficult to draw hard conclusions from the study. The results in Figures 1 and 3 show that the withdrawal of beta blockers leads to divergent and variable changes in MBF and thus limits its application in clinical decision making. This also raises the question of whether the observations seen are more random and not systematic in nature. For all these reasons, a larger study is clearly needed.

### Meta-analysis of secure randomised controlled trials of β-blockade to prevent perioperative death in non-cardiac surgery [^116PcmyJ]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Perioperative initiation of a course of β-blockers appears to increase postoperative mortality by 27%. This has emerged because the DECREASE family of studies has been discredited.

Patient safety being paramount, guidelines for perioperative β-blocker initiation should be retracted without further delay. Future guidelines should be accompanied by a commitment from named individuals to retract them immediately if the advice given is later revealed to be harmful.

Routine initiation of β-blockers for this indication should not be recommended, except in the context of RCTs which should be designed carefully, conducted honestly and reported truthfully.

### Beta blocker rebound phenomenon is important, but we do not know its definition, incidence or optimal prevention strategies [^112bnTy3]. Hypertension Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The aim of this review is to analyze whether there is a need for scientific information about the beta blocker (BB) rebound phenomenon; whether such information is available; and, if it is, how detailed is the BB rebound phenomenon explained in the guidelines and papers? A narrative review is used due to the lack of valid randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on the topic, which are needed for a meta-analysis. The BB rebound phenomenon can have dangerous consequences. The discontinuation of a BB leads to a fourfold increased risk of events related to coronary artery disease in hypertensive patients; it increases in-hospital mortality in heart failure patients; it can precipitate angina pectoris attack; and it increases the risk for death and rehospitalization in patients who survive acute myocardial infarction. Consequently, being considered in the guidelines, the BB rebound phenomenon is believed to be clinically relevant (by experts in the field). This is in sharp contrast with the lack of any additional relevant information about the BB rebound phenomenon in the various important guidelines. For example, we lack a consensus about the precise definition. Moreover, data about the incidence and optimal prevention strategies are lacking for the phenomenon (which is sometimes life-threatening). The BB rebound phenomenon is an additional reason why it is very important to test the prognosis of patients following the cessation of long-term medicaments in RCTs, particularly for BBs.

### 2009 ACCF / AHA focused update on perioperative beta blockade [^111t2hR2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Perioperative beta-blocker continuation and withdrawal — observational outcomes show that selective discontinuation increased myocardial infarction (MI) risk in the first 30 days (relative risk [RR] 2.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06 to 6.89) and between 30 and 180 days (RR 2.4, 95% CI 1.07 to 5.59); in a retrospective cohort of 140 preoperative beta-blocked patients, postoperative discontinuation in 8 patients was associated with 50% mortality versus 1.5% when continued (odds ratio [OR] 65.0; p < 0.001); and in 711 peripheral vascular surgery patients, continuous use was associated with lower 1-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.4, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.7), whereas withdrawal increased 1-year mortality (HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 5.9). The guideline notes that "perioperative beta-blocker withdrawal should be avoided unless necessary", and that continuation in the perioperative period "is a Class I indication", with titration to maintain heart rate control while avoiding frank hypotension and bradycardia as the goal.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113roJAv]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Beta blockers for HFrEF — In patients with HFrEF, with current or previous symptoms, use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended to reduce mortality and hospitalizations, and beta-blocker therapy provides high economic value. Treatment with beta blockers reduces the risk of death and the combined risk of death or hospitalization in patients with HFrEF. Beta blockers should be initiated at low doses with efforts to achieve target doses as tolerated, and they can be safely started before hospital discharge when patients are clinically stabilized and do not require intravenous inotropic therapy for HF. Even if symptoms or LVEF improve, long-term treatment with target doses should be maintained to reduce risk of progression, and abrupt withdrawal should be avoided unless indicated.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Practical use of beta-blockers — selection of patients and initiation: Beta-blockers should be prescribed to all patients with stable HF due to reduced LVEF unless they have a contraindication or are unable to tolerate them, and treatment with a beta-blocker should be initiated as soon as left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is diagnosed. Therapy should not be delayed until symptoms return or disease progression is documented, and even patients with little disability should receive treatment with a beta-blocker to reduce the risk of disease progression, future clinical deterioration, and sudden death. Patients need not be taking high doses of ACEIs prior to starting a beta-blocker, and in those taking a low dose of an ACEI, adding a beta-blocker produces a greater improvement in symptoms and reduction in risk of death than increasing the ACEI dose to trial targets. In patients with a current or recent history of fluid retention, beta-blockers should not be prescribed without diuretics.

### Weaning from inotropic support and concomitant β-blocker therapy in severely ill heart failure patients: take the time in order to improve prognosis [^111ZoN61]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

Beta-blockers improve the prognosis in heart failure (HF), but their introduction may seem impossible in patients dependent on inotropic support. However, many of these patients can be titrated on beta-blockers, but there is little evidence of successful clinical strategies.

Methods and Results

We analysed the records of inotropy-dependent patients referred for assessment for heart transplantation. Thirty-six patients (45%) could not be weaned (NW) and underwent left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation or transplantation, or died. However, 44 (55%) were successfully weaned (SW). Neither the aetiology (ischaemic vs. non-ischaemic) nor cardiac indexes were different in the SW as compared with the NW group (2.27 ± 0.5 vs. 2.15 ± 0.6L/min/m2). The NW patients had lower LVEF (15 ± 5% vs. 19 ± 5%, P = 0.001), higher right atrial pressure (12 ± 6 vs. 8 ± 6 mmHg, P = 0.02), and more severe mitral regurgitation (P < 0.001) than the SW patients. At discharge, 35 of 44 SW patients were receiving beta-blockers. In 29 of them, a beta-blocker could only be initiated or continued during concomitant support with i.v. enoximone for a duration of 14.1 ± 7.2 days. Patients discharged on a beta-blocker had an LVAD/transplantation-free cumulative survival of 71% during a follow-up of 2074 ± 201 days (confidence interval 1679–2470).

Conclusion

It takes time to put severely ill HF patients on beta-blockers and it may require bridging with inotropes which are independent of beta-adrenergic receptors. Whether such a strategy may result in a better clinical outcome warrants further research.

### Propranolol for the prevention of first esophageal variceal hemorrhage: a lifetime commitment? [^1151qUAo]. Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Although beta blockers have had significant impact in the treatment of portal hypertension, the question of how long they should be continued for prevention of variceal hemorrhage remains unknown. Prospective studies on beta blockers to prevent variceal hemorrhage lack long-term follow-up, and indefinite administration of beta blockers for primary prevention of variceal bleeding has become standard practice. The aim of this study was to determine the outcomes of patients in whom beta blocker therapy was discontinued. Patients completing a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of propranolol for the primary prevention of variceal hemorrhage were tapered off of propranolol and placebo and followed prospectively for subsequent events. Of the 49 patients in the follow-up study (25 former propranolol, 24 former placebo), 9 experienced variceal hemorrhage (6 former propranolol, 3 former placebo). Following withdrawal of propranolol, the freedom from variceal bleeding was not significantly different between these 2 groups of patients, suggesting that the protective effect of propranolol against variceal hemorrhage, noted previously, was no longer present. Seventeen patients died (12 former propranolol, 5 former placebo) during the follow-up study. Cumulative survival was longer in the placebo group. These trends for EVH and survival were opposite to those observed in the original study population while patients were taking medication. When propranolol is withdrawn, the risk of variceal hemorrhage returns to what would be expected in an untreated population. Patients who discontinue beta blockers experience increased mortality compared with an untreated population. These observations support the current practice of indefinite prophylactic therapy.

Practical use of beta-blockers — risks of treatment: fluid retention and worsening HF indicates initiation of treatment has produced 4 types of adverse reactions, and initiation of therapy with a beta-blocker can cause fluid retention that is usually asymptomatic and is detected primarily by an increase in body weight but may become sufficiently marked to cause worsening symptoms of HF; physicians should ensure that patients are not volume overloaded before a beta-blocker is initiated, should monitor patients closely for increases in weight and for worsening signs and symptoms of HF, and should augment the dose of diuretic if weight increases whether or not other signs or symptoms of worsening HF are present; the occurrence of fluid retention or worsening HF is not generally a reason for the permanent withdrawal of treatment, as such patients generally respond favorably to intensification of conventional therapy and once treated remain excellent candidates for long-term treatment with a beta-blocker.

Practical use of beta-blockers — risks of treatment: fatigue states that treatment with a beta-blocker can be accompanied by feelings of general fatigue or weakness, the sense of lassitude resolves spontaneously within several weeks without treatment in many cases but in some patients may be severe enough to limit increments in dose or require the withdrawal of treatment; complaints of fatigue can generally be managed by a reduction in the dose of the beta-blocker (or the accompanying diuretic), but treatment should be discontinued if the syndrome of weakness is accompanied by evidence of peripheral hypoperfusion, and reinitiation at a later time or with a different effective beta-blocker may be successful.

### Practical considerations of β-blockade in the management of the post-myocardial infarction patient [^113agA6b]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a major cause of death and disability in the United States that affects an estimated total of 1.5 million men and women each year. Despite significant advances in pharmacologic and interventional therapies, 25% of men and 38% of women still die within 1 year of the acute event. Beta-blockers have been shown to significantly decrease the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients after an AMI. National guidelines recommend that all patients with AMI may be started on beta-blocker therapy and continued indefinitely, unless absolutely contraindicated or not tolerated. However, a substantial portion of eligible AMI survivors are not prescribed beta-blockers in the hospital after an acute event or upon hospital discharge. In addition, patients with AMI are often treated with agents whose long-term use has not been shown effective and for which optimal dosing has not been defined. This paper will discuss the background of beta-blocker use for the treatment of AMI, discuss the rationale for choosing specific agents, and present protocols for initiating or switching to evidence-based therapies.

### Benefits of inpatient initiation of β-blockers [^111omfeZ]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical trials have demonstrated that beta-blockers effectively reduce mortality in patients after a myocardial infarction (MI) and in patients with chronic heart failure. Treatment guidelines recommend that all patients after MI without a contraindication receive early beta-blocker treatment. Initiation of beta-blockers also should be considered for stable patients who are hospitalized with heart failure. Despite well-documented benefits, however, beta-blockers are still underused. Barriers that cause reluctance by physicians to initiate therapy include the traditional belief that beta-blockers are contraindicated in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, complexity of management, perceived risk of adverse events, and potential for short-term clinical deterioration. Intervention programs promoting beta-blockers for inpatients have increased their use at discharge and after long-term follow-up. Because of pharmacologic differences, agent selection is also critical. Agents must have proven clinical efficacy, an established dose-titration regimen, and desirable pharmacokinetic properties. Increasing the use of these life-saving agents has the potential for substantial clinical impact.

### Why do patients fail to receive β-blockers for chronic heart failure over time? A "real-world" single-center, 2-year follow-up experience of β-blocker therapy in patients with chronic heart failure [^113x1YBd]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The longitudinal pattern of beta-blocker use in a heart-failure practice setting has not been explored. Previous studies have not specifically addressed the use of beta-blockers over time to determine the rate of use and reasons for discontinuation. The long-term compliance rate for beta-blocker drugs outside the context of a clinical trial has not been established.

Methods

We prospectively followed a cohort of 500 consecutive patients between March and May 2001, with a clinical diagnosis of chronic heart failure seen in a specialized heart failure clinic and determined the longitudinal pattern of beta-blocker use and clinical outcomes over a 2-year period.

Results

The final cohort consists of 340 patients with a complete 2-year follow-up data (mean age 61 ± 14 years, 69% men, 53% with ischemic etiology, mean ejection fraction 27.6 ± 15%). At 6, 12, and 24 months, beta-blocker utilization rates were maintained in 69%, 70%, and 74% of patients, respectively. Of the 120 confirmed initial non-beta-blocker users, 28 (23%) were subsequently started on beta-blocker, despite suspected relative contraindications in 53% of patients. Over a period of 2 years, the discontinuation rate was 10%, with failure to restart a beta-blocker after hospitalization as the most common reason for beta-blocker discontinuation.

Conclusion

Utilization rates of beta-blockers in our heart failure clinic have remained constant at approximately 70% throughout a 2-year follow-up. Of those who discontinued beta-blockers (10%), the most common documented cause was failure to restart beta-blockers after hospitalization.

### Achieving a maximally tolerated β-blocker dose in heart failure patients: is there room for Improvement? [^113K7KqK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although initially thought to be harmful in HF, beta-adrenergic blockers (β-blockers) have consistently been shown to reduce mortality and HF hospitalization in chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction. Proposed mechanisms include neurohormonal blockade and heart rate reduction. A new therapeutic agent now exists to target further heart rate lowering in patients who have been stable on a "maximally tolerated β-blocker dose", but this definition and how to achieve it are incompletely understood. In this review, the authors summarize published reports on the mechanisms by which β-blockers improve clinical outcomes. The authors describe differences in doses achieved in landmark clinical trials and those observed in routine clinical practice. They further discuss reasons for intolerance and the evidence behind using β-blocker dose and heart rate as therapeutic targets. Finally, the authors offer recommendations for clinicians actively initiating and up-titrating β-blockers that may aid in achieving maximally tolerated doses.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Practical use of beta-blockers — management of clinical deterioration on long-term therapy explains that in patients who have been taking a beta-blocker for long periods of time (more than 3 months), discontinuation after an episode of worsening HF will not diminish and may in fact increase the subsequent risk of clinical decompensation; if deterioration is characterized by hypoperfusion or requires the use of intravenous positive inotropic drugs, it may be prudent to halt or significantly reduce treatment with beta-blockers temporarily until the status of the patient stabilizes, positive inotropic agents whose effects are mediated independently of the beta-receptor (e.g., a phosphodiesterase inhibitor such as milrinone) may be preferred, and once stabilized, the beta-blocker should be reintroduced to reduce the subsequent risk of clinical deterioration.

### 2009 ACCF / AHA focused update on perioperative beta blockade [^115hsB3b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Perioperative beta-blocker therapy — recommendations and risk factors: Preoperative beta-blocker therapy should be considered in the context of a full evaluation of each patient's clinical and surgical risk, including identification of active cardiac conditions that require intensive management and may result in delay or cancellation of surgery unless the surgery is emergent. Clinical risk factors used in current recommendations are unchanged from the prior document and include history of ischemic heart disease, history of compensated or prior heart failure, history of cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and renal insufficiency defined as a preoperative serum creatinine of more than 2 mg/dL. The surgery-specific cardiac risk of noncardiac surgery remains relevant, but limited data are available to guide beta-blocker use with newer techniques (e.g., percutaneous or endovascular vascular procedures) that may be associated with lower short-term risk. The prior document outlined conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of beta blockers in reducing perioperative cardiac events, and the best approach to medically reduce cardiovascular complications during noncardiac surgery was still unknown. The authors advocated for randomized controlled trials because there may be some harm associated with beta-blocker therapy in low-risk patients, and they noted key literature gaps: most trials were inadequately powered; few randomized trials of medical therapy to prevent perioperative major adverse cardiac events had been performed; few trials examined perioperative beta-blocker therapy, particularly in high-risk patients; studies to determine the role of beta blockers in intermediate- and low-risk populations and the optimal type, dose, timing, duration, and titration were lacking; and no studies addressed care-delivery mechanisms for how, when, and by whom therapy should be prescribed and monitored.

### Can medications be safely withdrawn in patients with stable chronic heart failure? systematic review and meta-analysis [^114oW21R]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) therapy involves use of multiple medications. There is little guidance on the safety and impact on clinical outcomes of stopping HF medications.

Methods and Results

A comprehensive systematic search for studies of drug therapy withdrawal in HF was performed. Meta-analysis of the risk ratio (RR) was performed with the use of the Mantel-Haenszel random effects model for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes. Twenty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies on withdrawal of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors and beta-blockers in HF are scarce and small, yet show relatively convincingly that such withdrawals have untoward effects on cardiac structure, symptoms, and major outcomes. Meta-analysis of 7 studies of digoxin withdrawal (2,987 participants) without background beta-blocker showed increased HF hospitalizations (RR 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16–1.46; P < .0001), but no impact on all-cause mortality (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90–1.12; p = 0.06) nor reduction in all-cause hospitalization (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98–1.09; p = 0.27). Diuretic withdrawal trials demonstrated an ongoing need for these agents in chronic HF. Studies in peripartum cardiomyopathy showed that medications could be successfully withdrawn after recovery.

Conclusion

Current evidence discourages any attempt to discontinue RAAS inhibitors or beta-blockers in patients with stable HF, regardless of clinical and/or echocardiographic status. Formal withdrawal trials of other classes are needed.

### How to handle polypharmacy in heart failure. A clinical consensus statement of the heart failure association of the ESC [^1157xMnw]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

In this scientific statement document, we propose a deprescribing protocol including five steps (Figure 1):
To review and reconcile all drugs the patient is currently taking, the underlying indications and whether there is current or past history of non‐adherence.
To consider the risk of drug‐induced harm in individual patients: medication‐related factors to consider include known ADRs, drug–drug or drug–disease interactions, and polypharmacy.
To assess each drug regarding its current or future expected benefit or harm, or the likelihood of being particularly burdensome (i.e. for instance big tablets difficult to swallow, treatments needing repetitive monitoring, etc.).
To prioritize for discontinuation drugs that have the lowest benefit–harm ratio, the lowest likelihood of adverse withdrawal reactions or disease rebound syndromes, and are easy to withdraw. Attention should be paid to patient preferences.
To implement a discontinuation regimen and closely monitor patients to early identify the results of the intervention. Slow tapering over time may be required for some agents associated with increased risk for an adverse drug withdrawal event. These events may include a relapse of symptoms as a result of the withdrawal, or a physiological withdrawal such as rebound tachycardia after discontinuation of beta‐blockers or an increase in blood pressure after discontinuation of anti‐hypertensive agents. Practical application of these recommendations can be apparently difficult and not immediate in routine care.

Responsibility of therapy revision should not belong to one specific healthcare provider. Multidisciplinary discussion and mutual support in the decision‐making and in the process of deprescribing are priorities. Together with the HF physician in charge, specialized HF nurses and pharmacists are of value in the management of every step of this process.

Figure 1
Multidomain approach for managing polypharmacy in heart failure (HF). Reconciliation of treatments and periodical assessment of therapeutic appropriateness follow multistep and multidisciplinary processes, which should consider patient and drug characteristics. Periodical review of these aspects is pivotal. When the possibility and need of deprescribing is ascertained, the deprescribing protocol represents a point‐by‐point guide that can support physicians' decisions. Alternatives to definitive deprescribing (i.e. represcribing/replacement, variation in the way of administration) should be always evaluated. CV, cardiovascular.

### Β-blocker withdrawal and functional capacity improvement in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^113EjGW6]. JAMA Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Increasing the patient's heart rate (HR) has emerged as a therapeutic option in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, the evidence is conflicting, and the profile of patients who benefit most from this strategy remains unclear.

Objective

To assess the association of β-blocker treatment withdrawal with changes in the percentage of predicted peak oxygen consumption (VO2) across indexed left ventricular diastolic (iLVEDV) and indexed left ventricular systolic volumes (iLVESV), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with HFpEF and chronotropic incompetence.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This post hoc analysis was conducted using data from the investigator-blinded multicenter, randomized, and crossover clinical trial, PRESERVE-HR, that took place from October 1, 2018, through December 31, 2020, to investigate the short-term effects (2 weeks) of β-blocker withdrawal on peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2). Patients with stable HFpEF (New York Heart Association functional class II to III) receiving treatment with β-blocker and chronotropic incompetence were included.

Intervention

Participants in the PRESERVE-HR trial were randomized to withdraw vs continue with β-blocker treatment. After 2 weeks, they were crossed over to receive the opposite intervention. This crossover randomized clinical trial examined the short-term effect of β-blocker withdrawal on peak VO2.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was to evaluate the association between β-blocker withdrawal and short-term changes in percentage of peak VO2 across iLVEDV, iLVESV, and LVEF in patients with HFpEF and chronotropic incompetence treated with β-blocker.

Results

A total of 52 patients (mean age, 73 [SD, 13] years; 60% female) were randomized. The mean resting HR, peak HR, peak VO2, and percentage of peak VO2 were 65 (SD, 9) beats per minute (bpm), 97 (SD, 15) bpm, 12.4 (SD, 2.9) mL/kg per minute, and 72.4% (SD, 17.7%), respectively. The medians (minimum-maximum) of iLVEDV, iLVESV, and LVEF were 44 mL/m2 (IQR, 19–82), 15 mL/m2 (IQR, 7–32), and 64% (IQR, 52%-78%), respectively. After stopping β-blocker treatment, the median increase in peak HR was plus 30 bpm (95% CI, 25–35; P < .001). β-Blocker cessation was differentially associated with change of percentage of peak VO2 across the continuum of iLVESV (P for interaction = .02), indicating a greater benefit in those with lower iLVESV.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, results showed that in patients with HFpEF and chronotropic incompetence receiving treatment with β-blocker, lower iLVESV may identify those with a greater short-term improvement in maximal functional capacity after stopping β-blocker treatment. Further studies are warranted for further investigation.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115v7KAm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Perioperative hypertension management — beta blockers (BB) and clonidine: If well tolerated, BBs should be continued in patients receiving them for guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) indications, with continuation through hospitalization and at discharge unless contraindications arise. Abrupt withdrawal of long-term BB is harmful and should be avoided, and data are fewer on whether short-term (1 to 2 days) perioperative BB followed by rapid discontinuation is harmful. Special consideration is noted for patients taking clonidine or BB because stopping these medications acutely carries risk, and abrupt discontinuation of clonidine can cause rebound hypertension with norepinephrine surge. This guideline recommends against starting a BB on the day of surgery in BB-naive patients, particularly at high initial doses, in long-acting form, and without plans for dose titration or monitoring for adverse events.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Beta blockers — perioperative initiation and continuation are addressed as follows: Acutely discontinuing beta blockers for long-term indications is harmful and should be avoided, and clinical judgment should be used to titrate therapy with a focus on ensuring the medication is continued through the hospital stay and at discharge unless clear contraindications arise. Results from POISE indicate that initiating beta blockers on the day of surgery is harmful, and a large observational study suggested higher risks of death if beta blockers were initiated < 7 days before surgery compared with > 31 days earlier; patients who initiated between 8 and 30 days did not have excess mortality nor perioperative benefits. Thus, if initiation before surgery is required, the medication should be initiated ≥ 7 days before the surgery.

### Importance of in-hospital initiation of evidence-based medical therapies for heart failure-a review [^111QmKRR]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Patients who have had heart failure (HF) face very high risks of hospitalization and mortality. Despite the compelling scientific evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aldosterone antagonists, and beta blockers decrease rates of hospitalization and mortality in patients who have had HF, these life-prolonging therapies continue to be underused. Many studies in a variety of clinical settings have documented that important numbers of patients who have had HF are not receiving treatment with these evidence-based therapies, which are recommended by national guidelines, when guided by conventional care. This HF treatment gap results from a variety of complex issues, including lack of systems and disease management programs. This gap in beta-blocker therapy may be due in part to persisting perceptions, despite recent evidence to the contrary, that it should be delayed until patients who developed HF have been stable for 2 to 4 weeks after hospital discharge and that its initiation results in a substantial risk of worsening HF. Conversely, recent clinical trial evidence has substantiated that beta blockers can be safely initiated for patients with HF in the hospital and that there are early benefits, including decreased risks of mortality and hospitalization for worsening HF. It has become increasingly evident that in-hospital initiation of evidence-based cardiovascular therapies and patient education have a positive effect on long-term patient compliance and clinical outcomes. Adopting in-hospital initiation of these therapies as the standard of care (in the absence of contraindications or intolerance) in patients who have HF and stabilized systolic dysfunction could substantially improve treatment rates, decrease the risk of future hospitalizations, and prolong life in the large number of patients who are hospitalized each year for HF.

### Use of combination therapy with a β-blocker and milrinone in patients with advanced heart failure [^1115qcTP]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature evaluating the clinical effects of combination therapy with a beta-blocker and milrinone in patients with severe heart failure (HF).

Data Sources

Literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1950-June 2009), PubMed (1966-June 2009), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-June 2009), with combinations of the following terms: positive inotrope, milrinone, dobutamine, and beta-receptor blocker. In addition, reference citations from publications identified were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles that examined the effect of combination therapy with a beta-blocker and milrinone on clinical endpoints in patients with advanced HF were assessed.

Data Synthesis

A search of the literature revealed 4 studies examining the clinical effects of combination therapy with a beta-blocker and milrinone. Three of these studies were retrospective reviews, while one was a post hoc subgroup analysis from the OPTIME-CHF study. Concomitant therapy with milrinone and a beta-blocker was well tolerated, with no significant increase in adverse events or deterioration in clinical status in any study. Tolerability rates for combination therapy ranged from 88% to 92%. In 2 of the studies, roughly 50% of the patients in the combination arm were able to be weaned off milrinone. One study suggested a mortality reduction in favor of combination therapy over milrinone alone, while another study suggested no difference in mortality with combination therapy versus milrinone monotherapy. One study suggested a potential increase in mortality when beta-blocker therapy was withdrawn in patients who were started on milrinone. None of the studies demonstrated any significant differences in hospitalization rates. All of the studies were limited by their retrospective nature and small sample size.

Conclusions

Data are insufficient to make firm conclusions on the clinical benefit of combination therapy with a beta-blocker and milrinone in patients with advanced HF, although it appears that this regimen is well tolerated and may allow weaning of inotropic support.

### Rapid evidence-based sequencing of foundational drugs for heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction [^117XB13Z]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Step 1. Simultaneous initiation of a beta‐blocker and an SGLT2 inhibitor

Based on the evidence from randomized controlled trials, which of the foundational agents should be initiated as the first step? In our view, the most serious and unexpected complication of heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction is sudden cardiac death, and the most effective and rapidly‐acting means of preventing such death is beta‐adrenergic blockade, presumably because beta‐blockers interfere with catecholamine‐related ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Additionally, among the four foundational drug classes, beta‐blockers are most likely to exert favourable effects on left ventricular remodelling during long‐term treatment, yielding important recovery of a depressed ejection fraction. However, for beta‐blockers to be initiated safely (regardless of their position in the sequence), physicians should ensure that patients are clinically euvolaemic before the start of treatment and that concurrently administered diuretics are promptly intensified if fluid retention (as evidenced by weight gain) occurs. Failure to do so may explain why initiation of beta‐blockade can result in early worsening of heart failure, which can be avoided (even in patients with severe symptoms) if clinical euvolaemia is achieved and maintained.

Because of the predilection of beta‐blockers to cause fluid retention, we favour a strategy where beta‐blockers are combined with an SGLT2 inhibitor as the first step in drug sequencing. As a result of their actions on sodium and glucose transport in the proximal renal tubule, SGLT2 inhibitors promote a short‐term osmotic diuresis, which may contribute to the established ability of this drug class to reduce worsening heart failure events, a benefit that is seen rapidly following initiation of treatment. This early effect may help to minimize the risks of fluid retention that can be seen following initiation of treatment with a beta‐blocker. SGLT2 inhibitors also exert a striking nephroprotective effect, as evidenced by a slowing of the decline in glomerular filtration rate during long‐term therapy. This favourable effect on kidney function is especially important since several other foundational drugs (e.g. angiotensin receptor blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) often act to worsen renal function in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction. Importantly, treatment with a beta‐blocker and an SGLT2 inhibitor does not require specialized safety monitoring or laboratory testing. As a result, the ability of patients to tolerate a combination of a beta‐blocker and an SGLT2 inhibitor can generally be fully established within 2 weeks of starting outpatient treatment with both classes of drugs.

### 2009 ACCF / AHA focused update on perioperative beta blockade [^113nvXgt]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Perioperative beta-blocker therapy — current data suggest benefit and specify use: beta blockers reduce perioperative ischemia and may reduce the risk of MI and cardiovascular death in high-risk patients; continuation for ACCF/AHA Class I indications continues to be a Class I recommendation; when possible and where indicated, beta blockers should be started days to weeks before elective surgery, the dose should be titrated perioperatively, and titrated rate control should continue intraoperatively and postoperatively, if possible, to maintain a heart rate of 60 to 80 bpm in the absence of hypotension; by contrast, routine administration of higher-dose long-acting metoprolol on the day of surgery without titration is associated with an overall increase in mortality, and routine high-dose beta blockers without dose titration before noncardiac surgery are not useful, may be harmful, and carry a new Class III recommendation.

2.3.2 Treatment intervention and visits

Following screening (visit 0) and randomization (visit 1) visits, the procedures across treatment arms are:

‐A‐arm: Patients allocated to this arm are instructed to reduce by half the dose of beta‐blocker (Figure 1). The patients will be advised for potential adverse effects and instructed to contact with outpatient's clinics of HF if any adverse effect occurs. Patients will be checked in 3 days (visit 2) by a cardiologist. If clinically stable, the patients are instructed to withdraw the beta‐blocker and repeat all the procedures of the study at 15 days (visit 3). After visit 3, the patients initiate the previous half dose of beta‐blockers. Patients are visited at 18 days (visit 4). If clinically stable, the patient will increase to the previous dose of the beta‐blocker and repeat all the examination tests at 30 days (visit 5).

‐B‐arm: Patients allocated to this arm will continue with the same treatment and revisited 3 days after (visit 2) (Figure 1). All of the study procedures repeated at 15 days (visit 3), and, after them, the patients are instructed to reduce by the half dose of beta‐blocker. Likewise, the patients are advised for potential adverse effects and instructed to contact outpatient HF‐clinics of HF if any adverse effect occurs. Patients are revisited in 3 days (at 18 days, visit 4), and if clinically stable, the patient withdraws the beta‐blocker and repeats all the examination tests at 30 days (visit 5).

At visit 5, the responsible cardiologist will assess all the examination test and individually decide the convenience of beta‐blockers reintroduction or withdrawal in both arms. A cardiologist of the HF‐unit will clinically evaluate all patients at 60‐day after randomization (visit 6). Additional visits will be permitted according to the patient's clinical status and will be registered.

### Towards appropriate polypharmacy in older cardiovascular patients: how many medications do I have to take? [^117Vs2mW]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

β ‐blockers: Beta‐blockers such as metoprolol and carvedilol carry a class I recommendation post‐ACS per consensus guidelines and are usually started as early as 24 hours after ACS. 3, 9 In the older adult, beta‐blocker therapy may contribute to cognitive impairment and fatigue, especially with highly lipophilic agents such as metoprolol, while carvedilol can lead to pronounced hypotension. In the era of postrevascularization, the long‐term benefits of beta‐blockers have been called into question; guidelines even suggest to reassess their utility at 3 years post‐ACS in patients with Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) > 40%. 37

Renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibitors (ie, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker [ARB], aldosterone inhibitors): Renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors are a cornerstone of guideline‐directed medical therapy post‐ACS, especially if left ventricular dysfunction is present. 37 Older adults are at higher risk of acute kidney injury, and should be closely monitored for worsening renal dysfunction and hyperkalemia. Addition of an aldosterone antagonist to either an ACE‐inhibitor or ARB should be done cautiously, while the combination of an ACE‐inhibitor and an ARB should be avoided altogether. Consider reducing the dose or a temporary hold vs stopping therapy for worsening renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia (ie, serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL in women, 3 mg/dL in men, K+ > 5 mEq/L). 30 Avoid nephrotoxic medications like over‐the‐counter Non‐Steroidal Anti‐Inflammatory Drug (NSAIDs) or medications that can induce hyperkalemia, such as potassium‐sparing agents, trimethoprim, or potassium‐based salt substitutes. 3, 9

Nitrates: Nitrates can relieve symptoms associated with cardiac ischemia but do not reduce mortality, in which case chronic use should be reserved for coronary vasospasm or incomplete revascularization. 3 Long‐acting, once‐a‐day formulations cause less hypotension and are preferred. Sublingual nitroglycerin remains an important medication to have on hand for a relief of an ischemic attack.

### Clinical outcomes in patients on β-blocker therapy admitted with worsening chronic heart failure [^111bhEwQ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Beta blockers have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure without evidence of overt congestion. No data are available describing outcomes of patients admitted with exacerbated chronic heart failure who are receiving beta blockade at the time of admission. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate clinical outcomes in patients from the Outcomes of the Prospective Trial of Intravenous Milrinone for Exacerbations of Chronic Heart Failure (OPTIME-CHF) study who were prescribed beta blockers on admission compared with patients who were not prescribed beta blockers at admission. In all, 212 patients were treated with beta blockers at admission and 737 patients were not. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, except that patients prescribed beta blockers on admission had slightly higher ejection fractions, fewer New York Heart Association class IV symptoms, and lower heart rates. There was no difference in clinical events between patients who were treated with beta blockers at the time of admission and those who were not. Exploratory analyses suggested that patients whose beta-blocker therapy was discontinued had a higher risk of adverse outcomes, particularly in the subset of patients randomized to milrinone. The data from this nonrandom comparison suggest that continuation of pre-existing beta-blocker therapy is not associated with an increased risk of adverse clinical events in patients admitted with worsening heart failure. These results also suggest that caution should be taken when withdrawing beta blockade in this population.

Beta-blocker–related bradycardia and heart block — management indicates that the slowing of heart rate and cardiac conduction is generally asymptomatic and generally requires no treatment; however, if the bradycardia is accompanied by dizziness or lightheadedness or if second- or third-degree heart block occurs, physicians should decrease the dose of the beta-blocker. Physicians should also consider the possibility of drug interactions, because other drugs can cause bradycardia or heart block and may be discontinued. The role of pacemaker therapy with or without cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) to permit the use of beta-blocker therapy is entirely unknown.

Limitations of contemporary RCTs

Even though RCTs are designed to be unbiased and are regarded as the highest level of evidence, these types of studies still have limitations. The CAPITAL, REDUCE-AMI, and ABYSS trials have several limitations which raise important considerations for future research on beta-blocker therapy following an MI and broader cardiovascular contexts. Watanabe's study, being underpowered, lacked sufficient statistical power to detect meaningful differences, highlighting the need for adequately powered trials to assess beta-blocker withdrawal or continuation in various patient populations. The open-label design used in these trials may have introduced potential bias, as both patients and physicians knew the treatment allocation. This may have led to treatment crossover, especially in the no-beta-blocker or interruption groups, diluting the effects of the intervention. To mitigate this, future studies should aim for double-blind designs, or at the very least, strict protocols to minimize crossover and include both per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses to better capture the impact of treatment adherence and protocol deviations.

Furthermore, neither the REDUCE-AMI nor CAPITAL trial adequately addressed the effects of beta-blocker therapy in patients with mid-range LVEF (40% to 50%). While the ABYSS trial included patients with LVEF ≥ 40%, its findings may not be generalizable beyond Europe due to regional differences in health care systems and clinical practices. To address this limitation, future research should consider multicenter, multicounty RCTs to provide more globally relevant results and help inform worldwide clinical guidelines on beta-blocker use after MI.

Another limitation is the relatively short follow-up duration in many RCTs, which may fail to capture long-term outcomes like recurrent angina, heart failure progression, or other cardiovascular events. Extending follow-up periods in future studies will provide better insights into the long-term effects of beta-blocker therapy, including its impact on mortality, recurrent events, and quality of life, particularly in diverse patient subgroups.

Surgical procedures in adults with hypertension — Preoperative medication guidance includes continuation and specific cautions. In patients with hypertension undergoing major surgery who have been on beta blockers chronically, beta blockers should be continued (COR I, LOE B-NR). In patients with hypertension undergoing planned elective major surgery, it is reasonable to continue medical therapy for hypertension until surgery (COR IIa, LOE C-EO). In patients with hypertension undergoing major surgery, discontinuation of ACE inhibitors or ARBs perioperatively can be considered (COR IIb, LOE B-NR). In patients with planned elective major surgery and SBP of 180 mm Hg or higher or DBP of 110 mm Hg or higher, deferring surgery may be considered (COR IIb, LOE C-LD). For patients undergoing surgery, abrupt preoperative discontinuation of beta blockers or clonidine is potentially harmful (COR III: Harm, LOE B-NR).

WARNINGS

Cardiac Failure

Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by β-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe failure. Although β-blockers should be avoided in overt cardiac failure, acebutolol can be used with caution in patients with a history of heart failure who are controlled with digitalis and/or diuretics. Both digitalis and acebutolol impair AV conduction. If cardiac failure persists, therapy with acebutolol should be withdrawn.

In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure

In patients with aortic or mitral valve disease or compromised left ventricular function, continued depression of the myocardium with β-blocking agents over a period of time may lead to cardiac failure. At the first signs of failure, patients should be digitalized and/or be given a diuretic and the response observed closely. If cardiac failure continues despite adequate digitalization and/or diuretic, acebutolol therapy should be withdrawn.

Exacerbation of Ischemic Heart Disease Following Abrupt Withdrawal

Following abrupt cessation of therapy with certain β-blocking agents in patients with coronary artery disease, exacerbation of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction and death have been reported. Therefore, such patients should be cautioned against interruption of therapy without a physician's advice. Even in the absence of overt ischemic heart disease, when discontinuation of acebutolol is planned, the patient should be carefully observed, and should be advised to limit physical activity to a minimum while acebutolol is gradually withdrawn over a period of about two weeks. (If therapy with an alternative β-blocker is desired, the patient may be transferred directly to comparable doses of another agent without interruption of β-blocking therapy.) If an exacerbation of angina pectoris occurs, antianginal therapy should be restarted immediately in full doses and the patient hospitalized until his condition stabilizes.

Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design

This study is designed as a multicenter, prospective, controlled, randomized, two‐arms, cross‐over, efficacy trial. The population includes patients with the diagnosis of stable HFpEF according to criteria of the European Society of Cardiology 18 and New York Heart Association functional (NYHA) class II‐III/IV. A computer‐generated randomization sequence previously designed will be used to allocate participants (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive: (a) withdrawal of beta‐blocker followed by beta‐blocker reintroduction in two periods of 15 days; or (b) continuation of beta‐blocker followed by beta‐blocker withdrawal in two periods of 15 days. A summary of the study design is described in Figure 1. The study will be conducted in two centers in Spain. Discounting the time due to staggered entry, the total duration of a patient's follow‐up will be 6 months. All patients will provide signed informed consent before randomization. The research ethics committee approves the protocol of our center following the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and national regulations.

2.2 Study population sampling

Candidate patients will be selected from the outpatient HF‐clinics of the Hospital Clínico Universitario of Valencia‐Spain and Hospital Clínico Universitario de Santiago‐Spain. Treatment will be following current guidelines 18 and HF educational programs of each institution. Briefly, HFpEF is defined as the presence of: (a) symptoms and signs of HF with normal (≥ 50%) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); (b) elevation of natriuretic peptides; and (c) increase in LV wall thickness and/or increased left atrial (LA) size as a sign of increased filling pressures. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are summarized in Table 1. Inclusion criteria require the presence of ChI after performing the cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). The chronotropic index is equal to (heart rate at peak exercise−resting heart rate)/([220 – age] − resting heart rate). 19 ChI is defined as a chronotropic index < 0.62.

### The effect of beta blocker withdrawal on adenosine myocardial perfusion imaging [^1172ucup]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is an effective noninvasive modality for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD) and yields valuable information concerning risk, prognosis and therapeutical management. Ergometry is the stress test of choice and most frequently applied. However, the proportion of vasodilator stress tests with adenosine, dipyridamole and recently with regadenoson is growing. All vasodilators increase MBF to comparable levels. Adenosine and regadenoson through direct coronary vasodilation via adenosine A2A receptors, and dipyridamole indirectly through a prolonged action of endogenous adenosine by an inhibition of adenosine deaminase.

Despite maximal vasodilation by pharmacologic vasodilators, an interaction of cardiac medications such as beta blockers, calcium blockers, and nitrates has been suggested in several studies.-Current guidelines recommend temporarily discontinuing beta blockers before stress testing.

In clinical routine a temporary beta blocker withdrawal before stress perfusion testing is sometimes not possible due to complications, contraindications, a tight clinical schedule, or because a patient simply forgot to withhold the medication. Thus, the question arises of whether MPI under vasodilators is affected by beta blockers or their withdrawal at all.

The results of some recent studies addressing this issue are contradictory:

Two retrospective analyses reported a similar sensitivity and specificity between patients with and without beta blockers and no effect of beta blocker therapy on extent, severity, and perfusion defects. On the other hand, a significant impact of beta blockers on adenosine MPI has been demonstrated in a prospective study. All the cited studies related to MPI in SPECT technique.

The present prospective study was designed to determine the absolute effect of a temporary withdrawal of beta blockers on quantitative adenosine MBF with N-13 ammonia PET and to estimate its impact on the results and the interpretation of PET MPI.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA heart failure — practical use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) emphasizes that treatment with an ACEI should be initiated at low doses, and renal function and serum potassium should be assessed within 1 to 2 weeks of initiation of therapy and periodically thereafter; because fluid retention can blunt benefits and fluid depletion can potentiate adverse effects, healthcare providers should ensure that patients are being given appropriate doses of diuretics before and during treatment. Clinicians should attempt to use doses that have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in clinical trials; if these target doses of an ACEI cannot be used or are poorly tolerated, intermediate doses should be used, and clinicians should not delay the institution of beta-blockers in patients because of a failure to reach target ACEI doses. Once titrated, patients can generally be maintained on long-term therapy with an ACEI with little difficulty; although symptoms may improve within the first 48 hours, the clinical responses are generally delayed and may require several weeks, months, or more to become apparent, and even if symptoms do not improve, long-term treatment with an ACEI should be maintained to reduce the risk of death or hospitalization. Abrupt withdrawal of treatment with an ACEI should be avoided in the absence of life-threatening complications; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided; the use of an ACEI can also minimize or eliminate the need for long-term potassium supplementation; and in hemodynamically or clinically unstable patients it may be prudent to interrupt treatment with the ACEI temporarily until the clinical status of the patient stabilizes.

### Metoprolol tartrate (Lopressor) [^117L9reS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Abrupt Cessation of Therapy

Following abrupt cessation of therapy with certain beta-blocking agents, exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred. When discontinuing chronically administered LOPRESSOR, gradually reduce the dosage over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and monitor the patient. Warn patients not to interrupt therapy without their physician's advice.

5.2 Heart Failure

Worsening cardiac failure may occur during up-titration of LOPRESSOR. If such symptoms occur, increase diuretics and restore clinical stability before advancing the dose of LOPRESSOR [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. It may be necessary to lower the dose of LOPRESSOR or temporarily discontinue it. Such episodes do not preclude subsequent successful titration of LOPRESSOR.

5.3 Bronchospastic Disease

Patients with bronchospastic disease, should in general, not receive beta-blockers, including LOPRESSOR. Because of its relative beta1cardio-selectivity, however, LOPRESSOR may be used in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive treatment. Because beta1-selectivity is not absolute, use the lowest possible dose of LOPRESSOR. Bronchodilators, including beta2-agonists, should be readily available or administered concomitantly [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

5.4 Pheochromocytoma

If LOPRESSOR is used in the setting of pheochromocytoma, it should be given in combination with an alpha blocker, and only after the alpha blocker has been initiated. Administration of beta-blockers alone in the setting of pheochromocytoma has been associated with a paradoxical increase in blood pressure due to the attenuation of beta-mediated vasodilatation in skeletal muscle.

5.5 Major Surgery

Avoid initiation of a high-dose regimen of beta blocker therapy in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, since such use in patients with cardiovascular risk factors has been associated with bradycardia, hypotension, stroke and death.

Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery, however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.

5.6 Hypoglycemia

Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery, not eating regularly, or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Perioperative blood pressure thresholds, risk stratification, and beta-blocker initiation/withdrawal: There is conflicting evidence for patients with diastolic BP (DBP) > 110 mm Hg regarding recommending delay of surgery, and in a systematic review and meta-analysis, preoperative hypertension was associated with a 35% increase in cardiovascular complications; an increase in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications and renal failure has been reported in patients with DBP > 110 mm Hg immediately before surgery, whereas patients with DBP < 110 mm Hg do not appear to be at significantly increased risk. During induction of anesthesia, a sympathetic reaction can result in a 20 to 30 mm Hg increase in BP, and an elevated BP on the day of surgery may represent "white-coat hypertension"; therefore referring to patients' baseline ambulatory BP is recommended to guide BP management. Without evidence for increased risk for perioperative complications in patients whose preoperative systolic/diastolic BP is < 180/110 mm Hg, there is little evidence to defer surgery and BP can be controlled postoperatively or after discharge. Although few studies describe risks of withdrawing BB in the perioperative period, longstanding evidence suggests that abrupt withdrawal of long-term BB is harmful and should be avoided; there are fewer data to describe whether short-term (1 to 2 days) perioperative use of BB followed by rapid discontinuation is harmful, and abrupt discontinuation of clonidine can result in rebound hypertension associated with norepinephrine surge. This guideline recommends against starting a BB on the day of surgery in BB-naïve patients, particularly at high initial doses, in long-acting form, and if there are no plans for dose titration or monitoring for adverse events.

### The effect of beta blocker withdrawal on adenosine myocardial perfusion imaging [^117NnrTa]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The effect of beta blockers on myocardial blood flow (MBF) under vasodilators has been studied in several SPECT and PET myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) studies with divergent results. The present study evaluated the effect of a beta blocker withdrawal on quantitative adenosine MBF and on MPI results.

Methods

Twenty patients with beta blockers and CAD history were studied with quantitative adenosine N-13 ammonia PET. The first study was performed under complete medication and the second after beta blocker withdrawal. The PET studies were independently read with respect to MPI result and clinical decision making.

Results

Global MBF showed an increase from 180.2 ± 59.9 to 193.6 ± 60.8 mL·minute(-1)/100 g (P = 0.02) after beta blocker withdrawal. The segmental perfusion values were closely correlated (R(2) = 0.82) over the entire range of perfusion values. An essentially different interpretation after beta blocker discontinuation was found in two cases (10%).

Conclusion

A beta blocker withdrawal induces an increase in adenosine MBF. In the majority of cases, MPI interpretation and decision making are independent of beta blocker intake. If a temporary beta blocker withdrawal before MPI is not possible or was not realized by the patient, it is appropriate to perform adenosine stress testing without loss of the essential MPI result.

### Perioperative β-blocker withdrawal and mortality in vascular surgical patients [^117QQgiM]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Our purpose was to determine the effect of postoperative beta-blocker withdrawal on mortality and cardiovascular events after vascular surgery.

Methods

Detailed data were collected on perioperative cardiovascular medication use and discontinuation and cardiovascular risk factors among consecutive major vascular surgical procedures at two university hospitals.

Results

A total of 140 patients received beta-blockers preoperatively. Mortality in the 8 patients who had beta-blockers discontinued postoperatively (50%) was significantly greater than in 132 patients who had beta-blockers continued (1.5%, odds ratio 65.0, P < .001). The effect of beta-blocker discontinuation was unaffected by adjustment by stratification for risk factors (all P ≤ .01), for contraindications to restarting beta-blockers (P = 0.006), and by multivariable analyses adjusting for potential confounders (adjusted odds ratio 17.0, P = 0.01). beta-Blocker discontinuation also was associated with increased cardiovascular mortality (0% vs 29%, P = 0.005) and postoperative myocardial infarction (odds ratio 17.7, P = 0.003).

Conclusion

Discontinuing beta-blockers immediately after vascular surgery may increase the risk of postoperative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

### Betaxolol [^111i5n7E]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Cardiac Failure

Sympathetic stimulation may be a vital component supporting circulatory function in congestive heart failure, and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade carries the potential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating more severe heart failure. In hypertensive patients who have congestive heart failure controlled by digitalis and diuretics, beta-blockers should be administered cautiously. Both digitalis and beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents slow AV conduction.

In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure

Continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. Therefore at the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, discontinuation of betaxolol should be considered. In some cases beta-blocker therapy can be continued while cardiac failure is treated with cardiac glycosides, diuretics, and other agents, as appropriate.

Exacerbation of Angina Pectoris Upon Withdrawal

Abrupt cessation of therapy with certain beta-blocking agents in patients with coronary artery disease has been followed by exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction has been reported. Therefore, such patients should be warned against interruption of therapy without the physician's advice. Even in the absence of overt angina pectoris, when discontinuation of betaxolol is planned, the patient should be carefully observed and therapy should be reinstituted, at least temporarily, if withdrawal symptoms occur.

Bronchospastic diseases

PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASE SHOULD NOT IN GENERAL RECEIVE BETA-BLOCKERS. Because of its relative β -selectivity (cardioselectivity), low doses of betaxolol may be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to or cannot tolerate alternative treatment. Since β -selectivity is not absolute and is inversely related to dose, the lowest possible dose of betaxolol should be used (5 to 10 mg once daily) and a bronchodilator should be made available. If dosage must be increased, divided dosage should be considered to avoid the higher peak blood levels associated with once-daily dosing.

Major Surgery

Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery, however the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures (see Precautions, Drug Interactions).

### Β-blockers and reduction of cardiac events in noncardiac surgery: clinical applications [^1176VH1b]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Recent studies suggest that beta-blockers administered perioperatively may reduce the risk of adverse cardiac events and mortality in patients who have cardiac risk factors and undergo major noncardiac surgery. The objective of this article is to provide practicing physicians with examples of perioperative beta-blocker use in practice by using several hypothetical cases. Although current evidence describing the effectiveness of perioperative beta-blockade may not address all possible clinical situations, it is possible to formulate an evidence-based approach that will maximize benefit to patients. We describe how information from several sources can be used to guide management of patients with limited exercise tolerance, those at highest risk for perioperative cardiac events, patients who are taking beta-blockers long-term, and those with relative contraindications to beta-blockade. Even though fine points of their use remain to be elucidated, perioperative beta-blocker use is important and can be easily applied in practice by any physician involved with the care of patients perioperatively.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Stage C heart failure (HF) with reduced LVEF — Class I recommendations: Measures listed as Class I recommendations for patients in stages A and B are also appropriate for patients in Stage C (Levels of Evidence: A, B, and C as appropriate). Diuretics and salt restriction are indicated in patients with current or prior symptoms of HF and reduced LVEF who have evidence of fluid retention (Level of Evidence: C). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are recommended for all patients with current or prior symptoms of HF and reduced LVEF, unless contraindicated (Level of Evidence: A). Beta-blockers (using 1 of the 3 proven to reduce mortality, i.e., bisoprolol, carvedilol, and sustained release metoprolol succinate) are recommended for all stable patients with current or prior symptoms of HF and reduced LVEF, unless contraindicated (Level of Evidence: A). Angiotensin II receptor blockers approved for the treatment of HF are recommended in patients with current or prior symptoms of HF and reduced LVEF who are ACEI-intolerant (Level of Evidence: A). Drugs known to adversely affect the clinical status of patients with current or prior symptoms of HF and reduced LVEF should be avoided or withdrawn whenever possible.

### Life-threatening perioperative anesthetic complications: major issues surrounding perioperative morbidity and mortality [^113jdm4h]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Beta-blocker therapy

The recommendations regarding perioperative use of beta-blockers are simple and straightforward. If the patient is currently taking a beta-blocker (chronic therapy), they should continue taking their beta-blockers. However, despite the cardioprotective effects of beta-blockade, initiation of beta-blocker therapy in the immediate preoperative period has been associated with significant postoperative morbidity/mortality. More specifically, Wijeysundera and colleagues showed that perioperative beta-blockade started within 1 day or less before non-cardiac surgery prevents non-fatal MI but increases risks of stroke, death, hypotension and bradycardia. Additionally, Beattie et al demonstrated in 2010 that in the setting of anemia, beta-blockade significantly increases the risk of major adverse cardiac effects and mortality thereby emphasizing the importance of giving consideration to increasing the threshold of (intraoperative) blood transfusion in patient on beta-blocker therapy.

### Effect of β-blockers beyond 3 Years after acute myocardial infarction [^112fZaQ9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are a high‐risk group with increased mortality even after successful revascularization; thus, the current practice guidelines emphasize the importance of intensive risk factor modification, including hypertension in patients with AMI. 1

β‐Blockers have improved survival and are one of the cornerstones in the treatment of ischemic heart disease; they exert an antianginal effect by reducing the myocardial workload and oxygen demand. 2 Besides, they also have antiarrhythmic and antiremodeling effects. 3 The effects of β‐blockers have been extensively investigated in patients with AMI, 4, 5, 6, 7 and the current practice guidelines also recommend the use of β‐blockers in all patients after AMI unless contraindicated. 1, 8

Although the effects of β‐blockers on short‐term outcomes are well established, data on their long‐term effects are scarce, especially beyond 1 year after AMI. In addition, the β‐blocker prescription may change during follow‐up, so recent studies that examined long‐term survival effect according to β‐blocker prescription at discharge might have grave limitations. 9, 10 Therefore, whether β‐blocker use beyond 1 year after AMI truly reduces mortality in the current era of AMI and post‐AMI care remains inconclusive, particularly in patients with preserved left ventricular (LV) systolic function. In low‐risk patients (preserved ejection fraction, young age, absence of arrhythmias, or residual ischemia), prolonged use of β‐blockers is unlikely to confer any mortality benefit. 11 These findings continuously raise a question to clinicians on whether to discontinue β‐blockers in low‐risk patients or to switch β‐blockers to other classes of antihypertensive agents with stronger evidence for secondary prevention of cardiovascular adverse outcomes.

In this study, we aimed to examine the late effect of β‐blockers in patients with AMI. For this purpose, the β‐blocker status and clinical characteristics of each patient were reevaluated at discharge, 1 year after AMI, and 3 years after AMI.

### Continuation vs withdrawal of beta-blockers and outcomes after myocardial infarction with preserved left ventricular function [^113WN5fs]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Guideline-recommended therapy for patients who have suffered an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) includes antiplatelet therapy, statins, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and beta-blockers (BBs). BBs are a cornerstone of treatment for ischemic heart disease in the acute phase because they inhibit the physiological sympathetic activation, reduce myocardial workload, reduce infarct size, and have antiarrhythmic and antiremodeling effects. BB also have a well-defined role in long-term therapy of patients with persistent reduction in left ventricular (LV) systolic function. However, the role of longer-term BB treatment when AMI course is not complicated by heart failure, LV systolic dysfunction, recurrent ischemia, or arrhythmia is not well established. Most guidelines recommend BB use in the absence of contraindications with grade 1B evidence in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and grade 2A in non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The recommendation for BB use after AMI predominately comes from studies that predate routine implementation of a contemporary strategy of early reperfusion and medical therapy. Recent guidelines report uncertainty in the strength of the evidence for long-term use of BB post revascularization with preserved LV ejection fraction (LVEF).

Observational studies that have evaluated the duration of BB use and outcomes after AMI have several limitations, including incomplete ascertainment or heterogeneous definitions of post-myocardial infarction (MI) LV dysfunction, inclusion of patients with independent indications or contraindications to BB, lack of longitudinal prescription data, and relatively short durations of follow-up. Two recently published open-label randomized clinical trials have added to this literature but have not completely resolved the dilemma. The REDUCE AMI (Randomized Evaluation of Decreased Usage of Beta-Blockers after Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial found that initiating BBs in MI survivors with preserved LVEF at the time of discharge did not reduce the incidence of death from any cause or recurrent AMI, whereas the ABYSS (Assessment of Beta-Blocker Interruption 1 Year after an Uncomplicated Myocardial Infarction on Safety and Symptomatic Cardiac Events Requiring Hospitalization) trial failed to find that interrupting BBs a mean of 2.9 years after MI was noninferior to continuing them, for a composite primary endpoint of death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons. We sought to assess the association between discontinuation of newly prescribed BB within 180 days after AMI and long-term cardiovascular outcomes among a well-characterized, population-based cohort of AMI survivors without definite indications for long-term BB therapy.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^111LgKS2]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Graves' disease (GD) — thyroidectomy selection and perioperative management is outlined as follows: In exceptional circumstances when euthyroidism cannot be achieved before surgery, when surgery is urgent, or when the patient is allergic to antithyroid medication, the patient should be adequately treated with beta-blockade and potassium iodide in the immediate preoperative period, and the surgeon and anesthesiologist should have experience in this situation. If surgery is chosen as the primary therapy for GD, near-total or total thyroidectomy is the procedure of choice, and the patient should be referred to a high-volume thyroid surgeon. Following thyroidectomy for GD, we suggest that serum calcium or intact parathyroid hormone levels be measured, and that oral calcium and calcitriol supplementation be administered based on these results. Antithyroid drugs should be stopped at the time of thyroidectomy for GD, and beta-adrenergic blockers should be weaned following surgery. Following thyroidectomy for GD, L-thyroxine should be started at a daily dose appropriate for the patient's weight (0.8 μg/lb or 1.7 μg/kg), and serum TSH measured 6–8 weeks postoperatively.

### Nicardipine (nicardipine hydrochloride) [^112mpV39]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Increased Angina

About 7% of patients in short-term, placebo-controlled angina trials have developed increased frequency, duration or severity of angina on starting nicardipine hydrochloride or at the time of dosage increases, compared with 4% of patients on placebo. Comparisons with beta‑blockers also show a greater frequency of increased angina, 4% vs 1%. The mechanism of this effect has not been established (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Use in Patients with Congestive Heart Failure

Although preliminary hemodynamic studies in patients with congestive heart failure have shown that nicardipine hydrochloride reduced afterload without impairing myocardial contractility, it has a negative inotropic effect in vitro and in some patients. Caution should be exercised when using the drug in congestive heart failure patients, particularly in combination with a beta-blocker.

Beta-Blocker Withdrawal

Nicardipine hydrochloride is not a beta-blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta-blocker withdrawal; any such withdrawal should be by gradual reduction of the dose of beta-blocker, preferably over 8 days to 10 days.

### Exchange of β-blockers in heart failure patients. experiences from the poststudy phase of COMET (the carvedilol or metoprolol European trial) [^116dE1gQ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET) reported a significant survival benefit for carvedilol, a beta1-, beta2- and alpha1-blocker, vs. metoprolol tartrate, a beta1-selective blocker, in patients with mild-to-severe chronic heart failure (CHF). Patients on treatment with metoprolol might benefit from switching to carvedilol.

Aim

To investigate the safety and tolerability of switching beta-blockers in CHF.

Methods

At the end of COMET, the Steering Committee recommended that study medication was stopped without unblinding, and patients were commenced on open-label beta-blockade at a dose equivalent to half the dose of blinded therapy, with subsequent titration to target or maximum tolerated dose. Patients were followed for 30 days.

Results

1321 out of 1440 patients were transitioned to open-label treatment (76.8% to carvedilol). Serious adverse and CHF-related events were respectively 9.4% and 4.7% in those switching from carvedilol to metoprolol and 3.1% and 1.5% in patients switching from metoprolol to carvedilol. Patients who switched from carvedilol to metoprolol showed the highest mortality or hospitalisation rate (12.3%) in comparison with those who switched from metoprolol to carvedilol (3.1%, p < 0.001) or who stayed on the same drug (carvedilol: 2.5%, p < 0.001; metoprolol: 4.2%, p = 0.04). Reducing the initial dose of the second beta-blocker maximised the safety of this strategy. Event rate was higher in patients with more severe heart failure and in those withdrawing from beta-blockade.

Conclusion

Our data show that switching beta-blockers is a practical, safe and well-tolerated strategy to optimise treatment of CHF. Patients who switched to carvedilol showed the lowest rate of adverse events. A closer clinical monitoring is recommended during transition in high-risk patients.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Perioperative hypertension in noncardiac surgery — beta-blocker (BB) and clonidine management: If well tolerated, BBs should be continued in patients who are currently receiving them for GDMT indications, with clinical judgment used in titrating BB during the perioperative period and focusing on continuing the medication through the hospital stay and at discharge unless clear contraindications arise. Longstanding evidence suggests that abrupt withdrawal of long-term BB is harmful and should be avoided, and abrupt discontinuation of clonidine can result in rebound hypertension associated with norepinephrine surge. This guideline recommends against starting a BB on the day of surgery in BB-naive patients, particularly at high initial doses, in long-acting form, and when there are no plans for dose titration or monitoring for adverse events.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^116o1x3e]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 11 — patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and > 80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

### Optimizing the use of β-blockers in the effective treatment and management of heart failure: a case study approach [^111fzRR2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Today, heart failure is an increasing concern in the United States. Its prognoses are poor and its treatment is a complicated endeavor, because heart failure is not a single disease state. Rather, it is a syndrome with a cyclic pathophysiology composed of multiple mechanisms. Effective case management of heart failure must address each of the many changes involved in this syndrome, and therapy must be individualized, especially because patients with heart failure often require regimens of five or more drugs. In special populations, such as the elderly and/or patients with concomitant diseases requiring added medication, polypharmacy becomes an important issue. Maintaining consistent compliance with the treatment regimen and patient education regarding symptoms of fluid retention can be critical. Currently, beta-blockers, in addition to standard therapy, are recommended as first-line treatment in mild-to-moderate heart failure. The three cases presented in this article illustrate some common scenarios encountered and clinical decisions made when beta-blockers are used in the management of heart failure.

### Betaxolol hydrochloride [^113XPwnN]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS:

Cardiac Failure: Sympathetic stimulation may be a vital component supporting circulatory function in congestive heart failure, and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade carries the potential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating more severe heart failure. In hypertensive patients who have congestive heart failure controlled by digitalis and diuretics, beta-blockers should be administered cautiously. Both digitalis and beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents slow AV conduction.

In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure: Continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. Therefore, at the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure, discontinuation of betaxolol tablets, USP should be considered. In some cases beta-blocker therapy can be continued while cardiac failure is treated with cardiac glycosides, diuretics, and other agents, as appropriate.

Exacerbation of Angina Pectoris Upon Withdrawal: Abrupt cessation of therapy with certain beta-blocking agents in patients with coronary artery disease has been followed by exacerbations of angina pectoris and, in some cases, myocardial infarction has been reported. Therefore such patients should be warned against interruption of therapy without the physician's advice. Even in the absence of overt angina pectoris, when discontinuation of betaxolol tablets, USP is planned, the patient should be carefully observed and therapy should be reinstituted, at least temporarily, if withdrawal symptoms occur.

Bronchospastic diseases: PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASE SHOULD NOT IN GENERAL RECEIVE BETA-BLOCKERS. Because of its relative ß selectivity (cardioselectivity), low doses of betaxolol tablets, USP may be used with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to or cannot tolerate alternative treatment. Since ß selectivity is not absolute and is inversely related to dose, the lowest possible dose of betaxolol tablets, USP should be used (5 to 10 mg once daily) and a bronchodilator should be made available. If dosage must be increased, divided dosage should be considered to avoid the higher peak blood levels associated with once-daily dosing.

### Β-blocking agents for surgery: influence on mortality and major outcomes. A meta-analysis [^115QwM6M]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To re-evaluate the effects of perioperative beta-blockade on mortality and major outcomes after surgery.

Design

A meta-analysis of parallel randomized, controlled trials published in English.

Setting

A university-based electronic search.

Participants

Patients undergoing surgery.

Interventions

Two interventions were evaluated: (1) Stopping or continuing a β-blocker in patients on long-term β-blocker therapy; and (2) Adding a β-blocker for the perioperative period.

Measurements and Main Results

Stopping a β-blocker before the surgery did not change the risk of myocardial infarction (3 studies including 97 patients): risk ratio (RR), 1.08 (95% confidence interval 0.30, 3.95); I(2), 0%. Adding a β-blocker reduced the risk of death at 1 year: RR, 0.56 (0.31, 0.99); I(2), 0%; p = 0.046; number needed to treat 28 (19, 369) (4 studies with 781 patients). Adding a β-blocker reduced the 0-to-30 day risk of myocardial infarction: RR, 0.65 (0.47, 0.88); I(2), 12.9%; p = 0.006 (15 studies with 12,224 patients), but increased the risk of a stroke: RR, 2.18 (1.40, 3.38); I(2), 0%; p = 0.001 (8 studies with 11,737 patients); number needed to harm 177 (512, 88).

Conclusions

β-blockers reduced the 1-year risk of death, and this effect seemed greater than the risk of inducing a stroke.

Adverse events leading to discontinuation of allocated treatment

We analysed data on the rate of withdrawal from randomly assigned treatment due to any adverse events, and also report on the frequency of specific adverse events including depression, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction.

Trial participants on a beta‐blocker were no more likely than participants receiving a placebo to discontinue treatment due to adverse events (3 trials, 22,729 participants: RR (random effects) 3.38, 95% CI 0.82 to 13.95; low certainty evidence). However, there was significant heterogeneity of effect between the trials (I 2 = 100%, P < 0.00001); with no difference in the likelihood of discontinuing treatment with oxprenolol (1 trial, 6357 participants: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.04) and an increased likelihood with propranolol or atenolol (2 trials, 16,372; RR (random effects) 6.35, 95% CI 3.94 to 10.22, I² = 91%). A sensitivity analysis adding studies included in related reviews also revealed significant heterogeneity of effect (I 2 = 99%, P < 0.00001).

Participants taking a beta‐blocker were more likely to discontinue treatment due to adverse events than participants taking a RAS inhibitor (2 trials, 9951 participants: RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.54, I² = 12%; ARI 5.5%, NNTH 18; low certainty evidence), but there was no significant difference with a diuretic (3 trials, 11,566 participants: RR (random effects) 1.69, 95% CI 0.95 to 3.00, I² = 95%; low certainty evidence) or a CCB (2 trials, 21,591 participants: RR (random effects) 1.20, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.04, I² = 93%; low certainty evidence).

### Perioperative β-blockers for major noncardiac surgery: primum non nocere [^114K6akA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Recent studies have called into question the benefit of perioperative beta blockade, especially in patients at low to moderate risk of cardiac events. Once considered standard of care, the role of beta-blocker therapy now lies mired in conflicting data that are difficult to apply to the at-risk patient. We provide an overview of the evolution of perioperative beta blockade, beginning with the physiology of the adrenergic system, with emphasis on the biologic rationale for the perioperative implementation of beta-blockers. Although initial studies were small in size and statistically limited, early data showed cardiac benefit with the use of perioperative beta-blockers. However, larger, more recent studies now suggest a lack of benefit and potential harm from this practice. This paradigm holds true especially in those at low-to-moderate cardiovascular risk profiles. Potential explanations for these paradoxical results are discussed, stressing the key differences between earlier and current studies that may explain these divergent outcomes. We conclude by commenting on performance measures as they relate to perioperative beta-blockers and make recommendations for the continued safe implementation of this practice.

Heart failure management after device therapy — medication uptitration "must be attempted gradually in small dose increments" because "uptitration can lead to heart failure exacerbation".

Follow-up would ideally be by specialists in both arrhythmia and heart failure management, but "most patients do not have routine access to such settings". To maximize benefit after a sudden death has been prevented, "it is crucial that the management team evaluate the heart failure profile, review the medical regimen, and plan for ongoing care".

### Bisoprolol fumarate [^114svzXb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Cardiac Failure

Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in the setting of congestive heart failure, and beta-blockade may result in further depression of myocardial contractility and precipitate more severe failure. In general, beta-blocking agents should be avoided in patients with overt congestive failure. However, in some patients with compensated cardiac failure it may be necessary to utilize them. In such a situation, they must be used cautiously. In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure

Continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blockers can, in some patients, precipitate cardiac failure. At the first signs or symptoms of heart failure, discontinuation of bisoprolol fumarate should be considered. In some cases, beta-blocker therapy can be continued while heart failure is treated with other drugs. Abrupt Cessation of Therapy

Exacerbation of angina pectoris, and, in some instances, myocardial infarction or ventricular arrhythmia, have been observed in patients with coronary artery disease following abrupt cessation of therapy with beta-blockers. Such patients should, therefore, be cautioned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice. Even in patients without overt coronary artery disease, it may be advisable to taper therapy with bisoprolol fumarate over approximately one week with the patient under careful observation. If withdrawal symptoms occur, bisoprolol fumarate therapy should be reinstituted, at least temporarily.

Peripheral Vascular Disease

Beta-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Caution should be exercised in such individuals.
