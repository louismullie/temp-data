## Question

Cephalexin dose for 4 yrs old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate cephalexin dose for a 4-year-old child, including weight-based dosing, frequency, duration, and special-case adjustments. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the child's age and whether pediatric dosing principles apply. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled pediatric dose ranges and frequency. Next, I will consider infection-specific dose adjustments, especially for otitis media, osteoarticular infections, and UTIs. After that, I need to check pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets and whether less frequent dosing can be justified. I should also review renal impairment adjustments, formulation and adherence considerations, and finally synthesize a practical example with a clear dosing plan and duration, making sure I double-check maximum daily doses and safety caveats along the way.

> Let me first confirm the pediatric applicability. A 4-year-old falls under pediatric dosing rules, and cephalexin's safety and effectiveness in children are established for the labeled pediatric regimens, so I should proceed using weight-based pediatric dosing rather than adult fixed doses [^115mGUXG] [^117Kysaj].

> I need to verify the core pediatric dose range. The FDA label recommends 25–50 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours for most infections, with the option to increase to 50–100 mg/kg/day for severe infections, and it emphasizes that β-hemolytic streptococcal infections should be treated for at least 10 days; I should keep that minimum duration in mind for streptococcal pharyngitis or skin infections due to GAS [^117Kysaj].

> Hold on, I should verify infection-specific adjustments. For acute otitis media, the labeled pediatric dose is 75–100 mg/kg/day in divided doses, which is higher than the routine range, so if the indication is AOM I would target the higher end of that spectrum; for osteoarticular infections, pediatric guidelines endorse high-dose cephalexin at 75–100 mg/kg/day, and some experts even use up to 6 g/day in select cases, though I need to ensure careful monitoring and source control in those scenarios [^117Kysaj] [^113jGzww] [^111t7Zb7].

> Next, I should review pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations. Cephalexin is a beta-lactam for which time above MIC drives efficacy; modeling and clinical data suggest that for MSSA with MICs around 1–4 mg/L, higher divided doses can be needed to reliably achieve 40% fT > MIC, which supports the use of 75–100 mg/kg/day in serious MSSA infections; wait, let me verify whether less frequent dosing can still work — retrospective pediatric data show similar outcomes with QID versus TID for osteoarticular infections, and population PK work proposes BID/TID regimens that can meet PD targets depending on MIC, but I should be cautious and align with local susceptibility patterns and clinical response [^111t7Zb7] [^113R34ep] [^115fAxVQ].

> I will now examine renal function considerations. Cephalexin is renally cleared; in significant renal impairment, dose reductions are advised, and in severe or end-stage renal disease the label directs dose adjustments and extended intervals, so I need to check creatinine clearance or eGFR before finalizing frequency and total daily dose; for a typical 4-year-old with normal renal function, standard pediatric dosing applies, but I should confirm this explicitly [^117Kysaj] [^115mGUXG].

> Let me think about formulation and adherence. For a 4-year-old, oral suspension is usually preferred for accurate weight-based dosing and palatability; tablets/capsules become more practical as children approach about 10–12 years, so suspension is the right choice here to support adherence and dose precision; I should double-check the suspension concentration when calculating milliliters per dose to avoid errors [^1152vrNf].

> Now, I should synthesize a practical example. For a 4-year-old weighing 16 kg with an uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infection due to MSSA, I would use 25–50 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours; using 40 mg/kg/day, that equals 640 mg/day, or 160 mg per dose QID for 7–14 days, with reassessment at 48–72 hours; if the infection were severe or if the child had an AOM indication, I would increase to 75–100 mg/kg/day, for example 80 mg/kg/day equals 1,280 mg/day, or 320 mg per dose QID, ensuring the total daily dose stays within pediatric norms and below the adult maximum of 4 g/day unless a specialist directs otherwise [^117Kysaj] [^113cdboF].

> Wait, I should verify the maximum daily dose and correct a potential misstatement. I initially thought the pediatric maximum was 2 g/day, but that is not accurate; the FDA label allows up to 4 g/day in adults and older children, and pediatric osteoarticular guidance notes some experts use up to 6 g/day in select cases, so I should correct myself and anchor to 4 g/day as the general pediatric cap unless a pediatric infectious diseases specialist advises otherwise for compelling indications like MSSA osteoarticular infection [^117Kysaj] [^113jGzww].

> I need to ensure duration aligns with the pathogen and site. For streptococcal pharyngitis or impetigo, at least 10 days is recommended to prevent rheumatic complications; for uncomplicated SSTI without MRSA risk, 7–10 days is typical if improving promptly; for osteoarticular infections, total therapy is often 3–4 weeks with close clinical and laboratory monitoring; for AOM, 7–10 days is standard in children under 6 years, with adjustments based on response and severity [^117Kysaj] [^115rEzyk].

> But wait, what if MRSA is suspected or confirmed. Cephalexin lacks MRSA activity, so for purulent infections with high MRSA prevalence or when cultures show MRSA, clindamycin, TMP-SMX, or other MRSA-active agents are preferred; in cellulitis without purulence, streptococci predominate and cephalexin remains reasonable, and adding TMP-SMX to cephalexin did not improve outcomes in adults with uncomplicated cellulitis, reinforcing that spectrum expansion is not routinely needed when MRSA risk is low [^1149pVqY] [^1112uFJm].

> I should double-check that my dosing example respects both the lower and higher ends of evidence-based ranges. Using 40 mg/kg/day QID for a 16 kg child yields 160 mg per dose, which is within the 25–50 mg/kg/day labeled range and allows room to escalate to 50–75 mg/kg/day if the clinical response is suboptimal or if the infection is more severe, always reassessing at 48–72 hours and adjusting based on culture results and clinical trajectory [^117Kysaj].

> Final dosing synthesis for a 4-year-old with normal renal function: use cephalexin oral suspension dosed at 25–50 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours for most infections, increase to 75–100 mg/kg/day divided every 6–8 hours for otitis media, severe MSSA infections, or osteoarticular infections, treat streptococcal infections for at least 10 days, and keep total daily dose at or below 4 g unless a specialist directs otherwise; choose suspension for adherence and dose accuracy, and adjust for renal impairment if creatinine clearance is below 30 mL/min [^117Kysaj] [^113jGzww] [^115mGUXG].

---

Cephalexin for a 4-year-old is dosed at **25–50 mg/kg/day** [^117Kysaj] divided every 6–8 hours (maximum 4 g/day) [^113jGzww]. For severe infections, use **50–100 mg/kg/day** [^117Kysaj] in 3–4 divided doses. For otitis media, use **75–100 mg/kg/day** [^117Kysaj] in 3–4 divided doses. Treat streptococcal infections for at least 10 days [^117Kysaj] [^112iHzvG]. Adjust dose for renal impairment if creatinine clearance is < 30 mL/min [^115mGUXG] [^117Kysaj]. Common adverse effects include diarrhea, nausea, and rash [^notfound]; monitor for allergic reactions and superinfections [^notfound].

---

## Recommended pediatric dosage

- **Standard dosage**: 25–50 mg/kg/day [^117Kysaj] divided every 6–8 hours (maximum 4 g/day) [^113jGzww].

- **Severe infections**: 50–100 mg/kg/day [^117Kysaj] in 3–4 divided doses.

- **Otitis media**: 75–100 mg/kg/day [^117Kysaj] in 3–4 divided doses.

- **Duration**: 7–14 days, depending on infection type and severity [^117Kysaj]; streptococcal infections require at least 10 days [^112iHzvG].

---

## Clinical considerations

- **Renal impairment**: Adjust dose if creatinine clearance is < 30 mL/min [^115mGUXG] [^117Kysaj].

- **Allergic reactions**: Monitor for hypersensitivity, especially with penicillin allergy [^114AdUX9].

- **Adverse effects**: Common effects include diarrhea, nausea, and rash [^notfound]; monitor for superinfections [^notfound].

---

## Example calculation

For a 4-year-old weighing 16 kg, the standard dose is **25–50 mg/kg/day** [^117Kysaj] divided every 6–8 hours (maximum 4 g/day) [^113jGzww]. This corresponds to 400–800 mg/day, or 100–200 mg per dose if given every 6 hours.

---

Cephalexin is appropriate for a 4-year-old when dosed by weight and infection severity, with attention to renal function, allergies, and adverse effects [^115mGUXG].

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Duration of therapy ranges from 7 to 14 days depending on the infection type and severity. (2)
Dosage adjustment is required in patients with severe and end stage renal disease (ESRD) defined as creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min. (2.3)

2.1 Adults and Pediatric Patients at Least 15 Years of Age

The usual dose of oral cephalexin capsules is 250 mg every 6 hours, but a dose of 500 mg every 12 hours may be administered. Treatment is administered for 7 to 14 days.

For more severe infections larger doses of oral cephalexin capsules may be needed, up to 4 grams daily in two to four equally divided doses.

2.2 Pediatric Patients (over 1 year of age)

The recommended total daily dose of oral cephalexin capsules for pediatric patients is 25 to 50 mg/kg given in equally divided doses for 7 to 14 days. In the treatment of β-hemolytic streptococcal infections, duration of at least 10 days is recommended. In severe infections, a total daily dose of 50 to 100 mg/kg may be administered in equally divided doses.

For the treatment of otitis media, the recommended daily dose is 75 to 100 mg/kg given in equally divided doses.

2.3 Dosage Adjustments in Adult and Pediatric Patients at Least 15 Years of Age with Renal Impairment

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

MSSA acute bacterial arthritis antimicrobial choice and cephalexin dosing — For children with ABA caused by MSSA, a beta-lactam agent is preferred for initial parenteral treatment (cefazolin, nafcillin or oxacillin) and for definitive oral treatment (cephalexin). "High dose" cephalexin (100 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses) was first studied and remains adequate as convalescent therapy following initial parenteral therapy and surgical management. Modeling using a pharmacodynamic driver of 40% T > MIC suggests higher doses may be required for strains with MICs of 2 and 4 mg/L, and the MIC90 for MSSA is 4–8 mg/L, suggesting oral therapy should follow initial parenteral therapy, surgical debridement, and clinical response. The higher doses (120 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours) needed to achieve this target in 100%, 90% and 80% of children for MSSA with MICs of 0.25, 2 and 4 mg/L, respectively, do not appear necessary for good outcomes after oral transition. Using the same target, proposed cephalexin dosages (administered Q8H) are 45 mg/kg/day for MSSA with an MIC of 1 mg/L; 75 mg/kg/day for an MIC of 2 mg/L; and 135 mg/kg/day for an MIC of 4 mg/L, with those doses proposed for children weighing 10–15 kg.

### Twice-and thrice-daily cephalexin dosing for Staphylococcus aureus infections in children [^115fAxVQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cephalexin is used for the treatment of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infections in children. Although 4 times daily dosing is recommended, less frequent dosing regimens are often prescribed to improve treatment acceptability and adherence. We developed a population pharmacokinetic model of cephalexin in children to determine a twice-daily (BID) and thrice-daily (TID) cephalexin dosing regimen for MSSA infections.

Methods

A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using a nonlinear mixed effects modeling approach. The dataset used was from a prospective open-label pharmacokinetic study of orally administered cephalexin in 12 children 1–16 years of age with bone and joint infections. Simulations were performed to determine a BID and TID dosing regimen so that ≥ 90% of children in this age group would achieve the pharmacodynamic target for MSSA (ie, time that the free drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration of the bacteria for at least 40% of the dosing interval).

Results

The final model was 1 compartment with a transit compartment model to account for delay in oral absorption. For BID dosing, doses of 22–45 and 80mg/kg were required for MSSA with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 1–2 and 4mg/L, respectively. For TID dosing, the respective required doses were 15–25 and 45mg/kg.

Conclusions

Our study proposes a BID and TID cephalexin dosing regimen that can be prospectively evaluated. Through reducing the dose frequency of this widely prescribed antibiotic, we can reduce the medication burden for children and improve treatment compliance for MSSA infections.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

PIDS/IDSA pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) — orally administered antibiotics provide the following dosing and adult caps. Amoxicillin is 50–100 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 8 h (maximum daily adult dose 4 g/day), and "Not studied for ABA caused by pneumococcus or group A streptococcus in children; the higher end of the range may be needed for pneumococci that demonstrate increased penicillin resistance". Cephalexin is 75–100 mg/kg/day in divided doses three or four times per day (maximum 4 g/day), with "Some experts recommend up to 6 g/day". Oral clindamycin is 30–40 mg/kg/day in divided doses three or four times per day (maximum 1.8 g/day), with "Some experts recommend up to 2.7 g/day".

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of cephalexin in pediatric patients was established in clinical trials for the dosages described in the dosage and administration section [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 701 subjects in 3 published clinical studies of cephalexin, 433 (62%) were 65 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.

This drug is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

Cephalexin should be administered with careful monitoring in the presence of renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min, with or without dialysis). Under such conditions, careful clinical observation and laboratory studies renal function monitoring should be conducted because safe dosage may be lower than that usually recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Monitor patients longer for toxicity and drug interactions due to delayed clearance.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral cephalexin in children with osteoarticular infections [^113gdiN5]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoarticular infections lead to significant morbidity in children. Cephalexin has in vitro activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, a predominant pathogen in osteoarticular infection. However, cephalexin pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) are poorly described in children. This study described cephalexin PK in children treated for osteoarticular infection and assessed the proportion of children achieving surrogate PK/PD target for efficacy in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus infection.

Methods

Children with osteoarticular infection, 1 to 18 years of age, were eligible for this study if they were receiving oral cephalexin per standard of care. PK plasma samples were collected at specified times after multiple doses. PK parameters were estimated using noncompartmental analysis. PK/PD target for efficacy was calculated using the child's PK parameters, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the isolate when available and previously described MIC of 2 and 4 mg/L.

Results

Twelve children were enrolled and PK profiles were obtained from 11 of them. Median age was 7 years, and median cephalexin dose was 40 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours. Median apparent oral clearance, apparent oral volume of distribution and elimination half-life (T1/2) were 0.29 L/h/kg, 0.44 L/kg and 1.1 h, respectively. Time above MIC (T > MIC) was greater than 40% of the dosing interval in 100%, 90% and 80% of the children when MICs were 0.25, 2 and 4 mg/L, respectively.

Conclusions

Oral cephalexin achieved optimal plasma exposure and was well tolerated in children with osteoarticular infection. Correlation between osteoarticular infection clinical outcome and PK/PD parameters needs further evaluation.

### Mupirocin [^116r1QiU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of topical mupirocin cream for the treatment of secondarily infected traumatic skin lesions (e.g., lacerations, sutured wounds, and abrasions not more than 10 cm in length or 100 cm2in total area) was compared with that of oral cephalexin in 2 randomized, double-blind, double-dummy clinical trials. Clinical efficacy rates at follow-up in the per-protocol populations (adults and pediatric subjects included) were 96.1% for mupirocin cream (n = 231) and 93.1% for oral cephalexin (n = 219). Pathogen eradication rates at follow-up in the per-protocol populations were 100% for both mupirocin cream and oral cephalexin.

Pediatrics

There were 93 pediatric subjects aged 2 weeks to 16 years enrolled per protocol in the secondarily infected skin lesion trials, although only 3 were younger than 2 years of age in the population treated with mupirocin cream. Subjects were randomized to either 10 days of topical mupirocin cream 3 times daily or 10 days of oral cephalexin (250 mg 4 times daily for subjects greater than 40 kg or 25 mg per kg per day oral suspension in 4 divided doses for subjects less than or equal to 40 kg). Clinical efficacy at follow-up (7 to 12 days post-therapy) in the per-protocol populations was 97.7% (43 of 44) for mupirocin cream and 93.9% (46 of 49) for cephalexin.

### Selecting the proper pediatric dose: It is more than size that matters [^114Eb5f8]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Appropriate pediatric dose selection remains one of the most vexing clinical problems faced by healthcare professionals who are charged to provide medical care to infants and children. While body size does reflect the ontogeny of processes that govern drug disposition, there are extremes of disease that perturb the expected relationships.

### Oral cephalexin population pharmacokinetics and target attainment analysis in infants 7–60 Days old [^116KGCv2]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There are limited data to guide oral antibiotic dosing in neonates and young infants, particularly for intravenous (IV) to oral transition. Cephalexin is a promising oral treatment for neonatal pathogens, including Enterobacterales and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). However, maturational changes in gastrointestinal absorption and kidney function during early infancy complicate extrapolation of dosing from older populations. We evaluated cephalexin pharmacokinetics (PK) and simulated dosing strategies to achieve pharmacodynamic (PD) targets in infants ≤ 60 days old.

Methods

This prospective, single-center study enrolled infants 0–60 days receiving cephalexin either as part of routine clinical care or as a single 25 mg/kg study dose. Plasma concentrations were analyzed using non-linear mixed-effects modeling. Simulations assessed the probability of target attainment (PTA) for free time above MIC (fT > MIC) for ≥ 50% and ≥ 70% of the dosing interval across MICs 1–16 mg/L, assuming 10% protein binding. We also simulated the cumulative fractional response (CFR) using typical MIC distributions for Enterobacterales and MSSA.

Results

The analysis included 144 samples from 33 infants with median post-natal age 31 days (range 9–56) and median gestational age 37 weeks (range 29–41). A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and lag time best described the data. Weight influenced apparent volume of distribution and apparent clearance. Additionally, we identified a maturational effect on absorption rate using post-natal age and on apparent clearance using post-menstrual age. For Enterobacterales, 25 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours achieved > 90% CFR for a 50% fT > MIC target. For MSSA, 25 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours was sufficient. Higher or more frequent dosing was required to meet the more stringent 70% fT > MIC target.

Conclusions

Oral cephalexin can achieve necessary PD targets in infants 7–60 days old. These findings support the use of model-informed dosing strategies to guide safe and effective oral antibiotic use in early infancy, including for IV-to-oral transition.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Antimicrobial management in AHO when microbial etiology is identified notes that for MSSA isolates, first-generation cephalosporins (eg, cefazolin) or ASP (eg, oxacillin and nafcillin) are the preferred parenteral agents, and excellent outcomes with the transition to oral therapy with high-dose cephalexin or clindamycin are well documented; for MSSA infections, the safety and tolerability benefits of beta-lactam therapy are likely to be greater than glycopeptides (vancomycin), lincosamides (clindamycin), and oxazolidinones (linezolid), but no controlled data comparing efficacy, tolerability, and adverse event profiles between agents have been collected specifically in children with AHO. For CA-MRSA isolates that are susceptible, clindamycin is the preferred agent, with tolerability and safety benefits greater than vancomycin, the ability to convert readily from parenteral to oral therapy due to good enteral bioavailability, and potential adherence improved by adding flavoring to the liquid formulation. Vancomycin remains the preferred initial antimicrobial agent for clindamycin-resistant CA-MRSA infections, and other MRSA-active agents may be considered as alternatives (eg, ceftaroline, daptomycin, linezolid, and TMP-SMX) but have been used less often than vancomycin for the treatment of AHO; few published data exist for treatment outcomes, safety, tolerability, or standardized dosing of antimicrobial agents.

### Frequency of dosing of cephalexin for oral step-down therapy of pediatric osteoarticular infections caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus [^113R34ep]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Osteoarticular infections are one of the more common invasive bacterial infections encountered in children. There exist significant practice variations in both the diagnosis and treatment of such infections. However, the practice of transitioning from parenteral therapy to oral antibiotics has been well validated by several studies. For methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), cephalexin is often recommended. Prospective, controlled data regarding optimal dosing of cephalexin in pediatric osteomyelitis are not available. We sought to review our retrospective, uncontrolled data on four times daily (QID) versus three times daily (TID) dosing of cephalexin for pediatric osteoarticular infections. Children ≥ 1 month to < 18 years of age admitted to Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego with a diagnosis of osteomyelitis or septic arthritis between January 1, 2002, and November 30, 2007, were identified and previously reported. Only patients with culture-positive MSSA infections are included in this report. Demographic and clinical data were manually extracted from the electronic medical record. Fifty-nine patients were treated with cephalexin and had records available for review through our electronic medical record. Thirty-eight patients (64.4%) were treated QID, and 21 patients (35.6%) were treated TID. Clinical cure was achieved in all patients with only one adverse event occurring in the QID group. In this retrospective chart review of children with osteoarticular infections caused by MSSA treated with cephalexin, similar clinical outcomes were found with QID versus TID dosing.

### Variation in target attainment of beta-lactam antibiotic dosing between international pediatric formularies [^117VyC2h]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

As antimicrobial susceptibility of common bacterial pathogens decreases, ensuring optimal dosing may preserve the use of older antibiotics in order to limit the spread of resistance to newer agents. Beta-lactams represent the most widely prescribed antibiotic class, yet most were licensed prior to legislation changes mandating their study in children. As a result, significant heterogeneity persists in the pediatric doses used globally, along with quality of evidence used to inform dosing. This review summarizes dosing recommendations from the major pediatric reference sources and tries to answer the questions: Does beta-lactam dose heterogeneity matter? Does it impact pharmacodynamic target attainment? For three important severe clinical infections-pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis-pharmacokinetic models were identified for common for beta-lactam antibiotics. Real-world demographics were derived from three multicenter point prevalence surveys. Simulation results were compared with minimum inhibitory concentration distributions to inform appropriateness of recommended doses in targeted and empiric treatment. While cephalosporin dosing regimens are largely adequate for target attainment, they also pose the most risk of neurotoxicity. Our review highlights aminopenicillin, piperacillin, and meropenem doses as potentially requiring review/optimization in order to preserve the use of these agents in future.

### Efficacy of cephalexin two vs. three times daily vs. cefadroxil once daily for streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis [^114KHMjC]. Clinical Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare the bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of oral cephalexin twice vs. three times daily vs. cefadroxil once daily as therapy for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) tonsillopharyngitis. A prospective open-label, observational cohort study was conducted over 18 months (January 2000-June 2001). Children enrolled had an acute onset of symptoms and signs of a tonsillopharyngeal illness and a laboratory-documented GABHS infection. Follow-up examination and laboratory testing occurred 21 ± 4 days following enrollment. Two hundred seventy-one patients were enrolled (intent to treat group): 63 received cephalexin twice daily, 124 received cephalexin three times daily, and 84 received cefadroxil once daily. Fifty-three children did not return for the follow-up visit, leaving 218 patients in the per-protocol group: 54 cephalexin twice-daily treated, 94 cephalexin 3-times daily treated, and 70 cefadroxil once-daily treated. In the per-protocol group, bacteriologic cure for those treated with cephalexin twice daily was 87%, for cephalexin 3 times daily, it was 81% and for cefadroxil once daily it was 81% (p = 0.61). The clinical cure rate for cephalexin twice-daily treatment was 91%; for three-times daily, it was 86%; and for cefadroxil once daily, it was 84% (p = 0.56). Because treatment allocation was not randomized, logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for treatment group differences. Younger age of patient was significantly associated with bacteriologic (p = 0.04) and clinical (p = 0.01) failure independent of treatment group but in the adjusted logistic model no differences were found among the 3 treatment regimens. Cephalexin dosed twice daily or three times daily and cefadroxil dosed once daily appear equivalent in bacteriologic and clinical cure of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis.

### Pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of single-dose or multiple-dose cefiderocol in hospitalized pediatric patients three months to less than eighteen years old with infections treated with standard-of-care antibiotics in the PEDI-CEFI phase 2 study [^112zEJjM]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The PEDI-CEFI study aimed to investigate the safety, tolerability and PK profile of cefiderocol in pediatric patients between 3 months and < 18 years old in 4 age cohorts receiving weight-adjusted doses, who were hospitalized due to a suspected or confirmed Gram-negative bacterial infection.

Based on previous simulations, the initial dose selected for testing in pediatric patients was 2000 mg for patients with body weight ≥ 34 kg and 60 mg/kg for those < 34 kg and normal renal function, with no subject receiving > 2000 mg. In the multiple-dose phase of the study, while an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 was permitted in the eligibility criteria, no enrolled patient had this level of renal function. Seventeen patients had an eGFR ≥ 120 mL/min/1.73 m 2. While study enrollment was relatively slow for the youngest cohort in the multiple-dose phase of the study and only 6 patients were enrolled before a decision by the sponsor and regulators was made to close the study, PK data from this age cohort provide some useful data.

### Randomized controlled trial of cephalexin versus clindamycin for uncomplicated pediatric skin infections [^113gEFYz]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare clindamycin and cephalexin for treatment of uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) caused predominantly by community-associated (CA) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We hypothesized that clindamycin would be superior to cephalexin (an antibiotic without MRSA activity) for treatment of these infections.

Patients and Methods

Patients aged 6 months to 18 years with uncomplicated SSTIs not requiring hospitalization were enrolled September 2006 through May 2009. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to 7 days of cephalexin or clindamycin; primary and secondary outcomes were clinical improvement at 48 to 72 hours and resolution at 7 days. Cultures were obtained and tested for antimicrobial susceptibilities, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type, and Panton-Valentine leukocidin status.

Results

Of 200 enrolled patients, 69% had MRSA cultured from wounds. Most MRSA were USA300 or subtypes, positive for Panton-Valentine leukocidin, and clindamycin susceptible, consistent with CA-MRSA. Spontaneous drainage occurred or a drainage procedure was performed in 97% of subjects. By 48 to 72 hours, 94% of subjects in the cephalexin arm and 97% in the clindamycin arm were improved (P = 0.50). By 7 days, all subjects were improved, with complete resolution in 97% in the cephalexin arm and 94% in the clindamycin arm (P = 0.33). Fevers and age less than 1 year, but not initial erythema > 5 cm, were associated with early treatment failures, regardless of antibiotic used.

Conclusions

There is no significant difference between cephalexin and clindamycin for treatment of uncomplicated pediatric SSTIs caused predominantly by CA-MRSA. Close follow-up and fastidious wound care of appropriately drained, uncomplicated SSTIs are likely more important than initial antibiotic choice.

3.2 Antibiotic Treatment

Antibiotics were prescribed on the same date of diagnosis for 85.7% of UTIs (range from 20.7% in children of < 3 years to 89% in women aged 18–64 years). Only 17% of those who received antibiotics had a recorded urine testing within 10 days of diagnosis (range from 9.1% for the < 3 year group to 30.6% for 18- to 64-year-old women). Overall, the most common antibiotics initially prescribed were trimethoprim (56.8%) and nitrofurantoin (23.9%; Fig. 2). Cephalexin was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic in pregnant women (30.4%) and the second most commonly prescribed in children aged < 4 years (24.0% in those < 3 months and 5.6% in those aged 3 months to 3 years). Multiple antibiotics were administered to 3543 (0.8%) patients. Six percent of UTI episodes diagnosed in pregnant women (n = 62) were treated with trimethoprim and the proportion of UTIs treated with co-amoxiclav varied between 4.3% in children aged 4–15 years (n = 1086) and 7.6% in men aged 18–64 years (n = 1830). Chronic kidney disease (of stage ≥ 3) was diagnosed in 9.4% of episodes treated with nitrofurantoin in women and 15.0% of those in men (in 0.6 of episodes in women and 1.9% of those in men with stage ≥ 4).

The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Age Cohorts

Patients were stratified into 4 separate age cohorts: cohort 1, 12 to < 18 years; cohort 2, 6 to < 12 years; cohort 3, 2 to < 6 years and cohort 4, 3 months to < 2 years. The single-dose phase of the study involved cohorts 1–4, and the multiple-dose phase involved cohorts 2–4. Cohort 1 (12 to < 18 years old) was not included in the multiple-dose phase following a decision by the European Medicines Agency that extrapolation from adults was reasonable for this age group. The minimum planned enrollment was 6 patients in each cohort in the single-dose phase and 10 in each cohort in the multiple-dose phase, for a total of 54 patients. Patients were included in only one dosing phase of the study.

In cohorts 1–3, the safety, tolerability and plasma concentrations of cefiderocol in the single-dose phase were assessed in all 6 patients/cohort before opening enrollment of patients into the multiple-dose phase of the same age cohort. The single-dose phase of cohort 4 (ie, 3 months to < 2 years) was initiated only when safety, tolerability and PK data had been evaluated in at least 6 patients from single-dose cohorts 1–3, and following enrollment of a minimum of 3 patients in cohort 3.

### Cefaclor [^112MS6wQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Cefaclor is administered orally.

Adults ─ The usual adult dosage is 250 mg every 8 hours. For more severe infections (such as pneumonia) or those caused by less susceptible organisms, doses may be doubled.

Pediatric Patients ─ The usual recommended daily dosage for pediatric patients is 20 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 8 hours. In more serious infections, otitis media, and infections caused by less susceptible organisms, 40 mg/kg/day are recommended, with a maximum dosage of 1 g/day.

Cefaclor may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Under such a condition, the dosage usually is unchanged (see PRECAUTIONS).

In the treatment of β-hemolytic streptococcal infections, a therapeutic dosage of cefaclor should be administered for at least 10 days.

### Cephalexin twice daily versus four times daily for the treatment of urinary tract infections diagnosed in the emergency department [^111zdRxa]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cephalexin is an oral cephalosporin approved for the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Data regarding the optimal dosing interval for cephalexin in UTIs, including uncomplicated UTIs (uUTI) and complicated UTIs (cUTI), remains limited.

Objective

The primary objective of this study was to compare the rates of treatment failure between patients prescribed cephalexin twice daily versus four times daily for the management of uUTIs and cUTIs once discharged from the emergency department (ED).

Methods

This retrospective, single-center cohort study conducted between July 31st, 2016 and July 31st, 2023, included patients who were ≥ 18 years of age, discharged from the ED with a diagnosis of UTI, prescribed cephalexin 500 mg twice or four time daily, and a urine culture positive for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Proteus mirabilis susceptible to cefazolin. Treatment failure was defined as return to the ED or outpatient clinic with similar or worsening UTI symptoms or change in antibiotic therapy within 30 days of the initial ED visit. Sub-group analyses were performed for both uUTI and cUTIs.

Results

In total, 214 patients were included in this analysis (50.0% in each group). Treatment failure rates between the twice daily and four times daily dosing groups were 18.7% versus 15.0% (P = 0.465). Treatment failure rates in those with uUTI were 14.9% versus 8.1% (P = 0.197) and those with cUTI were 27.3% versus 30.3% (P = 0.786).

Conclusion

For patients with UTIs, there was no statistically significant difference in treatment failure rates between patients prescribed cephalexin twice daily versus four times daily. These findings suggest cephalexin dosed twice daily may be a reasonable option for the outpatient management of UTIs diagnosed in the ED, thus increasing adherence and decreasing cost without statistically compromising effectiveness.

Second-line antimicrobial agents — when first-line medications are not available or cannot be prescribed — include β-lactams and fluoroquinolones, and "Randomized trial evidence suggests that the effectiveness of 3-day cefpodoxime or TMP-SMX is comparable at 89.4% vs 100%". However, "Generally, cephalosporins have a lower cure rate than TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones", and "β-lactams, like cephalexin, can also be used if first-line antibiotics are inappropriate for any reason". Although "3-day fluoroquinolone regimens (eg, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) are highly efficacious, they are not first-line agents because of increasing resistance, higher expense, and serious adverse events as described in a 2016 Food and Drug Administration warning". Fosfomycin pharmacokinetics are noted as "resulting in urine levels that persist for 30 to 40 hours", and "When there is greater than 20% local E. coli resistance to TMP-SMX, an alternative treatment should be given".

### Cefotaxime [^112zFXRV]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The intent of this Pharmacy Bulk Package is for the preparation of solutions for intravenous infusion only.

Adults

Dosage and route of administration should be determined by susceptibility of the causative organisms, severity of the infection, and the condition of the patient (see table for dosage guideline). Cefotaxime may be administered IV after reconstitution. The maximum daily dosage should not exceed 12 grams.

If C. trachomatis is a suspected pathogen, appropriate anti-chlamydial coverage should be added, because cefotaxime sodium has no activity against this organism.

To prevent postoperative infection in contaminated or potentially contaminated surgery, the recommended dose is a single 1 gram IV administered 30 to 90 minutes prior to start of surgery.

Cesarean Section Patients

The first dose of 1 gram is administered intravenously as soon as the umbilical cord is clamped. The second and third doses should be given as 1 gram intravenously at 6 and 12 hours after the first dose.

Neonates, Infants, and Children

The following dosage schedule is recommended:

Neonates (birth to 1 month):

0–1 week of age 50 mg/kg per dose every 12 hours IV

1–4 weeks of age 50 mg/kg per dose every 8 hours IV

It is not necessary to differentiate between premature and normal-gestational age infants.

Infants and Children (1 month to 12 years):

For body weights less than 50 kg, the recommended daily dose is 50 to 180 mg/kg IV body weight divided into four to six equal doses. The higher dosages should be used for more severe or serious infections, including meningitis. For body weights 50 kg or more, the usual adult dosage should be used; the maximum daily dosage should not exceed 12 grams.

Geriatric Use

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. (See PRECAUTIONS, General and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use .)

### Pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of single-dose or multiple-dose cefiderocol in hospitalized pediatric patients three months to less than eighteen years old with infections treated with standard-of-care antibiotics in the PEDI-CEFI phase 2 study [^114LfUGR]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

The mean PK concentration–time profile curves in the multiple-dose phase of the study suggest that the weight-adjusted doses applied in the study across the 4 age cohorts resulted in similar maximum and trough concentrations in pediatric patients, and this was applicable regardless of their age, and renal function over the ranges present in the enrolled subjects (both eGFR 60–120 and ≥ 120 mL/min/1.73 m 2). Of note, collectively, dosing every 8 hours for pediatric patients with eGFR ≥ 120 mL/min/1.73 m 2 provided sufficient exposures compared with patients with eGFR 60–120 mL/min/1.73 m 2, but the number of patients were limited per age cohort. Studies in adults reported that cefiderocol demonstrates effective lung epithelial lining fluid penetration in parallel with plasma concentrations following a single intravenous dose (2000 mg) in healthy subjects, and achieves lung epithelial lining fluid concentrations sufficient to treat Gram-negative pulmonary bacterial infections with a relatively high MIC of ≤ 4 µg/mL in patients with pneumonia undergoing mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple cefiderocol doses (2 g every 8 hours). The PD driver of cefiderocol efficacy is the proportion of the dosing interval spent above the MIC by the unbound antibiotic at the site of infection (% f T > MIC). In the current study, cefiderocol total trough concentrations in plasma in pediatric patients (9.64–18.1 µg/mL on average in all age groups and 4.07–7.64 µg/mL of free drug concentrations (using unbound fraction of 0.422) remained above the approved European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST)and Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institutesusceptibility breakpoints for the various Gram-negative pathogens, thereby providing uniform attainment of a stringent PD target of 100% T > MIC. According to MIC distribution curves, most Gram-negative isolates have low cefiderocol MIC values; thus, exposure, as linked to the MIC and achieved with these weight-adjusted doses, is likely to exceed those necessary for cure.

### A comparison of short versus long course intravenous antibiotics when treating urinary tract infection in infants [^113s5qBS]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Oral cephalexin and amoxicillin were used in the continuation phase in 48% and 30% of the cases, respectively, and the total period of treatment (oral and IV) was 10 (IQR: 9–14) days. The median length of stay was 5 (IQR: 3–21) days, and only 34 (8%) patients needed long-term home IV antibiotics. Of the 403 children in the final study cohort, only 19 (5%) experienced treatment failure, defined as readmission within 30 days after discharge. Over the course of the study period, the proportion of children exhibiting treatment failure per year ranged from 2.5% to 8.8%. The treatment failure rate was similar (5%) between both groups; short-course versus long-course IV antibiotic exposure (P > .05). The median time to readmission was 17 (IQR: 8–27) days.

We found in the bivariate analyses (Table 1) that nosocomial UTI, age younger than 3 weeks, children with a higher baseline creatinine level, premature children, the presence of comorbidities, and children with a positive blood culture were each associated with increased likelihood of receiving a long-course IV antibiotic treatment (P < .001). Children with comorbidities and hospital-acquired UTI had longer length of stay (28 vs 3 days [P < .0001] and 56 vs 3 [P < .0001], respectively). In retrospect, the rate of renal scarring on DMSA scan was significantly higher in patients that had received long-course IV antibiotics (2 vs 13 days, P = 0.03). There were no statistically significant associations between IV antibiotic duration and patient sex, UTI history, appearance at presentation, low systolic blood pressure, abnormal KUB US findings, and presence of vesicoureteral reflux on voiding cystourethrography.

### Patient age and antibiotic formulation administration in the pediatric emergency department [^1152vrNf]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Oral antibiotics are the most prescribed medication in the United States. We sought to describe the distribution of oral antibiotic formulation administration among children in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

We performed a retrospective single-center study of children presenting to a pediatric ED. We included encounters for children (< 18 years) discharged from the ED between 2016 and 2022 and prescribed one of 7 common antibiotics in oral suspension or tablet/capsule forms, excluding children with an enteral feeding tube or complex neuromuscular conditions. We analyzed encounters for children administered an antibiotic in the ED and antibiotic prescriptions. We determined the age at which the proportion of children given a tablet or capsule equaled or exceeded the proportion of those given a suspension.

Results

We identified 12,900 eligible encounters (median age: 4.3 years, interquartile range: 1.7 to 8.1 years; 51.5% boys). The most common diagnoses were infectious ear disorders (22.6%), infectious mouth and throat disorders (9.1﻿%), infectious skin, dermatologic and soft tissue disorders (6.6﻿%), and infectious nose and sinus disorders (6.2%). For all antibiotics administered in the ED (n = 3809 encounters; 52.6% for amoxicillin), the age threshold at which more children were prescribed the tablet/capsule than the suspension formulation was 14 years. This threshold for each antibiotic was 16 years for amoxicillin, 13 years for amoxicillin-clavulanate, 11 years for azithromycin, 14 years for cefdinir, 12 years for cephalexin, 11 years for clindamycin, and 10 years for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Findings were similar for encounters discharged from the ED with an antibiotic prescription.

Conclusions

We identified age-related differences in antibiotic formulations in a pediatric ED. These findings can inform prescribing practices to optimize medication adherence and treatment effectiveness through clinical decision support and shared decision-making and may be especially useful during periods of formulation shortages or when planning for clinical research.

### Advancing pediatric antibacterial drug development: a critical need to reinvent our approach [^117KFKzw]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2019). Medium credibility.

REPORTING AND LABELING

Rapid widespread dissemination of findings from pediatric trials is needed to ensure that practitioners caring for children understand the benefits and risks of using new antibacterial drugs. Publication and presentation of information at national and international forums should occur as soon as a study has been completed. Public discussion of this information can be helpful in identifying important issues that should be addressed as the development program progresses. In addition, labeling related to children can be updated and expanded as important pharmacokinetic, safety, and efficacy data for different pediatric age groups are generated.

Recommendations in each of these areas reflect a single theme: the imperative for collaboration across all groups and individuals who have a stake in the development of new antibacterial drugs for use in children. Although collaboration undoubtedly is important in other therapeutic areas, the urgent need to understand optimal dosing, safety, and efficacy of new antibacterial agents in infants and children makes it an especially important issue for those engaged in antibacterial drug development. It is clear that new antibacterial therapies must be developed to address the medical needs of our youngest patients. Being well prepared to collaborate in bringing these advances to children is the responsibility of and challenge to everyone concerned about the health of children.

### Effect of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole vs cephalexin alone on clinical cure of uncomplicated cellulitis: a randomized clinical trial [^1112uFJm]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Emergency department visits for skin infections in the United States have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). For cellulitis without purulent drainage, β-hemolytic streptococci are presumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial regimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared with treatments lacking MRSA activity.

Objective

To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole yields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin alone.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter, double-blind, randomized superiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 years with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from April 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound performed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was August 2012.

Interventions

Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (n = 248 participants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (n = 248 participants).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome determined a priori in the per-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical failure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (> 25%), swelling, or tenderness (days 3–4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 8–10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 14–21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than 10%.

Results

Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol analysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15–78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had diabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 (85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to 5.7%; p = 0.50). In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure occurred in 189 (76.2%) of 248 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 171 (69.0%) of 248 in the cephalexin group (difference, 7.3%; 95% CI, -1.0% to 15.5%; p = 0.07). Between-group adverse event rates and secondary outcomes through 7 to 9 weeks, including overnight hospitalization, recurrent skin infections, and similar infection in household contacts, did not differ significantly.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with uncomplicated cellulitis, the use of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared to cephalexin alone did not result in higher rates of clinical resolution of cellulitis in the per-protocol analysis. However, because imprecision around the findings in the modified intention-to-treat analysis included a clinically important difference favoring cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, further research may be needed.

### Cefixime [^11135kBt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Adults: 400 mg daily (2.1)
Pediatric patients (6 months and older): 8 mg/kg/day (2.2)

2.1 Adults

The recommended dose of cefixime is 400 mg daily. This may be given as a 400 mg capsule daily. For the treatment of uncomplicated cervical/urethral gonococcal infections, a single oral dose of 400 mg is recommended.

The capsule may be administered without regard to food.

In the treatment of infections due to Streptococcus pyogenes, a therapeutic dosage of cefixime should be administered for at least 10 days.

2.2 Pediatric Patients (6 months or older)

The recommended dose is 8 mg/kg/day of the suspension. This may be administered as a single daily dose or may be given in two divided doses, as 4 mg/kg every 12 hours.

Note: A suggested dose has been determined for each pediatric weight range. Refer to Table 1. Ensure all orders that specify a dose in milliliters include a concentration, because cefixime for oral suspension is available in two different concentrations (100 mg/5 mL and 200 mg/5 mL).

Children weighing more than 45 kg or older than 12 years should be treated with the recommended adult dose.

Otitis media should be treated with the suspension. Clinical trials of otitis media were conducted with the suspension, and the suspension results in higher peak blood levels than the tablet when administered at the same dose.

Therefore, the tablet or capsule should not be substituted for the suspension in the treatment of otitis media [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In the treatment of infections due to Streptococcus pyogenes, a therapeutic dosage of cefixime should be administered for at least 10 days.

2.3 Renal Impairment

Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be employed in patients with creatinine clearances of 60 mL/min or greater. Refer to Table 2 for dose adjustments for adults with renal impairment. Neither hemodialysis nor peritoneal dialysis removes significant amounts of drug from the body.

2.4 Reconstitution Directions for Oral Suspension

After reconstitution, the suspension may be kept for 14 days either at room temperature, or under refrigeration, without significant loss of potency. Keep tightly closed. Shake well before using. Discard unused portion after 14 days.

### Continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for adults with repeated urinary tract infections (AnTIC): a randomised, open-label trial [^115EfgMh]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

At baseline, the groups did not differ in frequency of antimicrobial resistance of urinary isolates to eight oral antibiotics that are commonly used for UTI treatment. During the 12-month trial, resistance appeared more common in isolates that were cultured from urine submitted during symptomatic UTIs by participants in the prophylaxis group than those in the control group (figure 2). In urine samples submitted during asymptomatic periods between months 9 and 12 of the trial, resistance to nitrofurantoin (12 [24%] of 51 participants with at least one isolate from the prophylaxis group vs six [9%] of 64 participants with at least one isolate from the control group; p = 0·038), trimethoprim (34 [67%] of 51 participants vs 21 [33%] of 64 participants; p = 0·0003), and co-trimoxazole (26 [53%] of 49 participants vs 15 [24%] of 62 participants; p = 0·002) was significantly more frequent in the prophylaxis group than the control group. Over baseline and subsequent 3-monthly intervals during the 12-month trial period, resistance to amoxicillin (38 [52%] of 73 participants, 25 [74%] of 34 participants, 31 [82%] of 38 participants, 32 [74%] of 43 participants, and 37 [76%] of 49 participants; p = 0·004), cephalexin (11 [14%] of 78 participants, ten [25%] of 40 participants, 13 [32%] of 41 participants, 17 [38%] of 45 participants, and 16 [31%] of 51 participants; p = 0·005), co-trimoxazole (18 [25%] of 73 participants, 23 [59%] of 39 participants, 14 [37%] of 38 participants, 21 [48%] of 44 participants, 26 [53%] of 49 participants; p = 0·006), and trimethoprim (32 [42%] of 77 participants, 31 [79%] of 39 participants, 25 [63%] of 40 participants, 27 [63%] of 43 participants, 34 [67%] of 51 participants; p = 0·016) also significantly increased in isolates from urine specimens that were submitted during asymptomatic periods by participants in the prophylaxis group. There was no evidence of increasing resistance over time in the control group. Resistance of urinary isolates that were submitted during asymptomatic periods appeared to decrease at 18 months. There was no evidence that E coli isolated from perianal swabs of participants in the prophylaxis group had significantly more frequent resistance against any of the eight antibiotics tested than did participants in the control group at 6–12 months of the trial.

### A rare case of osteomyelitis of the clavicle in a child due to group A streptococcal infection [^115GoG8d]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Acute osteomyelitis of the clavicle is rare in the paediatric age group. We treated a 5-year-old boy who presented initially with fever and left shoulder pain, and subsequently developed swelling in the region of the left clavicle. Group A Streptococcus (GAS) was isolated in blood culture. MRI of the clavicle showed osteomyelitis of the medial clavicle. The child had incision and drainage of his clavicular collection. The child received intravenous benzylpenicillin and oral cephalexin in the initial presentation; he was treated with 2 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone and 4 weeks of oral penicillin thereafter with the resolution of his symptoms. There are no previous case reports of osteomyelitis of the clavicle in children caused by GAS. This case highlights the importance of identifying the microbial aetiology in these children to ensure early initiation of treatment with appropriate antibiotics.

### Cefoxitin sodium (cefoxitin) [^112iHzvG]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Treatment:

Adults:

The usual adult dosage range is 1 gram to 2 grams every 6 to 8 hours. Dosage should be determined by susceptibility of the causative organisms, severity of infection, and the condition of the patient (see Table 1 for dosage guidelines).

If C. trachomatis is a suspected pathogen, appropriate anti-chlamydial coverage should be added, because cefoxitin sodium has no activity against this organism.

CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION may be used in patients with reduced renal function with the following dosage adjustments:

In adults with renal insufficiency, an initial loading dose of 1 gram to 2 grams may be given. After a loading dose, the recommendations for maintenance dosage (Table 2) may be used as a guide.

When only the serum creatinine level is available, the following formula (based on sex, weight, and age of the patient) may be used to convert this value into creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function.

Males: Weight (kg) x (140-age)

72 x serum creatinine (mg/100 mL)

Females: 0.85 x above value

In patients undergoing hemodialysis, the loading dose of 1 gram to 2 grams should be given after each hemodialysis, and the maintenance dose should be given as indicated in Table 2.

Antibiotic therapy for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections should be maintained for at least 10 days to guard against the risk of rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis.

In staphylococcal and other infections involving a collection of pus, surgical drainage should be carried out where indicated.

Pediatric Patients:

The recommended dosage in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older is 80 to 160 mg/kg of body weight per day divided into four to six equal doses. The higher dosages should be used for more severe or serious infections. The total daily dosage should not exceed 12 grams. At this time no recommendation is made for pediatric patients from birth to 3 months of age (see PRECAUTIONS).

In pediatric patients with renal insufficiency, the dosage and frequency of dosage should be modified consistent with the recommendations for adults (see Table 2).

OVERDOSAGE

A study of children under six years of age suggested that ingestion of less than 250 mg/ kg of cephalosporins is not associated with significant outcomes. No action is required other than general support and observation. For amounts greater than 250 mg/kg, induce gastric emptying.

In five anuric patients, it was demonstrated that an average of 63% of a 1 g oral dose is extracted from the body during a 6–8 hour hemodialysis session.

### Cephalexin use in a pediatric emergency department during the shortage of amoxicillin suspension [^1112r8pV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

During a significant shortage of amoxicillin suspension in Canada in late 2022, local guidelines recommended cephalexin as an alternative with restricted use of amoxicillin-clavulanate (AC). The aim of the study was to determine outcomes of patients with a diagnosis of acute otitis media (AOM), community acquired pneumonia (AOM) and pharyngitis who were prescribed cephalexin compared to other antibiotics in the emergency department (ED).

Materials and Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of pediatric patients diagnosed with AOM, CAP, and pharyngitis who received antibiotic prescriptions upon discharge from the ED between July 2020 and June 2023. Cases were identified using ICD-10 diagnostic codes, and data were extracted from the EPIC™ electronic health record system. We compared return visits within 3 days and 21 days of the index encounter as measures of potential treatment failure and adverse events, respectively.

Results

Among 7387 eligible patient encounters, cephalexin and AC emerged as the most frequently prescribed alternatives to amoxicillin during the shortage period. Comparative analysis revealed no statistically significant differences in the rates of return visits or adverse events within 21 days post-treatment initiation across the different antibiotic regimens.

Conclusions

Cephalexin represents a suitable alternative for AOM, CAP, and pharyngitis during an amoxicillin shortage, with potential antimicrobial stewardship benefits due to its narrower spectrum.

The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacokinetic Assessments

PK sampling (0.18–0.4 mL of blood per patient) was performed at prespecified time points (ie, 1, 3, 3.5, 5 and 8 hours for cohorts 1 and 2 and 3, 5 and 8 hours for cohorts 3 and 4), with flexibility in the PK sampling schedule allowed for cohorts 1 and 2 (Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2). In the multiple-dose phase of the study, blood samples were taken between the 6th and 12th doses of cefiderocol. Individual plasma concentrations are summarized for each cohort in both dosing phases using descriptive statistics, including geometric mean and geometric coefficient of variation. The unbound concentrations were calculated based on the unbound fraction of 0.422 derived from previous studies.

Statistics

Continuous variables are summarized by using the number of nonmissing observations (N), arithmetic mean (mean), standard deviation, median and range (minimum–maximum) values. Categorical variables are summarized by using the frequency count and the percentage of patients in each category. Analysis populations are shown in Text, Supplemental Digital Content 3.

### Hemorrhagic cystitis due to cephalexin and review of the literature [^115tj7MF]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Godin et aldescribes a case of HC in a 24-year-old male treated with 8 grams of IV methicillin and 160 mg IM gentamicin for sternoclavicular staphylococcal arthritis. Isolated macroscopic hematuria was noted on the 13th day of treatment with increased urinary frequency and dysuria appearing a couple days later. Renal failure was observed on the 21st day with 20.3 mmol/L of urea and 0.292 mmol/L of creatine. Methicillin was replaced with pristinamycin and gentamicin dose was reduced. A generalized rash, neutropenia, and eosinophilia was subsequently observed with bone marrow aspiration confirming drug-induced agranulocytosis. Five days after methicillin discontinuation, neutropenia and urinary symptoms resolved, whereas urinary function returned to normal within 17 days.

Drug-induced HC is a rare complication, especially with antibiotic treatment. Cephalosporin and particularly cephalexin-induced HC has been reported rarely, leading us to share this pediatric case of cephalexin induced HC. To the best of our knowledge, there are only three previous reports of cephalexin-induced HC. Clinicians with a high suspicion of HC should consider medications as a causative agent as this can lead to early diagnosis, withdrawal of the medication, and prompt recovery.

Cellulitis treatment — antibiotic selection and duration — states that therapy for typical cases should include an antibiotic active against streptococci; many patients can start oral therapy, and suitable options include penicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin. In uncomplicated cellulitis, a 5-day course of antimicrobial therapy is as effective as a 10-day course if clinical improvement has occurred by 5 days; in hospitalized cellulitis/abscess, the average duration was 2 weeks, only about one-third received specific gram-positive therapy, two-thirds received very-broad-spectrum treatment, and the failure rate of 12% was not different regardless of spectrum of treatment.

### Cefuroxime and dextrose [^1117QKEK]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Patients Above 3 Months of Age:

Administration of 50 to 100 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses every 6 to 8 hours has been successful for most infections susceptible to cefuroxime. The higher dosage of 100 mg/kg/day (not to exceed the maximum adult dosage) should be used for the more severe or serious infections.

In bone and joint infections, 150 mg/kg/day (not to exceed the maximum adult dosage) is recommended in equally divided doses every 8 hours. In clinical trials, a course of oral antibacterials was administered to pediatric patients following the completion of parenteral administration of cefuroxime.

In cases of bacterial meningitis, a larger dosage of cefuroxime is recommended, 200 to 240 mg/kg/day intravenously in divided doses every 6 to 8 hours.

In pediatric patients with renal insufficiency, the frequency of dosing should be modified consistent with the recommendations for adults.

Cefuroxime for Injection USP and Dextrose for Injection USP in the DUPLEX® Container is designed to deliver a 750 mg or 1.5 g dose of cefuroxime. To prevent unintentional overdose, this product should not be used in pediatric patients who require less than the full adult dose.

For intermittent IV infusion with a Y-type administration set, dosing can be accomplished through the tubing system by which the patient may be receiving other IV solutions. However, during infusion of the solution containing Cefuroxime, it is advisable to temporarily discontinue administration of any other solutions at the same site.

Solutions of cefuroxime, like those of most beta-lactam antibacterials, should not be added to solutions of aminoglycoside antibacterials because of potential interaction.

However, if concurrent therapy with cefuroxime and an aminoglycoside is indicated, each of these antibacterials can be administered separately to the same patient.

Use sterile equipment.

Caution: Do not use plastic containers in series connections. Such use could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is complete.

### Treatment of acute otitis media consensus recommendations [^111a7pz8]. Clinical Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this paper is to provide consensus recommendations for the management of acute otitis media (AOM) that pediatricians can incorporate into their daily practices. These recommendations were developed during a roundtable meeting that convened clinicians versed in the management of AOM. This meeting was sponsored by an educational grant from SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals. In addition, clinical studies on AOM identified via MEDLINE search were considered in the development of these recommendations. The Drug-Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group guidelines for the management of AOM are reviewed in detail. All of the articles identified from the data sources were evaluated and all information deemed relevant was included in this review. AOM is one of the most common infectious diseases affecting infants and children and one of the leading causes of office visits and antibiotic prescriptions for this population. The incidence of AOM has increased during the past 25 years, probably the result of an increased utilization of day care facilities in the United States. The predominant pathogens in AOM include S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The high prevalence of drug-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-producing organisms presents a clinical challenge for practitioners in the selection of empiric antimicrobial therapy. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles should be considered in addition to minimum inhibitory concentrations in selecting antibiotics for AOM. Amoxicillin at conventional or high doses (80–90 mg/kg/day) remains an appropriate choice for first-line therapy for AOM. For patients in whom amoxicillin is unsuccessful, second-line therapy should have demonstrated activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae as well as beta-lactamase-producing pathogens. Appropriate options for second-line therapy include high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (90 mg/kg/day based on the amoxicillin component) and ceftriaxone. Cefuroxime has been suggested as a second-line agent in the past, but recent surveillance data suggest it may no longer be active against penicillin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae. Tympanocentesis is useful for identifying the causative pathogen, and it may be beneficial for patients who have failed multiple courses of antibiotics. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine recently was approved for use in children and should be administered to all children less than 2 years old and those at risk for recurrent AOM (e.g., day care attendance, siblings with a history of recurrent AOM). Consensus recommendations are provided for the management of AOM, with a focus on antimicrobial therapy. The current challenges in the management of AOM include the need for an increased understanding of epidemiology, increasing resistance among common middle ear pathogens, use of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles in designing treatment strategies, and understanding the potential impact of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.

### Cefixime (Suprax) [^116AUAzG]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

2.1 Adults

The recommended dose of cefixime is 400 mg daily. This may be given as a 400 mg tablet or capsule daily or the 400 mg tablet may be split and given as one half tablet every 12 hours. For the treatment of uncomplicated cervical/urethral gonococcal infections, a single oral dose of 400 mg is recommended. The capsule and tablet may be administered without regard to food.

In the treatment of infections due to Streptococcus pyogenes, a therapeutic dosage of cefixime should be administered for at least 10 days.

2.2 Pediatric Patients (6 months or older)

The recommended dose is 8 mg/kg/day of the suspension. This may be administered as a single daily dose or may be given in two divided doses, as 4 mg/kg every 12 hours.

Note: A suggested dose has been determined for each pediatric weight range. Refer to Table 1. Ensure all orders that specify a dose in milliliters include a concentration, because SUPRAX for oral suspension is available in three different concentrations (100 mg/5 mL, 200 mg/5 mL, and 500 mg/5 mL).

Children weighing more than 45 kg or older than 12 years should be treated with the recommended adult dose. SUPRAX (cefixime) chewable tablets must be chewed or crushed before swallowing.

Otitis media should be treated with the chewable tablets or suspension. Clinical trials of otitis media were conducted with the chewable tablets or suspension, and the chewable tablets or suspension results in higher peak blood levels than the tablet when administered at the same dose.

Therefore, the tablet or capsule should not be substituted for the chewable tablets or suspension in the treatment of otitis media [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In the treatment of infections due to Streptococcus pyogenes, a therapeutic dosage of cefixime should be administered for at least 10 days.

2.3 Renal Impairment

SUPRAX may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be employed in patients with creatinine clearances of 60 mL/min or greater. Refer to Table 2 for dose adjustments for adults with renal impairment. Neither hemodialysis nor peritoneal dialysis removes significant amounts of drug from the body.

2.4 Reconstitution Directions for Oral Suspension

After reconstitution, the suspension may be kept for 14 days either at room temperature, or under refrigeration, without significant loss of potency. Keep tightly closed. Shake well before using. Discard unused portion after 14 days.

### Pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of single-dose or multiple-dose cefiderocol in hospitalized pediatric patients three months to less than eighteen years old with infections treated with standard-of-care antibiotics in the PEDI-CEFI phase 2 study [^116ocna7]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Patient Disposition

Of 55 patients screened with appropriate assent or consent in Belgium, Estonia, Latvia, Spain, Georgia, Thailand and Ukraine, 2 withdrew. Of the 53 patients enrolled, 24 received a single dose of cefiderocol and 29 patients received multiple doses (Tables 1 and 2). Slow recruitment into the multiple-dose phase resulted in only 6 patients being enrolled in cohort 4. All patients in the single-dose phase and 89.7% and 96.6% of those in the multiple-dose phase completed treatment and the study, respectively (Table 1, Table, Supplemental Digital Content 4). All patients received cefiderocol in combination with SOC (Table, Supplemental Digital Content 5).

TABLE 1.
Patient Disposition

TABLE 2.
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics of Pediatric Patients Receiving Single-dose or Multiple-dose Cefiderocol (Safety Population)

Patient Characteristics

The median (range) age of patients was 73.5 (3–190) months [6.2 (0.3–15.8) years] in the single-dose phase and 64.0 (5–143) months [5.3 (0.4–11.9) years] in the multiple-dose phase (Table 2, Table, Supplemental Digital Content 6). Nine patients (37.5%) in the single-dose phase across cohorts 1–4 and 8 patients (27.6%) in the multiple-dose phase across cohorts 2–4 had eGFR of ≥ 120 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Most commonly, patients had complicated UTI and complicated intra-abdominal infections in both the single-dose phase and multiple-dose phase (Table 2).

Cefiderocol Exposure in Multiple-dose Phase

The median extent of cefiderocol exposure was 8.0 (range: 2–15) days, 86.2% of patients received 5–14 days of treatment: the median (range) number of cefiderocol doses received was 21.0 (12–42) in cohort 2, 27.0 (6–42) in cohort 3 and 15 (7–18) in cohort 4. All patients received 3-hour infusions of cefiderocol in the multiple-dose phase.

### Cefazolin sodium [^113zAYk5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Data from published literature report that cefazolin is present in human milk, but is not expected to accumulate in a breastfed infant. There are no data on the effects of cefazolin on the breastfed child or on milk production.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection or from the mother's underlying condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection is indicated for the treatment of respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, skin and skin structure infections, biliary tract infections, bone and joint infections, genital infections, septicemia, and endocarditis in pediatric patients for whom appropriate dosing with this formulation can be achieved, and for perioperative prophylaxis in pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years old [see Indications and Usage (1.1 to 1.9)].

Safety and effectiveness of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection in premature infants and neonates have not been established and is not recommended for use in this age group of pediatric patients. Dosing for cefazolin in pediatric patients younger than one month old has not been established.

Because of the limitations of the available strengths and administration requirements (i.e., administration of fractional doses is not recommended) of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection, and to avoid unintentional overdose, this product is not recommended for use if a dose of Cefazolin for Injection and Dextrose Injection that does not equal 1 gram or 2 grams is required and an alternative formulation of cefazolin should be considered [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5)].

### Pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of single-dose or multiple-dose cefiderocol in hospitalized pediatric patients three months to less than eighteen years old with infections treated with standard-of-care antibiotics in the PEDI-CEFI phase 2 study [^114ZWVcd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are increasing globally in neonates, infants and children; antibiotic options are limited.

Methods:

This international, multicenter, open-label phase 2 study, investigated the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of single-dose and multiple-dose cefiderocol [as a 3-hour infusion (every 8 hours) dosed at 2000 mg for body weight ≥ 34 kg and at 60 mg/kg for body weight < 34 kg], over a range of renal function, in hospitalized pediatric patients with aerobic Gram-negative bacterial infection; multiple-dose patients required standard-of-care systemic antibiotics for 5–14 days. Four cohorts of pediatric patients were enrolled (cohort 1: 12 to < 18 years, cohort 2: 6 to < 12 years, cohort 3: 2 to < 6 years and cohort 4: 3 months to < 2 years).

Results:

A total of 53 patients (median age: 73.5 months) were enrolled. Plasma concentration profiles were similar with single-dose (n = 24) and multiple-dose (n = 29) cefiderocol, irrespective of age and body weight in those with normal renal function or mild renal impairment. Geometric mean concentrations at the end of infusion ranged between 72.7 and 97.1 μg/mL for single-dose cefiderocol and between 88.8 and 106.0 μg/mL after multiple doses. At 8 hours, corresponding trough concentrations ranged from 7.86 to 10.8 μg/mL with single-dose cefiderocol and from 9.64 to 18.1 μg/mL with multiple doses. There were no deaths, no cefiderocol-related serious adverse events, significant related laboratory abnormalities or discontinuations.

Conclusions:

Multiple-dose cefiderocol, administered for 5–14 days and according to body weight, achieved steady-state plasma concentrations that remained above the susceptibility breakpoints of Gram-negative bacteria throughout the dosing period. Cefiderocol was well tolerated.

### Cefdinir: an advanced-generation, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin [^112FMZJx]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Cefdinir is an advanced-generation, broad-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agent that has been approved for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, acute maxillary sinusitis, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, acute bacterial otitis media, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections in adult and pediatric patients.

Objective

The purpose of this article was to review the in vitro antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, and potential role of cefdinir.

Methods

Studies were identified by a MEDLINE search (January 1983-September 2001) of the English-language medical literature, a review of identified articles and their bibliographies, and a review of data on file with the manufacturer. Clinical efficacy data were selected from all published trials mentioning cefdinir. Information concerning in vitro susceptibility, safety, chemistry, and the pharmacokinetic profile of cefdinir also was reviewed.

Results

Cefdinir has a broad spectrum of activity against many gram-negative and gram-positive aerobic organisms, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefdinir is stable to hydrolysis by 13 of the common beta-lactamases. It is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (mean time to peak plasma concentration, 3 hours) and is almost entirely eliminated via renal clearance of unchanged drug. The terminal disposition half-life of cefdinir is approximately 1.5 hours. Efficacy has been demonstrated in 19 clinical trials in adults and children with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (eg, pharyngitis, sinusitis, acute otitis media, acute bronchitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia), and skin and skin-structure infections. The adverse-event profile is similar to that of comparator agents, although in 4 adult and adolescent studies and 1 adult study, diarrhea occurred significantly more frequently in cefdinir recipients than in recipients of penicillin V, cephalexin, cefaclor, and cefprozil.

Conclusions

Cefdinir is an alternative to other antimicrobial agents and can be dosed once or twice daily for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections. Similar to other oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, cefdinir has activity against common pathogens of the respiratory tract and skin and is stable in the presence of selected beta-lactamases. The clinical choice of an oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin will be based on patient acceptance, frequency of administration, and cost.

### Cefoxitin [^114HnK3N]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The intent of this Pharmacy Bulk Package is for the preparation of solutions for intravenous infusion only.

TREATMENT

Adults

The usual adult dosage range is 1 gram to 2 grams every six to eight hours. Dosage should be determined by susceptibility of the causative organisms, severity of infection, and the condition of the patient (see Table 3 for dosage guidelines).

If C. trachomatis is a suspected pathogen, appropriate anti-chlamydial coverage should be added, because cefoxitin sodium has no activity against this organism.

Cefoxitin for Injection may be used in patients with reduced renal function with the following dosage adjustments:

In adults with renal insufficiency, an initial loading dose of 1 gram to 2 grams may be given. After a loading dose, the recommendations for maintenance dosage (Table 4) may be used as a guide.

When only the serum creatinine level is available, the following formula (based on sex, weight, and age of the patient) may be used to convert this value into creatinine clearance. The serum creatinine should represent a steady state of renal function.

Males: Weight (kg) x (140 - age) 72 x serum creatinine (mg/100 mL)

Females: 0.85 x above value

In patients undergoing hemodialysis, the loading dose of 1 gram to 2 grams should be given after each hemodialysis, and the maintenance dose should be given as indicated in Table 4.

Antibiotic therapy for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections should be maintained for at least 10 days to guard against the risk of rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis. In staphylococcal and other infections involving a collection of pus, surgical drainage should be carried out where indicated.

Pediatric Patients

The recommended dosage in pediatric patients three months of age and older is 80 to 160 mg/kg of body weight per day divided into four to six equal doses. The higher dosages should be used for more severe or serious infections. The total daily dosage should not exceed 12 grams.

At this time no recommendation is made for pediatric patients from birth to three months of age (see PRECAUTIONS).

In pediatric patients with renal insufficiency, the dosage and frequency of dosage should be modified consistent with the recommendations for adults (see Table 4).

### Simplified dosing of oral azithromycin for children 1–11 months old in child survival programmes: age-based and height-based dosing protocols [^111DfFg2]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

For the older age group, a tolerance limit of 15–30 mg/kg was used. Two sets of analyses were conducted for each trial, the first to select one dose for the entire group of children 3–11 months old and the second to select both dose and an age cut-off to delineate doses for two age groups among children 3–11 months old. In analyses to determine one dose, both MORDOR and CHAT analyses selected a dose of 160 mg (4 mL) for children 3–11 months old with 93.5% and 89.7% accuracy, respectively (table 3, figure 1). When selection for an age cut-off was included in the optimisation, the top results from both trials suggested a dose of 120 mg (3 mL) for the younger age group (3 months in MORDOR and 3–5 months in CHAT) and 160 mg (4 mL) for older age group (4–11 months in MORDOR and 6–11 months in CHAT), resulting in 94% accuracy in both MORDOR and CHAT. Similar results were found in both trials with an age cut-off of 4 months, suggesting a dose of 120 mg (3 mL) for children 3–4 months old and 160 mg (4 mL) for children 5–11 months old. All age cutoffs > 5 months resulted in a dose of 4 mL for both younger and older age groups. Heatmaps displaying the full results for the MORDOR and CHAT optimisations to determine both age cut-off and dose are included in online supplemental figures 1 and 2. Sensitivity analyses using tolerance limits of 20–40 mg/kg for children 3–11 months old resulted in higher suggested doses of 200 mg (5 mL) for one age group (online supplemental table 1) or 200–240 mg (5–6 mL) for two age groups, with similar accuracy to the main analyses in both trials. Table 4 proposes dosing schedules based on these results and shows the overall accuracy that would be seen if these approaches were used in each dataset.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Comparative clinical trials of otitis media were conducted in nearly 400 children between the ages of 6 months to 10 years. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from 47% of the patients, Haemophilus influenzae from 34%, Moraxella catarrhalis from 15% and S. pyogenes from 4%.

The overall response rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae to cefixime was approximately 10% lower and that of Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis approximately 7% higher (12% when beta-lactamase positive isolates of H. influenzae are included) than the response rates of these organisms to the active control drugs.

In these studies, patients were randomized and treated with either cefixime at dose regimens of 4 mg/kg twice a day or 8 mg/kg once a day, or with a comparator. Sixty-nine to 70% of the patients in each group had resolution of signs and symptoms of otitis media when evaluated 2 to 4 weeks post-treatment, but persistent effusion was found in 15% of the patients. When evaluated at the completion of therapy, 17% of patients receiving cefixime and 14% of patients receiving effective comparative drugs (18% including those patients who had Haemophilus influenzae resistant to the control drug and who received the control antibacterial drug) were considered to be treatment failures. By the 2 to 4 week follow-up, a total of 30%-31% of patients had evidence of either treatment failure or recurrent disease.

### Impact of an antibiotic stewardship program on antibiotic choice, dosing, and duration in pediatric urgent cares [^114rcGDN]. American Journal of Infection Control (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Many antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) focus on decreasing unnecessary antibiotics. We describe the impact of an outpatient ASP on choice, dose, and duration of antibiotics when used for common infections in pediatric urgent care (PUC) centers.

Methods

We reviewed encounters at 4 PUC centers within our organization for patients 6 months to 18 years old with acute otitis media, group A streptococcal pharyngitis, community-acquired pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and skin and soft tissue infections who received systemic antibiotics. We determined appropriate antibiotic choice, dose, and duration for each diagnosis. Pearson's χ² test compared appropriate prescribing before ASP implementation (July 2017-July 2018) and postimplementation (August 2018-December 2020). Control charts trended improvement over time.

Results

Our study included 35,917 encounters. The percentage of prescriptions with the recommend agent at the appropriate dose and duration increased from a mean of 32.7% to 52.4%. The center lines for appropriate agent, dose, and duration all underwent upward shifts. The most substantial changes were seen in antibiotic duration (63.2%-80.5%), and appropriate dose (64.6%-77%).

Conclusions

Implementation of an outpatient ASP improved prescribing patterns for choosing the appropriate agent, duration, and dose for many common infections in our PUCs.

### Empiric antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection in preschool children: susceptibilities of urine sample isolates [^112eYQFG]. Family Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic treatment recommendations based on susceptibility data from routinely submitted urine samples may be biased because of variation in sampling, laboratory procedures and inclusion of repeat samples, leading to uncertainty about empirical treatment.

Objective

To describe and compare susceptibilities of Escherichia coli cultured from routinely submitted samples, with E. coli causing urinary tract infection (UTI) from a cohort of systematically sampled, acutely unwell children.

Methods

Susceptibilities of 1458 E. coli isolates submitted during the course of routine primary care for children < 5 years (routine care samples), compared to susceptibilities of 79 E. coli isolates causing UTI from 5107 children < 5 years presenting to primary care with an acute illness [systematic sampling: the Diagnosis of Urinary Tract infection in Young children (DUTY) cohort].

Results

The percentage of E. coli sensitive to antibiotics cultured from routinely submitted samples were as follows: amoxicillin 45.1% (95% confidence interval: 42.5–47.7%); co-amoxiclav using the lower systemic break point (BP) 86.6% (84.7–88.3%); cephalexin 95.1% (93.9–96.1%); trimethoprim 74.0% (71.7–76.2%) and nitrofurantoin 98.2% (97.4–98.8%). The percentage of E. coli sensitive to antibiotics cultured from systematically sampled DUTY urines considered to be positive for UTI were as follows: amoxicillin 50.6% (39.8–61.4%); co-amoxiclav using the systemic BP 83.5% (73.9–90.1%); co-amoxiclav using the urinary BP 94.9% (87.7–98.4%); cephalexin 98.7% (93.2–99.8%); trimethoprim 70.9% (60.1–80.0%); nitrofurantoin 100% (95.3–100.0%) and ciprofloxacin 96.2% (89.4–98.7%).

Conclusion

Escherichia coli susceptibilities from routine and systematically obtained samples were similar. Most UTIs in preschool children remain susceptible to nitrofurantoin, co-amoxiclav and cephalexin.

### Early antibiotic exposure and development of asthma and allergic rhinitis in childhood [^1128uanQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic medical record (EMR) data from 2007 to 2016 at a large academic health institution. A single person completed data extraction and coding of variables for this study. Inpatient, emergency room, immediate care, and outpatient clinic encounters at the institution were included in the study. Children ages 1–10 years were included in this study; children younger than 1 year of age at the time of our study were excluded from the sample due to low number of diagnoses due to age. All children included were born at and attended at least two subsequent visits at this institution. Our dataset contained birth information on sex, age, race/ethnicity, zip code, birth weight, gestational age, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU vs. normal nursery), and method of delivery. For each additional visit, our data also contained recorded height, weight, and any current or past diagnoses. Primary outcomes included childhood asthma and allergic rhinitis. Children with missing data were excluded from the study. The study was approved by Loyola University Chicago institutional review board (IRB) and marked exempt.

Study exposure

Antibiotic exposure was defined as a physician order for outpatient or administration of inpatient oral antibiotics or intravenous antibiotics. Children received at least one of the following antibiotics in this study: Penicillin, Amoxicillin, Gentamicin, Vancomycin, Clindamycin, Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim, Cephalexin, Ampicillin, Cefotaxime, Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin, Cefdinir and Ceftazidime. We studied two exposures: our first exposure maintained antibiotic exposure as a continuous variable in terms of dosages, and our second exposure created binary exposure groups, categorizing antibiotics as receiving at least one order or administration vs. receiving no orders or administrations within a designated time frame. First, we compared children who received at least one dose of antibiotics in the first year of life to children who were not exposed during this time. We also compared children who received at least one dose of antibiotics in their lifetime to children who never received antibiotics. Lastly, we examined the dose-response relationship using an ordinal logistic regression analysis of each additional antibiotic prescription using the continuous antibiotic exposure group, and compared outcomes between first year and lifetime antibiotic exposure and the development of our primary disease outcomes.

### Direct oral challenges safely reduce the burden of low-risk cephalosporin allergy labels [^114eGfjW]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Among those stratified as low risk, 71 of 152 (46.7%) agreed to DOC whereas 81 of 152 (53.3%) had skin testing before considering OC (Figure 1). Of the 81 patients who underwent skin testing, 62 (76.5%) proceeded with OC whereas 19 (23.5%) did not undergo OC owing to a loss to follow-up (Figure 1). From the cohort of 71 patients who underwent DOC, 56 (78.9%) were female, 59 (83.1%) self-reported as White, and median age was 57 years (Table I). The most common drug allergy labels were cephalexin (39 of 71 [54.9%]), cefaclor (12 of 71 [16.9%]), and an unknown cephalosporin (11 of 71 [15.5%]) (Table I). The most common reported adverse drug reactions were childhood reaction (21 of 71 [29.5%]), unspecified rash (17 of 71 [23.9%]), and urticaria (13 of 71 [18.3%]) (Table I). Moreover, of the 71 patients, 68 (95.8%) were challenged with cephalexin, two (2.8%) with cefdinir, and one (1.4%) with cefuroxime (Table I). Of the 71 patients who underwent DOC, 70 (98.6%) passed and were successfully delabeled. Subsequently, 15 of 71 (21.1%) patients tolerated a known cephalosporin treatment after CAL removal (see Table E1 in this article's Online Repository at) and 67 of 71 (94.4%) maintained CAL removal from the medical record (Table I) with a median follow-up of 15.9 months (interquartile range, 11.8–19.7). In terms of adverse events, one of the 71 patients (1.4%) developed pruritus of the neck and eyes approximately 40 minutes after ingestion of cefuroxime, which resolved with antihistamines. This reaction was similar to the index reaction and the patient was not delabeled. Compared with low-risk patients who preferred skin testing before OC, we observed no positive skin tests, and all 62 patients (100%) tolerated OC (Table I). In terms of safety, no cases of cephalosporin anaphylaxis or other adverse drug reactions related to cephalosporins were observed in low-risk patients with CAL during challenge or subsequent treatments.

### Pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of single-dose or multiple-dose cefiderocol in hospitalized pediatric patients three months to less than eighteen years old with infections treated with standard-of-care antibiotics in the PEDI-CEFI phase 2 study [^113G5kFn]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacokinetics

The plasma cefiderocol concentration profiles after the single and multiple doses were similar in all age cohorts (Fig. 1 A and B). The geometric mean concentrations at 3 hours after the start of infusion (the end of infusion, considered peak concentrations) ranged between 72.7 and 97.1 μg/mL in the single-dose cohorts and between 88.8 and 106.0 μg/mL in the multiple-dose cohorts (Table, Supplemental Digital Content 7). The geometric mean concentrations at 8 hours after the start of infusion (considered trough concentrations, before the next infusion in the multiple-dose cohort) ranged between 7.86 and 10.8 μg/mL in the single-dose cohorts and between 9.64 and 18.1 μg/mL in the multiple-dose cohorts (Table, Supplemental Digital Content 7). In the multiple-dose phase of the study in each age cohort, the free drug trough concentrations ranged between 4.07 and 7.67 μg/mL (Table, Supplemental Digital Content 8). In this patient population, no correlation was found between total trough concentrations and eGFR (Figure, Supplemental Digital Content 9).

FIGURE 1.
Mean (SD) plasma cefiderocol concentration over time for pediatric patients in the single-dose phase (A) and multiple-dose phase (B) by age cohort (PKCS population). Cohort 1 = 12 to < 18 years, cohort 2 = 6 to < 12 years, cohort 3 = 2 to < 6 years and cohort 4 = 3 months to < 2 years. By study design, multiple-dose cefiderocol was not administered to subjects in age cohort 1 (ie, 12– < 18 years). Mean and SD of plasma cefiderocol concentration presented at ≥ 0 μg/mL in these plots even though the lower range for SD could be < 0 μg/mL. PKCS indicates pharmacokinetic concentration summary (n = 28; 1 patient did not have blood sample for pharmacokinetic analysis); CLSI indicates Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute; EUCAST, European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing; SD, standard deviation.

### Quality of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric community-acquired pneumonia in outpatient care [^113mw8Q2]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical guidelines, dose and duration

Clinical practice guidelines and treatment recommendations were extracted from Bugs & Drugs, a provincial reference, as well as: American Academy of Pediatrics (AAPS), Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS), Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), Canadian Pediatric Society (CPS), and the British Thoracic Society (BTS). Guidelines were reviewed and first-line agent(s), dosing and duration extracted. Treatment recommendations for β-lactam allergies were excluded as medication allergies are recorded but remain unavailable in PharmaNet data.

Amoxicillin [40–90 mg/Kg/day; max 4 g/day; x 5–7 days] was the primary treatment for outpatient pediatric CAP. Alternative first-line treatments included: Penicillin [25–50 mg/Kg/day; max 2 g/day; x 5–7 days]; Ampicillin [50–100 mg/Kg/day; max 2 g/day; x 5–7 days]; and Amoxicillin-clavulanate [90 mg/Kg/day; max 4 g/Kg/day; x 5–7 days]. Average daily dose was stratified by patient age, and calculated utilizing WHO growth charts for Canada. For each age, a daily dosing range was calculated. The 3rd and 97th percentile weights at the mid-point (i.e. 6.5 years for a 6-year-old) were determined for each sex. Per age and sex, the lowest 3rd percentile weight was multiplied by the lowest dose (e.g. 40 mg for amoxicillin) to calculate the minimum daily dose. The highest 97th percentile was multiplied by the highest dose (e.g. 90 mg for amoxicillin) to calculate the maximum; up to the maximum daily dose stated in guidelines (e.g. 4 g for amoxicillin).

Published in 2012, provincial guidelines state that 5–7 days is the appropriate duration of antibiotic treatment. Other guidelines put forth by the AAPS and IDSA, during our study period, do include longer durations (7–10 days), however given the scope of our study is limited to BC, regionally-specific recommendations were prioritized.

Purpose of this section — if an antibiotic will be used for treatment of a child with AOM, the clinician must choose an antibiotic with a high likelihood of being effective against the most likely etiologic bacterial pathogens with considerations of cost, taste, convenience, and adverse effects, and this section proposes first- and second-line antibiotics that best meet these criteria while balancing potential benefits and harms.
