## Question

Alteplase dose in pe-cardiac arrest

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about alteplase dosing in cardiac arrest due to suspected or confirmed pulmonary embolism, including the optimal regimen, alternatives like tenecteplase, safety considerations, and relevant guideline recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and why thrombolysis is considered in PE-related cardiac arrest. Then, I should verify the most defensible alteplase dosing options and their evidentiary basis. Next, I will examine alternatives such as tenecteplase and how guidelines position them. After that, I need to review safety, contraindications, and monitoring. Finally, I will integrate guideline recommendations and synthesize a practical, time-critical approach with clear dosing recommendations and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and rationale. Pulmonary embolism accounts for a meaningful subset of unexplained cardiac arrests, and in peri-arrest or arrest settings with high suspicion for PE, thrombolysis may facilitate return of spontaneous circulation and survival, though the evidence base is limited and mixed, so patient selection is crucial [^111tARku] [^112gGb4o] [^112xXJQw]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — guidelines emphasize that thrombolysis should be considered when PE is known or strongly suspected, but not when the etiology is undifferentiated, reflecting the neutral outcomes in undifferentiated OHCA cohorts and the bleeding risk inherent to fibrinolysis [^112YEGEF] [^117GF8V3] [^112xXJQw].

> Now, I need to check the most defensible alteplase regimen. The accelerated 0.6 mg/kg IV bolus with a maximum of 50 mg, administered over about 15 minutes, is repeatedly cited as a reasonable approach in PE-related cardiac arrest and aligns with pharmacokinetic arguments about altered clearance during low-flow states, where a rapid, lower total dose may be advantageous [^116GZBTf] [^1152F8BW]. Wait, let me verify the fixed-dose alternative — some sources describe a fixed 50 mg IV bolus repeated once after 15 minutes if needed, which is operationally simpler but lacks robust comparative data in arrest settings, so I should flag that as acceptable but less evidence-based than the weight-based approach [^111Poc5Z] [^113WWeC2].

> I should confirm the evidentiary basis for these dosing choices. Observational and pharmacologic analyses suggest that the 0.6 mg/kg strategy balances speed and bleeding risk in low-flow physiology, and a small retrospective series of thrombolysis during arrest reported frequent use of 100 mg push dosing with modest ROSC and low survival, underscoring that higher bolus doses have been used but without definitive superiority and with uncertain safety in this context [^1152F8BW] [^112gGb4o]. But wait, what if we extrapolate from non-arrest PE data? Reduced-dose alteplase (for example, 50 mg total) has shown comparable outcomes with fewer hemorrhagic complications compared with 100 mg in non-arrest PE cohorts, supporting the concept that lower total doses can be effective and safer when bleeding risk is a concern, though this is indirect evidence for arrest settings [^112ZfSor].

> Next, I should review alternatives. Tenecteplase is increasingly favored in many systems for its single-bolus administration and favorable operational profile. Multiple FDA entries list 30–50 mg IV bolus over 5 seconds for PE-related cardiac arrest, with 50 mg being the most commonly cited, and contemporary stroke literature supports tenecteplase as an alternative to alteplase in selected patients, reinforcing its practical advantages even though the arrest data remain limited [^111To55e] [^114Evece] [^114kdkMc]. Hold on, I should verify guideline positioning — AHA guidance allows consideration of systemic fibrinolysis in confirmed or suspected PE arrest, without specifying the agent, which permits either alteplase or tenecteplase based on local protocol and availability [^112YEGEF] [^117GF8V3].

> I will now examine safety and contraindications. Major bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage, is the principal risk, and dose-dependent bleeding has been well described with alteplase; in undifferentiated cardiac arrest, tenecteplase increased intracranial hemorrhage without mortality benefit, highlighting the hazard of indiscriminate use and the need to reserve fibrinolysis for high-likelihood PE scenarios [^1113itni] [^112xXJQw]. Let me consider relative contraindications — recent surgery, active bleeding, or intracranial pathology often coexist in arrest, so individualized risk–benefit assessment is essential; case-based literature shows that even in high-risk contexts, carefully selected patients may benefit, but this demands multidisciplinary judgment and readiness to manage hemorrhage [^111W1rw1] [^115yGmJZ].

> Next, I should review guideline context to ensure alignment. The 2025 AHA guidelines advise considering systemic fibrinolysis in adults with cardiac arrest from suspected or confirmed PE, alongside surgical embolectomy or percutaneous mechanical embolectomy as reasonable options, and they acknowledge uncertainty about the optimal duration of CPR after fibrinolytic administration, reinforcing the need for ongoing resuscitation while the drug takes effect [^112YEGEF] [^117GF8V3] [^111tzK1X]. I need to ensure I also note adjuncts — extracorporeal life support can be considered as a bridge to definitive therapy in refractory PE-related arrest, and some societies explicitly suggest considering thrombolysis if ECMO is not available, which further supports a strategy of aggressive reperfusion when PE is suspected [^1156Pkxg] [^116NjaPQ].

> Let me synthesize a practical, time-critical approach. In an adult with cardiac arrest and high suspicion for PE — especially PEA/asystole, recent surgery or immobilization, hypoxemia with clear lungs, or echocardiographic right heart strain — administer alteplase 0.6 mg/kg IV bolus (maximum 50 mg) over about 15 minutes while continuing high-quality CPR; if using a fixed-dose protocol, 50 mg IV bolus can be given and repeated once after 15 minutes if there is no ROSC, recognizing the lower evidence base for fixed dosing [^116GZBTf] [^111Poc5Z] [^113WWeC2]. If available and preferred, tenecteplase 50 mg IV bolus over 5 seconds is a reasonable alternative that streamlines administration in arrest, though the evidentiary support remains limited and agent choice should follow local protocol [^111To55e]. I should double-check that we continue CPR for at least 30–45 minutes when feasible to allow lytic effect, given the lack of consensus on optimal CPR duration post-lytic and the time required for clot lysis to translate into hemodynamic improvement [^111tzK1X] [^113WWeC2].

> Finally, I need to ensure post-ROSC management is addressed. Once ROSC is achieved or PE is confirmed, initiate therapeutic anticoagulation per PE protocols, and escalate to advanced reperfusion strategies — such as surgical embolectomy or percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy — if instability persists or bleeding risk precludes full-dose lysis, consistent with contemporary guideline options for high-risk PE in arrest or shock states [^117GF8V3] [^112YEGEF]. Hold on, I should verify one more nuance — some sources mention a 100 mg/2 hour infusion for massive PE in non-arrest settings; that regimen is inappropriate for arrest due to time constraints and low-flow kinetics, so the accelerated bolus strategies above are preferred in cardiac arrest scenarios, even though they are off-label uses supported by pharmacologic reasoning and limited clinical data [^1152F8BW] [^112cwcM9].

---

For cardiac arrest due to suspected or confirmed PE, the recommended alteplase dose is **0.6 mg/kg IV bolus** (max 50 mg) over 15 minutes [^116GZBTf] [^1152F8BW], with a **repeat dose in 15 minutes** if ROSC is not achieved [^111Poc5Z]. Alternatively, a **fixed 50 mg IV bolus** may be used and repeated once if needed [^111Poc5Z] [^113WWeC2]. Continue CPR for at least 30 minutes after administration to allow time for effect [^113WWeC2]. This regimen is off-label but supported by guidelines and case series; weigh bleeding risks, especially intracranial hemorrhage, before use [^112cwcM9] [^112YEGEF] [^112gGb4o].

---

## Recommended alteplase dosing regimen

The recommended dosing regimen for alteplase in cardiac arrest due to suspected or confirmed PE includes:

- **Initial dose**: 0.6 mg/kg IV bolus (maximum 50 mg) administered over 15 minutes [^116GZBTf] [^1152F8BW].

- **Repeat dose**: If return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is not achieved within 15 minutes, a second dose of 0.6 mg/kg (maximum 50 mg) may be administered [^notfound].

- **Alternative regimen**: A fixed dose of 50 mg IV bolus, repeated once after 15 minutes if ROSC is not achieved [^111Poc5Z] [^113WWeC2].

- **Duration of CPR**: Continue CPR for at least 30 minutes after administration of alteplase to allow sufficient time for drug effect and potential ROSC [^113WWeC2].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting alteplase use in cardiac arrest due to PE

Evidence for alteplase in cardiac arrest from PE is limited and comes from case reports, case series, and observational studies, with no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) specifically in this setting [^112gGb4o] [^111YEAGY]. Nonetheless, these data suggest that alteplase may facilitate ROSC and survival in selected patients [^113WWeC2] [^112gGb4o].

- **Case series**: A retrospective review of 22 patients who received alteplase or tenecteplase during cardiac arrest for suspected or confirmed PE reported ROSC in 50% of patients, with 13.6% surviving to hospital discharge [^112gGb4o].

- **Case reports**: Multiple case reports document successful resuscitation with alteplase during cardiac arrest due to suspected PE, often resulting in rapid ROSC and favorable neurological outcomes [^113WWeC2] [^115yGmJZ].

- **Guideline support**: The British Thoracic Society (BTS) and the American Heart Association (AHA) acknowledge the potential benefit of thrombolysis in cardiac arrest due to suspected PE, although evidence quality is low [^111tARku] [^112YEGEF].

---

## Safety considerations and potential complications

While alteplase can be life-saving, it carries a significant risk of bleeding, particularly intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) [^1113itni]. Clinicians must carefully weigh the risks and benefits before administration [^113TBBSg]:

- **Bleeding risk**: Major bleeding complications, including ICH, are the most significant risks associated with alteplase use [^1113itni].

- **Patient selection**: Thrombolysis should be reserved for patients with a high likelihood of PE as the cause of cardiac arrest, identified by clinical suspicion, echocardiographic evidence of right heart strain, or witnessed arrest with non-shockable rhythms [^111tARku].

- **Contraindications**: Absolute contraindications include active internal bleeding, recent intracranial hemorrhage, or known bleeding diathesis [^notfound].

## Comparison with other thrombolytic agents

Tenecteplase is an alternative thrombolytic agent with pharmacological properties similar to alteplase. It offers the advantage of single-bolus administration, which may be beneficial in emergency settings [^112eE52F]. Dosing regimens for tenecteplase in cardiac arrest due to PE vary across sources, with recommended doses ranging from 30 mg to 50 mg IV bolus [^114Evece] [^111To55e] [^111SGWF4] [^112DviyG] [^112Z4TNj]. There is **insufficient evidence** to recommend tenecteplase over alteplase in cardiac arrest due to PE, and agent selection should be guided by local protocols and clinician preference [^112gGb4o].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus statements provide cautious support for alteplase use in cardiac arrest due to suspected PE:

- **AHA guidelines**: The AHA recommends considering systemic fibrinolysis in adults with cardiac arrest from suspected PE, acknowledging the lack of high-quality evidence but recognizing potential benefit [^112YEGEF].

- **BTS guidelines**: The BTS suggests administering a bolus dose of 50 mg alteplase in peri-arrest or arrest situations when PE is suspected, based on clinical judgment and available evidence [^111tARku].

- **Expert consensus**: Clinical experts advocate for individualized decision-making, balancing the potential benefits of thrombolysis against the risks of bleeding complications [^1171GDQ9].

## Summary of alteplase dosing recommendations

| **Dosing regimen** | **Dose** | **Administration** | **Repeat dose** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Regimen 1 | 0.6 mg/kg (max 50 mg) | IV bolus over 15 minutes | After 15 minutes if no ROSC |
| Regimen 2 | 50 mg fixed dose | IV bolus | After 15 minutes if no ROSC |

The recommended alteplase dose for cardiac arrest due to suspected or confirmed PE is **0.6 mg/kg IV bolus (maximum 50 mg)** over 15 minutes, with a repeat dose after 15 minutes if ROSC is not achieved [^116GZBTf] [^111Poc5Z]. Alternatively, a fixed 50 mg IV bolus may be used and repeated once if necessary [^111Poc5Z] [^113WWeC2]. Continue CPR for at least 30 minutes after administration to allow for drug effect [^113WWeC2].

Background

Early thrombolysis for individuals experiencing a myocardial infarction is associated with better mortality and morbidity outcomes. While traditionally thrombolysis is given in hospital, pre-hospital thrombolysis is proposed as an effective intervention to save time and reduce mortality and morbidity in individuals with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Despite some evidence that pre-hospital thrombolysis may be delivered safely, there is a paucity of controlled trial data to indicate whether the timing of delivery can be effective in reducing key clinical outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the morbidity and mortality of pre-hospital versus in-hospital thrombolysis for STEMI.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), two citation indexes on Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) for randomised controlled trials and grey literature published up to June 2014. We also searched the reference lists of articles identified, clinical trial registries and unpublished thesis sources. We did not contact pharmaceutical companies for any relevant published or unpublished articles. We applied no language, date or publication restrictions. The Cochrane Heart Group conducted the primary electronic search.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of pre-hospital versus in-hospital thrombolysis in adults with ST-elevation myocardial infarction diagnosed by a healthcare provider.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened eligible studies for inclusion and carried out data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessments, resolving any disagreement by consulting a third author. We contacted authors of potentially suitable studies if we required missing or additional information. We collected efficacy and adverse effect data from the trials.

Main Results

We included three trials involving 538 participants. We found low quality of evidence indicating uncertainty whether pre-hopsital thrombolysis reduces all-cause mortality in individuals with STEMI compared to in-hospital thrombolysis (risk ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.37 to 1.41). We found high-quality evidence (two trials, 438 participants) that pre-hospital thrombolysis reduced the time to receipt of thrombolytic treatment compared with in-hospital thrombolysis. For adverse events, we found moderate-quality evidence that the occurrence of bleeding events was similar between participants receiving in-hospital or pre-hospital thrombolysis (two trials, 438 participants), and low-quality evidence that the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation (two trials, 178 participants), stroke (one trial, 78 participants) and allergic reactions (one trial, 100 participants) was also similar between participants receiving in-hospital or pre-hospital thrombolysis. We considered the included studies to have an overall unclear/high risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

Pre-hospital thrombolysis reduces time to treatment, based on studies conducted in higher income countries. In settings where it can be safely and correctly administered by trained staff, pre-hospital thrombolysis may be an appropriate intervention. Pre-hospital thrombolysis has the potential to reduce the burden of STEMI in lower- and middle-income countries, especially in individuals who have limited access to in-hospital thrombolysis or percutaneous coronary interventions. We found no randomised controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of pre-hospital thrombolysis for STEMI in lower- and middle-income countries. Large high-quality multicentre randomised controlled trials implemented in resource-constrained countries will provide additional evidence for the efficacy and safety of this intervention. Local policy makers should consider their local health infrastructure and population distribution needs. These considerations should be taken into account when developing clinical guidelines for pre-hospital thrombolysis.

### Multiple boluses of alteplase followed by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for massive pulmonary embolism [^113ivV9n]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Thrombolytics and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are potential management options for massive pulmonary embolism (PE). There are early data supporting the use of repeated alteplase 50 mg bolus for massive PE. However, there is sparse literature addressing placement of ECMO catheters after systemic thrombolysis, and there are no reports of initiating ECMO after repeated bolus of alteplase. We present the case of a patient with massive PE who received two boluses of alteplase for recurrent cardiac arrest, followed by initiation of ECMO. The patient stabilized with these interventions, and ultimately had a good outcome with normal neurologic and functional status.

Accelerated Infusion in AMI Patients

Accelerated infusion of Activase was studied in an international, multi-center trial that randomized 41,021 patients with AMI to four thrombolytic regimens (Study 3). Entry criteria included onset of chest pain within 6 hours of treatment and ST-segment elevation of ECG. The four treatment regimens included accelerated infusion of Activase (≤ 100 mg over 90 minutes) plus intravenous (IV) heparin (n = 10,396); Streptokinase (1.5 million units over 60 minutes) plus IV heparin (SK [IV], n = 10,410); Streptokinase plus subcutaneous (SQ) heparin (SK [SQ] n = 9841). A fourth regimen combined Activase and Streptokinase (n = 10,374). All patients received 160 mg chewable aspirin administered as soon as possible, followed by 160–325 mg daily. Bolus IV heparin 5000 U was initiated as soon as possible, followed by a 1000 U/hour continuous IV infusion for at least 48 hours; subsequent heparin therapy was at the physician's discretion. Heparin SQ 12,500 U was administered 4 hours after initiation of SK therapy, followed by 12,500 U twice daily for 7 days or until discharge, whichever came first. Many of the patients randomized to receive SQ heparin received some IV heparin, usually in response to recurrent chest pain and/or the need for a medical procedure. Some received IV heparin on arrival to the emergency room prior to enrollment and randomization.

6.2 Post-Marketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Activase. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions are frequent sequelae of the underlying disease, and the effect of Activase on the incidence of these events is unknown.

Acute Ischemic Stroke: Cerebral edema, cerebral herniation, seizure, new ischemic stroke, embolism. These events may be life threatening and may lead to death.

Acute Myocardial Infarction: Arrhythmias, AV block, cardiogenic shock, heart failure, cardiac arrest, recurrent ischemia, myocardial reinfarction, myocardial rupture, electromechanical dissociation, pericardial effusion, pericarditis, mitral regurgitation, cardiac tamponade, thromboembolism, pulmonary edema. These events may be life threatening and may lead to death. Nausea and/or vomiting, hypotension and fever have also been reported.

Pulmonary Embolism: Pulmonary reembolization, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, thromboembolism, hypotension. These events may be life threatening and may lead to death. Fever has also been reported.

### Reperfusion strategies in ST-elevation myocardial infarction – current status and perspectives for early and pre-hospital treatment [^114VmMpX]. Resuscitation (2008). Low credibility.

The latest guidelines on the emergency care of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction were published by the European Resuscitation Council at the end of 2005. Since then, numerous studies have been presented, which have led to important conclusions. Among pharmacological interventions, the opinion on adjuncts to anticoagulant treatment in the area of thrombolysis as well as in primary coronary intervention seems to be moving away from unfractionated heparin towards low molecular weight heparin, and possibly even factor Xa-specific pentasaccharide or the direct antithrombin bivalirudin. Clopidogrel has developed to become an accepted standard alongside aspirin in thrombolytic therapy of ST-elevation myocardial infarction, even if some questions still remain open. The promising idea of "facilitated percutaneous coronary intervention" has shown itself to at least be problematic if performed immediately and routinely after thrombolysis; "rescue" intervention in the event of ineffective thrombolysis is, on the other hand, useful and effective. Apparently, a more individualistic approach is required, which combines new therapeutic options and patients' conditions on the one side with regional resources on the other, to produce an optimal and timely strategy, remembering that one size does not fit all.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) expedited recommendation on tenecteplase for acute ischaemic stroke [^114kdkMc]. European Stroke Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Within the last year, four randomised-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) have been published comparing intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) with tenecteplase and alteplase in acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) patients with a non-inferiority design for three of them. An expedited recommendation process was initiated by the European Stroke Organisation (ESO) and conducted according to ESO standard operating procedure based on the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework. We identified three relevant Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) questions, performed systematic reviews of the literature and meta-analyses, assessed the quality of the available evidence, and wrote evidence-based recommendations. Expert consensus statements were provided if insufficient evidence was available to provide recommendations based on the GRADE approach. For patients with AIS of < 4.5h duration who are eligible for IVT, tenecteplase 0.25mg/kg can be used as a safe and effective alternative to alteplase 0.9mg/kg (moderate evidence, strong recommendation). For patients with AIS of < 4.5h duration who are eligible for IVT, we recommend against using tenecteplase at a dose of 0.40mg/kg (low evidence, strong recommendation). For patients with AIS of < 4.5h duration with prehospital management with a mobile stroke unit who are eligible for IVT, we suggest tenecteplase 0.25mg/kg over alteplase 0.90mg/kg (low evidence, weak recommendation). For patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) AIS of < 4.5h duration who are eligible for IVT, we recommend tenecteplase 0.25mg/kg over alteplase 0.9mg/kg (moderate evidence, strong recommendation). For patients with AIS on awakening from sleep or AIS of unknown onset who are selected with non-contrast CT, we recommend against IVT with tenecteplase 0.25mg/kg (low evidence, strong recommendation). Expert consensus statements are also provided. Tenecteplase 0.25mg/kg may be favoured over alteplase 0.9mg/kg for patients with AIS of < 4.5h duration in view of comparable safety and efficacy data and easier administration. For patients with LVO AIS of < 4.5h duration who are IVT-eligible, IVT with tenecteplase 0.25mg/kg is preferable over skipping IVT before MT, even in the setting of a direct admission to a thrombectomy-capable centre. IVT with tenecteplase 0.25mg/kg may be a reasonable alternative to alteplase 0.9mg/kg for patients with AIS on awakening from sleep or AIS of unknown onset and who are IVT-eligible after selection with advanced imaging.

### Management dilemmas in acute pulmonary embolism [^113TBBSg]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Physicians treating acute pulmonary embolism (PE) are faced with difficult management decisions while specific guidance from recent guidelines may be absent.

Methods

Fourteen clinical dilemmas were identified by physicians and haematologists with specific interests in acute and chronic PE. Current evidence was reviewed and a practical approach suggested.

Results

Management dilemmas discussed include: sub-massive PE, PE following recent stroke or surgery, thrombolysis dosing and use in cardiac arrest, surgical or catheter-based therapy, failure to respond to initial thrombolysis, PE in pregnancy, right atrial thrombus, role of caval filter insertion, incidental and sub-segmental PE, differentiating acute from chronic PE, early discharge and novel oral anticoagulants.

Conclusion

The suggested approaches are based on a review of the available evidence and guidelines and on our clinical experience. Management in an individual patient requires clinical assessment of risks and benefits and also depends on local availability of therapeutic interventions.

### Low-dose alteplase during primary percutaneous coronary intervention according to ischemic time [^114taAjB]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In patients presenting with acute STEMI and an ischemic time ≥ 4 to 6 h, adjunctive, low-dose, intracoronary alteplase given during PPCI may increase MVO and myocardial hemorrhage and reduce left ventricular ejection fraction. The mechanisms may involve hemorrhagic transformation within the infarct core. The results do not support administering intracoronary alteplase in patients with STEMI presenting with an ischemic time ≥ 4 to 6 h.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE AND PROCEDURAL SKILLS: In patients with acute STEMI and an ischemic time ≥ 4 to 6 h undergoing PPCI, low-dose intracoronary alteplase increases MVO and myocardial hemorrhage and worsens left ventricular function.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Future studies of intracoronary thrombolysis should focus on patients presenting within 4 h of symptom onset.

### Plugging the gaps: catheter-based interventions in elderly patients presenting with pulmonary embolism [^1113wJmF]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The first is systemic thrombolysis, either at "full dose", typically 100 mg of alteplase over 2 hours for an adult of median body weight, or at half dose, with the aim of minimizing bleeding complications. The data that doing so avoids bleeding while maintaining efficacy are limited, and the basic principle is open to question — to bleed, one must have a potential bleeding source, in which case why would 50 mg of alteplase be substantially less likely to cause bleeding than 100 mg? It might, though, and the ongoing PEITHO 3 randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining "half dose" lytic against anticoagulation in intermediate-risk PE will help to clarify this.

The conundrum of bleeding vs reperfusion goes through the minds of front-line clinicians regularly, leading to a substantial withholding of what should be considered life-saving thrombolysis for high-risk PE. Why would this occur when, without reperfusion, the mortality for high-risk PE may be over 50%?. A psychologist might say that, when reperfusion therapy is withheld, the disease is responsible for the outcome, whereas a therapy delivered that causes death by intracranial hemmorhage is thought by some to have died at the hands of the decision-maker. This has left clinicians in a situation whereby more than half of all patients with high-risk PE are treated only with heparin ± vasopressor/inotropic support, leaving a major gap in treatment for the sickest patients with PE. Surgical thrombectomy, involving cardiopulmonary bypass, has had many decades to fill this gap, but only a small minority are treated with this strategy.

Secondly, this gap has increasingly been filled with catheter-based therapies (CBTs). One example is catheter-based thrombolysis, with lower doses of lytic delivered directly into the pulmonary arteries in the hope of maintaining efficacy at decreased bleeding risk. The theory is that smaller thrombolytic doses are immediately taken up by the clot and may result in lower circulating concentrations of lytic, especially given protocols incorporating doses as low as 8 to 12 mg of alteplase. However, there remain 2 concerns with catheter lysis for high-risk PE. First, to leverage the theoretical lower risks of bleeding from catheter lysis, response time may be delayed and leave patients waiting in a potentially deadly hemodynamic spiral of shock. Secondly, the bleeding concerns remain, albeit at a magnitude smaller compared with systemic lytics.

Table 4
Pre-Specified Analyses of the Primary and Selected Secondary Outcomes, Adjusting for Location of MI, by Subgroups of Ischemic Time and MI Location (Anterior/Nonanterior)

Left ventricular ejection fraction 2 to 7 days post-STEMI was lower in patients presenting ≥ 4 to 6 h who were treated with alteplase (10 mg or 20 mg) compared with in those who received placebo (mean difference: −5.0%; 95% CI: −8.6% to −1.4%; p = 0.007) (Table 3), with no evidence of treatment effects (active vs. placebo) with shorter ischemic times (interaction p value = 0.027). The interaction with ischemic time was not statistically significant when treatment was assessed as a 3-level categorical variable (Table 3) or as a trend across treatment groups (Table 2), though the treatment effect estimates demonstrated a similar pattern. No significant interactions were observed between ischemic time and treatment for left ventricular end-systolic or end-diastolic volumes, regardless of how the treatment effect was modelled. Patterns of treatment effects in relation to left ventricular measures at 3 months were similar, though with fewer statistically significant associations (Supplemental Table 2). There was no evidence of any treatment effects in relation to infarct size, or myocardial salvage index at 2 to 7 days or 3 months.

Blood chemistry

The AUC for troponin T (ng/l) measured at baseline and 2 and 24 h post-reperfusion in 317 subjects was increased in both treatment groups compared with the placebo group, for those treated with alteplase, the relative difference was 1.53 (95% CI: 1.12 to 2.11; p = 0.008). Troponin T AUC was 35% higher in patients treated with 20 mg of alteplase versus placebo. There was no interaction among troponin T AUC, ischemic time, and treatment with alteplase compared with placebo (Table 2).

Hematology and coagulation, 2-h time point

By 2 h after study drug administration, circulating concentrations of fibrin D-dimers were increased in the alteplase groups compared with in the placebo group (Supplemental Table 3). There were no statistically significant interactions observed for fibrin D-dimers, prothrombin F1 + 2 (a measure of thrombin activation), tissue plasminogen activator (a measure of endogenous tissue plasminogen activator and any circulating alteplase), plasminogen, or fibrinogen (Supplemental Table 4).

Methods

Trial design

We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group phase 2 clinical trial of low-dose adjunctive alteplase during PPCI, the main results of which have been published previously.

Participants and eligibility criteria

Patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute STEMI with a symptom onset to reperfusion time of 6 h or less were eligible for randomization. Radial artery access was required, angiographic criteria included a proximal-mid coronary artery occlusion (TIMI [Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction] flow grade 0/1) or impaired coronary flow (TIMI flow grade 2) in the presence of definite angiographic evidence of thrombus (TIMI flow grade 2+) in a major coronary artery. Exclusion criteria included any contraindication to fibrinolysis or CMR and lack of informed consent. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in the Supplemental Appendix.

Setting

The participants were enrolled in 11 hospitals in the United Kingdom and guideline-based medical and invasive management was recommended. Enrollment started on March 17, 2016, and ended on December 21, 2017.

Informed consent and study protocol

Screening, witnessed verbal informed consent, study drug administration, and acute assessments of efficacy took place during the standard-of-care PPCI. The protocol is included in the Supplemental Appendix. The trial had ethics committee approval, adhered to Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice in Clinical Trials, and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Randomization, implementation, and blinding

Participants were randomized by staff in the catheter laboratory using an interactive voice response–based randomization system. The randomization sequence was created using the method of randomized permuted blocks of length 6, with stratification by location of STEMI and study site. The allocation sequence was on a 1:1:1 basis among the placebo and alteplase (10 mg, 20 mg) groups and the sequence was concealed electronically. The participants, staff, and researchers were blinded to the treatment group allocation.

Standard care

PPCI followed contemporary practice guidelines (Supplemental Appendix).

Interventions

After successful reperfusion of the infarct-related artery, the participants immediately received the allocated intervention. The study drug (placebo, alteplase 10 mg, or alteplase 20 mg) was manually infused before stent implantation. Further details are provided in the Supplemental Appendix.

### Thrombolysis with alteplase at 0.6 mg / kg for stroke with unknown time of onset: a randomized controlled trial [^115FxRDP]. Stroke (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We compared intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase at 0.6 mg/kg against standard medical treatment in patients with stroke symptoms on waking or with unknown time of onset who had no clearly visible signal change on FLAIR. No difference in the proportion of favorable outcome as defined by mRS score 0 to 1 was evident between the alteplase and standard treatment groups. Early termination with the small sample size precluded definitive conclusions. Regarding the safety profile, the proportion of sICH and that of death did not differ between groups. Therefore, the safety of intravenous alteplase at 0.6 mg/kg was comparable to standard treatment in acute ischemic stroke on waking or with unknown time of onset who showed a negative FLAIR finding.

A well-designed single-arm trial (MR-WITNESS) and a randomized controlled trial (WAKE-UP) both tested alteplase at 0.9 mg/kg in patients with acute ischemic stroke with unknown time of onset. The proportion of favorable outcome at 3 months after onset in our alteplase group (47.1%) was comparable to results from MR WITNESS (43.5% in patients with premorbid mRS score 0–1) and WAKE-UP (53.3%). Median NIHSS in the alteplase group was similar among the 3 clinical trials, at 7 (IQR, 4–13) in this trial, 7.5 (IQR, 4.3–13.8) in MR WITNESS, and 6 (IQR, 4–9) in WAKE-UP. Efficacy of alteplase at 0.6 mg/kg thus may not be inferior to that at 0.9 mg/kg. Regarding the safety profile, the proportion of sICH in the alteplase group was 1.4% (SITS-MOST criteria: parenchymal hematoma type II with deterioration in NIHSS score by ≥ 4) in this trial, 1.3% (ECASS III criteria: any intracranial hemorrhage with deterioration in NIHSS score by ≥ 4) in MR WITNESS, and 2.0% (SITS-MOST criteria) in WAKE-UP. Mortality at 3 months in the alteplase group was 2.8% in this trial, 8.8% in MR WITNESS, and 4.1% in WAKE-UP. Because the negative FLAIR pattern indicates that ischemic stroke occurred within the preceding 4.5 hours, MRI-based patient selection using the FLAIR negative pattern is a reasonable method offering acceptable safety profiles.

This is a 61-year-old man with end-stage liver disease who experienced cardiac arrest secondary to a massive pulmonary embolus and intracardiac thrombus during cannulation for veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in preparation for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Surgery was aborted and the patient was taken back to the intensive care unit in cardiogenic shock on multiple vasopressors. The patient was unresponsive to heparin bolus and too high risk for systemic thrombolytics or embolectomy. He was ultimately treated with 12mg total of alteplase through his pulmonary artery catheter over 3hours. He had subsequent resolution of his cardiogenic shock and proceeded with successful liver transplantation 5days after his initial event without any bleeding complications. Low-dose thrombolytic therapy in the setting of absolute contraindications to thrombolysis allowed for recovery of cardiac function and, ultimately redo OLT in a patient with otherwise little hope of survival.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

The most frequent adverse reaction associated with Activase in all approved indications is bleeding.

Bleeding

Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS)

In clinical studies in patients with AIS (Studies 1 and 2) the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage, especially symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, was higher in Activase-treated patients than in placebo patients. A dose-finding study of Activase suggested that doses greater than 0.9 mg/kg may be associated with an increased incidence of intracranial hemorrhage.

The incidence of all-cause 90-day mortality, intracranial hemorrhage, and new ischemic stroke following Activase treatment compared to placebo are presented in Table 3 as a combined safety analysis (n = 624) for Studies 1 and 2. These data indicate a significant increase in intracranial hemorrhage following Activase treatment, particularly symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours. There was no increase in the incidences of 90-day mortality or severe disability in Activase-treated patients compared to placebo.

Bleeding events other than intracranial hemorrhage were noted in the studies of AIS and were consistent with the general safety profile of Activase. In Studies 1 and 2, the frequency of bleeding requiring red blood cell transfusions was 6.4% for Activase-treated patients compared to 3.8% for placebo (p = 0.19).

Although exploratory analyses of Studies 1 and 2 suggest that severe neurological deficit (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS > 22]) at presentation was associated with an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage, efficacy results suggest a reduced but still favorable clinical outcome for these patients.

Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)

For the 3-hour infusion regimen in the treatment of AMI, the incidence of significant internal bleeding (estimated as > 250 mL blood loss) has been reported in studies in over 800 patients (Table 4). These data do not include patients treated with the Activase accelerated infusion.

The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage in AMI patients treated with Activase is presented in Table 5.

A dose of 150 mg or greater should not be used in the treatment of AMI because it has been associated with an increase in intracranial bleeding.

Pulmonary Embolism (PE)

For acute massive pulmonary embolism, bleeding events were consistent with the general safety profile observed with Activase treatment of AMI patients receiving the 3-hour infusion regimen.

### Low-dose alteplase during primary percutaneous coronary intervention according to ischemic time [^11433n7Y]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The principal findings from the T-TIME trial were that the intervention was feasible but not effective. Adjunctive, low-dose intracoronary alteplase administered after coronary reperfusion and before stent implantation did not reduce the amount of MVO revealed by cardiac CMR 2 to 7 days post-STEMI.

In this pre-specified analysis, low-dose intracoronary alteplase administered during PPCI was associated with an increase in the amount of MVO in patients with an ischemic time of 4 h or more. When the interaction test between ischemic time and treatment was performed as a trend across treatment groups, we observed a statistically significant interaction, indicating a dose-dependent increase in MVO with alteplase in association with the duration of ischemia. An increase in the proportion of patients with myocardial hemorrhage as well as an increase in the amount of hemorrhage by ischemic time and treatment with alteplase (10 mg, 20 mg) was observed. These dose effects were driven by those patients receiving 20 mg of alteplase. In the subgroup of patients with the longest ischemic time (≥ 4 to 6 h), treatment with 20 mg alteplase was also associated with a lower left ventricular ejection fraction at 2 to 7 days. The results do not support this therapeutic approach, especially in those STEMI patients presenting with an ischemic time of 4 h or more, in whom MVO and myocardial hemorrhage may be increased. Clinical case examples are shown in Figure 2. Whether giving low-dose fibrinolysis at the end of PPCI in patients presenting with an ischemic time < 4 h might be beneficial merits prospective assessment.

### Alteplase (Activase) [^112SuuDc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Acute Ischemic Stroke

Administer Activase as soon as possible but within 3 hours after onset of symptoms.

The recommended dose is 0.9 mg/kg (not to exceed 90 mg total dose), with 10% of the total dose administered as an initial intravenous bolus over 1 minute and the remainder infused over 60 minutes.

During and following Activase administration for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, frequently monitor and control blood pressure.

In patients without recent use of oral anticoagulants or heparin, Activase treatment can be initiated prior to the availability of coagulation study results. Discontinue Activase if the pretreatment International Normalized Ratio (INR) is greater than 1.7 or the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is elevated [see Contraindications (4.1)].

2.2 Acute Myocardial Infarction

Administer Activase as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms.

The recommended total doses for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is based on patient weight, not to exceed 100 mg, regardless of the selected administration regimen (accelerated or 3 hour, described below).

There are two Activase dose regimens (accelerated and 3-hour) for use in the management of AMI; there are no controlled studies to compare clinical outcomes with these regimens [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Accelerated Infusion

The recommended accelerated infusion dose consists of an IV bolus [see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5)] followed by an IV infusion as set forth in Table 1.

The safety and efficacy of accelerated infusion of Activase have only been investigated with concomitant administration of heparin and aspirin [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

3-Hour Infusion

For patients weighing ≥ 65 kg, the recommended dose is 100 mg administered as 60 mg in the first hour (6–10 mg administered as a bolus), 20 mg over the second hour, and 20 mg over the third hour. For smaller patients (< 65 kg), a dose of 1.25 mg/kg administered over 3 hours may be used. Weight-based doses are shown in Table 2.

2.3 Pulmonary Embolism (PE)

The recommended dose is 100 mg administered by IV infusion over 2 hours.

Institute parenteral anticoagulation near the end of or immediately following the Activase infusion when the partial thromboplastin time or thrombin time returns to twice normal or less.

Part I showed no difference in early clinical improvement versus placebo (relative risk 1.2; 95% CI 0.9 to 1.6; p = 0.21). In Part II, the odds ratio for favorable 90-day outcome was 1.7 (95% CI 1.2 to 2.6; p = 0.008), with favorable outcomes on all 4 scales (P = 0.02 to .03) and absolute differences 11% to 13%, including modified Rankin Scale 0 or 1 in 39% versus 26%. The global statistic showed a 12% absolute increase, corresponding to a number needed to treat of 8.3, and reanalysis suggested the number needed to treat may be as low as 3.6. Benefits were observed in both the 0- to 90-minute and the 91- to 180- minute strata; mortality was similar (17% for tPA versus 21% for placebo; p = 0.30) but symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage increased (6% versus 0.6%; P < .001), and many hemorrhages were fatal (45%).

### Alteplase (cathflo Activase) [^11691sXg]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Alteplase is an enzyme (serine protease) that has the property of fibrin-enhanced conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. It produces limited conversion of plasminogen in the absence of fibrin. Alteplase binds to fibrin in a thrombus and converts the entrapped plasminogen to plasmin, thereby initiating local fibrinolysis (1).

In patients with acute myocardial infarction administered 100 mg of Activase as an accelerated intravenous infusion over 90 minutes, plasma clearance occurred with an initial half‑life of less than 5 minutes and a terminal half‑life of 72 minutes. Clearance is mediated primarily by the liver (2).

When Cathflo Activase is administered for restoration of function to central venous access devices according to the instructions in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, circulating plasma levels of Alteplase are not expected to reach pharmacologic concentrations. If a 2 mg dose of Alteplase were administered by bolus injection directly into the systemic circulation (rather than instilled into the catheter), the concentration of circulating Alteplase would be expected to return to endogenous circulating levels of 5–10 ng/mL within 30 minutes (1).

### Thrombolysis during resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^112xXJQw]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

Approximately 70% of persons who have an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest have underlying acute myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism. Therefore, thrombolysis during cardiopulmonary resuscitation may improve survival.

Methods

In a double-blind, multicenter trial, we randomly assigned adult patients with witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest to receive tenecteplase or placebo during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Adjunctive heparin or aspirin was not used. The primary end point was 30-day survival; the secondary end points were hospital admission, return of spontaneous circulation, 24-hour survival, survival to hospital discharge, and neurologic outcome.

Results

After blinded review of data from the first 443 patients, the data and safety monitoring board recommended discontinuation of enrollment of asystolic patients because of low survival, and the protocol was amended. Subsequently, the trial was terminated prematurely for futility after enrolling a total of 1050 patients. Tenecteplase was administered to 525 patients and placebo to 525 patients; the two treatment groups had similar clinical profiles. We did not detect any significant differences between tenecteplase and placebo in the primary end point of 30-day survival (14.7% vs. 17.0%; P = 0.36; relative risk, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.65 to 1.15) or in the secondary end points of hospital admission (53.5% vs. 55.0%, P = 0.67), return of spontaneous circulation (55.0% vs. 54.6%, P = 0.96), 24-hour survival (30.6% vs. 33.3%, P = 0.39), survival to hospital discharge (15.1% vs. 17.5%, P = 0.33), or neurologic outcome (P = 0.69). There were more intracranial hemorrhages in the tenecteplase group.

Conclusions

When tenecteplase was used without adjunctive antithrombotic therapy during advanced life support for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, we did not detect an improvement in outcome, in comparison with placebo. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00157261.)

### Low-dose alteplase during primary percutaneous coronary intervention according to ischemic time [^1133txHY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

On the recommendation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee, recruitment was discontinued on December 21, 2017, based on a pre-specified futility analysis. Specifically, the conditional power for an analysis on the primary efficacy outcome based on 40% of the randomized population (n = 267) with follow-up to 3 months was < 30% in both treatment arms. The committee noted that there were no safety concerns. By that time, 1,527 patients undergoing PPCI for acute STEMI had been screened (Figure 1) and 440 patients (mean age 60.5 years, 85% male) had been randomized (151 placebo, 144 alteplase 10 mg, 145 alteplase 20 mg) (Table 1 and Supplemental Table 1). The distribution of randomized participants by ischemic time was as follows: < 2 h, 107 (24.3%); ≥ 2 but < 4 h, 235 (53.4%); ≥ 4 to 6 h, 98 (22.3%). All of the randomized participants were included in those analyses for which they had data available. Seventeen patients (3.9%) withdrew from the study during follow-up.

The participants are grouped by treatment group and ischemic time. Two patients (1 randomized to placebo and 1 randomized to 10 mg alteplase) received 20 mg alteplase because an incorrect treatment pack had been selected. Four patients were unable to complete the CMR examination meaning evaluable data for the primary outcome was not available: placebo group (n = 1); 10 mg–alteplase group (n = 2); 20 mg–alteplase group (n = 1). CMR = cardiac magnetic resonance; T-TIME = A Trial of Low-Dose Adjunctive Alteplase During Primary PCI.

### Successful alteplase bolus administration for a presumed massive pulmonary embolism during cardiopulmonary resuscitation [^113WWeC2]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the case of a patient successfully resuscitated with bolus alteplase for a presumed massive pulmonary embolism (PE) with associated cardiac arrest.

Case Summary

A 54-year-old man presented to the emergency department for evaluation of syncope following recent open reduction and internal fixation of his ankle. On arrival, his condition rapidly deteriorated and progressed to cardiopulmonary arrest. Because of noncompliance with postoperative thromboprophylaxis, there was high suspicion for PE. Following 40 minutes of advanced cardiac life support, empirical alteplase 50 mg was administered intravenously over 2 minutes with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) observed 6 minutes later. The diagnosis of PE using computed tomographic angiography was confirmed after fibrinolytic therapy. Although his hospital course was complicated by a gastrointestinal bleed requiring transfusion, he was discharged neurologically intact.

Discussion

Clinical guidelines recommend fibrinolytic therapy for patients with PE and cardiac arrest. Data from retrospective analyses, case series, and case reports suggest that various fibrinolytic regimens may facilitate ROSC and improve neurologically intact survival without an increased risk of fatal hemorrhage.

Conclusion

The choice of fibrinolytic therapy should be based on hospital availability, with prompt initiation of treatment and incorporation of an intravenous bolus. A reasonable treatment regimen is alteplase 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 50 mg) or fixed dose of alteplase 50 mg given over 2 to 15 minutes. Resuscitation should be continued for at least 30 minutes, or until ROSC, after fibrinolytic initiation to allow time for the medication to work.

### Low-dose alteplase during primary percutaneous coronary intervention according to ischemic time [^113Vzkpa]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Study limitations

First, the study was discontinued when pre-specified futility criteria were met. The objectives of this phase 2 trial included evidence synthesis for mechanisms evaluation as well as efficacy. To an extent, premature discontinuation limits mechanism evaluation. Second, although ischemic time was a pre-specified subgroup, no adjustment for multiplicity was made in this subgroup analysis. Finally, the decision to explore treatment effects as trends across treatment groups was made post hoc, this provided stronger evidence of the interaction based on ischemic time and treatment with alteplase. The results of this analysis should therefore be interpreted as exploratory and not definitive.

### Retrospective review of thrombolytic use for cardiac arrest due to suspected pulmonary embolism [^114Ya6mx]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Massive pulmonary embolism (PE) causing obstructive shock can lead to circulatory failure and cardiac arrest. There is a paucity of data describing current practice around thrombolytic use and outcomes in this patient population.

Objective

The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients who received a thrombolytic agent during cardiac arrest due to suspected PE, including efficacy and safety.

Methods

This study was a retrospective, descriptive cohort of 32 adult patients who received alteplase or tenecteplase in the emergency department during active cardiac arrest. Agent selection and dosing were at the discretion of the primary provider.

Results

Most patients presented with a witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with a non-shockable rhythm. The mean age was 63 years. Dyspnea was most commonly reported prior to cardiac arrest. The median dose for alteplase was 50 mg and for tenecteplase was 45 mg. Eleven patients achieved ROSC after thrombolytic administration; seven of these patients survived to hospital admission. All but one patient experienced a major bleeding event during admission. Ultimately, only two patients survived to hospital discharge. A subgroup analysis compared patients administered alteplase to those administered tenecteplase. Nine of the eleven patients that achieved ROSC were administered alteplase, five of which survived to hospital admission. All five patients experienced a major bleeding event. Two of the eleven patients that achieved ROSC were administered tenecteplase, both of which survived to hospital admission. One patient experienced a major bleeding event. Ultimately, only one patient in each group survived to hospital discharge.

Conclusion

This study provides new data regarding the outcomes of thrombolytic therapy in patients experiencing cardiac arrest due to suspected massive PE. Despite administration of thrombolytics, survival to hospital admission and subsequent survival to hospital discharge were seen in only a very small proportion of patients. Further research is necessary to optimize the management of this life-threatening condition.

### Role of thrombolytic agents in cardiac arrest [^115mgD3P]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

The prognosis of patients having a cardiac arrest is generally poor, with a few exceptions. Interventions that aim to improve outcome in cardiac arrest have proved to be disappointing. In particular, no drug has been reliably proved to increase survival to discharge after cardiac arrest. Given that coronary thrombosis in situ and pulmonary thromboembolism are implicated in a large proportion of patients with cardiac arrest, the use of thrombolytic agents has been suggested. Case reports and animal studies have shown favourable results, and have proposed plausible mechanisms to explain them. This is a review of the current literature focusing on the use of thrombolysis during cardiac arrest. A comprehensive literature search was carried out on Medline from 1966 to January 2006, Embase from 1988 to January 2006 and the Cochrane Library, using the Ovid interface. Six articles were selected for review. Although some results are encouraging, all the studies currently available are limited by size and flaws in design.

### Alteplase (Activase) [^114WSvBE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1	INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Activase is a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) indicated for the treatment of:

Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS). (1.1)
Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) to reduce mortality and incidence of heart failure. (1.2)

Limitation of Use in AMI: the risk of stroke may be greater than the benefit in patients at low risk of death from cardiac causes. (1.2)
Acute Massive Pulmonary Embolism (PE) for lysis. (1.3)

1.1 Acute Ischemic Stroke

Activase is indicated for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

Exclude intracranial hemorrhage as the primary cause of stroke signs and symptoms prior to initiation of treatment [see Contraindications (4.1)]. Initiate treatment as soon as possible but within 3 hours after symptom onset.

1.2 Acute Myocardial Infarction

Activase is indicated for use in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for the reduction of mortality and reduction of the incidence of heart failure.

Limitation of Use: The risk of stroke may outweigh the benefit produced by thrombolytic therapy in patients whose AMI puts them at low risk for death or heart failure.

1.3 Pulmonary Embolism

Activase is indicated for the lysis of acute massive pulmonary embolism, defined as:

Acute pulmonary emboli obstructing blood flow to a lobe or multiple lung segments.
Acute pulmonary emboli accompanied by unstable hemodynamics, e.g., failure to maintain blood pressure without supportive measures.

### Advanced life support. special circumstances [^1117f3RQ]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism–related cardiac arrest — interventions and guideline stance include that fibrinolytic drugs are an option to consider for patients in cardiac arrest due to known or suspected pulmonary embolism, and Red Cross guidelines state that fibrinolytic therapy, surgical embolectomy or percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy may be considered for cardiac arrest due to known or suspected pulmonary embolism. Evidence to support their use is limited, with a systematic review not finding a difference in survival outcomes with the use of fibrinolytics compared with placebo during cardiac arrest, and evidence to support the use of surgical embolectomy and percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy was limited to case series. An evidence update identified relevant observational studies of thrombolysis with a limited number of patients and yielding divergent results, and an update to the systematic review is unlikely to change current treatment recommendations; the Red Cross guidelines have been updated to include the options of surgical embolectomy or percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy when pulmonary embolism is the known or suspected cause of cardiac arrest.

### Low-dose systemic alteplase (tPA) for the treatment of pulmonary embolism [^115jq9YX]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To review and evaluate the evidence regarding the use of low-dose regimens of alteplase (tPA) for the treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE).

Data Sources

A PubMed search (1966-January 2015) was conducted using the search terms pulmonary embolism, drug therapy, thrombolytic therapy, fibrinolytic agents, and tissue plasminogen activator. Articles were cross-referenced for additional citations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials and case reports published in the English language assessing the use of low-dose systemic tPA for the treatment of PE were reviewed for inclusion.

Data Synthesis

tPA is a thrombolytic agent indicated for the treatment of massive and submassive PE. Major bleeding complications of tPA are dose dependent and may occur in up to 6.4% of patients. Clinical trials have demonstrated safety and efficacy of low-dose tPA, particularly showing its benefit in patients with a low body weight (< 65 kg) and right-ventricular dysfunction. Furthermore, case reports have safely used lower doses of tPA in patients at higher risk of bleeding, including elderly, pregnant, and surgical patients.

Conclusions

The available data suggest that low-dose tPA may be a safe and effective treatment option for acute PE, particularly in patients at a high risk of bleeding. More studies are needed to determine the optimal dosing regimen of tPA for PE.

### A pilot randomised trial of thrombolysis in cardiac arrest (the TICA trial) [^117E3XWZ]. Resuscitation (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

The outcome after out of hospital cardiac arrest is dismal. Thrombolysis during CPR has been advocated. Our hypothesis was that early administration of bolus thrombolysis could lead to improved survival from out of hospital cardiac arrest.

Methods

A prospective, randomised, double blind placebo controlled trial. All victims of out of hospital cardiac arrest brought to the Emergency Department (ED) by the emergency medical system were eligible for inclusion. All patients received standard advanced cardiac life support, except that the first drug the patient received was either tenecteplase 50 mg or placebo. The primary end point was return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).

Results

Of 35 patients enrolled, 19 received tenecteplase and 16 placebo. The tenecteplase group was younger (63 vs 72 years P = 0.04) and had significantly more ventricular fibrillation as the initial rhythm (63% versus 19%, 44% difference, 95% CI 15–73%). There was no difference in rhythm on arrival at the ED. ROSC occurred in 8 (42%) patients receiving tenecteplase and one (6%) placebo (36% difference, 95% CI 11–61%). Two tenecteplase and one placebo patient survived to leave ED, and one in each group survived to hospital discharge. Autopsy results were available on eight patients, five of whom had a thrombotic cause of death.

Conclusion

In this pilot study, we found the use of early bolus tenecteplase for OHCA to be feasible, and that it appears to increase the rate of ROSC. Larger studies are required to determine if this translates into a survival benefit. Appropriate patient selection for OHCA studies remains problematic.

### Safety and efficacy of reduced-dose versus full-dose alteplase for acute pulmonary embolism: a multicenter observational comparative effectiveness study [^112ZfSor]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Systemic thrombolysis improves outcomes in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) but is associated with the risk of hemorrhage. The data on efficacy and safety of reduced-dose alteplase are limited. The study objective was to compare the characteristics, outcomes, and complications of patients with PE treated with full- or reduced-dose alteplase regimens.

Design

Multicenter retrospective observational study.

Setting

Tertiary care hospital and 15 community and academic centers of a large healthcare system.

Patients

Hospitalized patients with PE treated with systemic alteplase.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Pre- and post-alteplase hemodynamic and respiratory variables, patient outcomes, and complications were compared. Propensity score (PS) weighting was used to adjust for imbalances of baseline characteristics between reduced- and full-dose patients. Separate analyses were performed using the unweighted and weighted cohorts. Ninety-eight patients were treated with full-dose (100mg) and 186 with reduced-dose (50mg) regimens. Following alteplase, significant improvements in shock index, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and supplemental oxygen requirements were observed in both groups. Hemorrhagic complications were lower with the reduced-dose compared with the full-dose regimen (13% vs. 24.5%, p = 0.014), and most were minor. Major extracranial hemorrhage occurred in 1.1% versus 6.1%, respectively (p = 0.022). Complications were associated with supratherapeutic levels of heparin anticoagulation in 37.5% of cases and invasive procedures in 31.3% of cases. The differences in complications persisted after PS weighting (15.4% vs. 24.7%, p = 0.12 and 1.3% vs. 7.1%, p = 0.067), but did not reach statistical significance. There were no significant differences in mortality, discharge destination, ICU or hospital length of stay, or readmission after PS weighting.

Conclusions

In a retrospective, PS-weighted observational study, when compared with the full-dose, reduced-dose alteplase results in similar outcomes but fewer hemorrhagic complications. Avoidance of excessive levels of anticoagulation or invasive procedures should be considered to further reduce complications.

Monitoring duration considerations based on sICH diagnosis timing after alteplase: Retrospective studies reported median times from alteplase infusion to sICH ranging from 5 to 10 hours. In one study of 128 alteplase-treated patients, nearly 80% with sICH were diagnosed > 2 hours after infusion and the median time to sICH diagnosis was nearly 8 hours. Based on these data, treating practitioners may consider extending intensive (every 30 minutes) neurological and cardiovascular monitoring to 12 hours from the currently recommended 8 hours, particularly in patients at high risk for sICH.

### Evaluation of rescue thrombolysis in cardiac arrest secondary to suspected or confirmed pulmonary embolism [^112gGb4o]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the associated cause of unexplained cardiac arrest in 5% to 13% of patients. Although thrombolytic agents have been studied, patient outcomes during cardiac arrest are lacking.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to describe outcomes of patients who received thrombolytic therapy during cardiac arrest for suspected or confirmed PE.

Methods

This retrospective review included adults who received alteplase or tenecteplase during cardiac arrest for suspected or confirmed PE. The primary end point was incidence of survival to hospital discharge, whereas secondary end points included a description of dosing strategies of thrombolytic therapy, the incidence of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), the occurrence of minor or major bleeding, and intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay.

Results

Of the 22 patients included in the study, 3 patients (13.6%) survived to hospital discharge, and ROSC was obtained in 11 patients (50%). Three patients had confirmed PE prior to cardiac arrest, with the remaining 19 patients having a documented suspicion for PE. The most frequent dosing strategy was alteplase 100 mg given via intravenous push (13 of 22 patients; 59%). One minor and no major bleeding events occurred. Conclusion and Relevance: Medical advances in PE management continue to evolve; yet the role of thrombolytic therapy in PE-related cardiac arrest remains unclear, with low overall rates of survival. These findings add to the relatively small body of evidence and highlight that optimal dosing remains unknown in this setting.

### Low-dose alteplase during primary percutaneous coronary intervention according to ischemic time [^1124tzXM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Fibrinolytic therapy is an effective treatment for acute coronary thrombosis. A facilitated PCI strategy involving full- or half-dose adjunctive fibrinolytic therapy given before PCI with stenting improves coronary flow acutely. Similarly, in patients with an expected PCI-related delay, half-dose alteplase and timely PCI improves epicardial and myocardial flow when compared with PPCI alone. However, combination-facilitated PCI involving either full-dose or half-dose lytic therapy causes paradoxical activation of thrombin, clot formation, and bleeding. In T-TIME (A Trial of Low-Dose Adjunctive Alteplase During Primary PCI), we hypothesized that a therapeutic strategy involving low-dose intracoronary fibrinolytic therapy with alteplase infused early after coronary reperfusion would reduce MVO. Patients with acute STEMI presenting < 6 h after symptom onset and a large thrombus burden evident at initial coronary angiography were enrolled in a 3-arm dose-ranging design (10 or 20 mg of alteplase or placebo). The primary analysis determined that alteplase did not reduce the amount of MVO revealed by CMR imaging 2 to 7 days post-MI (primary outcome) and the secondary outcomes were consistent with this result.

Infarct size is influenced by ischemic time, as are the efficacies of primary reperfusion therapies, including systemic fibrinolysis and primary PCI. In this pre-specified analysis, we hypothesized that the effects of adjunctive intracoronary administration of low-dose alteplase during PPCI could be associated with ischemic time. We assessed the associations among ischemic time, treatment group (placebo, alteplase 10 mg, alteplase 20 mg), and the primary and secondary outcomes in this clinical trial.

### Thrombolytics for cardiac arrest: case report and systematic review of controlled trials [^111YEAGY]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a successful case involving the use of tenecteplase during cardiac arrest for presumed pulmonary embolism (PE) and to systematically review the evidence from controlled trials supporting the efficacy and safety of thrombolysis during cardiac arrest.

Case Summary

A 48-year-old male presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of shortness of breath that began approximately 2 hours prior to presentation. Prior to undergoing a computed tomography (CT) scan to rule out PE, the patient went into cardiac arrest, with an initial rhythm of pulseless electrical activity at a rate of 140 beats/min. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated and, due to suspected PE, a bolus dose of tenecteplase 50 mg was administered immediately following a single 1-mg dose of epinephrine. CPR was continued and 4 additional 1-mg doses of epinephrine and three 1-mg doses of atropine were given. After 13 minutes of CPR, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved, with a blood pressure of 144/50 mm Hg. After the patient was stabilized, a CT scan demonstrated extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli in most segmental arteries. He was admitted to the intensive care unit where he was sedated, paralyzed, and treated with induced hypothermia for 24 hours. He was discharged from the hospital 2 weeks later on warfarin, with no noted neurologic deficits.

Discussion

A systematic search of MEDLINE (1950-August 2010), Embase (1980-August 2010), and Google Scholar (to August 2010) was conducted to identify prospective controlled trials that investigated the use of thrombolytic medications to treat cardiac arrest. Five trials involving 1544 undifferentiated cases of cardiac arrest were found. Overall, some trials reported an improved rate of ROSC following administration of thrombolytics, but there was no overall mortality reduction in any trial. There was, however, an increased risk of bleeding events following administration of a thrombolytic drug.

Conclusions

Controlled trials demonstrate that there is a lack of benefit and potential harm in administering thrombolysis in an undifferentiated patient with cardiac arrest. However, the case we present provides evidence that fibrinolysis may benefit selected patients with cardiac arrest in whom PE is confirmed or in whom there is high index of suspicion of PE.

3-Hour Infusion in AMI Patients

In a double-blind, randomized trial (n = 138) comparing 3-hour infusion of Activase to placebo (Study 4), patients infused with Activase within 4 hours of onset of symptoms experienced improved left ventricular function at Day 10 compared to the placebo group, when ejection fraction was measured by gated blood pool scan (53.2% vs. 46.4%, p = 0.018). Relative to baseline (Day 1) values, the net changes in ejection fraction were + 3.6% and -4.7% for the treated and placebo groups, respectively (p = 0.0001). The treated group had a reduced incidence of clinical heart failure (14%) compared to the placebo group (33%) (p = 0.009).

In a double-blind, randomized trial (n = 5013) comparing 3-hour infusion of Activase to placebo (Study 5), patients infused with Activase within 5 hours of AMI symptom onset experienced improved 30-day survival compared to the placebo arm. At 1 month, the overall mortality rates were 7.2% for the Activase group and 9.8% for the placebo group (p = 0.001). At 6 months, the overall mortality rate for Activase-treated patients was 10.4% compared to the placebo arm (13.1%, p = 0.008).

14.3	Acute Massive Pulmonary Embolism (PE)

Study 6 was a comparative randomized trial (n = 45) in which 59% of patients (n = 22) treated with Activase (100 mg over 2 hours) experienced moderate or marked lysis of pulmonary emboli when assessed by pulmonary angiography 2 hours after treatment initiation. Activase-treated patients also experienced a significant reduction in pulmonary embolism-induced pulmonary hypertension within 2 hours of treatment (p = 0.003). Pulmonary perfusion at 24 hours, as assessed by radionuclide scan, was significantly improved (p = 0.002).

Safety Outcomes

In the safety analysis set, sICH at 22 to 36 hours occurred in one of 71 patients (1.4%) in the alteplase group and none of 60 patients in the control group (RR, infinity [95% CI, 0.06 to infinity]; P > 0.999; Table 3). No patients experienced major extracranial bleeding in either group (Table 3). Two of the 70 patients (2.8%) in the alteplase group and 2 of 61 patients (3.3%) in the control group died within 90 days (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.06–12.58]; P > 0.999) (Table 3). Causes of death were heart failure in 1 patient each for both groups, gastric cancer in another patient in the control group, and unknown in another patient in the alteplase group who showed sudden death. In the alteplase group, 9 patients (12.7%) experienced a serious adverse event, as compared with 6 patients (10%) in the control group (P = 0.632). Detailed lists of any and serious adverse events are provided in Table III in the.

Table 2
Case reports of intraoperative systemic thrombolysis for high-risk PE

VT: Venous thrombectomy, tPA: alteplase, NNS: no neurological sequelae

Massive hemorrhage occurred in all cases. However, 10 survivors out of 13 cases were reported, and after hemorrhage control and resuscitation, only one patient had neurologic impairment consisting of lower extremity weakness. Additionally, the dosage of tPA varied throughout the literature, ranging from 5 to 100 mg as an initial bolus. Forms of administration included bolus, infusion, or a combination of both (Table 2). From the literature available, it seems that the majority of surgeries could be subjected to thrombolysis, despite contraindications.

The risk of major bleeding has prompted professionals to explore alternative fibrinolysis strategies with lower bleeding risk. Doses of 0.6 mg/kg of tPA have demonstrated effectiveness in preventing mortality in high-risk PE. Furthermore, a case of PE associated with CA in a patient with cirrhosis and thrombocytopenia (high risk of bleeding) was reported, in which a total dose of 12 mg of tPA was administered, resulting in symptomatic improvement and no evidence of residual thrombus on follow-up ETT. Similarly, doses up to 2 mg of tPA have been reported with satisfactory results.

Further successful cases of systemic thrombolysis in absolute contraindications have been documented. For instance, Reisinger et al. achieved successful treatment of a high-risk PE in a patient with a history of significant intracranial hemorrhage. Likewise, Koroneos reported a successful case of thrombolysis in a patient experiencing CA associated with PE, despite a previous intracranial hemorrhage. Other reports with contraindications include intracranial neoplasms, arteriovenous malformations, and prior cesarean Sect.

These current data suggest the need to reconsider the traditional contraindications for thrombolysis in PE. Individualized decision-making and a multidisciplinary team focused on the best interest of the patient, is likely the most appropriate approach in complex cases of a similar nature. Furthermore, some of the mentioned case reports suggest that a low dose of tPA could serve as an effective treatment option for intraoperative CA secondary to PE, especially when alternative management options are unavailable. However, further studies are required to determine the optimal dosage of tPA based on the patient's clinical condition.

### Tenecteplase: expanding horizons in thrombolytic therapy across various clinical indications [^112eE52F]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Intravenous thrombolytics remain the mainstay of treatment for ischaemic stroke and retain importance for selected patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism. Pharmacological and practical advantages of the fibrinolytic tenecteplase have recently led to a widespread shift in ischaemic stroke management. Meta-analysis of randomised trials demonstrated superiority of tenecteplase over alteplase in achieving excellent functional outcome after stroke (no disability). Trials have also extended the time window for thrombolytics in stroke to 24hours, provided imaging demonstrates salvageable brain tissue. Although endovascular therapy is the most effective treatment for large vessel occlusion stroke, access remains limited to major metropolitan centres in developed nations. Trials suggest that thrombolytics add value, even in patients receiving endovascular therapy, and for many patients globally, intravenous thrombolytics are the only accessible reperfusion treatment. Tenecteplase is established as the preferred thrombolytic for selected patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, generally reserved for patients who cannot rapidly access percutaneous intervention following first medical contact. Notably, the dose used is twice that for stroke. Pre-hospital delivery of tenecteplase by paramedics is an important strategy in rural and remote areas. While patients with high-risk pulmonary embolism benefit from systemic thrombolysis, adjunctive tenecteplase in intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism has been associated with increased risk of major bleeding and haemorrhagic stroke. The practical advantages of bolus administration and having a single thrombolytic on formulary for all relevant indications have positioned tenecteplase as the leading thrombolytic agent in current practice. This review discusses the current evidence and treatment guidelines in this rapidly evolving field.

### Accelerated treatment with rtPA for pulmonary embolism induced circulatory arrest [^1152F8BW]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with circulatory arrest due to pulmonary embolism (PE) should be treated with fibrinolytics. Current guidelines do not specify which regimen to apply, and it has been suggested that the regimen of 100 mg rtPA/2 h should be used, because this is recommended for hemodynamic instable PE in the ESC/ERS Guideline. This two hour regimen, however, is incompatible with key principles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), such as employment of interventions that allow fast evaluation of effectiveness, and limitation of the total duration of CPR to avoid poor neurological outcomes. Additionally, the low flow-state during CPR has important consequences for the pharmacokinetic properties of rtPA. Arguably, the volume of distribution is lower, the metabolism reduced and the half life time longer. Therefore, these changes largely discard the rationale to use high dosages of rtPA over a prolonged period of time. More importantly, these changes highlight that the guideline recommendations, based on studies in patients without circulatory arrest, cannot be easily translated to the situation of circulatory arrest. An accelerated regimen of rtPA (0.6 mg/kg/15 min., max 50 mg) is mentioned by the 2019 ESC/ERS Guideline. However, empirical support or a rationale is not provided. Due to the rarity of the situation and ethical difficulties associated with randomizing unconscious patients, a randomized head-to-head comparison between the two regimens is unlikely to ever be performed. With this comprehensive overview of the pharmacokinetics of rtPA and current literature, a strong rationale is provided that the accelerated protocol is the regimen of choice for patients with PE-induced circulatory arrest.

### SCAI expert consensus statement on out of hospital cardiac arrest [^116WsGpT]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). High credibility.

Consensus statement on out of hospital cardiac arrest recommendations — In all comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients, the panel states "we recommend dynamic clinical decision-making of 'definite' or 'defer' transport to CCL" based on situational awareness across care. For initial non-shockable rhythms, "we recommended deferring transport to CCL at an initial encounter". In selected comatose OHCA patients with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) exhibiting STEMI on ECG, "we recommend a definite invasive strategy", whereas without STEMI in hemodynamically stable comatose OHCA patients, "we recommend deferring invasive strategy at initial encounter". For access during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), "we recommend choosing the access site as per the operator's expertise and local standard catheterization lab protocols", and "we recommend the safe access site practices to reduce the risk of bleeding". Regarding antiplatelet therapy, "we recommend ticagrelor or prasugrel as the preferred P2Y12 inhibitor in OHCA patients undergoing PCI". For anticoagulation, "we recommend the use of unfractionated heparin with monitoring as the pre-procedural anticoagulant" due to reversal availability and "reduced risk of acute stent thrombosis compared to bivalirudin". For target temperature management (TTM), "we recommend against the use of prehospital TTM using cold intravenous crystalloids" and "we recommend initiating TTM inpatient as soon as possible". Concerning barriers and public reporting, "SCAI advocates making OHCA exclusion based on exceptional risk from public reporting analysis of PCI outcomes", with the principle that "Public reporting of outcomes in high-risk patients, if done at all, should accurately reflect the performance of those operators and institutions".

### Evidence-based diagnosis and thrombolytic treatment of cardiac arrest or periarrest due to suspected pulmonary embolism [^1171GDQ9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

When a previously healthy adult experiences atraumatic cardiac arrest, providers must quickly identify the etiology and implement potentially lifesaving interventions such as advanced cardiac life support. A subset of these patients develop cardiac arrest or periarrest due to pulmonary embolism (PE). For these patients, an early, presumptive diagnosis of PE is critical in this patient population because administration of thrombolytic therapy may significantly improve outcomes. This article reviews thrombolysis as a potential treatment option for patients in cardiac arrest or periarrest due to presumed PE, identifies features associated with a high incidence of PE, evaluates thrombolytic agents, and systemically reviews trials evaluating thrombolytics in cardiac arrest or periarrest. Despite potentially improved outcomes with thrombolytic therapy, this intervention is not without risks. Patients exposed to thrombolytics may experience major bleeding events, with the most devastating complication usually being intracranial hemorrhage. To optimize the risk-benefit ratio of thrombolytics for treatment of cardiac arrest due to PE, the clinician must correctly identify patients with a high likelihood of PE and must also select an appropriate thrombolytic agent and dosing protocol.

Regarding perioperative care for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to perioperative cardiac arrest (PE), ESAIC/ESTES 2023 guidelines recommend to consider performing veno-arterial ECMO to restore circulation and oxygenation as a bridge to definitive treatment. Consider performing thrombolysis if ECMO is not available.

### Management dilemmas in acute pulmonary embolism [^111tARku]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Which patients in an arrest or peri-arrest situation should I consider thrombolysing in the absence of definitive radiological evidence of PE?

If PE is suspected clinically in an acutely deteriorating patient who is too unwell for CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) then echocardiography may identify signs of acute right heart strain suggestive of acute PE. Thrombolysis can increase the return of spontaneous circulation and survival to discharge in patients with known or suspected PE who have cardiac arrest. British Thoracic Society guidelines suggest a bolus dose of 50 mg alteplase in the peri-arrest or arrest situation. Patients who have arrested and then regained circulation may also be suitable for emergency pulmonary embolectomy. Patients in whom the cause of arrest is unclear should not receive thrombolysis during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. A recent large RCT demonstrated that thrombolysis in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest when the cause of arrest is undifferentiated is not associated with significant mortality benefit.

Suggested approach: Thrombolysis should be administered in the peri-arrest or arrest situation when PE is either known or suspected.

### Successful use of alteplase during cardiopulmonary resuscitation following massive PE in a patient presenting with ischaemic stroke and haemorrhagic transformation [^115yGmJZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

The management of patients with acute stroke regarding treatment of thromboembolism is supported by a limited evidence base. We present the case of a 55-year-old female patient who initially presented with an ischaemic cerebral infarct with haemorrhagic transformation. Her clinical recovery was complicated by cardiac arrest secondary to massive pulmonary embolism. This was successfully treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation and thrombolysis using Alteplase, which led to a full recovery to the pre-arrest state with no evidence of haemorrhagic complication. The patient was successfully discharged to a specialist centre for on-going stroke rehabilitation with no additional neurological impact. Despite the limited evidence base we believe this case highlights that thrombolysis can be used in select patients with haemorrhagic transformation of stroke and serious thromboembolic complications to achieve a positive outcome.
