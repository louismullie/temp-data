## Question

When should someone with primary hyperparathyroidism be considered for surgery?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to consider parathyroidectomy in primary hyperparathyroidism and how to structure the decision-making and referral process. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing symptomatic from asymptomatic disease. Then, I should verify the absolute surgical indications. Next, I will review the criteria for asymptomatic patients who should be offered surgery. After that, I need to check special populations like normocalcemic PHPT, MEN1, and lithium-associated disease. I will then examine patients who do not meet criteria and how to monitor them. Finally, I should confirm preoperative workup, operative approach, and the importance of surgeon experience and systems-level factors that influence outcomes.

> Let me first confirm the disease framework and baseline evaluation. Primary hyperparathyroidism is a biochemical diagnosis of hypercalcemia with elevated or inappropriately normal PTH, and most patients in developed settings present without classic symptoms; nonetheless, I need to screen carefully for subtle neurocognitive complaints, bone pain, fragility fractures, nephrolithiasis, polyuria, and gastrointestinal symptoms because these change management entirely [^114guUzo] [^114XDA3W]. Hold on, I should verify the initial workup: measure 25-hydroxyvitamin D, phosphate, renal function, obtain three-site DXA including distal radius, and assess for silent nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis with renal imaging, since these findings can convert an "asymptomatic" patient into a surgical candidate [^117J3Tye] [^111dqGvZ].

> Next, I should review the absolute indication: any symptomatic PHPT warrants surgery. Wait, let me verify the scope of "symptomatic". It includes classic features such as nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, osteitis fibrosa cystica, pathologic fracture, and overt hypercalcemic symptoms, as well as neurocognitive or neuropsychiatric symptoms attributable to PHPT; if symptoms are present, parathyroidectomy is the preferred definitive therapy and should be offered if the patient is a surgical candidate [^111RbJRd] [^116nAg13] [^1151CQio].

> I will now examine the biochemical threshold for asymptomatic patients. I need to ensure I state this precisely: serum calcium at least 1.0 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal is an independent indication for surgery regardless of other features; this is consistently endorsed by major guidelines and reflects the risk of progression and end-organ effects over time [^116tzkNS] [^114YZidV] [^117J3Tye].

> Let me consider skeletal involvement next. Hold on, I should verify the thresholds: osteoporosis defined as T-score ≤ −2.5 at any site, the presence of a vertebral fracture identified on VFA or spine imaging, or a fragility fracture are all indications for surgery. Importantly, cortical bone loss at the distal radius is characteristic and often precedes cancellous bone changes, so I should not overlook this pattern on DXA [^116tzkNS] [^112SpR7H] [^111dqGvZ].

> I need to check renal criteria carefully. Impaired renal function with eGFR or creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min, nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis on imaging, and hypercalciuria above sex-specific thresholds (> 250 mg/day in women, > 300 mg/day in men) are accepted indications. I initially thought the hypercalciuria cutoff was > 400 mg/day universally, but wait, that higher threshold is not the current consensus and should not be used to exclude otherwise eligible patients [^116tzkNS] [^115LUeaS].

> Age is another independent indication. Patients diagnosed at age 50 years or younger should be offered surgery even if otherwise asymptomatic. The rationale is cumulative lifetime risk of complications and the durability of surgical cure over decades of expected survival [^116tzkNS] [^115f65xC].

> But wait, what if the patient does not meet any of these criteria? I should confirm that observation is acceptable with structured surveillance, yet I must counsel that approximately one third of truly asymptomatic patients will develop new surgical indications over 10–15 years. Therefore, if compliance with monitoring is uncertain or the patient prefers definitive therapy, surgery remains reasonable after shared decision-making [^111dqGvZ] [^114sutEN] [^115bkufZ].

> Let me consider normocalcemic PHPT specifically. I should double-check the guidance: there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine surgery for nPHPT, but if the same end-organ criteria emerge (fracture, low BMD, stones, reduced eGFR), applying standard surgical thresholds is reasonable. Because multigland disease is more common and localization is less reliable, patients are more likely to require bilateral exploration, so referral to experienced surgeons is crucial [^115SoFjt] [^117UPCBt] [^112JH2Kf].

> Next, I should review special contexts. In MEN1, optimal management is typically subtotal parathyroidectomy with removal of 3.5 glands and bilateral cervical thymectomy. Preoperative imaging rarely alters the operative plan, and intraoperative PTH may be less informative, so bilateral exploration is standard and should be performed at high-volume centers [^1154Gjbk]. For lithium-associated PHPT, I need to ensure we consider both focused and bilateral strategies guided by imaging and intraoperative PTH, recognizing higher rates of multigland disease in this subgroup [^1139yAGB] [^117WYwoB].

> I should confirm the approach to patients who decline or are poor surgical candidates. Medical therapy can control hypercalcemia with cinacalcet and improve bone density with antiresorptives such as alendronate, but neither modality is curative; therefore, I need to reassess periodically for new indications and revisit surgical candidacy if risk profiles change [^1163j2zS] [^112DEB6V].

> Hold on, I should verify the preoperative pathway. Imaging is for localization only, never for diagnosis; first-line studies include neck ultrasound and sestamibi or 4D-CT depending on availability and expertise, and negative or discordant imaging should not preclude surgical referral in a biochemically proven case; in reoperative settings, invasive localization may be required [^113ozvcX] [^11723FS3] [^1119hk9G].

> Let me think about operative strategy. In experienced hands, focused parathyroidectomy with intraoperative PTH monitoring achieves high cure rates when imaging is concordant, whereas bilateral exploration is preferred for discordant imaging, suspicion of multigland disease, or when intraoperative PTH is unavailable. Surgeon experience and institutional volume correlate with lower complication rates and higher cure, so I should refer to high-volume endocrine surgeons whenever feasible [^116hU4os] [^1132YjL2] [^1136SaFb].

> I should double-check postoperative expectations and follow-up. Biochemical cure is typically defined by normalization of calcium within 24 hours and durable eucalcemia by 6 months; early hypocalcemia risk is higher with hungry bone syndrome, so calcium and PTH checks in the first 24 hours and early supplementation are prudent; long-term, bone density gains are sustained and fracture risk declines, reinforcing the value of definitive therapy when indicated [^1146PExw] [^114sutEN] [^114guUzo].

> Finally, I need to ensure we address system-level barriers. Parathyroidectomy remains underutilized despite clear indications, with disparities by insurance, race, and comorbidity. Direct referral pathways to endocrine surgery and data-driven referral to higher-performing centers can shorten time to care and improve outcomes, so I should advocate for streamlined access and equitable referral practices in my institution [^112dpLZ4] [^113hWnro] [^112D8ZeB].

> In summary, I should confirm that surgery is indicated for all symptomatic patients and for asymptomatic patients who meet any of the following: serum calcium ≥ 1.0 mg/dL above normal, skeletal involvement (T-score ≤ −2.5, vertebral fracture, or fragility fracture), renal involvement (eGFR < 60 mL/min, nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, or sex-specific hypercalciuria), or age ≤ 50 years. For patients who do not meet criteria, structured surveillance is acceptable but a substantial fraction will progress, so shared decision-making and periodic reassessment are essential. Throughout, care should be coordinated with experienced endocrine surgeons to optimize cure and minimize complications [^116tzkNS] [^117J3Tye] [^111dqGvZ].

Parathyroidectomy is indicated for **symptomatic PHPT** (nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, osteoporosis/fragility fracture, or classic neuropsychiatric symptoms) [^111RbJRd] and for **asymptomatic PHPT** when any of the following are present: serum calcium ≥ 1.0 mg/dL above normal, age < 50 years, T-score ≤ −2.5 at any site, vertebral fracture, eGFR < 60 mL/min, nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, or hypercalciuria (> 250 mg/day women, > 300 mg/day men) [^116tzkNS]. Surgery is also recommended for patients who cannot or will not comply with surveillance, and for those with normocalcemic PHPT who meet the same end-organ criteria [^115bkufZ]. Parathyroidectomy is the only definitive cure, with high success and low complication rates when performed by experienced surgeons [^1164bP4G] [^117J3Tye].

## Indications for parathyroidectomy

### Symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism

In symptomatic PHPT, **nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis** — kidney stones or calcium deposits in the kidneys — are clear indications for surgery [^116tzkNS]. Osteoporosis or fragility fracture, defined as a T-score ≤ −2.5 at any site or a history of fragility fracture, also warrants operative management [^112SpR7H]. Classic neuropsychiatric symptoms — such as fatigue, depression, cognitive impairment, or "brain fog" — likewise justify surgical intervention [^116nAg13].

---

### Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism

Asymptomatic patients should be offered parathyroidectomy if any of the following criteria are met:

| **Criterion** | **Specific indication** |
|-|-|
| Serum calcium | ≥ 1.0 mg/dL (0.25 mmol/L) above the upper limit of normal [^116tzkNS] |
| Age | < 50 years [^115f65xC] |
| Bone mineral density | T-score ≤ −2.5 at any site or vertebral fracture [^112SpR7H] |
| Renal involvement | eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, or hypercalciuria (> 250 mg/day women, > 300 mg/day men) [^116tzkNS] |
| Compliance | Inability or unwillingness to comply with surveillance protocols [^115bkufZ] |

---

### Normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism

For normocalcemic PHPT, apply the same **end-organ criteria** (bone, renal) used for hypercalcemic PHPT when considering surgery [^114Tu7pc]. Individualize decisions based on patient-specific risk factors and preferences, with shared decision-making [^117UPCBt].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Parathyroidectomy is generally deferred until after delivery unless there is severe hypercalcemia or significant symptoms.
- **Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN)**: Patients with MEN1 or MEN2A may require a different surgical approach, often involving bilateral exploration and removal of multiple glands [^1154Gjbk].
- **Persistent or recurrent PHPT**: Reoperative surgery should be performed by experienced surgeons with appropriate localization studies and intraoperative adjuncts [^115Lpvp7].

---

## Contraindications to surgery

Contraindications include **high surgical risk** — severe cardiopulmonary disease or other major comorbidities that significantly increase perioperative risk — and patient preference, in which patients who decline surgery after informed consent should be managed medically with close surveillance [^1163j2zS].

---

## Benefits of parathyroidectomy

Parathyroidectomy provides **definitive cure** — normalization of calcium and PTH in > 98% of cases — and improves bone mineral density with sustained increases and reduced fracture risk. It also lowers renal complications, including a reduced risk of nephrolithiasis and stabilization or improvement of renal function, and enhances quality of life with improvements in neurocognitive symptoms and overall well-being [^114yN9zD] [^114sutEN] [^114guUzo].

---

## Risks and complications

- **Hypocalcemia**: Temporary or permanent, managed with calcium and vitamin D supplementation.
- **Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury**: Rare, risk minimized by experienced surgeons.
- **Persistent or recurrent disease**: Rare, often due to multigland disease or ectopic glands [^114yN9zD].

---

## Alternative medical management

Medical management is reserved for patients who are **poor surgical candidates** or decline surgery. Options include cinacalcet to lower serum calcium, bisphosphonates to improve bone mineral density, and close surveillance with regular monitoring of calcium, renal function, and bone density [^1163j2zS].

---

Parathyroidectomy is indicated for symptomatic PHPT and for asymptomatic patients who meet specific biochemical, skeletal, or renal criteria. It is the only definitive cure, with high success and low complication rates when performed by experienced surgeons.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® parathyroid adenoma [^113ozvcX]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hyperparathyroidism is defined as excessive parathyroid hormone production. The diagnosis is made through biochemical testing, in which imaging has no role. However, imaging is appropriate for preoperative parathyroid gland localization with the intent of surgical cure. Imaging is particularly useful in the setting of primary hyperparathyroidism whereby accurate localization of a single parathyroid adenoma can facilitate minimally invasive parathyroidectomy. Imaging can also be useful to localize ectopic or supernumerary parathyroid glands and detail anatomy, which may impact surgery. This document summarizes the literature and provides imaging recommendations for hyperparathyroidism including primary hyperparathyroidism, recurrent or persistent primary hyperparathyroidism after parathyroid surgery, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Recommendations include ultrasound, CT neck without and with contrast, and nuclear medicine parathyroid scans. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of primary hyperparathyroidism [^114XDA3W]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common endocrine disorder, resulting from the autonomous production of parathyroid hormone from 1 or more abnormal parathyroid glands. Disease presentation ranges from asymptomatic to multiorgan involvement (skeletal, renal, neurocognitive, and gastrointestinal). This article outlines the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic algorithm for PHPT. Key laboratory assessments are discussed, as are imaging studies for preoperative localization. Indications for surgical intervention are detailed, as are potential indications for surveillance. Sporadic and genetic syndromes associated with PHPT are also described.

### Medical management of primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the fourth international workshop on the management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism [^1163j2zS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common clinical problem. The only available definitive therapy is parathyroidectomy, which is appropriate to consider in all patients. The purpose of this report is to provide an update on calcium and vitamin D supplementation and medical management for those patients with PHPT who cannot or do not want to undergo surgery.

Methods

Questions were developed by the International Task Force on PHPT. A comprehensive literature search was undertaken, and relevant articles published between 2008 and 2013 were reviewed in detail. The questions were addressed by the panel of experts, and consensus was established at the time of the workshop.

Conclusions

The recommended calcium intake in patients with PHPT should follow guidelines established for all individuals. It is not recommended to limit calcium intake in patients with PHPT who do not undergo surgery. Patients with low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be repleted with doses of vitamin D aiming to bring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to ≥ 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) at a minimum, but a goal of ≥ 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) also is reasonable. Pharmacological approaches are available and should be reserved for those patients in whom it is desirable to lower the serum calcium, increase BMD, or both. For the control of hypercalcemia, cinacalcet is the treatment of choice. Cinacalcet reduces serum calcium concentrations to normal in many cases, but has only a modest effect on serum PTH levels. However, bone mineral density (BMD) does not change. To improve BMD, bisphosphonate therapy is recommended. The best evidence is for the use of alendronate, which improves BMD at the lumbar spine without altering the serum calcium concentration. To reduce the serum calcium and improve BMD, combination therapy with both agents is reasonable, but strong evidence for the efficacy of that approach is lacking.

### Using surgery to treat hyperparathyroidism… [^115qTD3m]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Widespread use of biochemical screening in clinically healthy persons has led to an increase in the number of persons found to have hypercalcemia and subsequently diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism. However, only about 20 percent of them have systemic manifestations of parathyroid disease such as loss of bone mass or kidney stones. In 1990, the National Institutes of Health issued a consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism that specified limited criteria for the use of surgery in managing this disease. They noted in the report that there were limited data on the natural history of hyperparathyroidism in untreated patients and that future recommendations may need modification. Silverberg and associates followed two cohorts of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism for 10 years. The study enrolled 121 patients during a seven-year period.

The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism was based on an elevated calcium level and confirmed by a serum parathyroid hormone assay. Patients who met the NIH–specified criteria for surgery were recommended for parathyroidectomy. These criteria included nephrolithiasis, osteitis fibrosa cystica, proximal muscle weakness, atrophy, hyperreflexia and gait disturbances. Patients were also recommended for surgery if they had at least one of the following: a serum calcium concentration of greater than 12 mg per dL, marked hypercalciuria, significant reduction in bone density or unexplained reduction in creatinine clearance, and were less than 50 years of age. Supplemental calcium was recommended for patients not undergoing surgery. After a baseline clinical evaluation and laboratory assessment, patients had repeat biochemical studies every four months. Patients who underwent parathyroidectomy were evaluated every six months.

Follow-up studies included measurements of serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels. Bone mineral density at the femoral neck, radius and lumbar spine was measured at baseline and every year. Among the cohort of 121 patients, 61 had surgery and 60 did not. The average age for the surgical and nonsurgical groups was 51 and 58 years, respectively. Ninety-one of the patients were women. Only 20 patients had symptoms of hyperparathyroidism. Of the 61 patients who had surgery, 49 were asymptomatic and 12 had symptoms. All of the surgical patients had normalization of biochemical markers after surgery. None of the patients with kidney stones had recurrences during the 10-year follow-up. Increases in bone mineral density were noted at all sites, but after one year, only changes for the femoral neck were significant.

Among the 60 patients who did not have surgery, eight were symptomatic and either refused surgery or had undergone previous unsuccessful surgery. None of these 60 patients showed significant changes from baseline in the various biochemical markers. For example, the mean serum calcium level was 10. 5 mg per dL at baseline and
10. 3 mg per dL at the 10-year follow-up. There were also no significant changes in bone mineral density or urinary calcium excretion among the 52 who were originally asymptomatic. During the 10-year follow-up, 14 of the 52 asymptomatic patients who did not undergo surgery showed signs of disease progression that became an indication for surgery. This included a serum calcium concentration of greater than 12 mg per dL in two patients, urinary calcium excretion greater than 400 mg per day in eight patients and a low cortical bone density in six patients.

### Diagnosis of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the third international workshop [^112xV7fq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common clinical problem. The purpose of this report is to guide the use of diagnostic tests for this condition in clinical practice.

Participants

Interested professional societies selected a representative for the consensus committee and provided funding for a one-day meeting. A subgroup of this committee set the program and developed key questions for review. Consensus was established at a closed meeting that followed. The conclusions were then circulated to the participating professional societies.

Evidence

Each question was addressed by a relevant literature search (on PubMed), and the data were presented for discussion at the group meeting.

Consensus Process

Consensus was achieved by a group meeting. Statements were prepared by all authors, with comments relating to accuracy from the diagnosis subgroup and by representatives from the participating professional societies.

Conclusions

We conclude that: 1) reference ranges should be established for serum PTH in vitamin D-replete healthy individuals; 2) second- and third-generation PTH assays are both helpful in the diagnosis of PHPT; 3) DNA sequence testing can be useful in familial hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia; 4) normocalcemic PHPT is a variant of the more common presentation of PHPT with hypercalcemia; 5) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels should be measured and, if vitamin D insufficiency is present, it should be treated as part of any management course; and 6) the estimated glomerular filtration rate should be used to determine the level of kidney function in PHPT: an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 ml/min.1.73 m2 should be a benchmark for decisions about surgery in established asymptomatic PHPT.

### New perspectives in the management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^1116jEy2]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a biochemical syndrome caused by the inappropriate or unregulated overproduction of parathyroid hormone, Leading to hypercalcae-mia. It was previously considered a relatively rare disorder, with clinical manifestations dominated by renal and/or bone disease. However, in modern times the diagnosis is most frequently recognized coincidentally on biochemical testing in patients evaluated for unrelated complaints. Parathyroidectomy is the only curative treatment for PHPT, with improved outcomes in symptomatic patients following this procedure. However, surgical intervention in patients with no clear clinical features remains controversial. The National Institutes for Health (NIH) have developed consensus guidelines giving specific indications for when surgery is recommended in patients with asymptomatic PHPT. This article examines the impact of treatment on asymptomatic PHPT, focusing on bone disease, neurocognitive function, quality of Life, cardiovascular disease and mortality. Medical treatment options, including bisphospho-nates and cinacalcet, are also discussed.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^114xjQLs]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate whether patients presenting with laboratory results consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) are managed in accordance with guidelines.

Methods

The laboratory database at a hospital in Sweden, serving 127,000 inhabitants, was searched for patients with biochemically determined pHPT. During 2014, a total of 365 patients with biochemical laboratory tests consistent with pHPT were identified. Patients with possible differential diagnoses or other reasons for not being investigated according to international guidelines were excluded after scrutinizing records, after new blood tests, and clinical assessments by endocrine surgeons.

Results

Altogether, 92 patients had been referred to specialists and 82 had not. The latter group had lower serum calcium (median 2.54 mmol/L) and PTH (5.7 pmol/L). Out of these 82 cases, 9 patients were diagnosed with pHPT or had some sort of long-term follow-up planned as outpatients.

Conclusion

Primary hyperparathyroidism is overlooked and underdiagnosed in a number of patients in the clinical setting. It is important to provide local guidelines for the management of patients presenting with mild pHPT to ensure that these patients receive proper evaluation and follow-up according to current research.

### Evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism: summary statement and guidelines from the fifth international workshop [^117YG2PD]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The last international guidelines on the evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) were published in 2014. Research since that time has led to new insights into epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, measurements, genetics, outcomes, presentations, new imaging modalities, target and other organ systems, pregnancy, evaluation, and management. Advances in all these areas are demonstrated by the reference list in which the majority of listings were published after the last set of guidelines. It was thus, timely to convene an international group of over 50 experts to review these advances in our knowledge. Four Task Forces considered: 1. Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, and Genetics; 2. Classical and Nonclassical Features; 3. Surgical Aspects; and 4. Management. For Task Force 4 on the Management of PHPT, Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology addressed surgical management of asymptomatic PHPT and non-surgical medical management of PHPT. The findings of this systematic review that applied GRADE methods to randomized trials are published as part of this series. Task Force 4 also reviewed a much larger body of new knowledge from observations studies that did not specifically fit the criteria of GRADE methodology. The full reports of these 4 Task Forces immediately follow this summary statement. Distilling the essence of all deliberations of all Task Force reports and Methodological reviews, we offer, in this summary statement, evidence-based recommendations and guidelines for the evaluation and management of PHPT. Different from the conclusions of the last workshop, these deliberations have led to revisions of renal guidelines and more evidence for the other recommendations. The accompanying papers present an in-depth discussion of topics summarized in this report. © 2022 The Authors.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^116kfTDD]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Biochemical testing of calcium and PTH is easily accessible across most of the world, and this contributes to an increased prevalence of patients diagnosed with biochemically mild pHPT. However, a biochemically mild profile does not guarantee mild symptoms. A large portion of patients who present with biochemically mild pHPT have symptoms at presentation, if these are properly searched for. It is still not clear which patients with mild and overtly asymptomatic pHPT will benefit from surgery, but some conservatively treated patients will develop a loss of cortical bone, progressive hypercalcaemia and neuropsychiatric symptoms.

The only definitive treatment is surgical removal of the diseased gland(s). According to the Scandinavian Quality Register for Thyroid, Parathyroid and Adrenal Surgery in 2014, 94% of patients are cured (defined as normalized serum levels of calcium and PTH) after undergoing a parathyroidectomy. Despite the low risk of complications with surgery, the often benign progress of pHPT makes it essential to carefully evaluate the risk profile of each individual before deciding to whom a parathyroidectomy should be offered. After differential diagnoses are excluded, information on the patient's symptoms, overt organ damage, comorbidity, current medications and age should be considered.

In Sweden, no firm guidelines exist on how to evaluate patients presenting with biochemically mild and overtly asymptomatic pHPT. The number of patients seen at the departments of endocrinology or endocrine surgery is not consistent with the presented prevalence of pHPT. This suggests that some patients with biochemically determined pHPT have not been evaluated by a specialist in endocrine surgery or endocrinology. Because of the lack of guidelines, these patients risk being incorrectly evaluated and followed up. If these patients do exist, their characteristics and symptoms, as well as the best way to handle these patients, have not yet been studied in a Swedish setting.

To conclude, the aim of this study was to investigate how patients presenting with laboratory results consistent with pHPT are managed in respect to referral to specialists and follow-up in a setting without firm local guidelines.

### A practical approach to hypercalcemia [^113ziSUT]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a disorder commonly encountered by primary care physicians. The diagnosis often is made incidentally in asymptomatic patients. Clinical manifestations affect the neuromuscular, gastrointestinal, renal, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems. The most common causes of hypercalcemia are primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy. Some other important causes of hypercalcemia are medications and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. An initial diagnostic work-up should include measurement of intact parathyroid hormone, and any medications that are likely to be causative should be discontinued. Parathyroid hormone is suppressed in malignancy-associated hypercalcemia and elevated in primary hyperparathyroidism. It is essential to exclude other causes before considering parathyroid surgery, and patients should be referred for parathyroidectomy only if they meet certain criteria. Many patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have a benign course and do not need surgery. Hypercalcemic crisis is a life-threatening emergency. Aggressive intravenous rehydration is the mainstay of management in severe hypercalcemia, and antiresorptive agents, such as calcitonin and bisphosphonates, frequently can alleviate the clinical manifestations of hypercalcemic disorders.

### Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: new issues and new questions – bridging the past with the future [^11266dkG]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2002). Low credibility.

The earliest clinical descriptions of PHPT pointed to an inexorably progressive disorder. Now, in many asymptomatic individuals who do not meet any surgical guidelines. PHPT in general, does not seem to be progressive. Most asymptomatic patients seem to remain asymptomatic over many years of observation. In those with major clinical manifestations, nephrolithiasis is by far the most common. In these patients, surgery is clearly indicated. Bone densitometry is an indispensable component of the evaluation as well as in monitoring because there is evidence of bone involvement in most patients. This contrasts with the skeletal X-ray, which is invariably negative. Nevertheless, patients with PHPT can show a bone mass measurement either at the cortical or cancellous skeleton that is more than 2 SDs below age- and sex-matched control subjects. Bone density, serum calcium concentration, and/or urinary calcium excretion per se can show evidence for progression in as many as 25% of patients with asymptomatic PHPT. There are newer pharmacologic approaches to PHPT that are the subject of intense investigation. The bisphosphonates and the calcimimetics show particular promise in this regard. Unanswered are such questions as whether the lower bone density in the milder patients will increase substantially as in those who undergo successful parathyroidectomy and whether fracture risk would therefore be reduced. Can medical therapy reduce serum calcium. parathyroid hormone levels, and other biochemical indices of PHPT? Can medical therapy improve bone density without the need for surgery. The issues outlined in this presentation and further amplified in other presentations given in this workshop lead to a series of questions that, in turn, may lead to modified guidelines for the management of these patients. The questions are as follows. (1) Should there be any changes in diagnostic criteria for PHPT? (2) Should the guidelines for surgery in PHPT be changed in light of new data over the past decade? What should those guidelines be? (3) At present, is there sufficient evidence of clinical benefit with specific medical therapies to recommend their use? In which patients? (4) Can some patients be followed without surgery? If so, how should they be monitored? (5) When surgery is the preferred option, what are the relative merits of minimally invasive procedures compared with more conventional surgery? (6) What is the role of localization techniques in identifying abnormal parathyroid tissue preoperatively and intraoperatively? Are they sufficiently helpful and cost effective to warrant their use in all patients who undergo parathyroid surgery? If not, in what patients should they be recommended? (7) What items should be placed on the research agenda for PHPT over the next decade?

### Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: a surgical perspective [^114zdmF4]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Since the advent of multichannel autoanalyzers and routine screening of serum calcium levels, prevalence of primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) has increased to between 0.1% and 0.4%. As more patients present with "asymptomatic" pHPT, ideal treatment of "mild" disease becomes more controversial, with the possibility of safe, nonoperative management in a selected group of patients. Accumulated evidence confirms that the majority of these patients suffer from vague, nonspecific complaints that are very real and can improve following parathyroidectomy. Furthermore, parathyroidectomy in patients with pHPT has been demonstrated to improve bone mineral density, reduce fracture risk, and improve health-related quality of life and possibly overall survival. Therefore, all patients with primary hyperparathyroidism should be referred for surgical evaluation by an experienced endocrine surgeon.

### Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: diagnostic pitfalls and surgical intervention [^116BqGBx]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common disease, with a prevalence as high as 1 in 400 women and 1 in 1000 men, and most are asymptomatic. Patients with PHPT have hypercalcemia with inappropriately normal levels of parathyroid hormone. Parathyroidectomy is the only curative therapy, and the procedure has become more common and more safe. Among asymptomatic patients, parathyroidectomy halts the progression of disease, improves quality of life, and may decrease risk of fracture and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Thus, surgery should be considered in all patients with asymptomatic PHPT who have minimal perioperative risk and sufficient life expectancy, regardless of chronologic age.

### The surgical management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the fourth international workshop [^115adJ2W]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The surgical management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) has undergone considerable advances over the past two decades. The purpose of this report is to review these advances.

Participants

This subgroup was constituted by the Steering Committee of the Fourth International Workshop on the Management of Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism to address key questions related to the surgical management of PHPT.

Evidence

Data since the last International Workshop were presented and discussed in detail. The topics included improvements in preoperative imaging, intraoperative adjuncts, refinements in local and regional anesthesia, and rapid intraoperative PTH assays.

Consensus Process

Questions were developed by the International Task Force on PHPT. A comprehensive literature search for relevant studies was undertaken. After extensive review and discussion, the subgroup agreed on what recommendations should be made to the Expert Panel regarding surgical approaches to parathyroidectomy.

Conclusions

1) All patients with PHPT who meet surgical criteria should be referred to an experienced endocrine surgeon to discuss the risks, benefits, and potential complications of surgery. 2) Patients who do not meet surgical criteria and in whom there are no medical contraindications to surgery may request a visit with an experienced endocrine surgeon. Alternatively, a multidisciplinary endocrine conference with surgeon involvement could be employed to address all relevant issues. 3) Imaging is not a diagnostic procedure; it is a localization procedure to help the surgeon optimize the operative plan. 4) The frequency of hereditary forms of PHPT may be underappreciated and needs to be assessed with increased vigilance. And 5) surgery is likely to benefit patients due to high cure rates, low complication rates, and the likelihood of reversing skeletal manifestations.

### Data-driven surgical referrals for primary hyperparathyroidism and associated surgical outcomes: a simulation study [^112D8ZeB]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

To minimize complications after parathyroidectomy, it is critical to connect patients with facilities equipped to perform this specialized procedure. This study assessed the effect of "referring" patients to higher-performing facilities for parathyroidectomy.

Methods

A simulation study of adults who underwent parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism was conducted using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient and Ambulatory Surgery and Services databases. Wilson score estimates were used to generate serious adverse event (SAE) rates for a training cohort to divide surgical facilities into quality quartiles. Using each facility's fixed effect from the regression model, this study simulated the difference in SAE and cost for each patient between treatment at their original facility and treatment at an alternative higher-quality facility based on a lower SAE rate. The set of potential alternative facilities was determined based on proximity or original facility health system affiliation.

Results

Of the 14,738 patients included in the proximity analysis 11,733 were randomized to the training group and 3005 to the testing cohort. The baseline characteristics and outcomes did not differ between the cohorts. Among the patients in the testing cohort, 314 were simulated to receive care at a higher-quality facility. The simulation predicted decreased SAE rates (2% vs. 3%; p < 0.001), with slightly increased total cost ($6391 vs. $6,351; p = 0.032). The results in the two simulations were similar.

Conclusions

Simulation indicated that data-driven parathyroidectomy referrals can reduce SAE and advance surgical health equity. Data-driven facility selection is one way to achieve better surgical outcomes.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: what is the role of parathyroid surgery? [^116eYUnq]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Successful surgery for nPHPT can yield significant benefits, including improvements in BMD and renal stone risk. However, there is evidence that suggests the magnitude of these improvements may be less in nPHPT patients compared with hPHPT patients. nPHPT can be more challenging to treat due to lower rates of pre-operative localisation, more patients requiring bilateral exploration and smaller but pathological multi-glandular disease. It provides further fuel to the adage that the most important factor is to localise a surgeon fluent in the disease and operative practice. Nonetheless, parathyroidectomy should be considered in patients with nPHPT, but it is important to assess and counsel patients individually to ensure appropriate expectations, even from technically successful parathyroidectomy.

### Data-driven surgical referrals for primary hyperparathyroidism and associated surgical outcomes: a simulation study [^113DLg5A]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, implementation of this approach would have required patient-centered discussions regarding the tradeoffs between a more proximate center and one with a higher likelihood of an improved clinical outcome. Given the heterogeneity of patients, the proposed changes in referrals may not be possible and should be viewed as an idealistic possibility. Further studies using more granular data should focus on the feasibility of optimizing referrals based on patient-specific limitations.

This simulation study demonstrated that higher-quality facilities are available to patients within a reasonable geographic region, which can lead to improved outcomes as measured by reduced medical events, technical events, and reoperation rates. Furthermore, optimizing referral practices does not have a significant impact on the financial cost to the institution while allowing patients to receive higher-quality care.

### What is the best way of assessing neurocognitive dysfunction in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism? [^116xxCdM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

The patient attending with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common occurrence in the outpatient endocrine setting. Indeed, more than 80% of contemporary PHPT patients are considered asymptomatic at diagnosis. A frequent question in clinical practice is at what stage may the patient be offered curative surgery. This may well relate to the duration and the degree of hypercalcemia, evidence of end-organ effects, and whether clear symptoms may or may not be attributable to the underlying condition.

Objective

There are well-recognized psychological and cognitive changes that can occur in the context of PHPT. A challenge for the clinician is to discern to what extent these symptoms may be present (often very close questioning is required) and how to measure and categorize them.

Interventions

Assessment can be difficult because patients who have PHPT tend to be more elderly, and they often have other overlapping comorbidities that may cloud the diagnosis. A decision then has to made as to whether such symptoms are likely to be a result of prolonged hypercalcemia, to what extent they can be attributed to the underlying disease, and whether they constitute sufficient weight to warrant surgical intervention in an otherwise "asymptomatic" patient. Practice tends to vary, and some clinicians may undertake watchful waiting or conservative management, whereas others may more readily push for surgical parathyroidectomy as a definitive treatment. We reviewed the literature on the subject of neuropsychological testing in the management of PHPT. POSITIONS: A controversy in clinical endocrinology is how to assess the cognitive, quality of life, and psychological effects of hypercalcemia. Multiple tools are being used, and significant changes have often been demonstrated in such parameters after parathyroidectomy.

Conclusions

We reviewed the latest studies on this subject and assessed the usefulness and validity of such tools in clinical practice, identifying several scores and measures that have been validated in clinical practice; comparisons are made with similar assessments such as the Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency Assessment questionnaire.

### Hyperparathyroidismen.wikipedia.org › wiki › hyperparathyroidism… [^112HfsJN]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

In 80% of cases, primary hyperparathyroidism is due to a single benign tumor known as a parathyroid adenoma. Most of the remainder are due to several of these adenomas. Very rarely it may be due to parathyroid cancer. Secondary hyperparathyroidism typically occurs due to vitamin D deficiency, chronic kidney disease, or other causes of low blood calcium. The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is made by finding elevated calcium and PTH in the blood. Primary hyperparathyroidism may only be cured by removing the adenoma or overactive parathyroid glands. In asymptomatic patients who present with mildly elevated blood calcium levels, with otherwise normal kidneys, and with normal bone density, monitoring may be all that is required. The medication cinacalcet may also be used to decrease PTH levels in those unable to have surgery although it is not a cure. In patients with very high blood calcium levels, treatment may include large amounts of intravenous normal saline.

Low vitamin D should be corrected in those with secondary hyperparathyroidism but low Vitamin D pre-surgery is controversial for those with primary hyperparathyroidism. Low vitamin D levels should be corrected post-parathyroidectomy. A history of acquired racquet nails may be indicative of bone resorption. Radiographically, hyperparathyroidism has a pathognomic finding of rugger jersey spine. Parathyroid adenomas are very rarely detectable on clinical examination. Surgical removal of a parathyroid tumor eliminates the symptoms in most patients. In secondary hyperparathyroidism due to lack of vitamin D absorption, the parathyroid gland is behaving normally; clinical problems are due to bone resorption and manifest as bone syndromes such as rickets, osteomalacia, and renal osteodystrophy. Thus, a third cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism is chronic kidney disease. Here the ability to manufacture 1, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D~3~ is compromised, resulting in hypocalcemia.

Diagnosis The gold standard of diagnosis is the PTH immunoassay. Once an elevated PTH has been confirmed, the goal of diagnosis is to determine the type of hyperparathyroidism by obtaining a serum calcium, phosphate, and PTH levels. Additionally a CT scan without contrast or renal ultrasound can be done to assess for nephrolithiasis and/or nephrocalcinosis if there is concern for it. Blood tests Intact PTH In primary hyperparathyroidism, parathyroid hormone levels are either elevated or "inappropriately normal" in the presence of elevated calcium. Typically, PTH levels vary greatly over time in the affected patient and must be retested several times to see the pattern. Serum phosphate In primary hyperparathyroidism, serum phosphate levels are abnormally low as a result of decreased reabsorption of phosphate in the kidney tubules. However, this is only present in about 50% of cases.

This contrasts with secondary hyperparathyroidism and tertiary hyperparathyroidism, in which serum phosphate levels are generally elevated because of kidney disease. Nuclear medicine Nuclear medicine imaging methods are used by surgeons to locate which parathyroid gland is responsible for hyperparathyroidism or to find ectopic parathyroid adenomas, most commonly found in the anterior mediastinum. Historically, technetium sestamibi scintigraphy was the main method used or this indication. Recently 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT tend to be more and more performed due to excellent diagnostic performance. Classification Primary Primary hyperparathyroidism results from a hyperfunction of the parathyroid glands themselves. The oversecretion of PTH is due to a parathyroid adenoma, parathyroid hyperplasia, or rarely, a parathyroid carcinoma.

### Surgery for asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the third international workshop [^1119hk9G]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Context

An international workshop on primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) was convened on May 13, 2008, to review and update the previous summary statement on the management of asymptomatic PHPT published in 2002.

Evidence Acquisition

Electronic literature sources were systematically reviewed, addressing critical aspects of the surgical issues pertaining to the indications, imaging, surgical treatment, and cost-effective management of patients with PHPT.

Evidence Synthesis

The surgical group concluded that many patients with "asymptomatic" PHPT have neurocognitive symptoms that may be unmasked after successful parathyroidectomy. Furthermore, reduced bone density and increased fracture risk can be improved with parathyroidectomy. When PHPT is symptomatic, it may be associated with nephrolithiasis, increased cardiovascular disease, and decreased survival. Preoperative imaging studies should only be performed to help plan the operation, and negative imaging should never preclude surgical referral. Noninvasive localization studies including ultrasound and sestamibi scans are often employed, especially in anticipation of focused explorations. Invasive localization studies should be reserved for remedial explorations where noninvasive imaging has been unsuccessful.

Conclusions

When performed by expert parathyroid surgeons, parathyroid surgery is safe, cost-effective, and associated with very low perioperative morbidity. Minimally invasive approaches to parathyroid surgery appear to be as effective as the classic bilateral cervical exploration approach.

### Parathyroidectomy for adults with primary hyperparathyroidism [^114yN9zD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), a disorder in which the parathyroid glands produce excessive amounts of parathyroid hormone, is most common in older adults and postmenopausal women. While most people with PHPT are asymptomatic at diagnosis, symptomatic disease can lead to hypercalcaemia, osteoporosis, renal stones, cardiovascular abnormalities and reduced quality of life. Surgical removal of abnormal parathyroid tissue (parathyroidectomy) is the only established treatment for adults with symptomatic PHPT to prevent exacerbation of symptoms and to be cured of PHPT. However, the benefits and risks of parathyroidectomy compared to simple observation or medical therapy for asymptomatic and mild PHPT are not well established.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of parathyroidectomy in adults with PHPT compared to simple observation or medical therapy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP from their date of inception until 26 November 2021. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing parathyroidectomy with simple observation or medical therapy for the treatment of adults with PHPT.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. cure of PHPT, 2. morbidity related to PHPT and 3. serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 1. all-cause mortality, 2. health-related quality of life and 3. hospitalisation for hypercalcaemia, acute renal impairment or pancreatitis. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We identified eight eligible RCTs that included 447 adults with (mostly asymptomatic) PHPT; 223 participants were randomised to parathyroidectomy. Follow-up duration varied from six months to 24 months. Of the 223 participants (37 men) randomised to surgery, 164 were included in the analyses, of whom 163 were cured at six to 24 months (overall cure rate 99%). Parathyroidectomy compared to observation probably results in a large increase in cure rate at six to 24 months follow-up: 163/164 participants (99.4%) in the parathyroidectomy group and 0/169 participants in the observation or medical therapy group were cured of their PHPT (8 studies, 333 participants; moderate certainty). No studies explicitly reported intervention effects on morbidities related to PHPT, such as osteoporosis, osteopenia, kidney dysfunction, urolithiasis, cognitive dysfunction or cardiovascular disease, although some studies reported surrogate outcomes for osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. A post-hoc analysis revealed that parathyroidectomy, compared to observation or medical therapy, may have little or no effect after one to two years on bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine (mean difference (MD) 0.03 g/cm 2 ,95% CI -0.05 to 0.12; 5 studies, 287 participants; very low certainty). Similarly, compared to observation, parathyroidectomy may have little or no effect on femoral neck BMD after one to two years (MD -0.01 g/cm 2, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.11; 3 studies, 216 participants; very low certainty). However, the evidence is very uncertain for both BMD outcomes. Furthermore, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of parathyroidectomy on improving left ventricular ejection fraction (MD -2.38%, 95% CI -4.77 to 0.01; 3 studies, 121 participants; very low certainty). Four studies reported serious adverse events. Three of these reported zero events in both the intervention and control groups; consequently, we were unable to include data from these three studies in the pooled analysis. The evidence suggests that parathyroidectomy compared to observation may have little or no effect on serious adverse events (RR 3.35, 95% CI 0.14 to 78.60; 4 studies, 168 participants; low certainty). Only two studies reported all-cause mortality. One study could not be included in the pooled analysis as zero events were observed in both the intervention and control groups. Parathyroidectomy compared to observation may have little or no effect on all-cause mortality, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 2.11, 95% CI 0.20 to 22.60; 2 studies, 133 participants; very low certainty). Three studies measured health-related quality of life using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and reported inconsistent differences in scores for different domains of the questionnaire between parathyroidectomy and observation. Six studies reported hospitalisations for the correction of hypercalcaemia. Two studies reported zero events in both the intervention and control groups and could not be included in the pooled analysis. Parathyroidectomy, compared to observation, may have little or no effect on hospitalisation for hypercalcaemia (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.25; 6 studies, 287 participants; low certainty). There were no reported hospitalisations for renal impairment or pancreatitis.

Authors' Conclusions

In accordance with the literature, our review findings suggest that parathyroidectomy, compared to simple observation or medical (etidronate) therapy, probably results in a large increase in cure rates of PHPT (with normalisation of serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels to laboratory reference values). Parathyroidectomy, compared with observation, may have little or no effect on serious adverse events or hospitalisation for hypercalcaemia, and the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of parathyroidectomy on other short-term outcomes, such as BMD, all-cause mortality and quality of life. The high uncertainty of evidence limits the applicability of our findings to clinical practice; indeed, this systematic review provides no new insights with regard to treatment decisions for people with (asymptomatic) PHPT. In addition, the methodological limitations of the included studies, and the characteristics of the study populations (mainly comprising white women with asymptomatic PHPT), warrant caution when extrapolating the results to other populations with PHPT. Large-scale multi-national, multi-ethnic and long-term RCTs are needed to explore the potential short- and long-term benefits of parathyroidectomy compared to non-surgical treatment options with regard to osteoporosis or osteopenia, urolithiasis, hospitalisation for acute kidney injury, cardiovascular disease and quality of life.

### The natural history of primary hyperparathyroidism with or without parathyroid surgery after 15 years [^114sutEN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) often presents without classical symptoms such as overt skeletal disease or nephrolithiasis. We previously reported that calciotropic indices and bone mineral density (BMD) are stable in untreated patients for up to a decade, whereas after parathyroidectomy, normalization of biochemistries and increases in BMD ensue.

Objective

The objective of the study was to provide additional insights in patients with and without surgery for up to 15 yr.

Design

The study had an observational design.

Setting

The setting was a referral center.

Patients

Patients included 116 patients (25 men, 91 women); 99 (85%) were asymptomatic.

Intervention

Fifty-nine patients (51%) underwent parathyroidectomy and 57 patients were followed up without surgery.

Main Outcome Measure

BMD was measured.

Results

Lumbar spine BMD remained stable for 15 yr. However, BMD started to fall at cortical sites even before 10 yr, ultimately decreasing by 10 ± 3% (mean ± sem; P < 0.05) at the femoral neck, and 35 ± 5%; P < 0.05 at the distal radius, in the few patients observed for 15 yr. Thirty-seven percent of asymptomatic patients showed disease progression (one or more new guidelines for surgery) at any time point over the 15 yr. Meeting surgical criteria at baseline did not predict who would have progressive disease. BMD increases in patients who underwent surgery were sustained for the entire 15 yr.

Conclusions

Parathyroidectomy led to normalization of biochemical indices and sustained increases in BMD. Without surgery, PHPT progressed in one third of individuals over 15 yr; meeting surgical criteria at the outset did not predict this progression. Cortical bone density decreased in the majority of subjects with additional observation time points and long-term follow-up. These results raise questions regarding how long patients with PHPT should be followed up without intervention.

Findings Initial evaluation should include 25-hydroxyvitamin D measurement, 24-hour urine calcium measurement, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and supplementation for vitamin D deficiency. Parathyroidectomy is indicated for all symptomatic patients, should be considered for most asymptomatic patients, and is more cost-effective than observation or pharmacologic therapy. Cervical ultrasonography or other high-resolution imaging is recommended for operative planning. Patients with nonlocalizing imaging remain surgical candidates. Preoperative parathyroid biopsy should be avoided. Surgeons who perform a high volume of operations have better outcomes. The possibility of multigland disease should be routinely considered. Both focused, image-guided surgery and bilateral exploration are appropriate operations that achieve high cure rates.

Conclusions and Relevance Evidence-based recommendations were created to assist clinicians in the optimal treatment of patients with pHPT. The surgical treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism has undergone extensive change in the past 2 decades. The presentation, diagnosis, and medical management have been previously addressed by an international workshop. 1–4 To meet the need for a detailed focus on operative management, the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons developed evidence-based guidelines to delineate the safe and effective practice of parathyroidectomy to achieve definitive treatment. Recommendation 1–3: In patients with suspected pHPT, a personal and family history should be taken. Patients with otherwise asymptomatic pHPT may have nephrocalcinosis or silent nephrolithiasis; both are indications for parathyroidectomy.

4 Recommendation 1–4: In patients with asymptomatic pHPT, abdominal imaging should be performed for detection of nephrocalcinosis or nephrolithiasis. Parathyroidectomy is the only definitive treatment of pHPT. Symptomatic patients are expected to derive clear benefits from curative parathyroidectomy, and patients considered to be asymptomatic frequently report improvement in quality-of-life indexes. 11–14 Observation and pharmacologic therapy are less effective and less cost-effective than surgery, even when the patient is considered asymptomatic. 15 Long-term hypercalcemia should be avoided because of potential deleterious effects. 16–18 Referral to an experienced parathyroid surgeon is advised to determine whether the likelihood and benefits of cure outweigh the anticipated risks of the procedure.

Quiz Ref IDRecommendation 3–1: Parathyroidectomy is indicated, and is the preferred treatment, for all patients with symptomatic pHPT. Recommendation 3–2: Parathyroidectomy is indicated when the serum calcium level is greater than 1 mg/dL above normal, regardless of whether objective symptoms are present or absent. Recommendation 3–3: Parathyroidectomy is indicated for objective evidence of renal involvement, including silent nephrolithiasis on renal imaging, nephrocalcinosis, hypercalciuria with increased stone risk, or impaired renal function. Primary hyperparathyroidism causes a decrease in BMD, most pronounced at cortical bone sites, such as the distal third of the radius.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^115q72UJ]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

A surprisingly large portion (n = 82) of the 365 patients with biochemically determined pHPT were not referred to specialists, despite the lack of differential diagnosis or other reasons to exclude the patient from treatment. However, eleven patients had a long-term plan of follow-up or were diagnosed with pHPT by the physician ordering the initial blood tests. A total of 42 patients underwent new blood sampling, and 32 of them still had an imbalance of calcium and PTH. Ultimately, 23 patients (28% of those not referred to a specialist) were formally diagnosed with pHPT by an endocrine surgeon.

It is important to remember that patients were excluded stepwise without further investigation. Thus, the number of patients with established pHPT but without proper medical management might be higher. Patients with mild pHPT will be subjected to further characterization regarding symptoms and complications due to pHPT, and the results will be published in a forthcoming report.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: what is the role of parathyroid surgery? [^116iHbJD]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is classically associated with both an elevated or 'inappropriately normal' parathyroid hormone (PTH) level and raised serum calcium. However, in clinical practice, increasing numbers of patients present with raised PTH but normal serum calcium, renal function and vitamin D; this is known as normocalcaemic PHPT (nPHPT). Studies investigating the clinical presentation of this condition have shown that patients may present with hypertension, nephrolithiasis, impaired glucose tolerance, osteoporosis and fragility fractures. The prevalence of such complications in nPHPT is similar to that in classical hypercalcaemic PHPT (hPHPT). Although the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have developed guidelines for the management of PHPT generally, a consensus is yet to be reached on the optimal management of nPHPT specifically. A review of the literature on parathyroidectomy in the treatment of nPHPT revealed that nPHPT patients were more likely to present with multi-glandular disease and significantly less nPHPT patients had an intra-operative PTH fall of > 50% compared with those with hPHPT. These findings demonstrate that patients with nPHPT are more likely to receive bilateral neck explorations and require remedial surgery compared with hPHPT patients. Following surgery, improvements in bone mineral density (BMD) and renal stones are generally observed in those with nPHPT. Where surgery is not possible, medical management with alendronate has been shown to be effective in nPHPT patients. Given the higher incidence of multi-gland disease and greater possibility of remedial surgery in nPHPT, careful consideration of risks and benefits should be made on an individualised basis and surgery should be performed by surgeons experienced in four gland exploration.

The prevalence of such complications in nPHPT is similar to that in classical hypercalcaemic PHPT (hPHPT). Although the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have developed guidelines for the management of PHPT generally, a consensus is yet to be reached on the optimal management of nPHPT specifically. A review of the literature on parathyroidectomy in the treatment of nPHPT revealed that nPHPT patients were more likely to present with multi-glandular disease and significantly less nPHPT patients had an intra-operative PTH fall of > 50% compared with those with hPHPT. These findings demonstrate that patients with nPHPT are more likely to receive bilateral neck explorations and require remedial surgery compared with hPHPT patients. Following surgery, improvements in bone mineral density (BMD) and renal stones are generally observed in those with nPHPT. Where surgery is not possible, medical management with alendronate has been shown to be effective in nPHPT patients. Given the higher incidence of multi-gland disease and greater possibility of remedial surgery in nPHPT, careful consideration of risks and benefits should be made on an individualised basis and surgery should be performed by surgeons experienced in four gland exploration.

### Parathyroidectomy in elderly individuals with primary hyperparathyroidism… [^113jYup3]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of chronic hypercalcemia. With advancing age, the incidence increases for both sexes, reaching 196 per 100 000 person-years for women and 95 per 100 000 person-years for men by 70 to 79 years of age. 1 Approximately 80% of individuals with PHPT initially lack symptoms such as nephrolithiasis, kidney dysfunction, gastrointestinal upset, and neuropsychiatric effects. However, even among asymptomatic individuals, PHPT accelerates bone turnover, predisposing them to osteoporosis and fragility fractures; the morbidity and mortality of these fractures are also most frequent among elderly individuals. 2 Surgery remains the only definitive treatment option for PHPT. However, the most recent National Institutes of Health consensus guidelines3 suggest that in the absence of symptomatic PHPT — serum calcium level more than 1 mg/dL above normal; evidence of osteoporosis or vertebral fractures; estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2; and/or hypercalciuria — surgery should only be considered when the asymptomatic individual is younger than 50 years.

### Current issues in hyperparathyroidism [^112PTuDo]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

There has been a shift in the referral patterns in recent years that has resulted in increasing numbers of patients being referred to surgeons with a diagnosis of hypercalcemia rather than primary hyperparathyroidism. The surgeon must perform a thorough history, including medications, and laboratory assessment, including serum calcium and parathyroid hormone measurements. A 24-hour urinary calcium excretion should be routinely ordered to exclude FHH. After the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is made, preoperative localization studies will benefit 78% to 90% of patients, with sestamibi scan being the most commonly used.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism in adults-(part I) assessment and medical management: position statement of the Endocrine Society of Australia, the Australian&New Zealand endocrine surgeons, and the Australian&New Zealand bone and mineral society [^113RT9pz]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To formulate clinical consensus recommendations on the presentation, assessment, and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in adults.

Methods

Representatives from relevant Australian and New Zealand Societies used a systematic approach for adaptation of guidelines (ADAPTE) to derive an evidence-informed position statement addressing nine key questions.

Results

PHPT is a biochemical diagnosis. Serum calcium should be measured in patients with suggestive symptoms, reduced bone mineral density or minimal trauma fractures, and in those with renal stones. Other indications are detailed in the manuscript. In patients with hypercalcaemia, intact parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, phosphate, and renal function should be measured. In established PHPT, assessment of bone mineral density, vertebral fractures, urinary tract calculi/nephrocalcinosis and quantification of urinary calcium excretion is warranted. Parathyroidectomy is the only definitive treatment and is warranted for all symptomatic patients and should be considered for asymptomatic patients without contraindications to surgery and with > 10 years life expectancy. In patients who do not undergo surgery, we recommend annual evaluation for disease progression. Where the diagnosis is not clear or the risk-benefit ratio is not obvious, multidisciplinary discussion and formulation of a consensus management plan is appropriate. Genetic testing for familial hyperparathyroidism is recommended in selected patients.

Conclusions

These clinical consensus recommendations were developed to provide clinicians with contemporary guidance on the assessment and management of PHPT in adults. It is anticipated that improved health outcomes for individuals and the population will be achieved at a decreased cost to the community.

### Clinical review: parathyroid localization and implications for clinical management [^11723FS3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical Context

The prevalence of hyperparathyroidism, especially primary hyperparathyroidism, has increased in recent decades due to improvements in diagnostic techniques with a corresponding surge in parathyroid surgery, leading to the development of focused, minimally invasive surgical approaches. Focused parathyroidectomy is predicated on preoperative localization of suspected parathyroid pathology. As a result, there has been a proliferation of parathyroid imaging modalities and protocols, resulting in confusion about their indications and applications.

Evidence Acquisition

Bibliographies from clinical trials and review articles published since 2000 were reviewed and supplemented with targeted searches using biomedical databases. We also employed our extensive clinical experience.

Evidence Synthesis

The best-studied modalities for parathyroid localization are nuclear scintigraphy and sonography and are widely applied as initial studies. Multiple variations exist, and several additional noninvasive imaging techniques, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance, are described. The exquisite anatomical detail of 4-dimensional computed tomography must be balanced with significant radiation exposure to the thyroid gland. Invasive venous PTH sampling and parathyroid arteriography have important roles in remedial cases. Due to considerable heterogeneity in imaging, multidisciplinary collaboration between endocrinologists, surgeons, and radiologists is beneficial.

Conclusions

Parathyroid localization is indicated in surgical candidates. Crucial considerations when selecting an imaging study include availability, cost, radiation exposure, local expertise, and accuracy. Additional factors include the patient's anticipated pathology and whether it is de novo or refractory disease. An approach to imaging for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism is presented.

### Management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^112EhSbW]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Since the last international guidelines were published in 2014 on the evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), new information has become available with regard to evaluation, diagnosis, epidemiology, genetics, classical and nonclassical manifestations, surgical and nonsurgical approaches, and natural history. To provide the most current summary of these developments, an international group, consisting of over 50 experts in these various aspects of PHPT, was convened. This paper provides the results of the task force that was assigned to review the information on the management of PHPT. For this task force on the management of PHPT, two questions were the subject of systematic reviews using the Gradingof Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology. The full report addressing surgical and nonsurgical management of PHPT, utilizing the GRADE methodology, is published separately in this series. In this report, we summarize the results of that methodological review and expand them to encompass a much larger body of new knowledge that did not specifically fit the criteria of the GRADE methodology. Together, both the systematic and narrative reviews of the literature, summarized in this paper, give the most complete information available to date. A panel of experts then considered the last set of international guidelines in light of the newer data and assessed the need for their revision. This report provides the evidentiary background to the guidelines report. In that report, evidence from all task forces is synthesized into a summary statement and revised guidelines for the evaluation and management of PHPT. © 2022 The Authors.

### What medical options should be considered for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism? [^115Ndujv]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common, often asymptomatic, endocrine disorder characterized by hypercalcaemia in the face of a nonsuppressed parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. For those with symptomatic disease or who meet surgical criteria, parathyroidectomy is the treatment of choice. However, those patients who do not meet surgical criteria or who cannot undergo or refuse surgery must be managed medically. Medical management of PHPT involves continual assessment to determine who will benefit from surgical intervention, replacement of vitamin D, treatment of parathyroid bone disease and management of hypercalcaemia and renal stone disease.

### Surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism: are the consensus guidelines being followed? [^113TFsW3]. Annals of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine parathyroidectomy (PTx) rates in patients who satisfy the consensus guidelines for surgical treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT).

Background

Surgery for PHPT is recommended for all symptomatic patients and select asymptomatic patients meeting established consensus criteria. Adherence to the consensus guidelines has not been examined systematically, because of inadequate information regarding patients managed nonoperatively.

Methods

All nonuremic patients with PHPT during the period 1995–2008 were identified using the Kaiser Permanente-Southern California laboratory database, encompassing 3.5 million individuals annually. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine predictors of PTx.

Results

We found 3388 patients with PHPT, of whom 265 (8%) were symptomatic (nephrolithiasis). Nephrolithiasis was predictive of PTx (OR 2.94 vs asymptomatic), with 51% of symptomatic patients undergoing surgery. Among asymptomatic patients, the proportion meeting consensus criteria was 39% during the early period (1995–2002) and 51% during the late period (2003–2008). The PTx rate for these patients exceeded that for asymptomatic patients not meeting consensus criteria but remained low (early 44% vs 19%, P < 0.0001; late 39% vs 16%, P < 0.0001). The following individual criteria were predictive of PTx: calcium > 11.5 mg/dL (OR 2.27), hypercalciuria (OR 3.28, P < 0.0001), and age < 50 years (OR 1.54, P < 0.0001). However, the absolute PTx rates associated with satisfaction of these criteria were in the 50% range. Bone density scores did not influence likelihood of PTx and renal impairment predicted against PTx (OR 0.35, P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

The consensus guidelines regarding PHPT have not been followed in our study population. PTx appears to be underutilized in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients.

### Data-driven surgical referrals for primary hyperparathyroidism and associated surgical outcomes: a simulation study [^1169ebg6]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study simulated how data-driven referral patterns for patients with PHPT requiring parathyroidectomy could impact surgical outcomes. Both methods of simulation showed a reduced rate of SAE and medical events when patients were sent to higher-performing facilities for care despite increased comorbidities in the patient population. Cost was statistically higher, but not meaningfully different, when patient referrals were permitted across facilities regardless of health system affiliations but restricted by travel distance. No differences in cost were observed when referrals were restricted to facilities within the same health system. Taken together, data-driven surgical referrals at both the regional and health system level may improve outcomes for parathyroidectomy.

Referral patterns for parathyroidectomy have varied over time as the practice of medicine has evolved. The 21st century has shown a shift toward performance of parathyroidectomy for PHPT within an ambulatory setting, with the majority of operations currently performed without inpatient stays. Patients typically are sent to a surgeon by their primary care physician, but may be referred by a specialist such as an endocrinologist. Among surveyed endocrinologists, factors that determined their surgeon of choice included the surgeon's outcomes, volume, and communication style, both with the referring provider and previous patients.

### Invited commentary: "Risk of neuropsychiatric disorders in primary hyperparathyroidism: parathyroidectomy versus nonoperative management" [^1121eCd6]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgical treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) has traditionally prioritized "bones and stones" over "moans and groans". As widespread routine biochemical testing and screening for osteoporosis becomes commonplace, more patients with "asymptomatic" or "minimally symptomatic" disease are being diagnosed. Strong indications for surgery remain confined to young patients and those with established osteoporosis or renal calculi. There remains some reluctance to refer patients for surgery where disease is "asymptomatic" particularly in those aged > 50 years. Current guidelines focus on biochemical cure and longer‐term improvements in bone mineral density and reduction in renal calculi as measures of success following surgery.

From the patient perspective, the most concerning symptoms are often the "nonspecific symptoms" of PHPT. These include anxiety, depression, fatigue, cognitive decline, aches, and pains. Improvements in these "nonspecific symptoms" are well‐documented following surgery and can be measured by both validated disease‐specific patient‐reported outcome measures (PROMs) and correlated with global health‐related quality of life scores. As clinicians, it is difficult to predict the degree to which any individual patient will benefit from surgery particularly regarding neurocognitive symptoms. Why one patient bounds back into the clinic after surgery and another is disappointed at the lack of improvement in symptoms is not fully understood. Longer‐term data on neurocognitive symptom change and the development of neuropsychiatric diagnoses after parathyroidectomy is lacking.

### Clinical management of primary hyperparathyroidism and thresholds for surgical referral: a national study examining concordance between practice patterns and consensus panel recommendations [^115ujVV8]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether 1990 guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for the optimal management (surgical versus nonsurgical) of patients with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) are known and followed by endocrinologists.

Methods

We surveyed endocrinologists in the United States who were randomly selected in 1998 from two endocrine societies. Endocrinologists were asked about management of asymptomatic patients with PHPT, awareness of NIH recommendations, practice demographics, and annual PHPT case volume. We classified endocrinologists into either low-volume (< 12 cases of PHPT per year) or high-volume (≥ 12 cases per year) physicians.

Results

Of 374 eligible physicians, 146 (39%) responded to our survey. In comparison with nonrespondents, respondents were of similar age, sex, years in practice, and geographic location profiles; this finding suggested minimal nonresponse bias. More high-volume physicians than low-volume physicians were aware of the NIH guidelines (75% versus 50%; P < 0.01). Management of asymptomatic patients was similar between volume groups; overall, 39% of patients were referred for surgical treatment. Nevertheless, considerable variation in management existed; 7% of all physicians referred ≥ 90% of their asymptomatic patients for surgical treatment, whereas 31% referred ≤ 10%. Adherence to monitoring guidelines for nonsurgically managed patients ranged widely, depending on the specific recommendation (from 6% of physicians obtaining creatinine clearance assessments every 6 months to 78% of physicians ordering serum calcium measurements every 6 months). Surgical referral practices also varied substantially, with 25% of all physicians referring a 40-year-old patient with PHPT when hypercalcemia was mild (≤ 1 mg/dL above normal), 39% when hypercalcemia was moderate, and 31% when hypercalcemia was severe (> 1.5 mg/dL above normal). Of the responding physicians, 4% reported that hypercalcemia alone was not sufficient justification to refer a patient for surgical intervention. Higher PHPT case volume was not associated with differences in surgical referral.

Conclusion

Suboptimal awareness of the 1990 NIH panel recommendations and the substantial variation in clinical management of PHPT indicate that newer NIH guidelines developed in 2002 must be more widely disseminated and strongly recommended if practice patterns are to be influenced and clinical outcomes improved.

### Contemporary management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^115Gbaya]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism can be asymptomatic or symptomatic, as well as classic, normocalcemic, or normohormonal. It is important to rule out other causes of hypercalcemia or hyperparathyroidism. Preoperative localization with imaging is necessary for a minimally invasive approach and can be helpful even if planning 4-gland exploration. There are a variety of intraoperative techniques that can assist with localization as well as confirming success. Standard of care remains surgical resection of affected glands. However, there are less invasive management strategies that can be considered for poor surgical candidates.

### Approach to the patient with persistent or recurrent primary hyperparathyroidism [^115Lpvp7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Reoperative parathyroid surgery may be required in patients who have persistent primary hyperparathyroidism after an unsuccessful operation and in patients who had an initially successful exploration but develop recurrent disease at an interval greater than 6 months postoperatively. Additionally, patients who have had significant surgery in the cervical region, particularly total thyroidectomy, should be considered in this group because they pose identical technical challenges that in the past have resulted in suboptimal cure and complication rates. These patients require a meticulous review of their historical, biochemical, imaging, and operative data to confirm the diagnosis, to evaluate the possibility of familial forms of hyperparathyroidism, and to confirm the indications for surgery. Once a patient is deemed an appropriate surgical candidate, sequential imaging is required to yield a roadmap to guide surgical intervention. These reoperative procedures require an experienced parathyroid surgeon armed with intraoperative adjuncts to locate the offending parathyroid gland(s) and remove them while minimizing collateral injury, particularly to the recurrent laryngeal nerves. These patients are also at increased risk of postoperative hypocalcemia that can be life-threatening. Despite these concerns, an experienced endocrine team can diagnose persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism, localize residual abnormal parathyroid glands, and perform surgical intervention with success and complication profiles that approximate those achieved in the unexplored patient.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is caused by the overproduction of parathyroid hormone by 1 or more parathyroid glands resulting in hypercalcemia and its downstream clinical consequences. The definitive management of PHPT is surgery. Approaches to successful surgery include bilateral exploration or focused parathyroidectomy with intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring, which in experienced hands are both associated with a low risk of complications.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: an update on diagnostic and management challenges [^114Tu7pc]. Clinical Endocrinology (2020). Medium credibility.

Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition that can present with intermittent hypercalcemia or may evolve into hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism. This milder biochemical entity remains incompletely understood because of a lack of long-term health outcomes regarding both medical and surgical approaches to its management. Medical therapies have shown some efficacy. A limited number of studies have found that bisphosphonates increase bone mineral density, and calcimimetics may decrease the risk of nephrolithiasis in patients with normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism. Studies have also described patient outcomes after applying the same surgical criteria used for patients with hypercalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism to those with the normocalcaemic form of the disease. These studies suggest that parathyroid surgery appears to be effective in normalizing elevated serum parathyroid hormone concentrations and decreasing adverse renal and skeletal outcomes in patients with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism. Given the available data and overall lack of consensus regarding the optimal management of these patients, a reasonable approach is to tailor treatment to the individual patient by considering their risk factors for new or accelerated bone loss, kidney stones, diminished quality of life, and cardiovascular disease.

### Management of primary hyperparathyroidism: historical and contemporary perspectives [^1117XBS1]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a frequently diagnosed endocrine condition most commonly caused by a single parathyroid adenoma. Our understanding of the epidemiology and management of PHPT have evolved in the past few decades. Asymptomatic PHPT has been the most common presentation in developed countries since the advent of routine biochemical screening. Symptomatic disease is now also decreasing in developing nations. Normocalcemic PHPT is a newer phenotype that can be diagnosed in the setting of elevated PTH concentrations with persistently normal serum calcium, however, evaluation for secondary causes of hyperparathyroidism is critical as it is a diagnosis of exclusion. Genetic testing can be helpful in patients younger than 30 years of age and/or patients with intermediate or equivocal ranges of the urinary calcium to creatinine ratio (between 0.01 and 0.02) to differentiate PHPT from FHH and to evaluate for other genetic etiologies that may affect management. Surgery is the recommended treatment modality for symptomatic PHPT, and patients with asymptomatic PHPT meeting recommended criteria should also be considered for parathyroidectomy. "Asymptomatic" patients should be screened for the presence of nephrolithiasis and/or vertebral fracture, since many will be reclassified as having symptomatic disease with further investigation. For poor surgical candidates or patients not meeting criteria for surgery, medical therapy includes cinacalcet for hypercalcemia and antiresorptive therapies for osteoporosis.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^113dWWvX]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To review primary hyperparathyroidism and the key issues that are relevant to the practicing endocrinologist.

Methods

The latest information on the presentation, diagnosis, and traditional and nontraditional aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism is reviewed.

Results

The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is straightforward when the traditional hypercalcemic patient is documented to have an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. Commonly, patients are identified who have normal serum calcium levels but elevated PTH levels in whom no secondary causes for hyperparathyroidism can be confirmed. Traditional target organs of primary hyperparathyroidism-the skeleton and the kidneys-continue to be a focus in the patient evaluation. Bone mineral density shows a typical pattern of involvement with the distal one-third radius being selectively reduced compared with the lumbar spine in which bone mineral density is generally well maintained. Neurocognitive and cardiovascular aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism, while a focus of recent interest, have not been shown to definitively aid in the decision for or against surgery. The recommendation for surgery in primary hyperparathyroidism is based on guidelines that focus on the serum calcium level, renal function, bone mineral density, and age. In patients who do not meet guidelines, a nonsurgical management approach has merit.

Conclusions

Primary hyperparathyroidism is continuing to show changes in its clinical profile, with normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism being a topic of great interest. Skeletal and renal features of primary hyperparathyroidism drive, in most cases, the decision to recommend surgery. In patients who do not meet any criteria for surgery, a conservative approach with appropriate monitoring is acceptable.

### Guidelines for the management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: summary statement from the fourth international workshop [^111dqGvZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is routinely encountered in clinical practices of endocrinology throughout the world. This report distills an update of current information about diagnostics, clinical features, and management of this disease into a set of revised guidelines.

Participants

Participants, representing an international constituency, with interest and expertise in various facets of asymptomatic PHPT constituted four Workshop Panels that developed key questions to be addressed. They then convened in an open 3-day conference September 19–21, 2013, in Florence, Italy, when a series of presentations and discussions addressed these questions. A smaller subcommittee, the Expert Panel, then met in closed session to reach an evidence-based consensus on how to address the questions and data that were aired in the open forum.

Evidence

Preceding the conference, each question was addressed by a relevant, extensive literature search. All presentations and deliberations of the Workshop Panels and the Expert Panel were based upon the latest information gleaned from this literature search.

Consensus Process

The expert panel considered all the evidence provided by the individual Workshop Panels and then came to consensus.

Conclusion

In view of new findings since the last International Workshop on the Management of Asymptomatic PHPT, guidelines for management have been revised. The revised guidelines include: 1) recommendations for more extensive evaluation of the skeletal and renal systems; 2) skeletal and/or renal involvement as determined by further evaluation to become part of the guidelines for surgery; and 3) more specific guidelines for monitoring those who do not meet guidelines for parathyroid surgery. These guidelines should help endocrinologists and surgeons caring for patients with PHPT. A blueprint for future research is proposed to foster additional investigation into issues that remain uncertain or controversial.

### Subclinical and asymptomatic parathyroid disease: implications of emerging data [^1167SxAw]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism, a disorder in which there is a tendency for hypercalcaemia caused by autonomous overproduction of parathyroid hormone, is common, especially in postmenopausal women. Although parathyroidectomy is indicated for symptomatic patients, most individuals with the disorder are asymptomatic and without classic complications, such as renal stones and osteoporosis, at diagnosis. Consensus guidelines suggest which individuals might be suitable for medical follow-up rather than parathyroidectomy, but there are no long-term randomised controlled trials to support the safety of medical surveillance, and some patients progress with time. Data from observational studies suggest that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are increased in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, and might be predicted by parathyroid hormone concentrations, even in individuals with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism. Whether parathyroidectomy improves cardiovascular outcomes in patients with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism is unproven, but data suggest that surgery decreases fracture risk and might improve neuropsychological symptoms. Studies also show that patients with normocalcaemic (subclinical) hyperparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism have a low risk of progression to overt disease, but their long-term risks are not defined. In this Review, we explore the increasing range of asymptomatic parathyroid disorders, focusing on current evidence about their natural history and potential complications, with a particular emphasis on primary hyperparathyroidism.

- serum calcium ≥ 1 mg/dL (≥ 0.25 mmol/L) above the ULN

- skeletal involvement, such as a fracture identified by vertebral fracture assessment or vertebral X-ray, or bone mineral density with a T-score ≤ -2.5 at any site

- renal involvement, such as eGFR or CrCl < 60 mL/min, nephrocalcinosis or nephrolithiasis identified by X-ray, ultrasound, or other imaging modality, or hypercalciuria (> 250 mg/day in women; > 300 mg/day in men)

- age < 50 years (no other indications are necessary; age < 50 years is a sufficient indication).

### Methodology for the guidelines on evaluation and management of hypoparathyroidism and primary hyperparathyroidism [^114jRBXb]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

To develop guidelines for hypoparathyroidism and primary hyperparathyroidism, the panel assembled a panel of experts in parathyroid disorders, general endocrinologists, representatives of the Hypoparathyroidism Association, and systematic review and guideline methodologists. The guideline panel referred to a formal process following the Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) methodology to issue GRADEd recommendations. In this approach, panelists and methodologists formatted the questions, conducted systematic reviews, evaluated risk of bias, assessed certainty of evidence, and presented a summary of findings in a transparent fashion. For most recommendations, the task forces used a less structured approach largely based on narrative reviews to issue non-GRADEd recommendations. The panel issued Eight GRADEd recommendations (seven for hypoparathyroidism and one for hyperparathyroidism).

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^112Pn7Py]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in the outpatient setting. Phenotypically, it has evolved from a disease of overt symptomatology to one of vague complaints and biochemical diagnosis. Preoperative localization and intraoperative parathyroid hormone have revolutionized the surgical management of these patients. Minimally invasive operations are now common worldwide with low morbidity and high patient satisfaction.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^114guUzo]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

In this Review, we describe the pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), with a focus on recent advances in the field. PHPT is a common endocrine disorder that is characterized by hypercalcaemia and elevated or inappropriately normal serum levels of parathyroid hormone. Most often, the presentation of PHPT is asymptomatic in regions of the world where serum levels of calcium are routinely measured. In addition to mild hypercalcaemia, PHPT can manifest with osteoporosis and hypercalciuria as well as with vertebral fractures and nephrolithiasis, both of which can be asymptomatic. Other clinical forms of PHPT, such as classical disease and normocalcaemic PHPT, are less common. Parathyroidectomy, the only curative treatment for PHPT, is recommended in patients with symptoms and those with asymptomatic disease who are at risk of progression or have subclinical evidence of end-organ sequelae. Parathyroidectomy results in an increase in BMD and a reduction in nephrolithiasis. Various medical therapies can increase BMD or reduce serum levels of calcium, but no single drug can do both. More data are needed regarding the neuropsychological manifestations of PHPT and the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to sporadic PHPT, as well as on risk factors for complications of the disorder. Future work that advances our knowledge in these areas will improve the management of the disorder.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism in adults-(part II) surgical management and postoperative follow-up: position statement of the Endocrine Society of Australia, the Australian&New Zealand endocrine surgeons, and the Australian&New Zealand bone and mineral society [^1146PExw]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence-based recommendations to guide the surgical management and postoperative follow-up of adults with primary hyperparathyroidism.

Methods

Representatives from relevant Australian and New Zealand Societies used a systematic approach for adaptation of guidelines (ADAPTE) to derive an evidence-informed position statement addressing eight key questions.

Results

Diagnostic imaging does not determine suitability for surgery but can guide the planning of surgery in suitable candidates. First-line imaging includes ultrasound and either parathyroid 4DCT or scintigraphy, depending on local availability and expertise. Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy is appropriate in most patients with concordant imaging. Bilateral neck exploration should be considered in those with discordant/negative imaging findings, multi-gland disease and genetic/familial risk factors. Parathyroid surgery, especially re-operative surgery, has better outcomes in the hands of higher volume surgeons. Neuromonitoring is generally not required for initial surgery but should be considered for re-operative surgery. Following parathyroidectomy, calcium and parathyroid hormone levels should be re-checked in the first 24h and repeated early if there are risk factors for hypocalcaemia. Eucalcaemia at 6 months is consistent with surgical cure; parathyroid hormone levels do not need to be re-checked in the absence of other clinical indications. Longer-term surveillance of skeletal health is recommended.

Conclusions

This position statement provides up-to-date guidance on evidence-based best practice surgical and postoperative management of adults with primary hyperparathyroidism.

### Presentation of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the third international workshop [^115LUeaS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Background

At the Third International Workshop on Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in May 2008, recent data on the disease were reviewed. We present the results of a literature review on issues arising from the clinical presentation and natural history of PHPT.

Methods

Questions were developed by the International Task Force on PHPT. A comprehensive literature search for relevant studies was reviewed, and the questions of the International Task Force were addressed by the Consensus Panel.

Conclusions

1) Data on the extent and nature of cardiovascular involvement in those with mild disease are too limited to provide a complete picture. 2) Patients with mild PHPT have neuropsychological complaints. Although some symptoms may improve with surgery, available data remain inconsistent on their precise nature and reversibility. 3) Surgery leads to long-term gains in spine, hip, and radius bone mineral density (BMD). Because some patients have early disease progression and others lose BMD after 8–10 yr, regular monitoring (serum calcium and three-site BMD) is essential in those followed without surgery. Patients may present with normocalcemic PHPT (normal serum calcium with elevated PTH concentrations; no secondary cause for hyperparathyroidism). Data on the incidence and natural history of this phenotype are limited. 4) In the absence of kidney stones, data do not support the use of marked hypercalciuria (> 10 mmol/d or 400 mg/d) as an indication for surgery for patients. 5) Patients with bone density T-score -2.5 or less at the lumbar spine, hip, or distal one third radius should have surgery.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^113qk2jF]. The Oncologist (2007). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is classically thought of as the somatic manifestation of hypercalcemia in which patients suffer from a variety of complaints including abdominal pain, nephrolithiasis, osteopenia, and mental status changes. Contemporary PHPT patients are generally free of somatic manifestations and are most often diagnosed when routine biochemical testing shows an elevated serum calcium level. The modern day patient may present with much more subtle neurocognitive symptoms including fatigue, lethargy, muscle weakness, depression, and cognitive impairment. Advances in imaging technology, intraoperative parathyroid hormone measurement, and surgical technique now allow parathyroidectomy to be performed using a focused approach without the absolute need of a four-gland exploration. Minimally invasive techniques allow the procedure to be accomplished under local anesthesia on an outpatient basis. This brief review summarizes the presentation, biochemical evaluation, operative intervention, and follow-up care of the modern day PHPT patient.

### Parathyroidectomy… [^116neLKp]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Parathyroidectomy is the surgical removal of one or more of the four parathyroid glands. This procedure is used to remove an adenoma or hyperplasia of these glands when they are producing excessive parathyroid hormone: hyperparathyroidism. The glands are usually four in number and located adjacent to the posterior surface of the thyroid gland, but their exact location is variable. When an elevated PTH level is found, a sestamibi scan or an ultrasound may be performed in order to confirm the presence and location of abnormal parathyroid tissue. Indications The main indication for parathyroidectomy is primary hyperparathyroidism, a condition in which one or more of the parathyroid glands produce excessive parathyroid hormone.

Not all cases of primary hyperparathyroidism require surgery, but it is recommended if the condition causes significant symptoms or if it affects the kidneys or bone health, and also in people under 50 even if they do not have symptoms. It is not always possible to anticipate if a parathyroid tumor is malignant. Any suspicion of parathyroid carcinoma is therefore also an indication for surgery. Parathyroidectomy may also be required in secondary hyperparathyroidism. This situation arises mainly in people with severe chronic kidney disease in which the parathyroid glands are overactive to compensate for the low calcium and vitamin D levels often present in CKD. In many cases, the parathyroid hormone production improves when these abnormalities are treated with medication.

A small proportion, however, have persistently raised hormone levels six months after treatment has started, thought to be autonomous production of hormone by the glands and loss of feedback mechanisms. In this situation surgical parathyroidectomy may be required, especially if calcium and phosphate levels remain elevated, there is calcium deposition in the wall of blood vessels or there is worsening bone disease. In people on dialysis, parathyroidectomy can improve their survival. It does appear that the procedure may be underused. Procedure The operation requires a general anesthetic or a local anesthetic. The surgeon makes an incision around an inch long in the neck just under the larynx, and locates the offending parathyroid glands. Preoperative testing using sestamibi scanning can help identify the location of glands.

It can also be used to limit the extent of surgical exploration when used in conjunction with intraoperative PTH hormone monitoring. The particular problem or disease process will determine how many of the parathyroid glands are removed. Some parathyroid tissue must be left in place to help prevent hypoparathyroidism. Recovery after the operation tends to be swift. The PTH level is back to normal within 10–15 minutes, and can be confirmed by intraoperative rapid assessment during the operation. However, the remaining parathyroid glands may take hours to several weeks to return to their normal functioning levels. Calcium supplements are therefore often required to prevent symptoms of hypocalcemia and to restore lost bone mass. The patient is placed in a semi-Fowler position and the neck is extended. An abbreviated Kocher incision is made and the platysma muscle is dissected horizontally. The strap muscles are released off of the thyroid gland.

### Outpatient management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^117X9ag9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in an outpatient setting. Most patients are asymptomatic with mild hypercalcemia and only require periodic follow-up. Symptomatic patients and those with end-organ damage should undergo surgery according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines. No medical therapy has been approved for treatment of this disorder. Treatment with bisphosphonate, calcimimetic drugs, or alcohol ablation techniques has been used in select patients.

MEN1 primary hyperparathyroidism — sporadic PHPT surgical thresholds and MEN1-specific considerations are as follows: In sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), surgery by an experienced parathyroid surgeon is recommended for patients who are < 50 years of age, have significant hypercalcemia (> 1 mg/dL [0.25 mmol/L] above the upper limit of normal) or hypercalciuria (> 250 mg/day in women and > 300 mg/day in men), have an eGFR < 60 mL/min, and/or have skeletal or renal complications; in MEN1, there is a special concern of hypergastrinemia associated with hypercalcemia, and the timing of surgical intervention is less clear in PHPT associated with MEN1.

### Indications for surgical management of hyperparathyroidism: a review [^117Qrz1b]. JAMA Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is a common clinical entity, with approximately 100 000 new cases diagnosed each year in the United States. Most patients with pHPT have a relatively mild form of the disease and present with few if any overt signs or symptoms. This has led to a dilemma regarding which patients should be considered for parathyroid surgery. In this article, we review the established literature on the indications for surgery in asymptomatic pHPT and discuss the most recent consensus conference guidelines.

Observations

The reviewed literature suggests that there were improved outcomes among patients with asymptomatic pHPT who underwent curative surgery.

Conclusions and Relevance

Most patients with pHPT should be considered for parathyroidectomy. More randomized clinical trials are needed to strongly support a surgical recommendation for all asymptomatic patients with pHPT.

### The landmark series: management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^115o2tun]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgery is the only definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). The surgical management of PHPT has evolved over the past several decades in response to the continually growing body of evidence supporting its effectiveness in both symptomatic and asymptomatic disease. As imaging modalities for localization, operative approach, and intraoperative adjuncts, such as intraoperative parathyroid hormone testing, have been optimized, careful evaluation of the timing of parathyroidectomy in relationship to the disease's natural history has been pursued to limit the detrimental end-organ effects of untreated PHPT. Herein, we review select studies examining key aspects of PHPT management fundamental to the practicing surgical oncologist and endocrine surgeon caring for patients with PHPT.

### Streamlining health care access for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism: a quality improvement pilot program [^113hWnro]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Patients with hyperparathyroidism (HPT) are typically referred to endocrinology for initial evaluation, often with prolonged wait times. We introduced a pilot program that triaged primary HPT (pHPT) patients directly into endocrine surgery clinic, bypassing endocrinology, to evaluate the difference in time between referral and appointment for endocrine surgery versus endocrinology and determine if patients received expedited care through this process.

Methods

From November 2022 to March 2024, HPT patients referred to endocrinology were screened for pHPT (Ca ≥ 10.7 and parathyroid hormone ≥ 65). Eligible patients were scheduled with endocrine surgery. Patients who did not meet the criteria or refused surgical evaluation were scheduled with endocrinology. The primary outcome was to evaluate the difference in time between initial referral and appointment for endocrine surgery versus endocrinology. Patient demographics, laboratory values, and surgical treatment were also collected. Descriptive analysis was performed in SPSS with categorical variables evaluated with chi-square tests and continuous variables evaluated with independent sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U test.

Results

Our pilot program referred 65 of 134 (48.5%) patients to endocrine surgery, whereas 69 of 134 (51.5%) were referred to endocrinology. Of these, 61 of 65 (93.8%) patients were seen by endocrine surgery, and 60 of 69 (87.0%) patients were seen by endocrinology. The mean time between referral and surgical appointment was 28 d (standard deviation 18), which was significantly less than the mean time interval of 118 d (standard deviation 73) for endocrine appointment (P < 0.001). Endocrine surgery patients had higher calcium levels than endocrinology patients (mean 11.4 versus 10.4, P < 0.001), but parathyroid hormone levels were not different (mean 135.6 versus 128.2, P = 0.43). Among endocrine surgery patients, 48 of 61 (78.7%) underwent parathyroid surgery compared to 10 of 60 (16.7%) endocrinology patients (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

For pHPT patients, initial referral to endocrine surgery significantly decreased time to evaluation, streamlined access to surgery, and decreased burden of care for endocrinology.

### Disparities in parathyroidectomy: who receives appropriate treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism? [^112dpLZ4]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Parathyroidectomy is underperformed despite clear benefits in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). We evaluated disparities in receipt of parathyroidectomy following PHPT diagnosis to explore barriers to care.

Methods

Adults diagnosed with PHPT 2013–2018 at a health system were identified. Recommended indications for parathyroidectomy include age ≤ 50 y, calcium > 11 mg/dL, or the presence of nephrolithiasis, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, decreased glomerular filtration rate, osteopenia, osteoporosis, or pathological fracture 1 y prior to diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier analysis assessed rates of parathyroidectomy within 12 mo following diagnosis as well as median time to parathyroidectomy, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses assessed factors associated with undergoing parathyroidectomy.

Results

Of 2409 patients, 75% were females, 12% aged ≤ 50 y, and 92% non-Hispanic White, while 52% had Medicaid/Medicare, 36% were commercial/self-pay or uninsured, and 12% unknown. Parathyroidectomy was performed within 1 y in 50% of patients. Within the 68% that met recommendations, parathyroidectomy was performed within 1 y in 54%; median time from diagnosis to surgery was shorter for males, patients aged ≤ 50 y, commercial/self-pay/no insurance patients (versus Medicaid/Medicare), and those with fewer comorbidities, P < 0.05. Multivariable analysis demonstrated non-Hispanic White patients and those with commercial/self-pay/uninsured were more likely to undergo parathyroidectomy after adjusting for comorbidity, age, and facility site. Among those strongly indicated, patients not on Medicare/Medicaid and aged ≤ 50 y were more likely to undergo parathyroidectomy after adjusting for race, comorbidity, and facility site.

Conclusions

Disparities in parathyroidectomy for PHPT were observed. Insurance type was associated with undergoing parathyroidectomy; patients on governmental insurance were less likely to undergo surgery and waited longer for surgery despite strong indications. Barriers to referral and access to surgery should be investigated and addressed to optimize all patients' access to care.

### Mild primary hyperparathyroidism: a literature review [^115ACQ1q]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

The biochemical profile of classic primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) consists of both elevated calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. The standard of care is parathyroidectomy unless prohibited by medical comorbidities. Because more patients are undergoing routine bone density evaluation and neck imaging studies for other purposes, there is a subset of people identified with a biochemically mild form of the pHPT that expresses itself as either elevated calcium or parathyroid hormone levels. These patients often do not fall into the criteria for operation based on the National Institutes of Health consensus guidelines, and they can present a challenge of diagnosis and management. The purpose of this paper is to review the available literature on mild pHPT in an effort to better characterize this patient population and to determine whether patients benefit from parathyroidectomy. Evidence suggests that there are patients with mild pHPT who have overt symptoms that are found to improve after parathyroidectomy. There is also a group of patients with biochemically mild pHPT who are found to progress to classic pHPT over time; however, it is not predictable which group of patients this will be. Early intervention for this group with mild pHPT may prevent progression of bone, psychiatric, and renal complications, and parathyroidectomy has proven safe in appropriately selected patients at high volume centers.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism in the older person [^114jJkyP]. Age and Ageing (2003). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common condition which may have few symptoms. One of the principal concerns in the older person with minimally symptomatic PHPT is restoration of bone mineral density and prevention of fracture. Other important considerations are cardiovascular risk and quality of life. Surgery, the traditional treatment of choice, may not always correct these factors. We present a review of the literature and advice of medical therapies which should be of benefit, with emphasis on a multifaceted approach in protecting the patient from PHPT.

### Current issues in the presentation of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the fourth international workshop [^114uRtpo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

This report summarizes data on traditional and nontraditional manifestations of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) that have been published since the last International Workshop on PHPT.

Participants

This subgroup was constituted by the Steering Committee to address key questions related to the presentation of PHPT. Consensus was established at a closed meeting of the Expert Panel that followed.

Evidence

Data from the 5-year period between 2008 and 2013 were presented and discussed to determine whether they support changes in recommendations for surgery or nonsurgical follow-up.

Consensus Process

Questions were developed by the International Task Force on PHPT. A comprehensive literature search for relevant studies was undertaken. After extensive review and discussion, the subgroup came to agreement on what changes in the recommendations for surgery or nonsurgical follow-up of asymptomatic PHPT should be made to the Expert Panel.

Conclusions

1) There are limited new data available on the natural history of asymptomatic PHPT. Although recognition of normocalcemic PHPT (normal serum calcium with elevated PTH concentrations; no secondary cause for hyperparathyroidism) is increasing, data on the clinical presentation and natural history of this phenotype are limited. 2) Although there are geographic differences in the predominant phenotypes of PHPT (symptomatic, asymptomatic, normocalcemic), they do not justify geography-specific management guidelines. 3) Recent data using newer, higher resolution imaging and analytic methods have revealed that in asymptomatic PHPT, both trabecular bone and cortical bone are affected. 4) Clinically silent nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis can be detected by renal imaging and should be listed as a new criterion for surgery. 5) Current data do not support a cardiovascular evaluation or surgery for the purpose of improving cardiovascular markers, anatomical or functional abnormalities. 6) Some patients with mild PHPT have neuropsychological complaints and cognitive abnormalities, and some of these patients may benefit from surgical intervention. However, it is not possible at this time to predict which patients with neuropsychological complaints or cognitive issues will improve after successful parathyroid surgery.

Regarding surgical interventions for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to parathyroidectomy, indications, AAES 2016 guidelines recommend to perform parathyroidectomy in patients with objective evidence of renal involvement, including:

- nephrocalcinosis

- hypercalciuria (24-hour urine calcium level > 400 mg/dL) with increased stone risk

- impaired renal function (GFR < 60 mL/min).

### Analysis of time to diagnosis and outcomes among adults with primary hyperparathyroidism [^116T5Ftk]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

It is unclear why patients with unexplained hypercalcemia did not undergo measurement of PTH. Although this group experienced increased rates of symptoms and diagnoses associated with PHP, their symptoms were considerably less severe compared with those with PTH measurements. It may be that they were considered to be asymptomatic and therefore did not undergo further workup. Diagnostic evaluation should not be restricted to the most symptomatic patients; therefore, this represents an opportunity for improvement. Furthermore, research indicates that patients who are labeled asymptomatic may still report symptoms when prompted or after undergoing cognitive testing. Our review only reported the rates of those symptoms that were coded, which likely underrepresented the true incidence of symptomatic patients. This suggests that there should be a strong suspicion for hyperparathyroidism in patients with hypercalcemia.

A possible explanation for missed diagnoses in patients with hypercalcemia and inappropriately nonsuppressed PTH between 50 and 65 pg/mL could be they were not identified because their PTH levels were within the reference range. Patients without a diagnosis with frankly elevated PTH greater than or equal to 65 pg/mL may be explained by the fact that clinicians often attribute hypercalcemia to other causes, even in patients with elevated PTH.

Another contributing factor for missed diagnoses may be that high-risk patients had lower calcium and PTH levels vs those whose PHP was diagnosed. Similarly, patients who experienced delayed diagnosis or time to treatment also had lower calcium and PTH compared with the timely diagnosis and treatment groups. Although greater PTH levels increased the likelihood of diagnosis and treatment, they did not correlate with disease burden in our study, a finding consistent with prior literature.

Among patients with a PHP diagnosis, those whose workup took over a year had significantly increased rates of disease sequelae over time, as seen at 2 to 3 years after hypercalcemia. Our study found that 40.2% of patients underwent surgical management after diagnosis, which is within the reported range of 16.8% to 67.2%. Patients who waited longer than 1 year from diagnosis to surgery also had increased rates of serious complications such as osteoporosis and HTN over time. Therefore, efforts to reduce diagnostic and treatment delays are worthwhile endeavors. Raising awareness about the diagnosis of PHP is important because it will lead to the evaluation of those associated conditions that should prompt referral to surgery as per the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines.

### Diagnosis and management of primary hyperparathyroidism across the VA health care system… [^112YTGzA]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Primary hyperparathyroidism appears to be underdiagnosed despite the presence of chronic hypercalcemia, and it is undertreated with parathyroidectomy despite surgical indications. Importance Untreated primary hyperparathyroidism impairs quality of life and incurs substantial costs. Parathyroidectomy is a low-risk, high-success, definitive intervention. Of 5793 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism presenting with a serum calcium level more than 1 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal, 1501 underwent parathyroidectomy. There was a decreasing trend in the use of parathyroidectomy over time. Parathyroidectomy is the only definitive treatment for pHPT. It is a low-risk operation, commonly performed on an outpatient basis, with high cure rates and excellent long-term outcomes, including in elderly patients.

5–7 Surgical intervention for pHPT has been associated with increased bone mineral density, decreased risk of fracture, decreased progression of kidney disease, and decreased rates of associated cardiovascular. dysfunction, constipation, and impotence. 8–14 Parathyroidectomy is the preferred treatment for all patients with symptomatic/classic disease, but some controversy remains about its use in patients with mild, asymptomatic pHPT. 4 Accumulating evidence, though, shows benefits to patients undergoing parathyroidectomy. for mild, asymptomatic disease, including improved neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms and overall quality of life. 15 Cost benefits of parathyroidectomy, even for patients with asymptomatic disease, have also been demonstrated. 16–18 This favorable risk to benefit ratio of the procedure has made it the primary recommended. treatment for pHPT, when surgery is possible.

19 Management guidelines have been periodically updated and reflect the growing evidence on the benefits of parathyroidectomy. 20–23 The most recent management guidelines released by the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons suggest that parathyroidectomy should be considered in patients with mild, nonclassic symptoms, if surgical risk is not prohibitive.
19. Thus, we examined diagnostic evaluation for pHPT and treatment patterns in the VA health care system. Our study objectives were to assess the rate of diagnostic testing for pHPT among patients with hypercalcemia, examine the use of parathyroidectomy for pHPT and determine temporal trends, and identify factors associated with surgical treatment in pHPT.

To assess how guidelines for the management of pHPT may have influenced the use of surgery, we performed subgroup analyses assessing the rate of parathyroidectomy among patients having symptomatic/classic disease or meeting 1 or more surgical indications with asymptomatic disease. Symptomatic/classic disease included nephrolithiasis and/or pathologic fractures. Surgical indications for asymptomatic disease included a serum calcium level greater than 1 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal, age younger than 50 years, estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1. 73 m2, 24-hour urine calcium level greater than 400 mg, and diagnosis of osteoporosis by ICD-9 codes.

MEN1 primary hyperparathyroidism — parathyroidectomy approach and imaging considerations include that imaging has no role in the diagnosis of PHPT and negative imaging results do not preclude surgery; preoperative localization for an initial open bilateral neck exploration may be of limited benefit in MEN1-associated PHPT, with only 7% of patients estimated to have a different procedure based on preoperative localization, though many parathyroid surgeons consider 7% significant; optimal surgery is a bilateral neck exploration with identification of all 4 parathyroid glands and removal of 3.5 glands with a bilateral cervical thymectomy, and recurrent PHPT risk increases if less than subtotal parathyroidectomy (≤ 3.5 glands) is performed; intraoperative PTH monitoring may have limited benefit because it will not alter the operative strategy, and referral to a high-volume center is crucial to optimize outcomes.

### When would I use medical therapies for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism? [^112DEB6V]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Although there may be controversy surrounding the indications for parathyroidectomy in primary hyperparathyroidism, it remains the only accepted definitive therapy. However, even if parathyroidectomy is indicated, some patients refuse surgery, are medically unfit or have residual or recurrent disease inaccessible to further surgery. Some of these patients may be suitable for long-term observation but others require intervention for management of symptomatic or moderate to severe hypercalcaemia, loss of bone mineral density or renal calculi. The selection of a suitable therapy for each patient should be individualized.

### Imaging techniques in parathyroid surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism [^117SAzJp]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2011). Low credibility.

As more patients present with the incidental diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism due to biochemical screening, treatment guidelines have been developed for the treatment of hyperparathyroidism. Management of primary hyperparathyroidism has evolved in recent years, with considerable interest in minimally invasive approaches. Successful localization of the diseased gland(s) by nuclear imaging and anatomical studies, along with rapid intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay, has allowed for focused and minimally invasive surgical approaches. Patients in whom the localization studies have identified single-gland adenoma or unilateral disease are candidates for such focused approaches instead of the traditional approach of bilateral exploration. These imaging techniques have also been critical in the successful management of patients with persistent or recurrent disease.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: what is the role of parathyroid surgery? [^111JjFxX]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Management

Patient work up and assessment with regard to 'candidates for surgery'

Referral for surgery

At present, for PHPT as a whole, referral for surgery is deemed necessary if patients are symptomatic, if there is end-organ involvement or if serum calcium is greater than 2.85 mmol/l. NICE also recommends to 'consider' surgery for those who do not fulfil the above criteria (see Table 2). This appears to be a reasonable starting point for nPHPT patients as those who may stand to benefit from prevention of progression of end organ effects can be referred for surgery. Questions remain, however, on whether surgery is of benefit to reduce risk of a number of non-skeletal and renal outcomes in nPHPT and whether alternative criteria should be developed.

Table 2.
Existing NICE guidance for PHPT surgical referral.

Localisation studies

Prior to surgery, ultrasonography and radionuclide scanning are utilised in an attempt to localise a parathyroid adenoma. However, studies have shown that imaging in nPHPT is less successful compared with hPHPT; this poses an additional challenge from a surgical perspective. In their case series of 616 patients, Trinh et al. reported a significantly higher incidence of multi-glandular disease (p = 0.002) in nPHPT patients, with 12% of nPHPT patients having multi-glandular disease compared with 4% of hPHPT patients. Moreover, Gómez-Ramírez et al. reported that parathyroid adenomas of nPHPT patients weighed on average 656 mg less than hPHPT patients (p = 0.058). These findings of a greater incidence of multi-glandular disease and smaller adenomas in nPHPT are supported extensively within the literature.– The combination of these two factors contributes to a lower sensitivity upon ultrasonography and technetium (Tc)-sestamibi scintigraphy amongst nPHPT patients.

### What symptom improvement can be expected after operation for primary hyperparathyroidism? [^112mfsAs]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The only cure for primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is operative resection of the parathyroid gland(s) responsible for the disease. The 1990 National Institute of Health's (NIH) consensus development conference on asymptomatic pHPT and its subsequent workshop in 2001 established which clinical criteria warranted parathyroidectomy (PTx) versus observation. While there is no debate that these NIH criteria capture a group of patients likely to benefit from PTx, there is concern that these guidelines miss a significant percentage of pHPT patients who actually are symptomatic. Unfortunately, these additional symptoms are often subtle, nonspecific, not traditionally measured, frequently not assessed or considered in this patient population, and are usually attributed to other diagnoses or simply advanced age.

Methods

An evidence-based literature review was performed assessing symptoms and clinical conditions associated with bone, neuropsychiatry, cognition, quality of life, and the neuromuscular system. The level of evidence and grade of recommendations were assigned to key studies to help determine recommendations regarding indications and potential benefits of parathyroidectomy (PTx).

Results

Symptoms ranging from decreased bone mineral density, increased fracture risk, neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive changes, lower quality of life, and neuromuscular symptoms were found to be associated with pHPT. The effects of PTx on these symptoms was addressed in a variety of studies that varied in quality.

Conclusion

Although there are few Level I randomized clinical trials addressing the benefit of PTx in patients with pHPT, there are supportive data to suggest that most patients with pHPT would benefit from operative cure.

### Diagnosis… [^114g2atY]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a medical condition where the parathyroid gland produce excess amounts of parathyroid hormone. The symptoms of the condition relate to the resulting elevated serum calcium, which can cause digestive symptoms, kidney stones, psychiatric abnormalities, and bone disease. The diagnosis is initially made on blood tests; an elevated level of calcium together with a raised level of parathyroid hormone are typically found. To identify the source of the excessive hormone secretion, medical imaging may be performed. Parathyroidectomy, the surgical removal of one or more parathyroid glands, may be required to control symptoms. In all cases, the disease is idiopathic, but is thought to involve inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, or involve gain of function mutations.

Recently, it was demonstrated that liquidators of the Chernobyl power plant are faced with a substantial risk of primary hyperparathyroidism, possibly caused by radioactive strontium isotopes. Diagnosis Blood tests Serum calcium levels are usually elevated, and the parathyroid hormone level is abnormally high compared with an expected low level in response to the high calcium. A relatively elevated parathyroid hormone has been estimated to have a sensitivity of 60–80% and a specificity of approximately 90% for primary hyperparathyroidism. A more powerful variant of comparing the balance between calcium and parathyroid hormone is to perform a 3-hour calcium infusion. After infusion, a parathyroid hormone level above a cutoff of 14 ng/L has a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 93% in detecting primary hyperparathyroidism, with a confidence interval of 80% to 100%.

Urinary cAMP is occasionally measured; it is generally elevated due to activation of G~s~ proteins when PTH binds to its receptor. Imaging Biochemical confirmation of primary hyperparathyroidism is following by investigations to localize the culprit lesion. Primary hyperparathyroidism is most commonly caused by a solitary parathyroid adenoma or parathyroid hyperplasia. Infrequently, the condition is caused by double or multiple parathyroid adenomas that can be present on more than one parathyroidal gland or even occur elsewhere. Scintigraphic or single-photon emission computed tomography imaging with the radiotracer^99m^Tc-sestamibi of head, neck and upper thorax is the first-line nuclear imaging modality for localizing parathyroid adenomas, having a sensitivity and specificity of 70–80%. Sensitivity falls down to 30% in case of double/multiple parathyroid adenomas or in case of parathyroid hyperplasia.

In cases where^99m^Tc-sestamibi scintigraphy or SPECT delivers inconclusive results, other imaging modalities and tracers can be applied. For detection of multiple parathyroid adenomas, positron emission tomography using the radiopharmaceutical^68^Ga-Trivehexin has demonstrated a higher detection rate than^99m^Tc-sestamibi imaging. Ultrasonography is also a useful test in localizing suspicious parathyroid lesions. Treatment Treatment is usually surgical removal of the gland containing adenomas, but medication may also be required. Surgery The surgical removal of one or more of the parathyroid glands is known as a parathyroidectomy; this operation was first performed in 1925. The symptoms of the disease, listed above, are indications for surgery. Surgery reduces all cause mortality as well as resolving symptoms. However, cardiovascular mortality is not significantly reduced.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^114NPRLk]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common endocrine disorder of calcium metabolism characterised by hypercalcaemia and elevated or inappropriately normal concentrations of parathyroid hormone. Almost always, primary hyperparathyroidism is due to a benign overgrowth of parathyroid tissue either as a single gland (80% of cases) or as a multiple gland disorder (15–20% of cases). Primary hyperparathyroidism is generally discovered when asymptomatic but the disease always has the potential to become symptomatic, resulting in bone loss and kidney stones. In countries where biochemical screening tests are not common, symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism tends to predominate. Another variant of primary hyperparathyroidism has been described in which the serum calcium concentration is within normal range but parathyroid hormone is elevated in the absence of any obvious cause. Primary hyperparathyroidism can be cured by removal of the parathyroid gland or glands but identification of patients who are best advised to have surgery requires consideration of the guidelines that are regularly updated. Recommendations for patients who do not undergo parathyroid surgery include monitoring of serum calcium concentrations and bone density.

### Who benefits from treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism? [^116nQNtg]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Parathyroidectomy (PTx) is the only definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), but is commonly underutilized. Most patients are medically observed, whereas approximately 30% of patients are treated operatively. PTx is a low-risk surgical procedure and the most cost-effective treatment option. An international consensus statement was published in 1990 to guide clinicians in the management of patients with PHPT, particularly those with asymptomatic disease. Most patients with PHPT and low perioperative risk benefit from surgical treatment, regardless of whether they meet consensus criteria, due to fracture risk reduction, health-related quality-of-life improvements, and prevention or mitigation of disease progression.

### Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: a medical perspective [^1177tCDG]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical phenotype of primary hyperparathyroidism in the United States has changed markedly over the past century, with the majority of patients having minimal overt symptomatology. It has become clear, however, that "asymptomatic" primary hyperparathyroidism is a disease with distinct physiologic characteristics. Data accumulated over recent years suggest that asymptomatic patients meeting specific criteria can be safely followed without surgery. These guidelines are elucidated, and new options in the medical therapeutics of primary hyperparathyroidism are discussed.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: what is the role of parathyroid surgery? [^117UPCBt]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Does surgical referral differ for nPHPT patients?

A key question remains as to whether nPHPT should be considered a different entity to hPHPT, or if they can be managed using a single approach. Whilst studies have reported that nPHPT presents differently to hPHPT, such as with a higher incidence of multi-glandular disease,– studies have also shown that a proportion of normocalcaemic patients will progress to hypercalcaemia. In line with this, a standardised approach to managing PHPT irrespective of serum calcium appears appropriate and the aforementioned NICE guidance for PHPT surgical referral remains applicable for nPHPT. However, it is important that discussions regarding surgery are individualised and patient expectations are comprehensively explored. This involves counselling the patient to ensure adequate understanding of both the positive (a reduction in end-organ effects) and adverse (risk of surgical complications) outcomes that may occur following surgery.

For clinicians, it is also important to avoid routinely screening PTH levels unless there is evidence to suggest measurement would be appropriate. This includes evidence of calcium homeostasis disturbance, renal dysfunction and occasionally if there is vitamin D deficiency.

Limitations of the current literature

Many of the studies investigating the role of surgery in the treatment of nPHPT consist of a relatively small cohort of patients. This is compounded by comparative studies in the field generally having a significantly larger number of hPHPT patients relative to nPHPT patients. Future studies should aim to analyse larger nPHPT cohorts, with comparative studies providing equal representation to nPHPT and hPHPT patients. Moreover, there is a need for large consortia based prospective registries of those managed both surgically and medically, with an extended follow up period of more than 10 years. This would enable the true natural history and adverse events of treatment to be observed, providing much needed clarity to clinicians.
