## Question

Post menopausal bleeding

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about postmenopausal bleeding. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining postmenopausal bleeding and its clinical significance. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and risk of endometrial cancer. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis and risk stratification. After that, I need to examine first-line diagnostic strategies, including transvaginal ultrasound thresholds and endometrial sampling. Then, I should consider special populations such as those on hormone therapy or tamoxifen. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight key takeaways, making sure I double-check thresholds and guideline nuances throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and why it matters. Postmenopausal bleeding is any unexpected vaginal bleeding occurring after 12 months of amenorrhea, and it is the most common presenting symptom of endometrial cancer, which mandates prompt evaluation to exclude malignancy [^11ab0e39] [^1d006254] [^f1e0ea6f].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology before drawing conclusions. The pooled risk of endometrial cancer among women with postmenopausal bleeding is about 9%, with a range of roughly 5–15% depending on region and hormone therapy status, and postmenopausal bleeding accounts for about 5% of office gynecology visits, underscoring both the frequency and the need for a standardized workup [^29b62829] [^ab63b016] [^18092206].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causes. I need to check the differential. Benign etiologies predominate, including endometrial atrophy, polyps, and hyperplasia, but malignancy risk is nontrivial and increases with age and risk factors such as obesity, unopposed estrogen, tamoxifen, diabetes, and Lynch syndrome, so I should keep both benign and malignant possibilities in mind during evaluation [^d68ffe2a] [^dcbd2654] [^1d006254].

> Next, I should review first-line diagnostic strategies. Either transvaginal ultrasound or endometrial sampling is acceptable initially, and I do not need to order both up front, though the choice should reflect patient risk, local expertise, and preferences [^1d006254] [^22dacc61].

> I will now examine transvaginal ultrasound thresholds. Let me think about the negative predictive value carefully. An endometrial thickness of 4 mm or less carries a greater than 99% negative predictive value for endometrial cancer, so if the lining is 4 mm or less and bleeding has stopped, endometrial sampling is generally not required, though persistent or recurrent bleeding warrants histologic evaluation regardless of thickness [^273a9b3a] [^4d4b1dc4] [^ad1c0d28].

> But wait, what if I use a 5 mm cutoff instead of 4 mm. I should double-check the trade-offs. Lowering the threshold to 3–4 mm increases sensitivity toward 98% but lowers specificity, whereas 5 mm improves sensitivity to about 90% with lower specificity; composite data show missed cancers even at 3–4 mm, so I need to balance detection with false positives and tailor to local practice patterns and patient risk [^1d342d65] [^31df472c] [^8e439871].

> Next, I should review endometrial sampling. Office-based sampling with a Pipelle is highly accurate in postmenopausal women, with detection rates approaching 99.6% in some series, but adequacy can be limited by focal lesions or thin linings; if sampling is insufficient or negative and bleeding persists, hysteroscopy with directed biopsy or D&C is indicated [^48c1de65] [^c6cb03ed] [^5819239e].

> Let me consider special populations. In women on menopausal hormone therapy, persistent unscheduled bleeding requires evaluation to exclude hyperplasia or cancer, and the same principles apply to those using vaginal estrogen, where new bleeding should prompt assessment before continuing therapy [^ddab973c] [^143d2010] [^34c47600].

> I should confirm tamoxifen-specific guidance. For patients on tamoxifen, any change in bleeding warrants gynecologic evaluation with ultrasound and possible endometrial biopsy, and routine surveillance imaging without symptoms is not recommended, given the elevated risk of endometrial pathology with tamoxifen exposure [^9194b6a8].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach to incidental endometrial thickening without bleeding. In asymptomatic postmenopausal women, an endometrial thickness greater than 4 mm alone does not mandate evaluation, and thresholds around 10–11 mm are commonly used to consider further assessment based on risk factors, so I must avoid over-calling incidental findings [^bf950732] [^d713f5ea] [^9e2bf001].

> Next, I should review what to do when initial tests are non-diagnostic. If office sampling is insufficient or negative and bleeding persists, or if ultrasound cannot adequately visualize the endometrium, sonohysterography, office hysteroscopy, or D&C should be pursued to secure a diagnosis and guide management [^fb21573e] [^37445000] [^c7b9b81a].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm. For a postmenopausal woman with bleeding, I should assess hemodynamics, perform a focused exam, and then choose TVUS or endometrial sampling as first-line. If TVUS shows endometrial thickness 4 mm or less and bleeding has resolved, observation is reasonable, but if thickness exceeds 4 mm or bleeding recurs, I should proceed to tissue diagnosis, ideally with hysteroscopic guidance for focal lesions, and escalate to D&C if sampling is inadequate or suspicion remains high [^1d006254] [^273a9b3a] [^c7b9b81a].

> I need to ensure I address disparities and system issues. Black women are less likely to receive guideline-concordant evaluation for postmenopausal bleeding, which correlates with later-stage diagnosis, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion and advocate for equitable, timely workups in all patients [^69943442].

> Finally, let me reconsider the key takeaways to avoid missing anything critical. Postmenopausal bleeding is common and carries a meaningful risk of endometrial cancer, so it warrants prompt evaluation. Either TVUS or endometrial sampling is acceptable initially, with a 4 mm threshold providing excellent negative predictive value on TVUS. Persistent or recurrent bleeding, or risk factors such as tamoxifen or hormone therapy, lower the threshold for tissue diagnosis, and incidental thickening without bleeding should not trigger invasive testing by default [^29b62829] [^273a9b3a] [^1d006254] [^bf950732].

Postmenopausal bleeding is **any vaginal bleeding after 12 months of amenorrhea** [^11ab0e39] and is a red-flag symptom that **requires prompt evaluation** to exclude endometrial cancer, which occurs in about 9% of cases [^29b62829] [^ab63b016]. The most common benign causes are endometrial atrophy, polyps, and hyperplasia, but malignancy risk rises with age, obesity, tamoxifen use, and unopposed estrogen exposure [^d68ffe2a] [^dcbd2654]. First-line evaluation is **transvaginal ultrasound** [^1d006254] with endometrial thickness ≤ 4 mm providing a > 99% negative predictive value for cancer [^273a9b3a]; thickness > 4 mm or persistent bleeding warrants endometrial sampling [^37445000] [^ad1c0d28]. Office endometrial biopsy is preferred [^c7b9b81a]; if inadequate or negative with ongoing bleeding, hysteroscopy with D&C is indicated [^5819239e]. Management is guided by histology, with cancer referred to gynecologic oncology and benign causes treated accordingly [^1d083842].

---

## Definition and clinical significance

Postmenopausal bleeding is **defined as any vaginal bleeding occurring after 12 months of amenorrhea** [^11ab0e39]. It is a clinically significant symptom because it is the most common presenting sign of endometrial cancer, which accounts for approximately 9% of cases of postmenopausal bleeding [^29b62829] [^ab63b016]. Prompt evaluation is essential to exclude malignancy and identify treatable benign causes [^1d006254].

---

## Etiology

Postmenopausal bleeding has diverse etiologies, broadly categorized as **benign and malignant**:

| **Category** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|
| Benign | - Endometrial atrophy (most common) [^d68ffe2a] <br/> - Endometrial polyps [^2da1403d] <br/> - Endometrial hyperplasia (with or without atypia) [^dcbd2654] <br/> - Cervical polyps <br/> - Vaginal atrophy <br/> - Trauma or infection [^notfound] |
| Malignant | - Endometrial carcinoma (most common gynecologic malignancy) [^65e83b88] <br/> - Cervical carcinoma <br/> - Ovarian carcinoma (less common) [^notfound] <br/> - Sarcomas (rare) [^notfound] |

---

Risk factors for malignancy include **advanced age, obesity, unopposed estrogen exposure, tamoxifen use, diabetes, hypertension, and family history of gynecologic malignancies** [^1d006254] [^dcbd2654].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

The diagnostic approach to postmenopausal bleeding aims to **exclude malignancy and identify benign causes**. The following steps are recommended:

---

### Initial assessment

Initial assessment includes a **focused history** detailing the bleeding pattern, duration, associated symptoms, medication use (especially hormone therapy or tamoxifen), and risk factors for malignancy [^1d006254]. A **physical examination** should include a speculum exam to visualize the cervix and vagina, and a bimanual exam to assess uterine size and adnexal masses [^notfound].

---

### Imaging

Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is the **first-line imaging modality** [^1d006254] to measure endometrial thickness and assess for structural abnormalities [^673898bd]. An endometrial thickness ≤ 4 mm in a postmenopausal woman with bleeding has a **negative predictive value > 99%** for endometrial cancer, making further evaluation unnecessary if bleeding has ceased [^273a9b3a] [^4d4b1dc4]. If the endometrial thickness is > 4 mm or if bleeding persists, **further evaluation is indicated** [^37445000].

---

### Endometrial sampling

Endometrial biopsy is indicated when TVUS shows endometrial thickness > 4 mm or when bleeding persists despite a thin endometrial lining [^37445000]. Office-based endometrial biopsy (e.g. Pipelle) is **highly sensitive** for detecting endometrial cancer, with a false-negative rate of approximately 10% [^c7b9b81a]. If the biopsy is inconclusive or the sample is inadequate, **hysteroscopy with dilation and curettage (D&C) is recommended** [^5819239e].

---

### Additional tests

Additional tests may include **saline infusion sonohysterography** to better visualize intrauterine lesions such as polyps or submucosal fibroids [^673898bd], and **MRI** if ultrasound is inconclusive or to further characterize suspected malignancy [^673898bd].

---

## Management

Management of postmenopausal bleeding depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Benign causes**: Endometrial atrophy may be managed conservatively with observation or local estrogen therapy. Polyps and hyperplasia without atypia are treated with hysteroscopic polypectomy or progestin therapy, respectively [^d5dd61ae] [^dcbd2654].
- **Malignant causes**: Confirmed or suspected endometrial cancer requires referral to gynecologic oncology for surgical staging and definitive treatment, which may include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, lymph node dissection, radiation, and chemotherapy [^1d083842].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with the **underlying cause**. Benign causes generally have an excellent prognosis, whereas endometrial cancer prognosis depends on the stage at diagnosis, histologic type, and patient factors. Early-stage endometrial cancer has a 5-year survival rate exceeding 90%, underscoring the importance of early detection through prompt evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding [^notfound].

---

Postmenopausal bleeding is a **common and potentially serious symptom** that requires prompt evaluation to exclude malignancy. Transvaginal ultrasound and endometrial sampling are the cornerstones of diagnosis, and management is tailored to the underlying cause. Early detection and treatment of endometrial cancer significantly improve outcomes, making timely evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding essential [^1d006254].

### Management of pre-, peri-, and post-menopausal abnormal uterine bleeding: when to perform endometrial sampling? [^5aa19ae9]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is defined as abnormal volume, duration, or frequency of menstrual period and is a common symptom in women of all ages (premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal). The acronym PALM-COEIN, introduced by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), facilitates the evaluation and differential diagnosis of AUB, mostly in premenopausal women with AUB. Endometrial evaluation (including ultrasound or hysteroscopic imaging and tissue sampling) for subtle pathology is proposed in patients who are at high risk for endometrial cancer and in patients at low risk who present with AUB and who present poor correspondence in medical treatment. Many new diagnostic modalities are available in clinicians in order to help the assessment of women presenting with abnormalities in their menstrual pattern. The present study reviews the optimal management of women presenting with AUB, taking into consideration the actual need for invasive management in these women, who of them require it, and who can be diagnosed without histological verification. The importance of endometrial tissue sampling in women who present with AUB as well as the best timing for a clinician to conduct a biopsy are two axons analyzed below, according to the latest worldwide guidelines and major publications about this subject.

Heavy vaginal bleeding is a common, life-altering condition affecting around 30% of women at some point in their reproductive lives. Initial evaluation should focus on hemodynamic stability. A thorough history including the patient's menstrual cycle and personal and family bleeding history should be obtained. Causes are stratified using the structural and nonstructural International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics classification system. Further consideration of the patient's age is essential because this can help to narrow the differential diagnosis. Work-up includes laboratory and imaging studies.

### A case of crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever presenting to the emergency department with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding [^ad4e319a]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a common cause of tick-borne hemorrhagic infections. The aim of this study is to report a case of a postmenopausal woman presenting with vaginal bleeding.

Case Report

A 52-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with high fever, weakness, loss of appetite, and vaginal bleeding. The patient was engaged in animal husbandry and had no history of tick bites. She had entered menopause 1 year prior. Laboratory tests revealed bicytopenia, abnormal kidney and liver function tests, and impaired coagulation parameters. The diagnosis of CCHF was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). She was hospitalized and treated with hydration, bleeding monitoring, and ribavirin. She was discharged on the 6th day of admission. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: CCHF presents various clinical manifestations, beyond fever and bleeding. In women living in endemic areas, postmenopausal bleeding may also be a symptom of CCHF, and it should be considered in the differential diagnosis if the clinical history and laboratory findings are consistent.

### Evaluation of the woman with postmenopausal bleeding: society of radiologists in ultrasound-sponsored consensus conference statement [^5b9069d3]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

A panel of 14 physicians practicing medicine in the United States with expertise in radiology, obstetrics and gynecology, gynecologic oncology, hysteroscopy, epidemiology, and pathology was convened by the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound to discuss the role of sonography in women with postmenopausal bleeding. Broad objectives of this conference were (1) to advance understanding of the utility of different diagnostic techniques for evaluating the endometrium in women with postmenopausal bleeding; (2) to formulate useful and practical guidelines for evaluation of women with postmenopausal bleeding, specifically as it relates to the use of sonography; and (3) to offer suggestions for future research projects.

Setting

October 24 and 25, 2000, Washington, DC, preceding the annual Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound Advances in Sonography conference.

Procedure

Specific questions to the panel included the following: (1) What are the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using transvaginal sonography versus office (nondirected) endometrial biopsy as the initial examination for a woman with postmenopausal bleeding? (2) What are the sonographic standards for evaluating a woman with postmenopausal bleeding? (3) What are the abnormal sonographic findings in a woman with postmenopausal bleeding? (4) When should saline infusion sonohysterography or hysteroscopy be used in the evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding? (5) Should the diagnostic approach be modified for patients taking hormone replacement medications, tamoxifen, or other selective estrogen receptor modulators?

Conclusions

Consensus recommendations were used to create an algorithm for evaluating women with postmenopausal bleeding. All panelists agreed that because postmenopausal bleeding is the most common presenting symptom of endometrial cancer, when postmenopausal bleeding occurs, clinical evaluation is indicated. The panelists also agreed that either transvaginal sonography or endometrial biopsy could be used safely and effectively as the first diagnostic step. Whether sonography or endometrial biopsy is used initially depends on the physician's assessment of patient risk, the nature of the physician's practice, the availability of high-quality sonography, and patient preference. Similar sensitivities for detecting endometrial carcinoma are reported for transvaginal sonography when an endometrial thickness of greater than 5 mm is considered abnormal and for endometrial biopsy when "sufficient" tissue is obtained. Currently, with respect to mortality, morbidity, and quality-of-life end points, there are insufficient data to comment as to which approach is more effective. The conference concluded by identifying several important unanswered questions and suggestions that could be addressed by future research projects.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 426: the role of transvaginal ultrasonography in the evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding [^66f4b05d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

The clinical approach to postmenopausal bleeding requires prompt and efficient evaluation to exclude or diagnose carcinoma. Women with postmenopausal bleeding may be assessed initially with either endometrial biopsy or transvaginal ultrasonography;this initial evaluation does not require performance of both tests.Transvaginal ultrasonography can be useful in the triage of patients in whom endometrial sampling was performed but tissue was insufficient for diagnosis. When transvaginal ultrasonography is performed for patients with postmenopausal bleeding and an endometrial thickness of less than or equal to 4 mm is found, endometrial sampling is not required. Meaningful assessment of the endometrium by ultrasonography is not possible in all patients. In such cases, alternative assessment should be completed. When bleeding persists despite negative initial evaluations, additional assessment usually is indicated.

Endometrial cancer epidemiology and presentation in postmenopausal women. Cancer of the endometrium is the most common type of gynecologic cancer in the United States, with in 2017 an estimated 61,380 new cases of uterine cancer and an estimated 10,920 deaths; most cases of uterine cancer (92%) occur in the endometrium, and vaginal bleeding is the presenting sign in more than 90% of postmenopausal women with endometrial carcinoma. Depending on age and risk factors, 1–14% of women with postmenopausal bleeding will have endometrial cancer.

### Perimenopausal vaginal bleeding: diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic options [^90babe50]. Journal of Women's Health (2012). Low credibility.

While significant awareness has been raised about menopause, less attention has been focused on the perimenopausal or "menopausal transition" period. Many women and their physicians remain unaware of the impact of this transitional phase into menopause. Specifically, heavy and unpredictable perimenopausal bleeding is extremely common. It is a normal phenomenon of aging and tends to improve over time. However, about one quarter of perimenopausal women will have heavy flow that persists beyond 3 months and will require medical assistance. The purpose of this review is to focus on the hormonal and physiologic changes that are associated with perimenopausal heavy vaginal bleeding, to present the essential evaluation of causes for this heavy flow, and to outline the evidence for effective medical and surgical treatments. Advances in the understanding of the normal physiology of perimenopause have led to medical therapies that may lead to fewer surgical procedures and hysterectomies and should be of interest to health care practitioners focusing on women's health. Although these issues are addressed in the gynecologic literature, there is relatively less published in other disciplines.

### Diagnosis of abnormal uterine bleeding with imaging [^9d504e85]. Menopause (2011). Low credibility.

The major role of ultrasound in the evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding, other than that occurring during pregnancy, is in postmenopausal women. Because postmenopausal bleeding can be the presenting symptom of endometrial cancer, any woman with this symptom should be evaluated to diagnose or exclude carcinoma. Over the last two decades, the role of ultrasound in the evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding has changed markedly, from little or no role in 1990 to a major role today. In the intervening years, numerous studies have shown that ultrasound is at least as sensitive as endometrial biopsy for endometrial cancer and that ultrasound can reliably exclude cancer without the need for biopsy in some women with postmenopausal bleeding. In particular, numerous studies have shown that women with an endometrial thickness of 4 mm or less have an extremely low likelihood of endometrial cancer and thus do not need to undergo endometrial biopsy. Ultrasound can also help in the selection of an appropriate biopsy technique. In a woman with postmenopausal bleeding and a thick endometrium, a sonohysterogram can determine whether the endometrium is diffusely thick or has focal areas of thickening. With diffuse thickening, a blind endometrial biopsy is appropriate. When there are one or more focal areas of thickening, hysteroscopic biopsy is likely to be the better choice. We present two clinical algorithms, either of which is an acceptable approach to the use of ultrasound and/or endometrial biopsy in women with postmenopausal bleeding: the "ultrasound-first" approach and the "biopsy-first" approach.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 734: the role of transvaginal ultrasonography in evaluating the endometrium of women with postmenopausal bleeding [^4f0ddbd6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Postmenopausal bleeding—persistent bleeding and incidental endometrial thickening management. Because rare cases of endometrial carcinoma can present with an endometrial thickness of less than 3 mm, persistent or recurrent uterine bleeding should prompt a histologic evaluation of the endometrium regardless of endometrial thickness, whereas an endometrial measurement greater than 4 mm incidentally discovered without bleeding need not routinely trigger evaluation; reliability of measurement can be affected by an axial uterus, obesity, coexisting myomas, adenomyosis, or previous uterine surgery.

Postmenopausal bleeding—initial evaluation and risk stratification with transvaginal ultrasonography: Ultrasonography to measure endometrial echo “should be offered as an initial evaluation only to women with postmenopausal bleeding for whom no further evaluation would be needed if a thin echo is found,” and “Persistent or recurrent bleeding should trigger additional evaluation.” Transvaginal ultrasonography “is a reasonable alternative to endometrial sampling as a first approach” for an initial episode, and “Ultrasonography should be used only for patients whose prior probability of cancer and hyperplasia is low enough that no additional testing would be required after a normal ultrasonography.” Clinical risk factors “should be considered when evaluating postmenopausal bleeding,” and “Endometrial sampling should be the first-line test for women with postmenopausal bleeding at higher risk.” A cohort “of 4,383 women” indicates threshold selection “should be based on available resources, comorbidities, and acceptable detection rates.”

### Transdermal vs. oral hormone replacement therapy (...) [^b25a0e8e]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Estrogen replacement therapy reduces bone loss, alleviates vasomotor symptoms and may decrease mortality from cardiovascular causes in postmenopausal women. However, cyclic hormone replacement therapy frequently induces a recurrence of uterine bleeding in women with an intact uterus. This withdrawal bleeding leads to a significant decrease in patient compliance. Continuous combined hormone replacement regimens have been developed that significantly reduce the incidence of bleeding, particularly with extended duration of therapy. The study included 441 healthy post-menopausal women with an intact uterus who requested hormone replacement therapy for moderate vasomotor symptoms. The women were randomized into three treatment groups and were given a 10-cm. All treatments were given for a total of 13 continuous cycles of four weeks' duration. Patches were applied twice weekly, and tablets were given daily.

Women were assessed at baseline and at 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks of treatment for climacteric symptoms, bleeding frequency and tolerability. The initial and final visits also included general physical and gynecologic examinations, cervical smears, transvaginal ultrasonography and mammography. Results indicate that the majority of women in all groups were amenorrheic after three treatment cycles, with the rate of amenorrhea increasing with duration of therapy. Amenorrhea was reported more frequently among women in the 10-cm. 2 patch group than in the other groups. The incidence of hot flushes, insomnia, and joint or limb pain were decreased equivalently in all three treatment groups. The frequency of endometrial hyperplasia after one year of treatment was less than 2 percent with all three regimens, a rate that is lower than the prevalence of hyperplasia in postmenopausal women without hormone replacement therapy.

The authors concluded that transdermal application of a low dosage of combined estrogen-progestogen may be a good alternative in women requesting hormone replacement therapy, because all preparations studied alleviated climacteric symptoms and did not induce endometrial hyperplasia. Because the low-dose transdermal application had the lowest reported incidence of adverse effects, it seems that this dosage would be preferable for relief of symptoms. However, this study did not evaluate whether low-dose transdermal estrogen is effective in preventing the bone loss and cardiovascular disease associated with menopause; a long-term study will be necessary to obtain that information.

Postmenopausal bleeding—endometrial thickness threshold, predictive value, and need for histology: Using a 4 mm endometrial echo as a cut-off yields “an extremely high negative predictive value (greater than 99%),” but “a thickened endometrial echo is not diagnostic of any particular pathology,” and “a thin endometrial echo does not reliably exclude type II endometrial cancer.” Therefore, “Repeated episodes of postmenopausal bleeding and ongoing postmenopausal bleeding require histologic evaluation even in women with an apparent thin endometrial echo.” For histology, “outpatient endometrial sampling with disposable devices is the primary method of choice,” and “If blind sampling does not reveal endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy, further testing, such as hysteroscopy with dilation and curettage, is warranted” in persistent or recurrent bleeding.

### How I manage heavy menstrual bleeding [^57dd7e4b]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is a common clinical problem; population-based studies estimate that approximately 10-35% of women report this symptom during their lifetime, while about 5% of women consult a physician for evaluation of HMB. Patients with HMB account for 15% of all referrals to gynaecologists and are frequently seen by haematologists in bleeding disorder clinics as well. Heavy menstrual bleeding can be caused by a wide variety of local and systemic factors, so a careful clinical and laboratory evaluation is often necessary to determine the aetiology and guide appropriate management. This review discusses the definition, causes and clinical outcomes of HMB. It outlines a diagnostic approach and focuses on medical (as opposed to surgical) treatments. Throughout, areas of controversy and opportunities for further research are highlighted.

### Cross-sectional imaging of acute gynaecologic disorders: CT and MRI findings with differential diagnosis-part II: uterine emergencies and pelvic inflammatory disease [^2da1403d]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Uterine emergencies

Abnormal genital bleeding represents the characteristic and most common manifestation of acute uterine disorders and is one of the most common presentations in the emergency gynaecology unit as it accounts for approximately one-third of urgent gynaecologic visits. Causes encompass a wide spectrum of systemic and endocrine disorders, benign conditions (infection and focal abnormalities of the uterine cavity) and malignancies.

In reproductive-age women, when pregnancy is ruled out, clinical examination is required to search for vaginal and cervical abnormalities underlying acute bleeding. Additional imaging is required to detect or exclude abnormalities such as endometrial polyps or submucosal fibroids. Endometrial cancer is rarely encountered in pre-menopausal women, very exceptionally under 40 years of age. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (idiopathic menorrhagia) represents a diagnosis of exclusion, in the absence of a recognizable pelvic pathology.

Transvaginal US remains the initial modality of choice in the evaluation of endometrial diseases, but the use of MRI to clarify abnormal or suspicious US findings before hysteroscopy is increasing, as it provides superior detection and characterisation of abnormalities in the uterine cavity.

Endometrial polyps

Endometrial polyps (EP) represent a localised overgrowth of endometrial glands with a central stroma composed of fibrous tissue or smooth muscle. Sometimes asymptomatic, EP easily cause either menometrorrhagia in pre-menopausal women or post-menopausal bleeding. The prevalence ranges from 7.8% to 34.9% and increases with age; tamoxifen is a well-established risk factor.

On T2-weighted MR images, EP appear as low signal intensity sessile or pedunculated masses projecting into the endometrial cavity, surrounded by high signal intensity fluid and endometrium. Furthermore, a fibrous core (low signal intensity stripe or centre) and intratumoural cysts (discrete, smooth-walled cystic structures of high signal intensity) may be identified within the mass. Cystic spaces correspond to dilated glands but are nonspecific as they may be present within EP, hyperplasia or cancer. On T1-weighted images, EP generally have isointense signal compared to the endometrium, and may become haemorrhagic after ulceration or infarction leading to the appearance of hyperintense region best appreciated using precontrast fat saturation. After gadolinium contrast, EP may show either early persistent or gradually increasing enhancement, equal to or greater than that of outer myometrium (Fig. 1).

### Association of endometrial cancer with postmenopausal bleeding (...) [^29b62829]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Question What is the prevalence of postmenopausal bleeding in women with endometrial cancer and the risk of endometrial cancer in women with postmenopausal bleeding. Findings This systematic review and meta-analysis of 40 790 unique patients in 129 unique studies suggests that postmenopausal bleeding occurs in approximately 90% of women with endometrial cancer; however, only 9% of women with postmenopausal bleeding were diagnosed with endometrial cancer. These estimates varied by geographic region, hormone use, and calendar time. Meaning These findings provide a foundation for evaluating early detection strategies for endometrial cancer and can support risk-informed decision making in clinical management of postmenopausal bleeding. Importance As the worldwide burden of endometrial cancer continues to rise, interest is growing in the evaluation of early detection and prevention strategies among women at increased risk.

Focusing efforts on women with postmenopausal bleeding, a common symptom of endometrial cancer, may be a useful strategy; however, PMB is not specific for endometrial cancer and is often caused by benign conditions. We evaluated endometrial cancer risk estimates of 5%, 10%, and 15%, representing the range of risks observed in different geographic regions. We show the magnitude of the increase in PPV of both tests with increasing risk of endometrial cancer in women with PMB, supporting the evaluation of early-detection strategies in various populations. However, little consensus exists about how to best treat these women if bleeding persists, and a considerable number of women with HT-associated bleeding will undergo procedures to rule out endometrial cancer. 165 Our data emphasize the importance of considering a woman’s HT status to inform clinical decision making, potentially supporting a less aggressive management approach in HT users.

Finally, our results suggested a lower prevalence of endometrial cancer in retrospective and prospective cohort studies compared with cross-sectional studies. Cross-sectional studies may have been more likely to include women with recurrent bleeding; however, few studies distinguished between incident vs recurrent PMB. Our study represents an important and timely evaluation of the risk of endometrial cancer in women with PMB and can serve as a reliable reference for the prevalence of PMB in women with endometrial cancer and the risk of endometrial cancer in women with PMB, 2 requisite prior probabilities for prediction of endometrial cancer risk and secondary and tertiary prevention.

### An unusual cause of postmenopausal bleeding [^e4171721]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma usually presents with lymphadenopathy, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding is a cardinal symptom of carcinoma of the endometrium or cervix but not one of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Clinical awareness of this unusual mode of presentation is important.

Case

We report a case of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in a 60-year-old woman, who presented primarily with postmenopausal bleeding. Clinical examination revealed a "thickened" area on the posterior vaginal wall. Repeated vaginal biopsies showed fibrosis and inflammatory tissue only. Immunohistochemistry revealed non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges such a complex case presents.

Conclusion

This case not only represents a case of non-Hodgkin lymphoma with genital involvement but also highlights the importance of diagnosis and management of such complex cases.

Fig. 1 
Endometrial polyp in a 44-year-old woman with acute uterine bleeding and associated bilateral ovarian neoplasm. Sagittal (a) and oblique-coronal (d) T2-weighted images show a huge polypoid mass (arrowheads) arising from the uterine fundus that fills the endometrial cavity and protrudes into the cervical canal. Note the hypointense stromal axis of the polyp (arrows). Corresponding sagittal (b) and oblique-coronal (e) precontrast fat-suppressed T1-weighted images show hyperintense foci on the polyp edge (thin arrows), representing haemorrhage. On gadolinium-enhanced sagittal (c) and oblique-coronal (f) fat-suppressed T1-weighted images, the implant base (stromal axis) of the polyp shows intense enhancement (arrows). The patient underwent bilateral uterine artery embolisation in order to control bleeding

Regarding management, hysteroscopic polypectomy is the gold standard for both diagnosis and treatment. Conservative management is reasonable in the case of small polyps in asymptomatic patients.

The key differential diagnosis of post-menopausal bleeding is endometrial carcinoma, which usually shows intermediate signal intensity (hyperintense compared with the myometrium) on T2-weighted images. Identification of the central fibrous core and of intratumoural cysts favour the diagnosis of EP. Conversely, myometrial invasion, necrosis, a lower enhancement compared to the adjacent myometrium and irregular internal “cystic” areas suggest carcinoma. Endometrial hyperplasia is a premalignant condition that does not have a characteristic imaging appearance (Fig. 2); therefore, any focal endometrial thickening warrants hysteroscopy and biopsy, especially in post-menopausal women.

### Ovarian cancer symptoms in pre-clinical invasive epithelial ovarian cancer-an exploratory analysis nested within the UK collaborative trial of ovarian cancer screening (UKCTOCS) [^75fb4ceb]. Gynecologic Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

One in five symptomatic women with preclinical early stage HGSC reported lethargy and tiredness compared to one in ten of those with early stage CD. Of note, fatigue was reported by one-third of women with clinically diagnosed early stage iEOC in the study by Lurie et al. We too found similar rates (29%) in an international survey of over 800 newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients. However we found that their primary care physicians only reported fatigue in 3% of the same cohort. Fatigue is under reported by clinicians. Poor recording in notes, possibly also contributed to our finding of fatigue in only 5% of clinically diagnosed women. There is much speculation about the role of biological factors in cancer-related fatigue with mounting support for the hypothesis that heightened inflammatory activity and proinflammatory cytokines contribute to cancer-related fatigue. Again, as a symptom to aid differential diagnosis, this must be viewed in the context of 14% of 51,007 postmenopausal UKCTOCS women reporting that they had discussed tiredness, fatigue or lack of energy with their GP in the preceding three months.

Abnormal vaginal bleeding was a rare symptom in early stage pre-clinical HGSC. It is a symptom that in older postmenopausal women is rapidly reported and usually managed by a gynaecologist. As a result, those presenting with bleeding in early stage cancer are almost always clinically diagnosed. In keeping with this, in the trial, among women with symptomatic early stage clinically diagnosed HGSC, 31% (95%CI 22–42) reported abnormal bleeding. Overall 9% of women with early stage clinically diagnosed iEOC reported abnormal vaginal bleeding which is similar to the 12% reported by Lurie et al for stage I-II iEOC and 13% by Chan et al in high-risk early stage epithelial ovarian cancer.

Our finding of symptoms in preclinical patients as well as that of studies like CLOCS put in question the timelines previously reported for patient intervals. This probably reflects the poor recording on symptoms and their onset in medical records. It is likely that these limitations will be magnified with the current trend to ever shorter appointments and the perceived diminishing role of detailed symptom history given the extensive use of imaging. Recall bias of patients is also a contributary factor. There is need to elicit information on specific symptoms directly from patients to obtain accurate information for symptom research.

### Association of endometrial cancer risk with postmenopausal bleeding in women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ab63b016]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

As the worldwide burden of endometrial cancer continues to rise, interest is growing in the evaluation of early detection and prevention strategies among women at increased risk. Focusing efforts on women with postmenopausal bleeding (PMB), a common symptom of endometrial cancer, may be a useful strategy; however, PMB is not specific for endometrial cancer and is often caused by benign conditions.

Objective

To provide a reference of the prevalence of PMB in endometrial cancers and the risk of endometrial cancer in women with PMB.

Data Sources

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, PubMed and Embase were searched for English-language studies published January 1, 1977, through January 31, 2017.

Study Selection

Observational studies reporting the prevalence of PMB in women with endometrial cancer and the risk of endometrial cancer in women with PMB in unselected populations were selected.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two independent reviewers evaluated study quality and risk of bias using items from the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale and the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. Studies that included highly selected populations, lacked detailed inclusion criteria, and/or included 25 or fewer women were excluded.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The pooled prevalence of PMB in women with endometrial cancer and the risk of endometrial cancer in women with PMB.

Results

A total of 129 unique studies, including 34 432 unique patients with PMB and 6358 with endometrial cancer (40 790 women), were analyzed. The pooled prevalence of PMB among women with endometrial cancer was 91% (95% CI, 87%-93%), irrespective of tumor stage. The pooled risk of endometrial cancer among women with PMB was 9% (95% CI, 8%-11%), with estimates varying by use of hormone therapy (range, 7% [95% CI, 6%-9%] to 12% [95% CI, 9%-15%]; P<.001 for heterogeneity) and geographic region (range, 5% [95% CI, 3%-11%] in North America to 13% [95% CI, 9%-19%] in Western Europe; P=.09 for heterogeneity).

Conclusions and Relevance

Early detection strategies focused on women with PMB have the potential to capture as many as 90% of endometrial cancers; however, most women with PMB will not be diagnosed with endometrial cancer. These results can aid in the assessment of the potential clinical value of new early detection markers and clinical management strategies for endometrial cancer and will help to inform clinical and epidemiologic risk prediction models to support decision making.

### Executive summary of the uterine cancer evidence review conference [^48c1de65]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

EARLY DIAGNOSIS

Postmenopausal bleeding is the presenting symptom in 91% of women with endometrial cancer. Ten percent of women have bleeding in the first year after menopause.The pooled risk of endometrial cancer in women with postmenopausal bleeding is 9%.In a U.K. study, 41 of 85 women with endometrial cancer reported that they were not aware that bleeding was a sign of possible cancer.

Techniques for Evaluation

Transvaginal Ultrasonography

Transvaginal ultrasonography is commonly used for first-line evaluation in patients with postmenopausal bleeding. In a meta-analysis, the sensitivity and specificity for endometrial cancer detection with an endometrial thickness threshold of 5 mm were 90% and 54%, and with a threshold of 3 mm, they were 98% and 35%, respectively.For premenopausal women with AUB, multiple studies have shown saline-infusion ultrasonography to be superior to transvaginal ultrasonography in the detection of intracavitary pathology. – One study compared endometrial thickness to surgical or sonohysterogram findings in premenopausal patients and found endometrial thickness to be inadequate for excluding abnormalities.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that ultrasonographic measurement of endometrial thickness in premenopausal women has no diagnostic value and should not be performed.

Office Endometrial Sampling

Office-based endometrial sampling is minimally invasive and cost-effective. The Pipelle catheter is an accurate method of endometrial sampling, with detection rates for endometrial cancer of 99.6% in postmenopausal women and 91% in premenopausal women.The pooled sensitivity of office endometrial sampling for the diagnosis of endometrial cancer was 100% in studies using dilation and curettage (D&C) and 90% in studies using hysteroscopy with biopsy or curettage as the reference standard. Specificity for both ranged from 99% to 100%.The accuracy of office endometrial biopsy is more limited with an inadequate specimen or if the endometrial pathology is not global.In a meta-analysis of 11 studies, the posttest probability of endometrial cancer with a negative biopsy was 0.9%.The SGO and ACOG both recommend that persistent AUB should be further evaluated, with the SGO specifying use of hysteroscopic-guided biopsy. 8,120

Transvaginal ultrasonography—measurement and diagnostic threshold for postmenopausal bleeding. Endometrial thickness is measured as the maximum anterior–posterior thickness of the endometrial echo on a long-axis transvaginal view of the uterus, and early comparisons with endometrial sampling found that an endometrial thickness of 4–5 mm or less reliably excluded endometrial cancer. Transvaginal ultrasonography is appropriate for an initial evaluation if images reveal a thin endometrial echo (less than or equal to 4 mm), given that an endometrial thickness of 4 mm or less has a greater than 99% negative predictive value for endometrial cancer.

### First-time postmenopausal bleeding as a clinical marker of long-term cancer risk: a Danish nationwide cohort study [^18092206]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) refers to any genital tract bleeding in postmenopausal women, other than that expected during cyclic postmenopausal hormone therapy.PMB is frequently encountered in both general and hospital settings,and accounts for ~5% of office gynaecology visits.The incidence of PMB decreases with increasing time after menopause,while the risk of an underlying malignancy increases with increasing age.

The most common causes of PMB are benign, such as vaginal atrophy or benign focal lesions.However, PMB is also the most common presenting sign of endometrial carcinoma. Approximately 5–10% of women with hospital-diagnosed PMB has an underlying endometrial cancer. – Although PMB is most commonly attributed to an intrauterine source, it may also originate from other gynaecological or non-gynaecological sources, such as the cervix, vagina, ovaries, bladder, urethra or lower gastrointestinal tract.Occasionally, PMB also occurs due to non-structural causes such as coagulopathies as seen in haematologic cancers.

While the short-term risk of underlying endometrial cancer has been studied previously, –,, few studies investigated the long-term risk of gynaecological as well as the risk of non-gynaecological cancers, and these studies were limited by size (<700 participants) and selective inclusion of patients from specific hospitals.

We therefore conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study to investigate the long-term risk of cancer and the particular risks of gynaecological, urological, gastrointestinal and haematological cancers after a first-time hospital diagnosis of PMB.

### Pipelle® under ultrasound guidance (PUG) to investigate post-menopausal bleeding. (PUG) [^6df574d7]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Overview TITLE Pipelle® under Ultrasound Guidance to investigate post-menopausal bleeding: Randomised Controlled Trial BACKGROUND Women who are suspected of having endometrial cancer due to vaginal bleeding after the menopause must have a tissue sample taken from this area to determine whether there is an abnormality. ELIGIBILITY All patients presenting with post-menopausal bleeding who have an endometrial thickness of 5mm or above without a contraindication to an outpatient endometrial biopsy. DESIGN Prospective randomised controlled trial enrolling 92 patients. When patients are entered into the study they will randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group will have their biopsy performed under transabdominal ultrasound guidance and the other will have the biopsy performed using the traditional 'blind' approach without ultrasound guidance. There will be 46 patients in each group.

Any woman presenting to her general practitioner or accident and emergency department with post-menopausal bleeding in the United Kingdom should receive an urgent two week wait referral to rapid access gynaecology services. At this appointment women will typically undergo a transvaginal ultrasound scan to assess the gynaecological anatomy, in particular the endometrium. If the endometrium is deemed to be thickened, at more than 4 or 5mm depending on local guidance, sampling is required to rule out endometrial cancer or its precursor, endometrial hyperplasia. ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW-UP Follow up for all trial participants will be the same as for patients undergoing standard assessment of post-menopausal bleeding. Histopathology results will be reviewed within two weeks of the sample being taken and if benign the patient will be discharged from the clinic. Their GP will receive a letter stating that their investigations are normal and their involvement in the trial has come to an end.

If they have further episodes of post-menopausal bleeding their GP will be asked to refer them back to the rapid access clinic on a suspected cancer pathway. If non-benign pathology is found, then the patient will be invited for a further appointment and follow up will be determined as per the relevant protocol. If the laboratory reports that the sample taken is not adequate for histopathological analysis the patient will be contacted and recommended to undergo a hysteroscopy for further assessment.

### Clinical and histopathologic differential diagnosis of venous malformation of the uterine cervix [^289b73e7]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Venous malformations of the uterine cervix are extremely rare. Most lesions are asymptomatic and incidental, but sometimes, they may present with abnormal and/or intractable vaginal bleeding. The study aimed to describe a case of venous malformation of the uterine cervix and discuss the clinical and histopathologic differential diagnosis of this entity.

Case

A 50-year-old woman attended to the gynecology clinic for postcoital spotting and postmenopausal bleeding. Gynecologic examination revealed polypoid, lobulated, bluish, vascular nodular lesions 4 to 1 cm in size surrounding the cervical introitus. The lesions were completely excised via loop electrosurgical excision procedure method. Pathologic diagnosis revealed venous malformations of the uterine cervix.

Conclusions

Venous malformations of the uterine cervix should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with cervical mass and vaginal bleeding. Pathologic examination is necessary in such a case to exclude the possibility of malignant vascular tumor or cervical neoplasm.

Clinical management during menopausal hormone therapy (MHT)—For women with persistent unscheduled bleeding while taking MHT, we recommend evaluation to rule out pelvic pathology, most importantly, endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, and we recommend informing women about the possible increased risk of breast cancer during and after discontinuing EPT while emphasizing adherence to age-appropriate breast cancer screening. Regular clinical follow-up, initially, within 1 to 3 months after starting MHT, and then every 6 to 12 months, allows monitoring of efficacy and side effects and treatment adjustments as needed.

### Practice bulletin no. 149: endometrial cancer [^1d342d65]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Medium credibility.

Postmenopausal uterine bleeding—initial evaluation and ultrasound thresholds: Initial assessment may use either endometrial biopsy or transvaginal ultrasonography, and this initial evaluation does not require performance of both tests. In approximately 2,900 postmenopausal women from 13 published studies, an endometrial thickness of 5 mm or less on ultrasonography had a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 54% for detecting endometrial cancer, compared with 98% and 35% when the cutoff was reduced to 3 mm. When transvaginal ultrasonography is used initially and an endometrial thickness of less than or equal to 4 mm is found, endometrial sampling is not required; thickness greater than 4 mm should trigger alternative evaluation such as sonohysterography, office hysteroscopy, or endometrial biopsy, and evaluation is also warranted if thickness cannot be adequately visualized.

### Postmenopausal invasive endometriosis requiring supralevator pelvic exenteration [^9888a847]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Endometriosis is rare in postmenopausal women. We report a case of invasive pelvic endometriosis in a postmenopausal woman requiring a supralevator pelvic exenteration for palliation of symptoms and for tissue diagnosis.

Case

A 65-year-old woman with a history of total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for endometriosis at age 43 years presented with acute vaginal bleeding, hematuria, and a recently diagnosed pelvic mass. Biopsies revealed endometriosis, and she underwent supralevator pelvic exenteration with vaginectomy, end colostomy, ileal conduit, and coagulation of endometriotic implants. Pathologic examination showed invasive endometriosis and no evidence of malignancy.

Conclusion

Endometriosis should remain on the differential diagnosis for pelvic mass in a postmenopausal woman, although suspicion for malignancy should remain high.

Endometrial cancer—Level B diagnostic thresholds using transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) in postmenopausal bleeding specify when endometrial sampling is not required and when alternative evaluation is triggered. Based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence (Level B), when TVUS is used initially and endometrial thickness is less than or equal to 4 mm, endometrial sampling is not required. If endometrial thickness is greater than 4 mm in a patient with postmenopausal bleeding, alternative evaluation (such as sonohysterography, office hysteroscopy, or endometrial biopsy) should be triggered, as should an inability to adequately visualize thickness.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 734: the role of transvaginal ultrasonography in evaluating the endometrium of women with postmenopausal bleeding [^ae4ae886]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Cancer of the endometrium is the most common type of gynecologic cancer in the United States. Vaginal bleeding is the presenting sign in more than 90% of postmenopausal women with endometrial carcinoma. Clinical risk factors for endometrial cancer, including but not limited to age, obesity, use of unopposed estrogen, specific medical comorbidities (eg, polycystic ovary syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, atypical glandular cells on screening cervical cytology), and family history of gynecologic malignancy also should be considered when evaluating postmenopausal bleeding. The clinical approach to postmenopausal bleeding requires prompt and efficient evaluation to exclude or diagnose endometrial carcinoma and endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia. Transvaginal ultrasonography usually is sufficient for an initial evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding if the ultrasound images reveal a thin endometrial echo (less than or equal to 4 mm), given that an endometrial thickness of 4 mm or less has a greater than 99% negative predictive value for endometrial cancer. Transvaginal ultrasonography is a reasonable alternative to endometrial sampling as a first approach in evaluating a postmenopausal woman with an initial episode of bleeding. If blind sampling does not reveal endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy, further testing, such as hysteroscopy with dilation and curettage, is warranted in the evaluation of women with persistent or recurrent bleeding. An endometrial measurement greater than 4 mm that is incidentally discovered in a postmenopausal patient without bleeding need not routinely trigger evaluation, although an individualized assessment based on patient characteristics and risk factors is appropriate. Transvaginal ultrasonography is not an appropriate screening tool for endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women without bleeding.

### Modern evaluation of the endometrium [^e287bf12]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding in women older than age 35 years, and certainly in menopausal patients, mandates evaluation, mainly to exclude cancer and hyperplasia, but also to better diagnose the source of the bleeding to appropriately manage the patient. In the past, dilation and curettage was the mainstay of diagnosis. This gave way to in-office suction pump-generated biopsies. Most recently, disposable biopsy instruments with their own internal piston to generate suction have become the standard of care. Rarely has such a technique received such widespread acceptance with such limited validation. Transvaginal ultrasonography, when technically feasible, is a noninvasive way to image the endometrial cavity. Saline-infusion sonohysterography is a subset of transvaginal ultrasonography reserved for patients in whom an adequate endometrial echo is not seen or when an endometrial echo is seen but not sufficiently thin. Appropriate understanding and use of transvaginal ultrasonography and addition of sonohysterography when necessary can allow a clinical algorithm that can triage patients with abnormal uterine bleeding to 1) no anatomic pathology best treated expectantly; 2) a global endometrial process, in which case random blind endometrial sampling is appropriate; or 3) a focal endometrial abnormality in which case endometrial sampling should be done with the visualization offered by hysteroscopy. Finally, the incidence of thick endometrial echo found incidentally in postmenopausal women with no bleeding is extremely high (10-17%) and should not trigger invasive endometrial sampling automatically.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® on abnormal vaginal bleeding [^673898bd]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

In evaluating a woman with abnormal vaginal bleeding, imaging cannot replace definitive histologic diagnosis but often plays an important role in screening, characterization of structural abnormalities, and directing appropriate patient care. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is generally the initial imaging modality of choice, with endometrial thickness a well-established predictor of endometrial disease in postmenopausal women. Endometrial thickness measurements of ≤5 mm and ≤4 mm have been advocated as appropriate upper threshold values to reasonably exclude endometrial carcinoma in postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding; however, the best upper threshold endometrial thickness in the asymptomatic postmenopausal patient remains a subject of debate. Endometrial thickness in a premenopausal patient is a less reliable indicator of endometrial pathology since this may vary widely depending on the phase of menstrual cycle, and an upper threshold value for normal has not been well-established. Transabdominal ultrasound is generally an adjunct to TVUS and is most helpful when TVUS is not feasible or there is poor visualization of the endometrium. Hysterosonography may also allow for better delineation of both the endometrium and focal abnormalities in the endometrial cavity, leading to hysteroscopically directed biopsy or resection. Color and pulsed Doppler may provide additional characterization of a focal endometrial abnormality by demonstrating vascularity. MRI may also serve as an important problem-solving tool if the endometrium cannot be visualized on TVUS and hysterosonography is not possible, as well as for pretreatment planning of patients with suspected endometrial carcinoma. CT is generally not warranted for the evaluation of patients with abnormal bleeding, and an abnormal endometrium incidentally detected on CT should be further evaluated with TVUS.

### Cross-sectional imaging of acute gynaecologic disorders: CT and MRI findings with differential diagnosis-part II: uterine emergencies and pelvic inflammatory disease [^55313d6f]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Uterine inversion

Uterine inversion (UI) refers to inside-out overturning and protrusion of the uterine fundus downwards up to or through the cervix that may occur either as an acute (within 24 h) life-threatening obstetric complication of mismanaged labour or in multiparous post-menopausal women from pulling effect of submucosal or pedunculated leiomyomas attached to the fundus; in the latter case, symptoms include pelvic tenderness or pain, vaginal discharge and irregular uterine bleeding. Physically, the vagina is occupied by the inverted uterus, but the clinical diagnosis is challenging without a high index of suspicion. Imaging is crucial to avoid misinterpretation as cervical tumour and to obviate biopsy which may cause profuse bleeding.

Whereas the nature of the “mass” protruding into the vagina is difficult to identify at US, MRI generally clinches the diagnosis. The hallmark of UI on sagittal viewing is a U-shaped uterus with indentation and depression of the fundus, and a “bulls-eye” transverse configuration reflecting the zonal anatomy (Fig. 7 d, f). Additionally, MRI may detect the possible presence of T2-hypointense submucosal fibroids or heterogeneously hyperintense mass-forming tumours. Albeit with limited contrast resolution, in acute settings, CT with adequate image reformation may also allow recognition of UI (Fig. 7 a, c).

Fig. 7 
Surgically confirmed, spontaneous uterine inversion without mass lesions in a 79-year-old woman experiencing muco-haemorrhagic vaginal discharge. Precontrast (a) and contrast-enhanced (b, c) CT images showed a solid, mass-like enhancing structure (plus sign) surrounded by air coursing through the dilated uterine cervix. Loss of the normally convex uterine fundus (thin arrows) was noted. Physically, the upper vagina was occupied by the inverted uterus. Sagittal (d) and axial (e) T2-weighted MRI images confirmed the diagnosis by showing lost convexity and depression of the uterine fundus (thin arrows), U-shaped inverted uterus (plus sign) with preserved zonal anatomy for age and normal homogeneous enhancement on post-gadolinium T1-weighted image (f), which coursed downwards through the hypointense uterine cervix walls (thin arrows) [adapted from Open Access ref. no]

Treatment of UI should consider the fertility and reproductive wishes of the patient, stage of inversion and underlying (benign or malignant) pathology. Whereas in puerperium manual repositioning is possible, post-menopausal UI requires abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy.

### Explaining variation in referral from primary to secondary care: cohort study [^4d518673]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Study design

We identified the most common symptoms associated with referral by examining four routinely available data sources (see web extra).We found close agreement between the datasets. We then applied the a priori set of criteria (box) to the list of symptoms obtained.

On application of these criteria just three symptoms were identified for further study: postmenopausal bleeding, hip pain, and dyspepsia. National guidance states that women with postmenopausal bleeding (who are not receiving hormone replacement therapy) should be referred to secondary care urgently to exclude endometrial cancer.In contrast, we chose hip pain in patients aged 55 and over, assuming that for most this would be due to osteoarthritis.Guidelines acknowledge that “there is very little evidence on which to base decisions about who to refer,” which suggests that greater variation in decisions about referral may occur.Finally, guidance on referral for dyspepsia includes an age criterion whereby urgent referral for diagnostic endoscopy is recommended in patients over 55 with unexplained and persistent dyspepsia of recent onset, but not in patients under 55.We therefore hypothesised that any influence of social factors on referral would differ by age group and that, if present, would be more evident among patients under 55, for whom the referral criteria were less explicit.

The study period was 1 January 2001 to 1 July 2007, except for dyspepsia, where the analysis period began on 1 January 2003. National guidelines for postmenopausal bleeding were first published in 2000and guidelines for dyspepsia were revised in 2002.Thus the analysis periods chosen allowed time for guidelines to be adopted in practice.

Medical diagnoses are coded in the health improvement network using the Read code classification scheme. We identified patients consulting their general practitioner with Read codes relating to the relevant symptoms. We limited our analyses to patients aged 18 years and above for dyspepsia; and 55 years and above for postmenopausal bleeding (because the modal age for menopause is 51)and for hip pain.

To ensure as far as possible that only patients with incident symptoms were examined, we excluded patients who presented with the symptom or who had a related investigation or diagnosis recorded before the start of the study period. We excluded patients with postmenopausal bleeding if they had been prescribed hormone replacement therapy in the preceding six months.

### Familial clustering of leiomyomatosis peritonealis disseminata: an unknown genetic syndrome? [^233ed3ca]. BMC Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

Leiomyomatosis peritonealis disseminata (LPD) is a rare disease and only a relatively small number of cases have been reported so far. No epidemiologic data is available and cases reported have been from different ethnical groups, without any clear ethnical predominance. Except two cases, all cases describe female patients, so occurrence of LPD in males is extremely rare. No familial cases have been reported so far and no link to environmental influences has been found, except for excessive hormonal exposure.

Correct diagnosis is difficult and can only be achieved through invasive diagnostics together with histopathological analysis. Patients usually present with unspecific abdominal problems, e.g. abdominal discomfort or pain, rectal or vaginal bleeding (in cases with uterine leiomyomas) or symptoms of intestinal obstruction. Imaging studies revealed tumorous lesions in some cases, but in the propositus of this presented case no evidence of LPD could be found by any kind of imaging studies (ultrasound, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging). Biopsies can provide the material for a histopathologic diagnosis. However vascularized tumors can cause severe bleedings on biopsy, so that biopsies taken on explorative laparotomy seem to warrant greater safety and furthermore allow for assessing the extent of LPD or exclusion of other diagnoses. Differential diagnosis include peritoneal disseminated metastasis, malignancy or other forms of leiomyomas (e.g. benign metastasizing leiomyoma, a uterine leiomyoma associated with a smooth muscle mass in a solid organ). LPD is regarded as a benign disease, but in about 2–5% of the reported cases a progression towards malignancy has been reported [-]. Malignant transformation from leiomyoma to sarcoma was found on histopathological findings. However the majority of cases take a benign course, sometimes LPD resolves with hormone therapy or does not relapse after surgical resection. Some cases show recurrent growth of leiomyomas and recurrence of symptoms. The occurrence of LPD without intrauterine leiomyomas, in postmenopausal women, LPD with estrogen- and progesterone-receptor negative tumors and the occurrence in men led to the idea, that LPD is a new disease entity.

Endometrial hyperplasia, polyps, and cancer—patients who are receiving or have received tamoxifen and who retain their uterus should undergo annual gynecologic exams.

### Endometrial hyperplasia [^dcbd2654]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

The objectives of this Clinical Expert Series on endometrial hyperplasia are to review the etiology and risk factors, histologic classification and subtypes, malignant progression risks, prevention options, and to outline both surgical and nonsurgical treatment options. Abnormal uterine and postmenopausal bleeding remain the hallmark of endometrial pathology, and up to 10-20% of postmenopausal bleeding will be either hyperplasia or cancer; thus, immediate evaluation of any abnormal bleeding with either tissue procurement for pathology or imaging should be undertaken. Although anyone with a uterus may develop atypical hyperplasia, also known as endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN), genetic predispositions (eg, Lynch syndrome), obesity, chronic anovulation, and polycystic ovarian syndrome all markedly increase these risks, whereas use of oral contraceptive pills or progesterone-containing intrauterine devices will decrease the risk. An EIN diagnosis carries a high risk of concomitant endometrial cancer or eventual progression to cancer in the absence of treatment. The definitive and curative treatment for EIN remains hysterectomy; however, the obesity epidemic, the potential desire for fertility-sparing treatments, the recognition of varying rates of malignant transformation, medical comorbidities, and an aging population all may factor into decisions to employ nonsurgical treatment modalities.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding [^65e83b88]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is a common medical problem, with a direct influence on women's quality of life, utilization of health care resources, and costs. AUB in women older than 40 years and especially in postmenopausal women requires a prompt and efficient evaluation, mainly to exclude the presence of malignant or premalignant lesions of the endometrium. Cancer of the endometrium is the most common gynecologic malignancy, with an incidence in the United States of more than 60,000 cases and mortality estimated at 10,000 women annually. This article outlines the role of transvaginal ultrasonography in the evaluation of cases of AUB.

### Cross-sectional imaging of acute gynaecologic disorders: CT and MRI findings with differential diagnosis-part II: uterine emergencies and pelvic inflammatory disease [^efc9bb76]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

In post-menopausal women, the normal endometrium measures a mean 4 mm (range 1–12 mm) thickness, and endometrial thickness should be regarded as abnormal if ≥ 5 mm or > 9 mm, respectively, in presence or absence or genital bleeding.

In reproductive age, the normal endometrial thickness varies according to the menstrual cycle phases. Shitano et al. prospectively investigated the MRI appearance of normal endometrium in 32 healthy pre-menopausal women in follicular phase (FP) and luteal phase (LP). The maximum thickness of the normal endometrium, measured on sagittal T2-weighted images, in FP (mean 6.5 mm, range 2.1–14 mm) was significantly lower than that in LP (mean 10.4 mm, range 3.9–20.4 mm). Furthermore, on T2-weighted sequences, the signal intensity of the normal endometrium in FP was significantly higher than that in LP.

Uterine fibroids

The most common gynaecological mass, fibroids (leiomyomas) are benign tumours composed of smooth muscle cells and fibrous connective tissues that develop in almost 20–30% of reproductive-age women. In non-complicated fibroids, CT findings include uterine enlargement with lobulated contours, deformity of the endometrial cavity, and presence of focal masses that vary from exophytic or subserosal to intramural to submucosal. When present, coarse calcification is quite specific. Contrast enhancement is variable, so that fibroids may appear isodense, hypodense or hyperdense relative to the myometrium. MRI is the most accurate modality to detect, localise and characterise leiomyomas, which are typically T2-hypointense compared to the surrounding myometrium and of intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images.

### Role of bleeding recognition and evaluation in black-white disparities in endometrial cancer [^69943442]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Advanced stage at diagnosis is an independent, unexplained contributor to racial disparity in endometrial cancer.

Objective

We sought to investigate whether, prior to diagnosis, provider recognition of the cardinal symptom of endometrial cancer, postmenopausal bleeding, differs by patient race.

Study Design

Black and White women diagnosed with endometrial cancer (2001 through 2011) from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare who had at least 2 years of claims prior to diagnosis were identified. Bleeding diagnoses along with procedures done prior to diagnosis were captured via claims data. Multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of race with diagnostic workup and multivariate models built to determine the association of appropriate diagnostic procedures with stage at diagnosis.

Results

In all, 4354 White and 537 Black women diagnosed with endometrial cancer were included. Compared to White women, Black women were less likely to have guideline-concordant care: postmenopausal bleeding and appropriate diagnostic evaluation (70% vs 79%, P < .001), with adjusted relative risk ratios of 1.12-1.73 for different nonguideline-concordant pathways: bleeding without diagnostic procedures, alternative bleeding descriptions, and neither bleeding nor procedures. These pathways were associated with higher odds of advanced stage at diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio, 1.90-2.88).

Conclusion

The lack of recognition and evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding is associated with advanced stage at diagnosis in endometrial cancer. Older Black women are at highest risk for the most aggressive histology types, yet they are less likely to have guideline-concordant evaluation of vaginal bleeding. Efforts aimed at improving recognition-among patients and providers-of postmenopausal bleeding in Black women could substantially reduce disparities in endometrial cancer.

### Postmenopausal bleeding: value of imaging [^ca971d0a]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Endovaginal sonography in combination with HSG is an effective screening tool in evaluating patients with postmenopausal bleeding. Endovaginal sonography is highly sensitive for detecting endometrial carcinoma and can identify patients at low risk for endometrial disease obviating the need for endometrial sampling in this subgroup of patients. In patients with abnormal findings at sonography, a detailed morphologic analysis can be used to determine which patients can undergo blind endometrial sampling successfully versus those who would benefit from hysteroscopic guidance. In patients in whom endovaginal sonography and HSG are inadequate, MRI may provide additional information on the appearance of the endometrium, particularly in patients in whom endometrial sampling is difficult (eg, patients with cervical stenosis).

### Predicting the risk of endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women presenting with vaginal bleeding: the norwich DEFAB risk assessment tool [^70e308a1]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main objective of the diagnostic evaluation of women with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding is exclusion of malignancy. Women with postmenopausal uterine bleeding may be assessed initially with either endometrial biopsy or transvaginal ultrasonography. Initial evaluation does not require performance of both tests. Currently, with respect to mortality, morbidity, and quality-of-life end points, there are insufficient data to comment as to whether transvaginal ultrasonography or endometrial biopsy is most effective for initial evaluation of this group of women. Which approach is used initially depends on the risk of the patient and the nature of the clinician's practice. As it is not clear which approach for evaluation of the endometrium is more effective, we attempted in this study to find a way of discriminating patients at low and high risk of endometrial cancer. This individualised risk prediction will allow clinicians to make more efficient use of the available diagnostic resources and simultaneously minimise false-negative results from various investigations.

Currently, information gained from the clinical history is not taken into account when performing risk assessment for postmenopausal women with vaginal bleeding. The optimal assessment of women with postmenopausal bleeding would be to stratify the population of women into high-risk and low-risk groups on the basis of history and ultrasound scan results. The low-risk group would undergo endometrial biopsy and the higher risk would undergo immediate visualisation and biopsy of the endometrium for definitive tissue diagnosis.

We propose an algorithm (Norwich DEFAB) for predicting the risk of endometrial carcinoma on the basis of the odds of cancer from multiple logistic regression analysis for individual women presenting with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding. Norwich DEFAB provides a quantitative assessment of the risk of malignancy incorporating patient characteristics of diabetes, ultrasound scan assessment of endometrial thickness, frequency of bleeding, age, and BMI.

Since 2008, women presenting with postmenopausal bleeding should be referred for further investigation through a Danish national integrated cancer pathway.This referral triggers prompt investigation by a specialist in gynaecology and should, according to guidelines, include gynaecological examination, abdominal palpation and vaginal ultrasound.In cases with endometrial thickness in >4 mm or irregular endometrium endometrial sampling is recommended. Otherwise, no further investigation of the endometrium is recommended, unless rebleeding occurs.Despite the existence of national integrated pathways, we cannot be sure that all women were referred for or underwent appropriate diagnostic work-up according to national guidelines, which is a study weakness.

We used SIRs as a measure of relative risk, comparing the risk of cancer in our PMB cohort to that expected in the general population. Unlike some women in the general population, women in our cohort are unlikely to have undergone hysterectomy upon the time of PMB diagnosis, which could potentially lead to overestimation of the risk of cancer. Correction for hysterectomy was performed in a Danish study investigating the incidence of cervical cancer.The overall incidence of cervical changed from 17.8/100,000 person-years to 19.3/100,000 person-years after correction for hysterectomies, corresponding to an overall increase of 8.4% in the incidence rate after correction for hysterectomies. The magnitude of this change is not able to explain our SIRs of endometrial cancer of 2.55 during 1–5 years of follow-up and 1.63 after >5 years of follow-up. Moreover, women in our cohort can undergo hysterectomy during follow-up, diminishing the impact of correction for hysterectomy.

In conclusion, a hospital-diagnosed PMB is a marker of a long-term risk of urogenital cancer in the Danish population. The sustained elevated SIR of ovarian and bladder cancer for several years after PMB diagnosis, suggest a need to broaden the diagnostic work-up in terms of normal gynaecological findings.

### Predicting the risk of endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women presenting with vaginal bleeding: the norwich DEFAB risk assessment tool [^d68ffe2a]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Postmenopausal bleeding refers to any genital tract bleeding in a postmenopausal woman, other than the expected bleeding that occurs in women taking sequential hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Because postmenopausal bleeding is the most common symptom of endometrial cancer, when postmenopausal bleeding occurs, clinical evaluation is indicated. Approximately 10% (range 1–25%) of women presenting with postmenopausal bleeding will be diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma (;;). Endometrial atrophy is the most common cause of genital tract bleeding among postmenopausal women. Endometrial hyperplasia and polyps are also common causes.

Two different forms of endometrial carcinoma have been identified. Type-I cancers have an endometrioid histology and account for 70–80% of endometrial carcinomas. They are associated with unopposed oestrogen stimulation of the endometrium and tend to arise in women with obesity, hyperlipidaemia, and other hyper-oestrogenic conditions. Type-II cancers have a non-endometrioid histology and arise in women who are less likely to have the clinical associations seen in type-I cancers. Several risk factors such as obesity, tamoxifen use, increasing age, hypertension, diabetes, and unopposed use of exogenous oestrogens are strongly associated with increased risk of type-I endometrial cancer (;;;;;;). Early menarche and late menopause have also been implicated due to prolonged oestrogen stimulation of the endometrium. Nulliparity as an isolated risk factor does not appear to increase the risk of endometrial cancer, although due to the high frequency of anovulatory cycles there may be an association in women with subfertility. Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer is a significant but rare risk factor, with descendants of an affected family member carrying a theoretical 50% lifetime risk of endometrial cancer.

Currently, controversy exists as to whether transvaginal ultrasonography or endometrial biopsy should be used as the initial diagnostic step for clinical evaluation of women presenting with postmenopausal bleeding. In addition, decisions made about the most appropriate investigations that need to be performed, are not always guided by clinical history. The few studies that attempt to include information gained from clinical history to predict the risk of endometrial carcinoma are too small to develop a predictive model (;).

The aim of our study was to use routinely collected clinical data from history and ultrasound evaluation of the endometrium to develop an algorithm to predict the risk of endometrial carcinoma in women presenting to secondary care with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 734: the role of transvaginal ultrasonography in evaluating the endometrium of women with postmenopausal bleeding [^c6cb03ed]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Biopsy findings insufficient for diagnosis and triage—In a study of 97 consecutive women with postmenopausal bleeding, a pipelle biopsy was able to be performed in only 82% (n=45) with an endometrial thickness of less than 5 mm, and of these women, an adequate sample was obtained in only 27%. Across studies, the range of sampling failure was 0–54%, with a sample size-weighted failure rate for pipelle biopsy of 10.4%. Transvaginal ultrasonography can be useful in triage when office endometrial sampling is insufficient; in one study, 29.8% of women evaluated for abnormal uterine bleeding had an “insufficient endometrial sample” with none having endometrial hyperplasia or cancer after the 2-year follow-up. After an insufficient endometrial biopsy, no further evaluation is necessary if subsequent transvaginal ultrasonography demonstrates a thin echo in a woman with postmenopausal bleeding in whom bleeding has ceased; however, because rare cases of endometrial carcinoma can present with an endometrial thickness of less than 3 mm, persistent or recurrent uterine bleeding should prompt a histologic evaluation regardless of endometrial thickness.

### Endometrial cancer: rapid evidence review [^1d083842]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Incidence and mortality rates associated with endometrial cancer are increasing in the United States. Risk factors include obesity, unopposed estrogen states, estrogen-producing tumors, younger age at menarche, nulliparity, late menopause, and tamoxifen use. There are no recommendations for endometrial cancer screening in individuals at average risk. Abnormal uterine bleeding, especially postmenopausal bleeding, is the most common symptom. Patients who present with postmenopausal bleeding should be evaluated with pelvic ultrasonography or endometrial biopsy. The diagnosis of endometrial cancer is made with endometrial biopsy, most often with Pipelle endometrial sampling. Dilation and curettage is recommended if an adequate sample cannot be obtained, the diagnosis is unclear, or a focal lesion such as an endometrial polyp or mass is present. Treatment of early-stage disease is primarily surgical. Radiation therapy decreases recurrence rates but not survival rates in early-stage cancers. Chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and biologic therapy are used to treat advanced endometrial cancer, and clinical trials are ongoing. Complementary medicine therapies can improve quality of life and survival rates in patients undergoing treatment. Patients should be referred to a gynecologic oncologist; early-stage treatment is associated with longer survival rates. Endometrial cancer survivors should undergo periodic surveillance that includes a history and physical examination.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding: a management algorithm [^fe6cd796]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding is a common problem, and its management can be complex. Because of this complexity, concise guidelines have been difficult to develop. We constructed a concise but comprehensive algorithm for the management of abnormal uterine bleeding between menarche and menopause that was based on a systematic review of the literature as well as the actual management of patients seen in a gynecology clinic. We started by drafting an algorithm that was based on a MEDLINE search for relevant reviews and original research. We compared this algorithm to the actual care provided to a random sample of 100 women with abnormal bleeding who were seen in a university gynecology clinic. Discrepancies between the algorithm and actual care were discussed during audiotaped meetings among the 4 investigators (2 family physicians and 2 gynecologists). The audiotapes were used to revise the algorithm. After 3 iterations of this process (total of 300 patients), we agreed on a final algorithm that generally followed the practices we observed, while maintaining consistency with the evidence. In clinic, the gynecologists categorized the patient's bleeding pattern into 1 of 4 types: irregular bleeding, heavy but regular bleeding (menorrhagia), severe acute bleeding, and abnormal bleeding associated with a contraceptive method. Subsequent management involved both diagnostic and treatment interventions, which often occurred simultaneously. The algorithm in this article is designed to help primary care physicians manage abnormal uterine bleeding using strategies that are consistent with the evidence as well as the actual practice of gynecologists.
