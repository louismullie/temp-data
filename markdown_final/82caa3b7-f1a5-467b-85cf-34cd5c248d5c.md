## Question

Overlap syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "overlap syndrome", specifically focusing on asthma–COPD overlap, and wants a detailed, step-by-step exploration. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching concept and why overlap syndromes matter clinically. Then, I should verify the specific definition and evolution of asthma–COPD overlap (ACO) and its nomenclature. Next, I will examine epidemiology and why estimates vary. After that, I need to check the pathophysiology and phenotypes. Then, I will review diagnostic criteria and the challenges of definition. Next, I should analyze clinical implications and outcomes. Finally, I will synthesize management principles, highlight controversies and knowledge gaps, and briefly note other overlap syndromes for context, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate references and self-corrections where needed.

> Let me first confirm the core concept: "overlap syndrome" is not a single disease but a descriptive umbrella for patients who share features of two or more conditions, often with worse outcomes than either alone. In respiratory medicine, the most studied is asthma–COPD overlap, which GINA/GOLD explicitly frame as a heterogeneous clinical grouping rather than a discrete entity, and this heterogeneity is echoed across other medical domains such as autoimmune liver disease and hematologic malignancies, underscoring the need to treat the overlapping components rather than force a single-label diagnosis [^113nUgAW] [^112t3AiQ] [^114MSgzF].

> Wait, let me verify the terminology evolution before proceeding: initially termed asthma–COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS), the field shifted to asthma–COPD overlap (ACO) to avoid implying a single disease. GINA 2024 emphasizes that ACO is a descriptive label for patients with persistent airflow limitation and features of both asthma and COPD, and contemporary COPD phenotyping literature further notes that GOLD no longer recognizes ACOS as a distinct entity, reinforcing the conceptual move away from a unified syndrome toward treatable traits and phenotypes [^113nUgAW] [^111hz4Pf] [^11391WLg].

> I need to check the epidemiology carefully because prevalence estimates vary widely with definitions and populations. Meta-analytic data show ACO prevalence around 0.3–5.0% in the general population, 3.2–51.4% among patients with asthma, and 12.6–55.7% among patients with COPD, while primary care cohorts and regional studies demonstrate substantial variability, for example 5.3–26.5% in COPD populations depending on the diagnostic criteria used, highlighting the lack of standardized case definitions and the impact of ascertainment methods [^114umgss] [^111xjUvZ] [^116kcwZM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms. I should confirm the pathophysiologic heterogeneity: ACO reflects mixed inflammatory patterns (eosinophilic, neutrophilic, mixed), variable reversibility superimposed on incompletely reversible obstruction, and structural remodeling, with contributions from shared risk factors such as smoking, aging, and early-life influences. This mechanistic diversity supports a phenotype-based approach rather than a single-pathway model [^114UtSKC] [^114gFf3L] [^115ediPp].

> Next, I should review diagnostic criteria and the definitional challenge. There is no universally accepted gold standard, so clinicians often apply syndromic recognition using features of both diseases: persistent airflow limitation with post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC less than 0.70, plus features such as symptom variability, atopy, eosinophilia, and bronchodilator responsiveness. Proposed criteria range from major/minor frameworks to latent class analyses, and comparative studies show poor diagnostic concordance across definitions, reinforcing the need for pragmatic, trait-based assessment rather than rigid algorithms [^111XhfWP] [^112y7Eb6] [^115aZBhM] [^111dywfJ].

> I will now examine clinical implications and outcomes. Patients with ACO generally have worse symptoms, more frequent exacerbations, higher healthcare utilization, and impaired quality of life compared with asthma or COPD alone, and some cohorts suggest higher mortality, although prognostic signals vary by phenotype and definition. Importantly, ACO patients are often excluded from pivotal trials, limiting evidence-based therapy and contributing to undertreatment of the asthma component [^114UtSKC] [^114umgss] [^115ediPp].

> Let me think about management principles and safety. Consensus guidance advises treating the asthma component first because of the risk of harm from LABA monotherapy in unrecognized asthma, so inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are essential and should be paired with long-acting bronchodilators as needed, while avoiding ICS-only strategies in COPD-predominant phenotypes. Macrolides may be considered in select inflammatory phenotypes, and advanced biologics can be explored in type 2–high ACO, though high-quality ACO-specific RCTs are lacking. I should double-check that these recommendations align with GINA and contemporary reviews, which they do [^113F3mp7] [^116s3yAp] [^115Qbc6X].

> But wait, what about controversies and knowledge gaps? I need to ensure I capture them accurately: there is ongoing debate whether ACO is a continuum versus distinct clusters, no consensus diagnostic criteria exist, most pharmacologic evidence is extrapolated from asthma/COPD trials because ACO patients were excluded, and the field is moving toward a treatable traits model emphasizing phenotyping and biomarkers such as blood eosinophils, although VA/DoD guidance concludes evidence is insufficient to use eosinophils alone to guide ICS decisions in COPD or suspected ACO, underscoring the need for better trials and biomarker validation [^115XWDNJ] [^114YbnTi] [^113J31fZ] [^116vpCza].

> Let me consider other overlap syndromes briefly to contextualize the concept. COPD–obstructive sleep apnea overlap confers greater nocturnal hypoxemia, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular morbidity, with CPAP improving survival. Combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE) is recognized as a high-risk phenotype with distinct physiology. Autoimmune liver disease overlaps (AIH–PBC, AIH–PSC) require tailored immunosuppression. Hematologic MDS/MPN overlaps have unique biology and management. And immune-related toxicities like triple M (myocarditis, myositis, myasthenia gravis) illustrate iatrogenic overlap requiring high-dose steroids and escalation strategies, all reinforcing that "overlap" signals worse outcomes and modified treatment paradigms [^116RRd1K] [^1169n6ga] [^114o85cY] [^1163NtzS] [^114MSgzF] [^116MMLB8].

> In summary, I should confirm the practical takeaway: ACO is best viewed as a clinical descriptor for patients with persistent airflow limitation and features of both asthma and COPD. Diagnosis remains syndromic and heterogeneous, outcomes are generally worse, and management should prioritize ICS-containing regimens for the asthma component while layering COPD-directed bronchodilation and phenotype-guided add-ons, recognizing that our current evidence base is limited and that future progress hinges on inclusive trials, biomarker refinement, and a treatable traits framework [^113nUgAW] [^114UtSKC] [^116s3yAp].

Overlap syndromes are clinical entities characterized by **coexisting features of two or more distinct diseases** [^116qREyg], often with worse outcomes than either disease alone [^116RRd1K]. The most common are **asthma-COPD overlap (ACO)** [^113nUgAW] and **COPD-obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) overlap** [^1169n6ga], each with distinct pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, and management [^114UtSKC] [^1169n6ga]. Diagnosis relies on clinical features, spirometry, and sleep studies [^111XhfWP] [^1169n6ga], while management combines therapies for both conditions and is individualized to phenotype and severity [^113F3mp7] [^114VQrkh]. Prognosis is generally poorer in overlap syndromes, underscoring the need for early recognition and targeted therapy [^114umgss] [^116RRd1K].

---

## Definition and clinical significance

Overlap syndromes are defined by the **coexistence of features of two or more distinct diseases** [^115YgjVf], often with worse outcomes than either disease alone [^1162wkJw]. They are clinically significant because they complicate diagnosis and management, increase morbidity and mortality, and are frequently excluded from clinical trials, limiting evidence-based guidance [^1179AP9W].

---

## Common overlap syndromes

Several overlap syndromes are recognized across medical specialties, including:

| **Overlap syndrome** | **Description** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) | Coexistence of asthma and COPD features | Higher exacerbation risk, poorer quality of life, increased healthcare utilization [^114umgss] |
| COPD-OSA overlap | Coexistence of COPD and obstructive sleep apnea | Increased nocturnal hypoxemia, pulmonary hypertension, cardiovascular morbidity, and mortality [^1169n6ga] |
| Autoimmune hepatitis-PBC overlap | Features of autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cholangitis | Requires combined immunosuppressive therapy, different prognosis than either alone [^112xkCvf] |
| MDS/MPN overlap syndromes | Coexistence of myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features | Complex management, often requires allogeneic stem cell transplantation [^114MSgzF] |

---

## Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology of overlap syndromes **varies by the specific diseases involved** [^115YgjVf]. Common mechanisms include shared inflammatory pathways, genetic predisposition, and environmental triggers. For example, asthma-COPD overlap involves both eosinophilic and neutrophilic inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and structural airway remodeling [^113PwRfD].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and challenges

Diagnosis of overlap syndromes is challenging due to the **absence of universally accepted criteria** and significant heterogeneity in clinical presentation [^114YbnTi]. Diagnostic approaches typically rely on clinical features, physiological testing, and biomarkers. For example, asthma-COPD overlap is characterized by persistent airflow limitation with features of both asthma and COPD, diagnosed through clinical history, spirometry, and assessment of inflammatory biomarkers [^113nUgAW].

---

## Clinical implications and prognosis

Overlap syndromes are associated with **increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare utilization** compared to either disease alone [^114umgss]. Patients with overlap syndromes often experience more severe symptoms, frequent exacerbations, and poorer quality of life [^111yXgAX]. Prognosis varies depending on the specific overlap syndrome and the severity of underlying conditions [^115YgjVf].

---

## Management strategies

Management of overlap syndromes requires a **combination of therapies** targeting each underlying condition, individualized based on patient phenotype, disease severity, and response to treatment [^113F3mp7]. For example, asthma-COPD overlap is managed with inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting bronchodilators, and targeted biologic therapies, while COPD-OSA overlap requires continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in addition to standard COPD management [^113g5aoj].

---

## Controversies and debates

Controversies surrounding overlap syndromes include the **lack of standardized diagnostic criteria**, limited evidence from clinical trials, and debates over whether these syndromes represent distinct entities or part of a disease continuum [^115XWDNJ]. Ongoing research aims to clarify definitions, improve diagnostic tools, and develop targeted therapies [^1179AP9W].

---

Overlap syndromes are clinically important entities characterized by the coexistence of features of two or more distinct diseases, often with worse outcomes than either disease alone. They require **careful diagnosis, individualized management, and ongoing research** to improve patient outcomes [^116RRd1K].

### Pembrolizumab-induced triple M overlap syndrome, example of indiscriminate immune activation [^116MMLB8]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Triple M Overlap Syndrome is an ultra-rare and seldom-described immune-related adverse event (irAE) secondary to pembrolizumab therapy. This entity and its namesake are due to auto-immune phenomena involving myocardium, striated muscle and neuromuscular junction, yielding a syndrome of myocarditis, myositis and myasthenia gravis. Since it was first identified in 1975, only 100 cases of this syndrome are found in the literature. With the increasing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for the treatment of various malignancies, however, more cases are likely to be diagnosed in the future. We present a patient who received her first cycle of pembrolizumab therapy 3weeks prior to presentation with complaints of intense myalgias, diffuse muscle weakness and ptosis. Investigative workup revealed myocarditis, myositis and myasthenia gravis. Treatment with high-dose steroids plus plasma exchange drastically improved her symptoms. This case demonstrates the presenting symptoms, diagnostic findings, critical complications and management strategies of Triple M Overlap Syndrome.

Purpose Of Review

The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and obstructive sleep apnoea overlap syndrome is associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates than either disease alone. There is evidence of a bidirectional relationship between the two conditions, with the overlap syndrome encompassing a spectrum of clinical phenotypes.

Recent Findings

This review examines the evidence for the various factors that determine the overlap syndrome, the impact overlap syndrome has on co-morbidities, and implications for diagnosis and treatment.

Summary

The accurate diagnosis of the overlap syndrome is critical given its implications for treatment optimisation and reduction in healthcare utilisation and costs.

### The asthma-COPD overlap syndrome: towards a revised taxonomy of chronic airways diseases? [^116i3pDP]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Most research of treatments for airways diseases has been restricted to patients who meet standard definitions of either chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, yet to distinguish COPD from asthma in adult patients who have clinical features of both can be challenging. Treatment guidelines provide scant advice on how such patients should be managed. With increasing recognition that asthma and COPD are heterogeneous diseases, attention has been directed to the needs of a group of patients with what is now termed asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS), particularly in view of the high morbidity in this population. This Review considers the epidemiology, mechanisms of disease, current attempts to define and diagnose ACOS, existing and potential treatment options, and new approaches to the phenotyping and taxonomy of airway diseases.

Table 1
Proposed design for a randomized trial of azithromycin for the long-term management of asthma. Seven of nine PRECIS-2 domains are recommended as pragmatic and two as explanatory

a PRECIS-2 grades on a scale from 1 (extremely explanatory) to 5 (extremely pragmatic). Column 2 presents recommendations for which end of the spectrum is emphasized

Pragmatic trials primarily ask Does this treatment work? Explanatory trials primarily ask What is the mechanism? Addressing target groups/mechanisms in pragmatic trials of macrolides is desirable and possible as secondary aims by specifying a priori hypotheses coupled with subgroup analyses. We recommend studying a wide array of biomarkers using this approach. It is notable that RCTs of macrolides have been performed and/or macrolides are being recommended in the treatment of many chronic lung conditions (diffuse pan-bronchiolitis, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, COPD, post-transplant bronchiolitis obliterans). A planned trial will test the effectiveness of azithromycin in patients with the "overlap syndrome" (asthma-COPD). It is time to add asthma to the growing list of chronic respiratory conditions that are being evaluated by robust macrolide RCTs that are pragmatic in nature.

In the meantime, patients with severely uncontrolled and/or refractory asthma, or new-onset asthma are increasingly searching the Internet for new information and are sometimes better informed than their doctor about current evidence regarding macrolides for asthma (Hahn: personal observations). Pending more robust data from asthma RCTs that have yet to be performed, how should practicing clinicians respond when such patients request macrolide treatment? As stated above, the ERS/ATS guidelines on severe asthma recommend against the use of macrolides, albeit with caveats that the evidence for this recommendation is weak and provisional. Informal guidelines from a pulmonology research group state that they recommend macrolide treatment only for confirmed diagnoses of atypical lung infection. From a practical standpoint, their recommendation limits treatment only to those who have undergone bronchoscopy; even then the diagnostic sensitivity is likely to be less than perfect due to sampling issues discussed earlier. Both these recommendations have met resistance from patients who have read and understood the evidence (Hahn: personal communication). We offer a third alternative recommendation, repeated word for word from the conclusion of the sole practice-based pragmatic trial of azithromycin for asthma conducted to date:

We report the case of a 24-year-old woman with an autoimmune hepatitis/primary biliary cirrhosis overlap syndrome triggered by an acute hepatitis A. A number of viruses have been proposed as potential triggers of autoimmune hepatitis in patients with genetic predisposition. To date, approximately 10 cases of type 1 autoimmune hepatitis following hepatitis A virus infection have been published in the medical literature. To our knowledge, this is the first case of overlap syndrome triggered by an acute hepatitis A.

### Overlap in the diagnostic criteria of frontotemporal dementia syndromes with parkinsonism [^112qFAtW]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, a significant overlap of diagnostic criteria fulfilment was observed in the diagnostic criteria of different syndromes with parkinsonism in our cohort. This could be interpreted to be limiting the specificity of clinical diagnosis in current clinical practice. The diagnostic criteria for PD clearly differentiates patients from other parkinsonisms, whereas the diagnostic criteria for possible CBS are the least specific. This is a result of shared diagnostic criteria items, and it could be improved upon if other data was included in the criteria (e.g. biomarker data). The development of disease-specific therapies may only begin with the possibility to utilize a well-defined patient group with specific accurate diagnoses. This highlights the urgent need for better patient stratification and diagnostic tools.

### When asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap; current knowledge and unmet needs [^113iHqzQ]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are common diseases that often overlap. The term asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) has been used to define this entity but there remain several speculations on its exact definition, impact, pathophysiology, and clinical features. Patients with ACO have greater morbidity than those with asthma or COPD alone, but the information on the best therapeutic approach to this group of patients is still limited. Current treatment recommendations rely on expert opinions, roundtable discussions, and strategy documents. It is prudent to examine existing knowledge about ACO and determine the path for future research.

### Identifying possible asthma-COPD overlap syndrome in patients with a new diagnosis of COPD in primary care [^116Xm4BK]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Interpretation of findings in relation to previously published work

No universal consensus exists on diagnosis of asthma–COPD overlap, and we, therefore, based our classification on elements from the Global Initiative for Asthma and Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease documenttogether with criteria applied in previously published studies. Furthermore, as our primary aim was to develop an algorithm for identifying individuals with possible ACOS among patients with a new diagnosis of COPD in general practice, the applied criteria had to be obtainable in that setting. Self-reported wheeze has been shown to be far more prevalent among patients classified as having asthma–COPD overlap compared with COPD onlyand the BDR criteria has been recommended and applied in previous studies.,

The average tobacco exposure was found to be 32 pack-years, which is lower than that often reported from clinical trials of patients with COPD, most likely due to the selection of subjects with no previous diagnosis of obstructive lung disease; and in keeping with previous studies, tobacco exposure was higher, and level of lung function tended to be lower, in males compared with that in females. Another important difference between the present cohort and patients enrolled in COPD trials is the high proportion of current smokers (62%) in our study, which points to an important opportunity for guidance on smoking cessation, also because the most common respiratory symptom was cough, by many smokers regarded as a harmless smoking-related symptom.

### Cytokine release syndrome and sepsis: analogous clinical syndromes with distinct causes and challenges in management [^114tcwgg]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Both cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and sepsis are clinical syndromes rather than distinct diseases and share considerable overlap. It can often be challenging to distinguish between the two, but it is important given the availability of targeted treatment options. In addition, several other clinical syndromes overlap with CRS and sepsis, further making it difficult to differentiate them. This has particularly been highlighted in the recent coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic. As we start to understand the differences in the inflammatory markers and presentations in these syndromes, hopefully we will be able to enhance treatment and improve outcomes.

### Asthma-COPD overlap 2015: now we are six [^113PwRfD]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The overlap between asthma and COPD is increasingly recognised. This review examines the new insights, treatment and remaining knowledge gaps for asthma-COPD overlap.

Method

A systematic literature review of cluster analyses of asthma and COPD was performed. Articles from 2009 to the present dealing with prevalence, morbidity and treatment of asthma-COPD overlap were identified and reviewed.

Results

Asthma-COPD overlap was consistently recognised in studies using a variety of different study designs and sampling. The prevalence was approximately 20% in patients with obstructive airways diseases. Asthma-COPD overlap was associated with increased morbidity and possibly an increased mortality and comorbidity. There was evidence of a heterogeneous pattern of airway inflammation that included eosinophilic (in adult asthma), neutrophilic or mixed patterns (in severe asthma and COPD). Systemic inflammation was present in asthma-COPD overlap and resembled that of COPD. Within asthma-COPD overlap, there is evidence of different subgroups, and recognition using bronchodilator responsiveness has not been successful. Guidelines generally recommend a serial approach to assessment, with treatment recommendations dominated by an asthma paradigm. Research is needed into key clinical features that impact outcome, mechanisms and treatment approaches in asthma-COPD overlap. Identifying and treating disease components by multidimensional assessment shows promise.

Conclusions

Asthma-COPD overlap has drawn attention to the significant heterogeneity that exists within obstructive airway diseases. It should be replaced by novel approaches that identify and manage the components of this heterogeneity, such as multidimensional assessment and treatment. Future research is needed to test these novel and personalised approaches.

### Current concepts in clinical features and diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome [^1147noQf]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis and clinical features of thoracic outlet syndrome have long confounded clinicians, owing to heterogeneity in symptom presentation and many overlapping competing diagnoses that are "more common". Despite the advent and prevalence of high-resolution imaging, along with the increasing awareness of the syndrome itself, misdiagnoses and untimely diagnoses can result in significant patient morbidity. The authors aimed to summarize the current concepts in the clinical features and diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome.

### Phenotypes of asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap [^117Wudej]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are considered unique diseases with distinct characteristics. Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap is a disorder in which the clinical characteristics of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease coexist. Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap is a heterogenous condition; patients can have varied clinical presentations. There are significant gender variations among different phenotypes overlap. Age of symptom onset is another important consideration. Severity of symptoms, spirometry findings, smoking history, and type of airway inflammation varies between the different phenotypes. Understanding disease pathophysiology and establishing phenotypic models will improve a precision approach.

### Primary biliary cholangitis: 2018 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^112FKuUF]. Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)–autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) overlap — definition and usage: There is no formal definition of the overlap syndrome between PBC and AIH, and PBC/AIH overlap usually refers to simultaneous AIH in patients who have a diagnosis of AMA-positive PBC and should not be used to refer to patients with AIH who have coincidental AMA. Conversely, "overlap" should not refer to PBC patients with serum antinuclear antibody and a mild degree of interface hepatitis because these are common features of PBC. A PBC/AIH overlap syndrome may also refer to patients with PBC followed sequentially by AIH or, less commonly, AIH followed by PBC, and limited observational data suggest that biochemical response to therapy does not differ in patients with PBC alone.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^111437LB]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established in 1993 by the World Health Organization and National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to develop a global strategy for managing and preventing asthma. GINA reports, now funded independently through the sale of GINA products, have provided the foundation for many national guidelines. They are prepared by international experts from primary, secondary and tertiary care, and are annually updated following a review of evidence. In 2014, a major revision of the GINA report was published, that took into account advances in evidence not only about asthma and its treatment, but also about how to improve implementation of evidence-based recommendations in clinical practice. This paper summarises key changes relevant to primary care in the new GINA report. A noticeable difference is the report's radically different approach, now clinically-focussed, with multiple practical tools and flow charts to improve its utility for busy frontline clinicians. Key changes in recommendations include a new, diagnosis-centred definition of asthma; more detail about how to assess current symptom control and future risk; a comprehensive approach to tailoring treatment for individual patients; expanded indications for commencing inhaled corticosteroids; new recommendations for written asthma action plans; a new chapter on diagnosis and initial treatment of patients with asthma-COPD overlap syndrome; and a revised approach to diagnosing asthma in preschool children. The 2014 GINA report (further updated in 2015) moved away from a 'textbook' approach to provide clinicians with up-to-date evidence about strategies to control symptoms and minimise asthma risk, in a practical, practice-centred format.

### Patient phenotyping and early disease detection in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115a3Mk7]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Low credibility.

The traditional physiological definition of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is of practical use in encompassing the overlapping syndromes of COPD in routine clinical practice, and underpins the continued use of spirometry for diagnosis, screening, staging, and monitoring. However, the diagnostic criteria for COPD have not evolved in step with advances in understanding of pathogenesis, and this approach of including all the components of COPD under one umbrella is under question. The characterization of phenotypic variation is currently recognized to hold the key to better understanding of COPD pathogenesis and the identification of effective novel therapies. COPD demonstrates considerable heterogeneity, and, consequently, patient characterization requires a varied approach and the use of multiple modalities. This review discusses the methodologies that are currently used for patient phenotyping and the approaches that have been advocated for the identification of clinically meaningful phenotypes.

### Diagnosis and management of cancer risk in the gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyposis syndromes: recommendations from the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^1158FFZA]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Juvenile polyposis syndrome — genetic evaluation and surveillance are advised as follows: We recommend genetic evaluation for any individual with 1) 5 or more juvenile polyps of the colon or rectum; or 2) 2 or more juvenile polyps in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract; or (3) any number of juvenile polyps and 1 or more first-degree relatives with juvenile polyposis syndrome (Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Given this risk, we recommend patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome undergo surveillance of the colon and stomach (Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). For timing, we suggest initiating colonoscopic and upper endoscopic surveillance at age 12–15 years, or earlier if symptomatic, and surveillance should be repeated every 1–3 years depending on polyp burden (Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). For syndromic overlap, we suggest patients with SMAD4 pathogenic variants be clinically evaluated for HHT at the time of the diagnosis, including screening for and appropriate management for AVMs (Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome: nothing new under the sun [^115jxfY8]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The debate about whether asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are distinct clinical syndromes is not new; there is heightened interest in understanding the group of individuals with obstructive lung disease who seem to have elements of both conditions because recent studies have demonstrated increased risk for respiratory events and exacerbations. We describe the clinical characteristics of this subtype of disease and suggest 4 working definitions of individuals who would fall into the asthma-COPD overlap category. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these subtypes will hopefully lead into a better understanding of therapeutic strategies that can target specific pathobiologic pathways.

### Recent developments in the management of idiopathic cholestatic liver disease [^114vzpvx]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Overlap syndromes

PBC-autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) or overlap syndrome is a rare entity comprising patients showing features of both PBC and autoimmune hepatitis either concurrently or sequentially and this occurs in approximately 2% of PBC patients. This entity possibly reflects a focal point along a continuous spectrum of autoimmune diseases occurring in patients with a certain genetic susceptibilities or merely due to simple coincidence.

A debate surrounds the diagnostic criteria for PBC-AIH overlap; a recent retrospective study evaluating 134 patients from a single center has concluded that the Paris criteria for diagnosis of PBC-AIH overlap has excellent sensitivity and specificity. On the other hand, a recent study by Neuhauser et al with a cohort of 368 PBC patients and 43 patients with possible PBC-AIH concluded that the simplified AIH scoring system is useful for managing patients with PBC-AIH overlap and should replace the older revised AIH scoring system.

Due to the rarity of overlap syndromes, no long-term therapeutic trials are available to guide the management and evidence is compiled from smaller retrospective trials and studies involving primary autoimmune liver diseases.

Combination therapy of UDCA and corticosteroids has been recommended for managing patients with PBC-AIH overlap as it shows both biochemical and histological improvement. Although some patients with PBC-AIH may show improvement on UDCA therapy alone, however, many patients may require corticosteroids to show a complete therapeutic response. It is recommended that patients with PBCAIH be tried on UDCA therapy and then if no response is detected, corticosteroids can be added. A nationwide study in Japan concluded that the need for using corticosteroids in PBC-AIH overlap can be predicted by a simplified scoring system for AIH. Recently, the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group supported the use of immunosuppressive therapy along with UDCA in patients showing features of PBC-AIH overlap.

COPD and OSA are both highly prevalent, which implies that both disorders occurring together (overlap syndrome) is likely to be common based on chance association alone. However, different clinical COPD phenotypes influence the likelihood of coexisting OSA in that the increased lung volumes and low BMI associated with the predominant emphysema phenotype protects against OSA, whereas the higher likelihood of peripheral edema and increased BMI associated with the predominant chronic bronchitis phenotype promotes OSA. Both COPD and OSA are associated with similar physiological and molecular consequences, such as hypoxia and systemic inflammation, that contribute to cardiovascular and other comorbidities, and pulmonary hypertension is highly prevalent in patients with the overlap syndrome. However, there have been few published reports that have evaluated systemic inflammation and other cardiovascular comorbidities in patients with overlap syndrome. The diagnosis of OSA in patients with COPD requires awareness of relevant clinical features, and screening questionnaires may help identify suitable patients for further overnight study. The recognition of coexisting OSA in patients with COPD has important clinical relevance, as the management of patients with overlap syndrome is different from the management of COPD alone, and the survival of patients with overlap syndrome that is not treated with nocturnal positive airway pressure is significantly inferior to that of patients with overlap syndrome that is appropriately treated.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — eosinophilia and asthma-COPD overlap to guide therapy: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of eosinophilia or suspicion of asthma-COPD overlap syndrome to guide choice of additional therapy (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-added). Evidence cited includes a systematic review in which five RCTs examined blood eosinophil counts with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) addition, maintenance, or withdrawal and the SR showed no difference between ICS containing and non-ICS containing treatments in the risk of moderate to severe exacerbations, with other secondary outcomes mixed; due to mixed results with significant heterogeneity, the Work Group did not recommend for or against using eosinophil counts to decide on ICS therapy, noted evidence for eosinophil counts to inform the decision to withdraw an ICS in stable COPD, and stated there was insufficient data to define asthma-COPD overlap syndrome.

### Treatment patterns in asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome [^1132JDWT]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap syndrome (ACOS) is a complex disease entity with limited guidance surrounding medication therapy.

Objective

To evaluate a patient population with possible ACOS and their medication regimen based on the Global Initiative for Asthma and Global Initiative for COPD joint statement for ACOS.

Methods

This was a retrospective study based at a large clinical practice within a school of medicine. The sample included adults 40 to 85 years old who had an active concurrent diagnosis of asthma and COPD. Patients were considered to have likely inconsistent therapy (only preventive, no rescue medication), inconsistent therapy (neither preventive nor rescue medication), and likely consistent therapy (both preventive and rescue medication or rescue medication alone).

Results

A total of 513 patients were included the study. The majority of the sample were female (75%) and white (87.1%), with an average age of 61 years. About 7% of patients had likely inconsistent therapy, whereas 7.7% had inconsistent therapy to control their airway disease. Never smokers were more likely than former smokers to have inconsistent therapy (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 4.54; CI = 1.86–11.04). Adults 65 years and older were more likely than those aged 40 to 49 years to be in the likely inconsistent therapy group (adjusted OR = 4.01; CI = 1.04–15.34). Patients without any comorbid conditions were more likely than those with 2 or more comorbid conditions to be in the likely inconsistent group (adjusted OR = 3.50; CI = 1.39–8.77).

Conclusion

As the disease definition and treatment recommendations evolve, future studies should continue to monitor ACOS treatment patterns and outcomes.

### Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome [^1179v6oP]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Overlap of asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease (ACO) in patients with obstructive lung disease is growing in recognition, though there is no consistent agreement on the diagnostic criteria for the disease process. Patients with ACO have distinct clinical characteristics and trajectories, which are representative of a heterogenous, multifactorial, and incompletely understood inflammatory pathophysiology. Current treatment strategies are focused on titration of inhaled therapies such as long-acting bronchodilators, with increasing interest in the use of targeted biologic therapies aimed at the underlying inflammatory mechanisms. Future directions for research will focus on elucidating the varied inflammatory signatures leading to ACO, the development of consistent diagnostic criteria and biomarkers of disease, and improving the clinical management with an eye toward targeted therapies.

### Overlap syndrome: a diagnostic dilemma [^114V2SHa]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

We report an interesting case of a young patient who came with a concern for missing teeth and lack of hair on scalp and body. Examination revealed complete absence of teeth, absence of eyebrows, eyelashes and hair over scalp. He was short-statured, had hyperextensible joints and hyperelastic skin, protuberant lips and many other anomalies such that the overall pattern of defects was not recognisable. A wide array of investigations involving the dental and medical faculties were done; however, the final diagnosis could not be reached, since it appeared to involve features of more than one syndrome, thus the name 'overlap syndrome'.

### A comparison of diagnostic consistency for asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap and clinical characteristics study [^115aZBhM]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The diagnostic criteria of ACO have not been unified, and the diagnostic methods used in different studies lead to diagnostic inconsistencies. Furthermore, these methods cannot be used to diagnose the ACO phenotypes and to study the underlying mechanisms. As a future research direction, our team plans to follow up on the clinical characteristics and treatment effects in these patients in a prospective study to propose some potential solutions.

### Asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS) in primary care of four Latin America countries: the PUMA study [^111xjUvZ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma–COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS) prevalence varies depending on the studied population and definition criteria. The prevalence and clinical characteristics of ACOS in an at-risk COPD primary care population from Latin America was assessed.

Methods

Patients ≥ 40 years, current/ex-smokers and/or exposed to biomass, attending routine primary care visits completed a questionnaire and performed spirometry. COPD was defined as post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity (FEV₁/FVC) < 0.70; asthma was defined as either prior asthma diagnosis or wheezing in the last 12 months plus reversibility (increase in post-bronchodilator FEV₁ or FVC ≥ 200 mL and ≥ 12%); ACOS was defined using a combination of COPD with the two asthma definitions. Exacerbations in the past year among the subgroups were evaluated.

Results

One thousand seven hundred forty three individuals completed the questionnaire, 1540 performed acceptable spirometry, 309 had COPD, 231 had prior asthma diagnosis, and 78 asthma by wheezing + reversibility. ACOS prevalence in the total population (by post-bronchodilator FEV₁/FVC < 0.70 plus asthma diagnosis) was 5.3 and 2.3% by post-bronchodilator FEV₁/FVC < 0.70 plus wheezing + reversibility. In the obstructive population (asthma or COPD), prevalence rises to 17.9 and 9.9% by each definition, and to 26.5 and 11.3% in the COPD population. ACOS patients defined by post-bronchodilator FEV₁/FVC < 0.7 plus wheezing + reversibility had the lowest lung function measurements. Exacerbations for ACOS showed a prevalence ratio of 2.68 and 2.20 (crude and adjusted, p < 0.05, respectively) (reference COPD).

Conclusions

ACOS prevalence in primary care varied according to definition used. ACOS by post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 0.7 plus wheezing + reversibility represents a clinical phenotype with more frequent exacerbations, which is probably associated with a different management approach.

### Autoantibodies and overlap syndromes in autoimmune rheumatic disease [^114zSCTC]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

Many patients diagnosed with autoimmune rheumatic disease cannot be categorised easily into one of the established clinical entities such as systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, or systemic sclerosis. The term "overlap syndrome" has been increasingly used to identify such patients and is useful in terms of clarifying prognosis and facilitating disease management. This article reviews overlap syndrome in autoimmune rheumatic disease, with particular emphasis on the associated serological markers.

### Redefining the overlap of asthma and COPD [^111hz4Pf]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

The term asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) has been suggested for people with chronic airflow obstruction that has features characteristic of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 1 People with clinical features of asthma and COPD tend to have worse outcomes than those with either asthma or COPD alone, yet their clinical management has remained unclear. UK guidelines currently do not specifically address this issue, 2,3 but the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) and the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) have published a consensus-based report on the diagnosis and treatment of people with asthma, COPD and ACO. 1 Although 'asthma-COPD overlap syndrome' (ACOS) was briefly used, some thought that it gave the unhelpful impression that it referred to a single disease entity. Here, we consider some of the challenges in managing this heterogeneous group of patients.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^115Qbc6X]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

6. Expanded indications for starting regular controller (preventer) treatment

The GINA report now includes a new table with evidence-based recommendations for initiating controller treatment. The most important change is a recommendation for earlier initiation of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids; for example, in patients with symptoms twice or more a month and/or risk factors for exacerbations, such as a need for oral corticosteroids in the last year. The aim is to reduce asthma risk, even if day-to-day symptoms are not frequent enough to be burdensome.

7. Tailoring asthma treatment for individual patients

The GINA report now describes a framework for personalised asthma management. While national guidelines provide recommendations about the treatment that may be most cost-effective across the whole population, patient-level decisions should also take into account any characteristics or phenotypes that predict the patient's risk or likely treatment response (e.g. smoking status, blood eosinophilia, admission to hospital for asthma in the previous year) together with patient goals and concerns and practical issues such as inhaler technique, adherence and cost to the patient.

8. Patients with features of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

A new feature in GINA relates to the asthma–COPD overlap syndrome. Past guidelines for asthma and COPD have been separate, and most regulatory studies have excluded patients with both conditions. However, many patients have features of both asthma and COPD, including symptomatic smokers with a history of childhood asthma, and patients with asthma and fixed airflow limitation. In collaboration with the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, GINA 2014 included a new chapter outlining a syndromic approach to diagnosis in primary care, with pragmatic advice about safety considerations in choice of initial treatment (avoidance of long-acting β₂-agonist alone if the features suggest asthma, and avoiding inhaled corticosteroid-only treatment if the features suggest COPD). Therefore, it is important that asthma (or asthma–COPD overlap syndrome) should remain in the patient's list of diagnoses, even if they develop fixed airflow limitation.

### Sleep-disordered breathing and COPD: the overlap syndrome [^113g5aoj]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

Sleep-disordered breathing (mainly obstructive sleep apnea [OSA]) and COPD are among the most common pulmonary diseases, so a great number of patients have both disorders; this "overlap syndrome" causes more severe nocturnal hypoxemia than either disease alone. This common combination of OSA and COPD has important implications for diagnosis, treatment, and outcome. Specifically, patients with COPD and OSA have a substantially greater risk of morbidity and mortality, compared to those with either COPD or OSA alone. Only now are the interactions between these 2 systemic diseases being determined and appreciated. Many questions remain, however, with regard to disease definition, prognosis, and optimal treatment. Treatment currently consists of continuous positive airway pressure, and oxygen as needed. Noninvasive ventilation may be helpful in overlap syndrome patients, but this has not yet been well studied.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113nUgAW]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma-COPD overlap — terminology and definitions — 'asthma-COPD overlap' is used as a descriptive label for a heterogeneous group of patients and does not denote a single disease entity; another common descriptor is 'asthma+COPD'. Asthma is characterized by respiratory symptoms that vary over time and in intensity together with variable expiratory airflow limitation, COPD is a heterogeneous lung condition with chronic respiratory symptoms due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities that cause persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction, and 'asthma-COPD overlap'/'asthma +COPD' collectively describe patients with persistent airflow limitation and clinical features consistent with both asthma and COPD and is not a definition of a single disease entity but a descriptive term for clinical use.

### Prevalence of overlap syndromes and symptoms in pediatric functional dyspepsia [^112d3qfk]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In sum, pediatric FD is a heterogeneous syndrome exhibiting variable symptoms from patient to patient with many, but not all, fulfilling criteria for PDS. The clinical presentation of FD also varies with regard to non-FD symptoms, exhibiting significant overlap with IBS as well as symptoms consistent with GERD and OBS. These varying symptom profiles need to be considered in providing care to FD patients. For example, an FD patient with overlap may have a different pathogenic process or respond differently to a treatment regimen than a patient with FD alone or FD with overlap GERD. Likewise, varying symptom profiles need to be accounted for and analyzed in studies involving subjects with FD. Clinical trials need to be designed to fit the patients that are actually encountered, rather than the clean diagnostic boxes we create.

### The triple overlap of COPD, severe obesity, and high risk of OSA: insights from an NHANES analysis [^114G7awn]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are highly prevalent respiratory disorders that are independent risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality. The co-existence of these disorders, known as overlap syndrome, is common, with prevalence rates as high as 66%, depending on the population studied. Overlap syndrome is characterized by more pronounced nocturnal oxygen desaturation, more frequent cardiovascular morbidity, and greater healthcare utilization compared to each disease alone.

The prevalence of severe obesity (body mass index [BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared], ≥ 40) among US adults has increased substantially over the past few decades. Disparities in severe obesity are evident across different sexes, racial/ethnic groups, and socio-economic statuses. It can be projected that the prevalence of severe obesity among overlap syndrome patients will increase and, consequently, more patients will present with "triple overlap" of COPD, OSA, and severe obesity, or triple overlap syndrome. In a small single-center study comparing overlap syndrome patients with and without obesity (BMI ≥ 30), those with overlap syndrome and obesity had an average BMI of 41.5 indicating severe obesity, were more likely to be female, had more severe OSA (i.e. higher apnea-hypopnea index, and more profound depth and duration of hypoxemia), and were more likely to require non-invasive ventilation. Thus, triple overlap syndrome may represent a more severe phenotype at greater risk for poor outcomes and potential disparities in prevalence. No prior study has investigated the US nationwide prevalence trends and characteristics of triple overlap syndrome. In this study, we aimed to characterize trends in the prevalence of triple overlap of COPD, BMI ≥ 40 kg/m², and high risk for OSA (HR-OSA), among US adults overall and by sociodemographic subgroups using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles 2005 to 2008 and 2015 to March 2020.

### Do we really need asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome? [^115XWDNJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

The association of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the same patient, which is designated as mixed asthma-COPD phenotype or overlap syndrome (ACOS), remains a controversial issue. This is primarily because many conflicting aspects in the definition of ACOS remain, and it is extremely difficult to summarize the distinctive features of this syndrome. Furthermore, we are realizing that asthma, COPD, and ACOS are not single diseases but rather syndromes consisting of several endotypes and phenotypes and, consequently, comprising a spectrum of diseases. The umbrella term ACOS blurs the lines between asthma and COPD and allows an approach that simplifies therapy. However, this approach contradicts the modern concept according to which we must move toward more targeted and personalized therapies to treat patients with these diseases. Therefore we argue that the term ACOS must be abandoned and ultimately replaced when new phenotypes and underlying endotypes are identified and a new taxonomy of airway diseases is generated.

### A rare case report of polyangiitis overlap syndrome: granulomatosis with polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^115xfWTW]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is classically described as presenting with the triad of necrotizing vasculitis, asthma, and eosinophilia. Asthma is nearly universal, and while it is commonly severe and of long duration, it is not necessarily so. Cardiac involvement is relatively common (on the order of 30–50%) and accounts for a significant percentage of the attributable morbidity and mortality of EGPA. Other common target end organs include the skin, peripheral nervous system, pulmonary parenchyma (eosinophilic pneumonia and/or radiographic infiltrates), sinuses, musculoskeletal system, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys. Approximately one-half to three-quarters of patients will be either ANCA (primarily p-ANCA) or anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) positive. Limited presentations of EGPA may occur as well.

Overlap syndrome was postulated in 1954 by Godman and Churg, who described a patient with Wegener granulomatosis and eosinophilic pulmonary infiltrates. Polyangiitis overlap syndrome, previously published by Leavitt and Fauci, is defined as systemic vasculitis that does not fit precisely into a single category of classical vasculitis or overlaps more than one subtype of vasculitis. Several polyangiitis overlap syndromes have been identified, however, to our knowledge, there are only several case reports of an overlap syndrome involving both GPA and EGPA.

We conducted a PUBMED literature review using key words 'granulomatosis with polyangiitis', 'Wegener's', 'GPA', 'eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis', 'Churg-Strauss', 'EGPA', 'overlap syndrome' 'Wegener's with eosinophilia' and 'GPA with eosinophilia' in English only journals from 1986 to 2017. Relevant case reports and review articles were found that described cases of overlap syndromes of GPA and EGPA. In this manuscript we report a unique case of GPA/EGPA overlap syndrome and place this case in the context of the other cases that have been previously described.

### How are long-Covid, post-sepsis-syndrome and post-intensive-care-syndrome related? A conceptional approach based on the current research literature [^1141Fftv]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Long-Covid (LC), Post-Sepsis-Syndrome (PSS) and Post-Intensive-Care-Syndrome (PICS) show remarkable overlaps in their clinical presentation. Nevertheless, it is unclear if they are distinct syndromes, which may co-occur in the same patient, or if they are three different labels to describe similar symptoms, assigned on the basis on patient history and professional perspective of the treating physician. Therefore, we reviewed the current literature on the relation between LC, PSS and PICS. To date, the three syndromes cannot reliably be distinguished due similarities in clinical presentation as they share the cognitive, psychological and physical impairments with only different probabilities of occurrence and a heterogeneity in individual expression. The diagnosis is furthermore hindered by a lack of specific diagnostic tools. It can be concluded that survivors after COVID-19 sepsis likely have more frequent and more severe consequences than patients with milder COVID-19 courses, and that are some COVID-19-specific sequelae, e.g. an increased risk for venous thromboembolism in the 30 days after the acute disease, which occur less often after sepsis of other causes. Patients may profit from leveraging synergies from PICS, PSS and LC treatment as well as from experiences gained from infection-associated chronic conditions in general. Disentangling molecular pathomechanisms may enable future targeted therapies that go beyond symptomatic treatment.

### Asthma-COPD overlap syndrome: pathogenesis, clinical features, and therapeutic targets [^114UtSKC]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS) or asthma-COPD overlap captures the subset of patients with airways disease who have features of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although definitions of ACOS vary, it is generally thought to encompass persistent airflow limitation in a patient older than 40 years of age with either a history of asthma or large bronchodilator reversibility. ACOS affects about a quarter of patients with COPD and almost a third of patients who previously had asthma. Compared with their counterparts with asthma or COPD alone, patients with ACOS have significantly worse respiratory symptoms, poorer quality of life, and increased risk of exacerbations and hospital admissions. Whether this condition emerges after gradual shifts in airway remodelling and inflammation in a patient with COPD, as the result of noxious exposures in a patient with asthma, or even as a de novo disease with its own pathology is yet to be determined. Nevertheless, using treatments developed for asthma or COPD that target eosinophilic, neutrophilic, or paucigranulocytic airway inflammation may be a helpful approach to these patients until further clinical trials can be performed.

### Asthma-COPD overlap and chronic airflow obstruction: definitions, management, and unanswered questions [^114YbnTi]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap (ACO) is a common clinical presentation of chronic airways disease in which patients show some features usually associated with asthma, and some usually associated with COPD. There is ongoing debate over whether ACO is a discrete clinical entity, or if it is part of a continuum of airways disease. Furthermore, there is considerable variation among current definitions of ACO, which makes diagnosis potentially challenging for clinicians. Treating ACO may be equally challenging because ACO is an understudied population, and the evidence base for its management comes largely from asthma and COPD studies, the relevance of which deserves careful consideration. In this review, we synthesize the various approaches to ACO diagnosis and evaluate the role of currently available diagnostic tests. We describe the potential benefits of existing asthma and COPD therapies in treating patients with ACO, and the value of a "treatable traits" approach to ACO management. Throughout the review, we highlight some of the pressing, unanswered questions surrounding ACO that are relevant to the clinical community. Ultimately, addressing these questions is necessary if we are to improve clinical outcomes for this complex and heterogeneous patient population.

### Clinical characteristics of eosinophilic COPD versus COPD patients with a history of asthma [^111RHtSz]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

To the Editor:

Eosinophilic COPD appears to be a distinct patient subgroup with a corticosteroid treatment response. Furthermore, some, but not all, studies have shown that higher blood eosinophil counts in COPD patients predict a higher exacerbation rate in the future. The presence of eosinophilic inflammation in this COPD subgroup suggests that a similarity to asthma is present. Indeed, eosinophilic COPD has been labelled as part of the asthma-COPD overlap, also termed the asthma COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS). The asthma-COPD overlap consists of multiple subgroups of patients with distinct clinical and pathophysiological features, and there is a need to further define the characteristics of these subgroups. We have compared the clinical characteristics of eosinophilic COPD patients without any clinical history of asthma, and COPD patients with a childhood history of asthma. The aim was to understand the similarities and differences between eosinophilic COPD and patients with a clinical diagnosis of both asthma and COPD.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116rBY6w]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Background — importance of labels and overlap: Asthma and COPD are heterogeneous conditions characterized by airway obstruction, and the most easily recognized phenotypes of asthma and COPD such as allergic asthma in children/young adults and emphysema in older smokers are clearly distinguishable, yet regulatory studies of pharmacotherapy in asthma and COPD are largely restricted to patients with very clearly defined asthma or COPD and in the community the features of asthma and COPD may overlap, especially in older adults.

### Overlap syndrome of asthma and COPD predicts low quality of life [^111yXgAX]. The Journal of Asthma (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In clinical practice, patients whose airway disease shares features of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remain poorly recognized.

Material and Methods

The study population consisted of 1546 patients with a diagnosis of asthma or COPD or both. Based on patient-reported outcomes and retrospective medical record data, the study population was divided into three groups: (1) asthma only, (2) COPD only, and (3) both asthma and COPD (overlap syndrome group). We evaluated patient characteristics associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

Results

In many respects, the overlap group fell between the asthma and COPD groups. In the overlap group, however, HRQoL was the poorest of all. In the logistic regression model, with the asthma group as the reference, both the overlap and the COPD group showed higher risk for low HRQoL [odd ratio (OR): 1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2–3.2; and OR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.0–3.2; respectively]. In addition, female gender, obesity, duration of disease, disability pension, and coexisting cardiovascular disease were associated with low HRQoL across the study population.

Conclusions

Patients with overlapping asthma and COPD differed from those patients with asthma or COPD only. Overlap syndrome was associated with low HRQoL.

### SCN5A overlap syndromes: an open-minded approach [^114EsZxe]. Heart Rhythm (2022). Medium credibility.

SCN5A overlap syndromes are clinical entities that express a phenotype combining aspects of different canonical SCN5A-related arrhythmia syndromes or a variable arrhythmic phenotype among individuals carrying the same SCN5A mutation. Here we review the literature addressing SCN5A overlap syndromes as well as the principal mechanisms currently proposed. Among others, a multifactorial determination encompassing an interaction between SCN5A variant(s), other genetic polymorphisms, and possibly environmental factors seems the most plausible hypothesis.

### The many faces of asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap [^114fRxCc]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are common diseases that often overlap. The term asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) has been used to define this entity but there remain several speculations on its exact definition, impact, pathophysiology, clinical features, and management. We reviewed recent publications on ACO to obtain more insight of current knowledge and outline future needs.

Recent Findings

Criteria for ACO vary from one publication to another and the many variable features of these patients underline the need to reconsider the evaluation and approach of patients with overlapping features based on clinical traits and underlying biological mechanisms. Epidemiological studies reveal that ACO patients have generally an increased burden of illness and healthcare use in addition to poorer quality of life (QoL) compared with asthma and higher or equal to COPD. However, their long-term outcome seems better than patients with COPD alone. Various methods have been proposed to evaluate these patients but their usefulness compared to 'classical' investigation of obstructive lung diseases remains speculative and needs further evaluation. Furthermore, there are no formal studies that examined and compared the different treatment strategies of well-characterized patients with ACO as such patients are usually excluded from clinical trials.

Summary

ACO is a common condition with variable features and a high burden of disease. There is no consensus on its definition, diagnostic, and clinical features and more research should be done on its optimal management and long-term outcomes.

### Practical tips in bronchiectasis for primary care [^111onoN3]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Box 1 Important concepts for bronchiectasis in Primary Care

Box 2 Practical tips for bronchiectasis in Primary Care

Clinical suspicion.
- A complete clinical history + lung function test + Chest X-ray + basic peripheral blood sample analysis are essential in Primary Care to evaluate the most probable aetiology of bronchiectasis
- **Rule out bronchiectasis if there is**: Presence of persistent and productive cough (especially with a haemoptoic or purulent component) Repeated isolation of pathogenic microorganisms, especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa Uncontrolled COPD or asthma patients, despite correct treatment Chronic respiratory symptoms and an underlying disease that could generate bronchiectasis.

Diagnostic method
- Bronchiectasis is not usually visible in a chest X-ray
- The diagnostic tool of choice is a high-resolution CT scan.

Overlap syndromes
- Bronchiectasis should not be confused with COPD and asthma in diagnosis
- COPD/asthma and bronchiectasis can coexist (overlap syndromes)
- Both disorders should be treated in overlap syndromes
- **Special care with the use of ICs**: use the lowest possible dose.

Microbiological aspects
- Serial sputum examination is important in bronchiectasis
- Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most virulent microorganism
- The persistence of the same pathogenic microorganism is called chronic bronchial infection.

Therapeutic aspects
- Bronchiectasis patients should be managed on a multidisciplinary basis between Primary Care and secondary/tertiary care
- Sputum colour is the best biomarker for telling whether or not a given anti-inflammatory/antibiotic treatment is effective.
- Respiratory physiotherapy/rehabilitation and exercise programmes are key aspects of the treatment
- ICs should be avoided if asthma or COPD with eosinophilia is not present
- Macrolides are usually prescribed in bronchiectasis because of their immunomodulatory properties, rather than their antibiotic properties
- The control of comorbidities and end-stage patients is a key aspect of Primary Care in bronchiectasis
- Inhaled antibiotics currently provide effective treatment to some bronchiectasis patients
- Mild-to-moderate exacerbations should be treated in Primary Care
- The follow-up of post-COVID-19 patients is important since some of them develop traction bronchiectasis, among other pulmonary sequelae.
- Clear criteria for patients referral to secondary/tertiary centres

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1179AP9W]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Unanswered clinical questions in patients with overlapping features of asthma and COPD — there is an urgent need for more research to guide better recognition and safe and effective treatment, because patients who do not have 'classical' features of asthma or of COPD, or who have features of both, have generally been excluded from randomized controlled trials of most therapeutic interventions for airways disease, and from many mechanistic studies. Future research should include study of clinical and physiological characteristics, biomarkers, outcomes and underlying mechanisms among broad populations of patients with respiratory symptoms or with chronic airflow limitation. In the meantime, the present chapter provides interim advice about diagnosis and initial treatment from the perspective of clinicians, particularly those in primary care and nonpulmonary specialties, and further research is needed to inform evidence-based definitions, to provide a more detailed classification of these patients, and to encourage the development of specific interventions for clinical use.

### Syndrome of combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema: an official ATS / ERS / JRS / ALAT research statement [^114o85cY]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Is CPFE a syndrome?

Background and hypothesis

Current management and future study of CPFE will be facilitated by a clearer understanding of whether this entity has clinical relevance (clinical utility) or if it is biologically unique (pathogenic utility). In early descriptions, CPFE had been viewed as the coincidental coexistence of IPF and emphysema, with a common linkage to smoking. In 2005, the description of the characteristic functional profile of CPFE in a series of 61 patients, taken together with the observation of a high prevalence of PH, provided support for "the individualization of CPFE as a discrete clinical entity apart from both IPF and pulmonary emphysema". The authors considered that "CPFE was not just a distinct phenotype of IPF, but deserved the terminology of syndrome as a result of the association of symptoms and clinical manifestations, each with a probability of being present increased by the presence of the other". However, no consensus exists on whether CPFE is a syndrome or distinct entity.

The committee considered the following options for CPFE: 1) coexistence of two diseases with no clinically relevant implications or major pathogenetic significance (two coincident diseases); 2) coexistence of two diseases with clinically relevant implications and/or major pathogenetic significance (a syndrome); 3) a single biologically unique entity distinct from both IPF and emphysema (one distinct disease).

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^114h7pGF]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Clinical features of adrenal insufficiency and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome — this table contrasts overlapping presentations: glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome includes general malaise, fatigue, nausea, muscle and joint pain, sleep disturbances, and mood change, with signs such as Cushingoid features common, especially earlier in the glucocorticoid taper; adrenal insufficiency shows signs including weight loss, hypotension, and orthostasis, and the risk of adrenal crisis is present if not optimally treated with glucocorticoid therapy; timing differs, with withdrawal symptoms occurring at any point during glucocorticoid taper and with higher risk after long-term supraphysiologic exposure, whereas adrenal insufficiency appears only when not treated with optimal glucocorticoid therapy; biochemistry in withdrawal shows normal electrolytes with possible glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia, while adrenal insufficiency shows hyponatremia and hypoglycemia; HPA axis testing is not recommended in withdrawal, and in adrenal insufficiency there are initially low ACTH and cortisol with later normal-elevated ACTH and low cortisol; general remarks note that patients may be asymptomatic at baseline but can develop symptoms — from mild to life-threatening adrenal crisis — after triggers, and recurrence of underlying autoimmune diseases can occur during tapering, with symptom overlap between adrenal insufficiency and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome.

### Identifying patients with asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome using latent class analysis of electronic health record data: a study protocol [^115D6yMj]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are two common different clinical diagnoses with overlapping clinical features. Both conditions have been increasingly studied using electronic health records (EHR). Asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS) is an emerging concept where clinical features from both conditions co-exist, and for which, however, there is no consensus definition. Nonetheless, we expect EHR data of people with ACOS to be systematically different from those with "asthma only" or "COPD only". We aim to develop a latent class model to understand the overlap between asthma and COPD in EHR data. From the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) databank, we will use routinely collected primary care data recorded in or before 2014 in Wales for people who aged 40 years or more on 1st Jan 2014. Based on this latent class model, we will train a classification algorithm and compare its performance with commonly used objective and self-reported case definitions for asthma and COPD. The resulting classification algorithm is intended to be used to identify people with ACOS, 'asthma only', and 'COPD only' in primary care datasets.

### Management of chronic multisymptom illness: synopsis of the 2021 US department of veterans affairs and US department of defense clinical practice guideline [^113pcetu]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2022). High credibility.

Chronic multisymptom illness (CMI) pathophysiology — research needs emphasize that an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of CMI is needed and that this gap is one of the greatest barriers in CMI research and ultimately CMI patient treatment. The guideline notes that intervention studies have used analogous syndromes such as FMS, IBS, and ME/CFS that may overlap but not fully capture the mechanisms, and that clinically relevant subcategories of CMI with different pathophysiological processes may exist. It states that additional research to clarify the specific etiologic and pathophysiological processes in CMI and any relevant subgroups will allow researchers and clinicians to identify, study, and implement treatments that more specifically engage the whole person and more effectively treat CMI. This research should focus on determining whether (and to what extent) CMI overlaps with other symptom-based syndromes, and such research must explicitly justify the selection of specific interventions and putative mechanisms of action based on current understanding of the pathophysiology.

### Pharmacologic management strategies of asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap [^116s3yAp]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The best therapeutic approach to patients with asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap (ACO) is unknown. Current treatment recommendations rely on expert opinions, roundtable discussions, and strategy documents, because patients with ACO have been excluded from most clinical studies in asthma and COPD. Because of the underlying asthma initial therapy, early use of inhaled corticosteroids along with a long-acting bronchodilator is recommended. If maintenance inhaler therapy is not effective, advanced therapies based on phenotyping and identification of treatable traits may be considered.

### Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and the overlap syndrome [^113sd9de]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are highly prevalent chronic diseases in the general population. Both are characterized by heterogeneous chronic airway inflammation and airway obstruction. In both conditions, chronic inflammation affects the whole respiratory tract, from central to peripheral airways, with different inflammatory cells recruited, different mediators produced, and thus differing responses to therapy. Airway obstruction is typically intermittent and reversible in asthma but is progressive and largely irreversible in COPD. However, there is a considerable pathologic and functional overlap between these 2 heterogeneous disorders, particularly among the elderly, who may have components of both diseases (asthma-COPD overlap syndrome). The definitions for asthma and COPD recommended by current guidelines are useful but limited because they do not illustrate the full spectrum of obstructive airway diseases that is encountered in clinical practice. Defining asthma and COPD as separate entities neglects a considerable proportion of patients with overlapping features and is largely based on expert opinion rather than on the best current evidence. The presence of different phenotypes or components of obstructive airway diseases, therefore, needs to be addressed to individualize and optimize treatment to achieve the best effect with the fewest side effects for the patient. Although specific interventions vary by disease, the treatment goals of obstructive airway diseases are similar and driven primarily by the need to control symptoms, optimize health status, and prevent exacerbations.

### The overlap syndrome of asthma and COPD: what are its features and how important is it? [^115ediPp]. Thorax (2009). Low credibility.

There is a need to re-evaluate the concept of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as separate conditions, and to consider situations when they may coexist, or when one condition may evolve into the other. Epidemiological studies show that in older people with obstructive airway disease, as many as half or more may have overlapping diagnoses of asthma and COPD (overlap syndrome). These people are typically excluded from current therapy trials, which limit the generalisability of these trials, and this presents a problem for evidence-based guidelines for obstructive airway diseases. Studying overlap syndrome may shed light on the mechanisms of COPD development. Overlap syndrome is recognised by the coexistence of increased variability of airflow in a patient with incompletely reversible airway obstruction. Patients typically have inflammatory features that resemble COPD, with increased airway neutrophilia, as well as features of airway wall remodelling. Overlap syndrome can develop when there is accelerated decline in lung function, or incomplete lung growth, or both. The risk factors for these events are shared, such that increasing age, bronchial hyper-responsiveness, tobacco smoke exposure, asthma and lower respiratory infections/exacerbations are significant risk factors for both incomplete lung growth and accelerated loss of lung function. Studying these events may offer new insights into the mechanisms and treatment of obstructive airway diseases.

### Overlap syndromes in sarcoidosis: unveiling the masquerader [^113uw3Fz]. Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

As a multi system granulomatous disease, clinical presentations of sarcoidosis are highly variable. In the absence of a stereotypical clinical presentation such as asymptomatic bilateral hilar adenopathy, Lofgren's syndrome, or lupus pernio, a diagnosis of sarcoidosis typically requires 1) compatible clinical presentation, 2) histologic evidence of granulomatous inflammation, and 3) the exclusion of other causes. The clinical presentation of sarcoidosis is often nonspecific and a variety of other causes of granulomatous inflammation can make diagnosing sarcoidosis a challenge for clinicians. "Overlap syndromes" are often used to describe clinical presentations of sarcoidosis that share histologic and clinical features of other diseases, or when the diagnosis of sarcoidosis is made in association with the coexistence of another diagnosis with similar clinical or histologic findings. Because of the risk of diagnostic delay and diagnostic errors, it is vital for clinicians to be familiar with overlap syndromes in sarcoidosis. The coexistence of sarcoidosis with other diseases can also significantly impact disease management and outcomes. This article will review the most current published data on overlap syndromes in sarcoidosis to aid clinicians in diagnosing and managing these complex patients.

### Outcome of absence epilepsy with onset at 8–11 years of age: watershed ages when syndromes overlap [^111QnDQD]. Journal of Child Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Therefore, there is considerable electro-clinical overlap between the syndromes and the cutoff ages of syndrome onset and offset remains controversial. Stratification into a particular syndrome is not always possible at the time of diagnosis and accurate classification may require additional evidence (including about the outcomes) accumulated over time to determine the syndrome. Specific counseling and determination of the risk of generalized tonic-clonic seizures has clinical relevance, as syndromes with associated with generalized tonic-clonic seizures often require long-term antiseizure medications. In addition, determining the risk of generalized tonic-clonic seizures is important, as individuals with generalized tonic-clonic seizures may face distinct challenges than those with absence seizures alone, including risk of seizure-related injury and of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. The study objective is to determine clinical and initial EEG findings to predict the development of generalized tonic-clonic seizures in children presenting with absence seizures in an age range where absence epilepsy syndromes overlap.

### Airway overlap syndromes with asthma [^115YgjVf]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

The airways, defined as the segment of the respiratory system extending from the pharynx to the alveoli, represent a crucial site for various inflammatory airway diseases. Among the most common are asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Due to their high individual prevalence, it is not unusual for a single patient to suffer from two or more of these conditions simultaneously. Beyond this epidemiological coincidence, several pathophysiological links, despite notable differences among the diseases, have been identified. These connections influence not only the mutual prevalence of the disorders but also their clinical management and prognosis, frequently in a bidirectional manner. This constellation of interactions has been termed "overlap syndromes". Overlap syndromes involving asthma are especially frequent, including asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS), asthma-OSA overlap syndrome, and asthma-bronchiectasis overlap syndrome (ABOS). These syndromes often exhibit bidirectional relationships. Asthma, for instance, may aggravate COPD symptoms, prompting modifications in its treatment; it may also worsen preexisting OSA through increased pharynx collapsability, the use of inhaled corticosteroids or contribute to more frequent bronchiectasis exacerbations. Conversely, the presence of COPD can hinder adequate asthma control, bronchiectasis may enhance the inflammatory burden and exacerbate asthma, and OSA can induce harmful nocturnal oxygen desaturations that impair asthma outcomes. These complex and dynamic interactions underscore the importance of recognizing overlap syndromes in clinical practice. An integrated, individualized approach that considers the coexistence of multiple airway diseases is essential for optimizing diagnosis, therapeutic interventions, and long-term prognosis in affected patients.

### Diagnostic challenges of adult asthma [^1154QPyg]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Bronchial asthma is a common disorder that affects about 300 million people worldwide. Its signs and symptoms however, can be present in other pulmonary and/or airway diseases and therefore a careful workup of patients with respiratory symptoms that might be due to asthma is required to a) keep a broad differential diagnosis, especially in cases that do not respond well to standard antiasthmatic therapy and b) attempt to subphenotype patients within the syndrome of asthma to diagnose e.g. precipitating factors, inflammatory subtypes and comorbidities.

Recent Findings

The syndrome of asthma contains a number of different phenotypes that offer the possibility of personalized medicine based on the respective asthma phenotype. There are attempts to combine asthma and COPD in newly postulated overlap syndromes which this review discourages to do but instead, based on new and old information concerning asthma phenotyping, suggests to rule in comorbidities and rule out a number of other diseases that can mimick asthma clinically.

Summary

Bronchial asthma, although one of the most common respiratory diseases, can be mimicked by a number of other pulmonary and airway diseases, and especially patients with so called severe or treatment refractory asthma should receive a detailed diagnostic workup with a rather broad differential diagnosis.

### Respiratory mechanics and ventilatory control in overlap syndrome and obesity hypoventilation [^116f89yU]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Differences and similarities between overlap syndrome and obesity hypoventilation

Although overlap syndrome and OHS are very different conditions, they share some pathogenetic and clinical aspects, and represent substantial morbidity and mortality (Table 2). On the one hand, from the pathophysiologic point of view, the presence of COPD does not favour the occurrence of OSA and vice versa, and hence the occurrence of overlap syndrome is by coincidence. In OHS, on the other hand, there is abundant evidence that it is tightly linked with OSA, and only a minority has nonobstructive sleep-disordered breathing. However, overlap patients have important sleep-related oxygen desaturation and represent a high risk of developing hypercapnia and pulmonary hypertension, even in the presence of mild to moderate bronchial obstruction. OHS patients will, by definition, present always with respiratory insufficiency, and are therefore more often at risk for morbidity and mortality than the overlap population. Both disorders share complex interactions, among which are increased work of breathing related to (central) obesity, alterations of ventilatory drive, various associated sleep breathing disorders and neurohormonal changes such as leptin resistance. However, those with overlap syndrome do not necessarily present with obesity, and the ventilatory drive can be normal, enhanced or reduced and the presence of hypoventilation is optional.

### Global prevalence of asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) in the general population: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114umgss]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are major public health problem and represent a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Asthma and COPD are the most common chronic respiratory diseases worldwide each with a unique natural history and pathophysiology. Asthma is usually characterized by chronic airway inflammation whereas COPD is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and chronic inflammation of the airways. However, patients can sometimes have clinical features of both diseases, and this condition has been termed asthma-COPD overlap (ACO), recommended by joint GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma) and GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) guideline. According to this guideline, ACO is characterized by "persistent airflow limitation with several features usually associated with asthma and several features usually associated with COPD". Furthermore, many studies use the term asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS), but based on the recent change recommended by the GINA and GOLD in 2017, we will use 'ACO' as a term for this condition as it is not considered a single entity but a group of phenotypes. Although asthma and COPD have been well defined, there is currently no consensus on the definition of ACO.

Most previous studies revealed that patients with ACO have more respiratory symptoms, more frequent exacerbations, poor quality of life, higher mortality rate, increased health care utilization, and higher prevalence of comorbidities than those with either asthma or COPD only.

Numerous population-based studies have been carried out to estimate the prevalence of ACO throughout the world, especially in the USA and Europe. However, there is a considerable variation among the studies. The prevalence of ACO has varied widely in these studies from 0.3 to 5.0% in the general population, from 3.2 to 51.4% in patients with asthma, and from 12.6 to 55.7% in patients with COPD. Although there are currently a limited number of population-based studies in this context, it has been growing in recent years.

The global prevalence of ACO remains unknown, and no systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based studies has yet been conducted. On the other hand, due to the considerable heterogeneity among the reported prevalence of ACO, and its significant public health impact, the exact prevalence of ACO is critical for strategic plan and health policy. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the published literature to examine this parameter. We examined the prevalence both in the general population and among patients with asthma or COPD to understand better the absolute burden of this condition.

### Myelodysplastic syndrome / myeloproliferative neoplasm overlap syndromes: a practical guide to diagnosis and management [^114MSgzF]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) overlap syndromes are a rare group of biologically and clinically connected hematologic malignancies that includes chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), the most common subtype, as well as atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, MDS/MPN with SF3B1 and thrombocytosis, and MDS/MPN, not otherwise specified. Given their rarity and overlapping clinical features, accurate diagnosis and risk stratification presents a significant challenge. Therapeutic approaches are largely borrowed from either MDS or MPN and the only curative option for appropriate patients is allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Recent advances have started to uncover the pathobiologic basis for these diseases, leading to novel clinical trials for MDS/MPN overlap syndromes, in particular CMML. This review is a practical guide for the diagnosis and management of MDS/MPN overlap syndromes and presents novel therapeutics being specifically designed for these diseases to improve their historically poor outcomes.

### Cardiac sodium channel overlap syndromes: different faces of SCN5A mutations [^111SZ5Tr]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Cardiac sodium channel dysfunction caused by mutations in the SCN5A gene is associated with a number of relatively uncommon arrhythmia syndromes, including long-QT syndrome type 3 (LQT3), Brugada syndrome, conduction disease, sinus node dysfunction, and atrial standstill, which potentially lead to fatal arrhythmias in relatively young individuals. Although these various arrhythmia syndromes were originally considered separate entities, recent evidence indicates more overlap in clinical presentation and biophysical defects of associated mutant channels than previously appreciated. Various SCN5A mutations are now known to present with mixed phenotypes, a presentation that has become known as "overlap syndrome of cardiac sodium channelopathy". In many cases, multiple biophysical defects of single SCN5A mutations are suspected to underlie the overlapping clinical manifestations. Here, we provide an overview of current knowledge on SCN5A mutations associated with sodium channel overlap syndromes and discuss a possible role for modifiers in determining disease expressivity in the individual patient.

### How are long-Covid, post-sepsis-syndrome and post-intensive-care-syndrome related? A conceptional approach based on the current research literature [^114WwvBA]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Current challenges in diagnosis

LC, PSS and PICS are syndromes in the sense of symptom complexes, whereby not all symptoms need to co-occur for a diagnosis. This results in a certain heterogeneity in the manifestations of the individual syndromes. At the same time, there is a considerable overlap in possible symptoms, which hinders the differential diagnosis. To this end, it is also unclear if patients can suffer from more than just one of the three syndromes. Such simultaneous diagnosis is currently subject to definitional restrictions, as LC can only be diagnosed if the symptoms cannot be explained by another diagnosis. However, sepsis or ICU treatment in connection with COVID-19 disease are alternative explanations for such symptoms, if the three syndromes are not clearly distinguishable in their clinical appearance and diagnostically.

Moreover, the overlapping disorders and symptoms of LC, PSS or PICS are largely based on the same or at least very similar pathomechanisms (Table 1). Such essentially identical pathogenesis questions the distinction between LC, PSS and PICS as three distinct entities in the sense of actually different syndromes. Otherwise, the terms LC, PSS and PICS would only be three different labels, assigned based on different patient histories, or different point of views and the respective professional background of the treating physician, but would ultimately denote the same symptom complex.

Currently, we face a lack of diagnostic and clinical differentiability, and unclear distinction do not allow a clear diagnosis of one or more (coincident) syndromes in patients with COVID-19 viral sepsis treated on the ICU due to a lack of diagnostic marker and criteria. We therefore currently assume that many consequences after sepsis cannot be specifically assigned, while only few symptoms are syndrome-specific (Fig. 2) and caused e.g. by COVID-19 persistence in LC.

Fig. 2
Conceptual illustration of the relation of PICS, PSS and LC symptoms. The Venn diagram shows that there are symptoms that can be attributed to COVID-19, sepsis or the intensive care stay in terms of their etiology. Examples of this are impairments due to viral persistence after COVID-19, or dysphagia after intubation after intensive care stay. There are also symptoms that cannot be specifically assigned, at least not yet, such as depression or cognitive impairment. Figure created with

### Identifying possible asthma-COPD overlap syndrome in patients with a new diagnosis of COPD in primary care [^111ZoCEw]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

A significant proportion of patients presenting with symptoms of obstructive lung disease has features of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), often referred to as the asthma–COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS). In recent years, the ACOS has gained much attention and been extensively reviewed. However, so far there is no generally agreed term or defining features for this category of patients with chronic airway obstruction, although diagnostic criteria have been proposed based on consensus for overlap in patients already diagnosed with COPD.

The proportion of patients with ACOS among individuals with existing COPD is unclear, as it depends very much on the applied defining criteria, but has been reported to be between 15 and 60%. Furthermore, concurrent doctor-diagnosed COPD and asthma have been reported in up to 20% of patients with obstructive lung disease. Given these uncertainties, it appears important to establish useful and reliable criteria for identifying patients with possible ACOS, i.e. an asthma component of their disease, not least when these patients are diagnosed in primary care.

Pharmacological therapy of patients with asthma–COPD overlap can at present not be evidence-based, as this group of patients has, although together with a substantial proportion of all patients with obstructive lung disease, consistently been excluded from participating in clinical trials. So, as clinical trials have until now only enrolled patients with the extreme phenotypes of both asthma and COPD, there is a clear need for clinical trials to establish evidence-based therapy for this group of patients. In the meantime, a number of national guidelines, and the GINA-GOLD ACOS documenthave attempted to establish consensus-based treatment options for patients with ACOS. However, as patients with asthma–COPD overlap seem to be at risk for a poor outcome, including a high risk of exacerbations, it is important to identify this subgroup of patients with COPD to ensure adequate treatment of the asthma component of their disease, including anti-inflammatory therapy, also for patients diagnosed in primary care.

The aim of the present study was to describe an algorithm for identifying possible ACOS in adults with newly diagnosed COPD by applying different diagnostic criteria in a large cohort of individuals at high risk of COPD, but no previous diagnosis of obstructive lung disease, in a primary care setting to facilitate identification of patients with an asthma component of their disease, as this subgroup of patients with COPD is likely to be at risk for a poor outcome.

### A rare case report of polyangiitis overlap syndrome: granulomatosis with polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^111L7vtA]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a systemic ANCA-associated vasculitis characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation and a predilection for the upper and lower respiratory tract. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is also a systemic ANCA-associated vasculitis, but EGPA is characterized by eosinophilic as well as granulomatous inflammation and is more commonly associated with asthma and eosinophilia.

Polyangiitis overlap syndrome is defined as systemic vasculitis that does not fit precisely into a single category of classical vasculitis classification and/or overlaps with more than one category. Several polyangiitis overlap syndromes have been identified, however, there are very few case reports of an overlap syndrome involving both GPA and EGPA in the medical literature.

Case presentation

We conducted a PUBMED literature review using key words 'granulomatosis with polyangiitis', 'Wegener's', 'GPA', 'eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis', 'Churg-Strauss', 'EGPA', 'overlap syndrome', 'Wegener's with eosinophilia', and 'GPA with eosinophilia' in English only journals from 1986 to 2017. Relevant case reports and review articles of overlap syndromes of GPA and EGPA were identified. We aim to report a unique case of GPA and EGPA overlap syndrome and review the cases that have been previously described.

Between 1986 and 2017, we identified 15 cases that represent an overlap syndrome with compelling features of both GPA and EGPA. Patients ranged in age between 21 and 78. Of those whose gender was identified, 80% of the patients were female. All cases described involved the lungs, 60% reported sinus involvement, and more than 50% displayed renal involvement. An overwhelming majority of patients were positive for c-ANCA and demonstrated eosinophilia (peripheral blood or tissue eosinophilia). A preponderance of the cases described were treated with systemic corticosteroids combined with an immunosuppressive/cytotoxic agents.

Conclusion

To our knowledge, there have been very few cases reported of an overlap syndrome of GPA and EGPA. Identification of patients with a polyangiitis overlap syndrome of GPA and EGPA is imperative as prognosis, longitudinal management and treatment modalities may differ between these entities.

### How are long-Covid, post-sepsis-syndrome and post-intensive-care-syndrome related? A conceptional approach based on the current research literature [^1159CMxY]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

If long-term impairments occur after ICU treatment for COVID-19 sepsis, these can be caused by the ICU treatment, the septic course with systemic inflammation and organ failure, or by COVID-19 itself. To date, it is not possible to reliably differentiate between LC, PICS and PSS, as the conditions overlap both in terms of etiology, pathogenesis and clinical presentation. Currently, no diagnostic tools are yet available for a reliable differential diagnosis.

If a differentiation of LC, PSS or PICS proves to be clinically meaningful and relevant, future research is needed to understand the exact pathomechanisms and to identify diagnostic criteria that allow both clear diagnoses of each of the three syndromes and the diagnosis of co-incidences between LC, PSS or PICS (Fig. 3). The exclusion of alternative explanations for the respective symptoms of the individual syndromes does not appear to be a suitable criterion.

Fig. 3
Proposed future research areas on LC, PSS and PICS. Figure created with

For clinical treatment, it is relevant that COVID-19 sepsis can have more frequent and more severe consequences than milder COVID-19 courses. COVID-19 sepsis can also lead to different sequelae than sepsis of other origins. For diagnostics and therapy, synergies can arise from PICS, PSS and LC research as well as IACC in general and contribute to optimizing the care of LC, PSS or PICS patients. "Silo" thinking in individual, clearly defined diseases should be overcome, as it may hinder progress and unnecessarily complicate patient care. The focus should be on adequate diagnostics and therapy for all survivors with long-term consequences after COVID-19, sepsis and ICU treatment.

However, advancing clinical management of LC, PSS and PICS does not make the further molecular differentiation of the exact pathomechanisms in LC, PCS and PSS any less important. Exploring these mechanisms is crucial, as it will enable future targeted therapies that go beyond symptomatic treatment in rehabilitation (Fig. 3). For instance, therapies could focus on the elimination of autoantibodies, eradication of viral persistence, and mitochondrial repair, providing more precise and effective treatments tailored to the predominant pathomechanism in each patient. This dual approach of combining broad symptom management with targeted molecular therapies may hold promise for significantly improving patient outcomes.

### Defining the asthma-COPD overlap syndrome in a COPD cohort [^111XhfWP]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS) has been recently described by international guidelines. A stepwise approach to diagnosis using usual features of both diseases is recommended although its clinical application is difficult.

Methods

To identify patients with ACOS, a cohort of well-characterized patients with COPD and up to 1 year of follow-up was analyzed. We evaluated the presence of specific characteristics associated with asthma in this COPD cohort, divided into major criteria (bronchodilator test > 400 mL and 15% and past medical history of asthma) and minor criteria (blood eosinophils > 5%, IgE > 100 IU/mL, or two separate bronchodilator tests > 200 mL and 12%). We defined ACOS by the presence of one major criterion or two minor criteria. Baseline characteristics, health status (COPD Assessment Test [CAT]), BMI, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity (BODE) index, rate of exacerbations, and mortality up to 1 year of follow-up were compared between patients with and without criteria for ACOS.

Results

Of 831 patients with COPD included,125 (15%) fulfilled the criteria for ACOS, and 98.4% of them sustained these criteria after 1 year. Patients with ACOS were predominantly male (81.6%), with symptomatic mild to moderate disease (67%), who were receiving inhaled corticosteroids (63.2%). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics, and only survival was worse in patients with non-ACOS COPD after 1 year of follow-up (P < .05).

Conclusions

The proposed ACOS criteria are present in 15% of a cohort of patients with COPD and these patients show better 1-year prognosis than clinically similar patients with COPD with no ACOS criteria.

### Identifying patients with asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome using latent class analysis of electronic health record data: a study protocol [^111dywfJ]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are two common different clinical diagnoses with overlapping clinical features. Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) defined asthma based on variable respiratory symptoms and expiratory airflow limitation. On the other hand, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) defined COPD based on persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation. While asthma affects people from the early school age, COPD mainly affects those aged over 40 years with a smoking history. Clinically, the differentiation between the two diseases and identifying their overlap in those older people can be challenging. Co-existence of clinical features of both conditions along with persistent airflow limitation has been recently recognised by a joint committee publication between GOLD and GINA as the asthma–COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS).

However, there are currently no universally agreed consensus clinical definitions for the diagnosis of asthma, – COPD, and ACOS. – Subsequently, the prevalence of these three conditions is highly dependent on case definitions and data sources. –

In studies conducted using electronic health records (EHR), identifying patient groups is further complicated by the limitations of these data, such as missing data and coding errors. – Despite the lack of consensus clinical definitions, we expect EHR data of people with 'ACOS' to be systematically different from those with 'asthma only' or 'COPD only'. Case definitions aiming to differentiate between those patient groups based solely on clinical knowledge or face validity may be inaccurate, and validating them with traditional methods, e.g. review of full patient records, is time consuming and labour intensive. Clustering methods overcome these challenges by automatically identifying subgroups in the population that best explains the patterns in high-dimensional EHR data, without an a priori hypothesis about those subgroups and their labels. Latent class analysis (LCA) is such a method that can probabilistically identify patients with asthma and/or COPD using the available recorded data.

### Are asthma and COPD a continuum of the same disease? [^113GgHa1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are common heterogeneous diseases with significant impact on morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. In most of the cases, the main features and pathophysiology differ substantially between both asthma and COPD, which allows differentiating both entities and providing appropriate treatment. The recognition of a subgroup of patients who present clinically with features of both conditions, asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome, has reignited the question of whether asthma and COPD are different manifestations of the same disease or unique processes, the so-called Dutch hypothesis versus British hypothesis controversy. There is enough heterogeneity in the clinical and mechanistic profiles of these 3 diseases, and subsets of these 3 diseases, to suggest that a new approach relying on the concept of endotypes of obstructive airways disease may be more useful. This characterization has provided the basis for opening new areas of research that may eventually lead to the development of new targeted drugs. This review focuses on the current knowledge of asthma, COPD, and asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome phenotypes with emphasis on mechanisms of disease and how these may define endotypes, providing a more rational approach to research and clinical care.

### Asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS) in primary care of four Latin America countries: the PUMA study [^116kcwZM]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS) prevalence varies depending on the studied population and definition criteria. The prevalence and clinical characteristics of ACOS in an at-risk COPD primary care population from Latin America was assessed.

Methods

Patients ≥ 40 years, current/ex-smokers and/or exposed to biomass, attending routine primary care visits completed a questionnaire and performed spirometry. COPD was defined as post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity (FEV 1 /FVC) < 0.70; asthma was defined as either prior asthma diagnosis or wheezing in the last 12 months plus reversibility (increase in post-bronchodilator FEV 1 or FVC ≥ 200 mL and ≥ 12%); ACOS was defined using a combination of COPD with the two asthma definitions. Exacerbations in the past year among the subgroups were evaluated.

Results

One thousand seven hundred forty three individuals completed the questionnaire, 1540 performed acceptable spirometry, 309 had COPD, 231 had prior asthma diagnosis, and 78 asthma by wheezing+reversibility. ACOS prevalence in the total population (by post-bronchodilator FEV₁/FVC < 0.70 plus asthma diagnosis) was 5.3 and 2.3% by post-bronchodilator FEV₁/FVC < 0.70 plus wheezing+reversibility. In the obstructive population (asthma or COPD), prevalence rises to 17.9 and 9.9% by each definition, and to 26.5 and 11.3% in the COPD population. ACOS patients defined by post-bronchodilator FEV₁/FVC < 0.7 plus wheezing+reversibility had the lowest lung function measurements. Exacerbations for ACOS showed a prevalence ratio of 2.68 and 2.20 (crude and adjusted, p < 0.05, respectively) (reference COPD).

Conclusions

ACOS prevalence in primary care varied according to definition used. ACOS by post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 0.7 plus wheezing+reversibility represents a clinical phenotype with more frequent exacerbations, which is probably associated with a different management approach.

### Pathophysiology of asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap [^114gFf3L]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap (ACO) is a condition in which a person has clinical and biological features of both asthma and COPD. The pathophysiology behind the development of ACO is complex, with various inflammatory cells, cytokines, environmental factors, and architectural changes within the airways, all affecting a patient's clinical manifestation. A better understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms resulting in the development of ACO will help us to better identify potential drug targets and improve symptom burden and overall quality of life for patients living with ACO.

Overlap syndromes

PSC with additional features of AIH

There is a reported 1.4–17% overlap of AIH in adults diagnosed with PSC. Conversely, a prospective study of MRCP and liver biopsy in 59 patients with AIH demonstrated features of PSC in 1.7%. These patients typically have cholangiographic features of PSC in combination with findings suggestive of AIH, including younger age, higher transaminases, elevated immunoglobulins, positive ANA, SMA and/or liver/kidney microsomal antibodies and mixed histopathological changes with interface hepatitis as well as the typical biliary pathology of PSC.

Patients who fulfil the diagnostic criteria of AIH published by the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group respond to treatment with steroids and have a better prognosis than classic PSC, but worse than non-overlap AIH. An AIH/PSC overlap syndrome is more common in children (where it may be labelled autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis (ASC)), with cholangiographic features of sclerosing cholangitis reported in up to 49% of children with antibody-positive AIH. We recommend management of PSC with additional features of AIH according to the EASL guidelines on the management of AIH. The importance of identifying an AIH overlap syndrome is due to the potential therapeutic benefit of immunosuppression, and hence liver biopsy is recommended for those with significantly raised transaminases, immunoglobulins or positive AIH autoantibodies (ALT > 5 × upper limit of normal (ULN), IgG > ×2 ULN, positive ANA, SMA and/or liver/kidney microsomal antibodies). Some patients with features of AIH overlap syndrome progress to a more typical PSC phenotype. In this situation, ongoing treatment with immune suppression may not be effective and patients may require repeat assessment with cholangiography and consideration of repeat biopsy.

Other overlap syndromes

A PSC/PBC overlap syndrome has been reported in only small case series. This may reflect the diagnostic difficulty in those with small duct PSC where the classic cholangiographic features are absent and liver biopsy is often not diagnostic. AMAs are positive in < 5% of cases of PSC.

It is not clear whether IgG4-SC can be an overlap syndrome or if it represents a separate condition with similar clinical features. However, a subset of patients with a diagnosis of PSC do have elevated serum levels of IgG4 as discussed elsewhere in the guidelines

### Understanding asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome [^114Z7Cki]. Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome (ACOS) is a loosely-defined clinical entity referring to patients who exhibit characteristics of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Clinical definitions and classifications for ACOS vary widely, which impacts our understanding of prevalence, diagnosis and treatment of the condition. This literature review was therefore conducted to characterize the prevalence of ACOS and the effect of different disease definitions on these estimates, as this has not previously been explored. From an analysis of English language literature published from 2000 to 2014, the estimated prevalence of ACOS ranges from 12.1% to 55.2% among patients with COPD and 13.3%-61.0% among patients with asthma alone. This variability is linked to differences in COPD and asthma diagnostic criteria, disease ascertainment methods (spirometry-based versus clinical or symptom-based diagnoses and claims data), and population characteristics including age, gender and smoking. Understanding the reasons for differences in prevalence estimates of ACOS across the literature may help guide decision making on the most appropriate criteria for defining ACOS and aid investigators in designing future ACOS clinical studies aimed at effective treatment.

### Overlap syndromes of cholestatic liver diseases and auto-immune hepatitis [^1147Cpxh]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Approximately 18% of patients with auto-immune liver disease present with features characteristic of a second auto-immune liver disease. These cases have been termed "overlap syndromes". The pathogenesis of overlap syndromes is poorly understood, and few data are available regarding the clinical characteristics and outcome of this disease. Therefore, a consensus on the definition of overlap syndromes has not been reached. A common genetic background between auto-immune hepatitis (AIH) and its overlap with primary biliary cirrhosis(PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) might confer susceptibility to a more inflammatory phenotype, probably requiring combined immunosuppressive treatment. This article focuses on the prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment of the overlap syndrome of AIH and PBC or PSC.

Summary of previously reported cases of cutaneous lupus erythematosus/lichen planus overlap syndrome

Our hope is that this proposed criterion will benefit future research by helping to identify cases of this rare disorder and by generating discourse among clinicians to publish their own thoughts and experiences regarding appropriate criteria for and treatment of CLE/LP overlap syndrome. There are several limitations to our proposed criterion. First, many of the clinical and histologic features of CLE and LP intrinsically overlap, which may lead to the overcalling of purely CLE cases as CLE/LP overlap syndrome. Second, many cases of chronic CLE are seronegative, which means that these cases would not be included in our definition of "classic" CLE/LP overlap syndrome; however, these cases may be captured by our proposed "possible" cases of overlap. Ultimately, further studies will be needed to elucidate the pathogenesis and most effective treatments for CLE/LP overlap syndrome.

### A comparison of diagnostic consistency for asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap and clinical characteristics study [^112y7Eb6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is preventable, common, and treatable and is characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation. Asthma is a common, chronic respiratory disease, characterised by variable symptoms of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and/or cough, and by variable expiratory airflow limitation. In some patients, chronic asthma cannot be clearly distinguished from COPD using currently available tests and techniques, and in those patients, it is assumed that asthma and COPD coexist. Asthma-COPD overlap syndrome has been coined to acknowledge that this represents an overlap of common disorders causing chronic airflow limitation rather than being a distinct syndrome. To avoid the impression that this is a single disease, the term ACOS is no longer advised; the descriptive term asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) may be more appropriate. The prevalence rates of ACO range from 15 to 55%, with variation depending on sex and age. The wide range may be due to the different criteria used by different investigators. The prognosis of ACO is often worse than that of asthma or COPD alone, but the evidence for ACO treatment is very limited as few pharmacotherapy studies have examined this population. The different diagnostic criteria used in various regions and by different investigators might also limit the progress of ACO clinical studies. The diagnostic criteria of ACO have not been unified. Previous studies have used their own respective standards, so there was a lack of evaluation among the ACO patients screened by each standard. Our study compared the consistency among seven different sets of ACO diagnostic criteria proposed by previous studies to examine the clinical characteristics of patients screened by different standards, aiming to provide more clinical evidence for ACO diagnosis.

### Defining asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap [^113J1sKJ]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Much interest has been given to the asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap (ACO) in the past 2 decades, but the condition is still ill-defined. There is general agreement that a patient with longstanding asthma who develops fixed airflow obstruction after years of smoking has ACO although defining asthma in the face of COPD can be challenging. Many features of asthma are also found in patients with COPD without indicating an overlap and no consensus exists on which characteristics should be included in the definition of ACO. Nevertheless, some guidance has been issued to help clinicians and researchers to make a diagnosis of ACO and these will be reviewed here.

### Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and non-invasive ventilation in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114VQrkh]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

An important subgroup to consider in the discussion of non-invasive ventilation is the obstructive sleep apnea and COPD overlap syndrome. These patients have been systematically excluded from most randomized controlled trials of non-invasive ventilation in the setting of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and COPD, although they might benefit particularly well from the intervention. Another important consideration is whether one should modify the positive airway pressure modality strategy to continuous positive airway pressure rather than non-invasive ventilation when obstructive sleep apnea is the predominant pathology in the overlap syndrome, akin to the recommendation in the obesity hypoventilation syndrome with severe sleep apnea, where continuous positive airway pressure rather than non-invasive ventilation is the first line option. Patients with the overlap syndrome have lower 5 year survival rates than those obstructive sleep apnea even when treated with continuous positive airway pressure. However, in a prospective cohort, continuous positive airway pressure treatment in patients with the overlap syndrome improved survival and decreased hospital admissions. Whether adding high intensity non-invasive ventilation strategy to adequate end-expiratory pressure to maintain airway patency would serve to improve outcomes in this group of patients is not known. When confronted with patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome and COPD overlap, it might be challenging to determine the primary factor responsible for hypercapnic respiratory failure. Nonetheless, pragmatic goals relating to positive airway pressure treatment for obesity hypoventilation syndrome are similar to chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and COPD and include correction of sleep hypoxemia, obstructive events and hypercapnia. In the absence of robust clinical trials in this population, the authors tend to use high intensity non-invasive ventilation when clinical evaluation points toward COPD as the biological cause for chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, and positive airway pressure treatment when obesity hypoventilation syndrome or obstructive sleep apnea predominate.

### Omalizumab treatment in asthma-COPD overlap syndrome [^113kY2ny]. The Journal of Asthma (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome (ACOS) is a poorly understood disease with an increasing morbidity and mortality. Currently, the most effective treatment for ACOS is unknown and omalizumab for ACOS has not yet been reported.

Methods

We report our experience with anti-IgE, omalizumab treatment on 3 patients with ACOS as a retrospective case study.

Results

After 1 year of omalizumab treatment, patients experienced significantly lower rates of asthma exacerbation and hospitalization and better asthma control test results.

Conclusion

Our study shows that omalizumab may be an effective and safe therapy for patients with ACOS. However larger randomized trials are needed.

### The asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome (ACOS): opportunities and challenges [^112izqGb]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Some individuals share characteristics of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS) has been defined as symptoms of increased variability of airflow in association with an incompletely reversible airflow obstruction. In this review, we present the latest findings in the diagnosis, characterization and management of ACOS.

Recent Findings

Around 15–20% of COPD patients may have an ACOS. Patients with ACOS are characterized by increased reversibility of airflow obstruction, eosinophilic bronchial and systemic inflammation, and increased response to inhaled corticosteroids, compared with the remaining patients with COPD. Patients with ACOS have more frequent exacerbations, more wheezing and dyspnoea, but similar cough and sputum production compared with COPD.

Summary

The relevance of the ACOS is to identify patients with COPD who may have underlying eosinophilic inflammation that responds to inhaled corticosteroids. So far, the previous diagnosis of asthma in a patient with COPD is the more reliable criterion for ACOS. Ongoing studies will clarify if concentrations of blood eosinophils may be useful to identify this subgroup of patients with COPD. If this is the case, the interest of ACOS may shift to that of eosinophilic COPD, which is easier to diagnose and has clear therapeutic implications.

### Assessing symptom burden in myelodysplastic syndrome / myeloproliferative neoplasm overlap patients [^114qTgLP]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm overlap syndromes are rare types of chronic myeloid hematologic neoplasms. Patients with overlap syndrome have similar clinical features, mutations, and disease course, to other chronic myeloid malignancies. Limited data also suggests that overlap syndromes patients experience long standing and at times poorly controlled symptoms that may be underrecognized. In this article, we discuss the etiologies of symptoms in patients with overlap syndromes and currently available symptom burden assessment tools. Overall, symptom burden is an important consideration in patients with overlap syndrome, and efforts are ongoing to further investigate symptom burden and quality of life in this population.

### Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap [^113Lzr4i]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap (ACO) defines a subgroup of patients with asthma who have persistent airflow obstruction or patients with COPD who may exhibit variable airflow limitation and/or evidence of type 2 inflammation. Additional investigations are needed to determine whether ACO represents a distinct disorder with unique underlying pathophysiology, whether ACO patients should be managed differently from those with asthma or COPD, and whether the diagnosis affects long-term outcomes. This article presents the data about the clinical features of ACO, the current information regarding the underlying pathophysiology of the syndrome, and current understanding of therapeutic options.

### Treatment of overlapping asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: can guidelines contribute in an evidence-free zone? [^1162wkJw]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

In their most typical forms, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are clearly distinguishable, but many patients with chronic airflow limitation demonstrate features of both conditions and have worse health outcomes than those with either disease alone. This has been called the asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome (ACOS), but as yet, it lacks a precise definition. However, given the different pathways by which a patient can come to demonstrate features of both asthma and COPD, ACOS is not thought to represent a single disease but to include several heterogeneous phenotypes with different underlying mechanisms. These issues have important implications for guidelines because some existing treatment recommendations for asthma and COPD are in conflict, and patients with both asthma and COPD have specifically been excluded from major pharmacologic trials. As a result, there is little evidence at present to support specific treatment recommendations for ACOS on the basis of efficacy or effectiveness, yet these patients continue to present for diagnosis and management, mainly in primary care. This article highlights the need for clinical guidance about ACOS, summarizes recommendations about its diagnosis and treatment from a sample of national asthma and COPD guidelines, and proposes a way forward, as suggested in a collaborative Global Initiative for Asthma/Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease report, to provide health professionals with interim recommendations about syndromic recognition and initial treatment based on both potential effectiveness and potential risk. Additional research in broad populations is urgently needed to develop a precise definition for ACOS, characterize its phenotypes, and identify opportunities for targeted treatment.
