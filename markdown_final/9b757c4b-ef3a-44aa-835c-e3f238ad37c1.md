## Question

Low Hemoglobin A, increased hemoglobin A2 quant, and presence of Hb C indicates most likely what?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to interpret a hemoglobin pattern of low HbA, increased HbA2, and presence of HbC, and to determine the most likely diagnosis and next steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what each hemoglobin fraction represents and how they are normally distributed. Then, I should verify the classic diagnostic implications of elevated HbA2 and the meaning of detecting HbC. Next, I will integrate these findings into a coherent genotype, consider modifiers like alpha thalassemia and iron deficiency, and rule out alternative explanations. Finally, I will outline confirmatory testing, counseling, and management implications, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the components and their usual ranges. HbA is the adult form composed of two alpha and two beta chains and normally comprises the vast majority of total hemoglobin, HbA2 is a minor hemoglobin made of two alpha and two delta chains and is typically about 2–3 percent of total hemoglobin, and HbC is a structural beta-globin variant caused by a single nucleotide substitution that alters the beta chain, which when present indicates carriage of the HbC allele [^114AX1p8].

> Now, I should verify the diagnostic significance of an increased HbA2. Wait, let me double-check the threshold before I jump ahead. Elevated HbA2 is the most significant laboratory marker for beta thalassemia trait, with a commonly used diagnostic cutoff of 3.5 percent or higher, though some programs use slightly higher action values in screening algorithms, and accurate quantification is essential because method and context can affect results [^115JHfQD] [^1178jDCn]. Hold on, I should also consider confounders; HbA2 can be artifactually elevated or misread in certain settings, and pregnancy or HIV therapy have been reported to raise HbA2, so I need to ensure the measurement is valid and interpreted with red cell indices and iron studies before concluding beta thalassemia trait [^114sMcD8] [^112iM4qa] [^116bC38c].

> Next, I will examine the implication of detecting HbC. The presence of HbC on electrophoresis or chromatography indicates heterozygosity for the HbC allele, i.e., hemoglobin C trait, which is a structural variant of the beta-globin gene and is distinct from thalassemia, which is a quantitative synthesis disorder [^notfound]. I need to ensure I do not conflate HbC with thalassemia; they are genetically and pathophysiologically different, though they can coexist in the same individual [^notfound].

> Integrating these findings, I should confirm the most likely genotype. Low HbA with increased HbA2 and the presence of HbC is best explained by compound heterozygosity for beta thalassemia trait and hemoglobin C, commonly written as HbC/beta thalassemia, where one parental allele is the HbC variant and the other is a beta thalassemia mutation causing reduced beta-chain production and compensatory HbA2 elevation [^notfound]. Let me reconsider whether homozygous HbC could mimic this; no, homozygous HbC would typically show predominantly HbC with near-absent HbA and would not have the elevated HbA2 that signals beta thalassemia, so the pattern here points to compound heterozygosity rather than simple HbC homozygosity [^notfound].

> I should now review the expected hematologic phenotype to ensure internal consistency. Patients with HbC/beta thalassemia generally have microcytosis and hypochromia due to impaired beta-chain synthesis and HbC-related red cell changes, with anemia that can range from mild to moderately severe depending on the specific beta thalassemia mutation and coinherited modifiers, so low HbA reflects reduced normal adult hemoglobin production and the elevated HbA2 reflects delta-chain compensation in beta thalassemia [^notfound]. But wait, what if alpha thalassemia is also present; coinheritance of alpha thalassemia can ameliorate the severity of beta thalassemia by reducing alpha chain excess, so I should keep that possibility in mind when the phenotype is milder than expected [^112BAsin].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without excluding alternatives. I need to check for iron deficiency, which can lower HbA2 and potentially mask a thalassemia diagnosis, so normal or high HbA2 in the face of iron deficiency would actually strengthen the case for beta thalassemia trait, whereas low HbA2 could obscure it; thus, iron studies are essential to interpret HbA2 accurately in this context [^111qYKnh] [^111wbP4h]. I should also verify that the HbA2 quantification method is reliable in the presence of HbC; most modern HPLC and capillary electrophoresis platforms quantify HbA2 accurately even with common variants, but I should confirm the laboratory's method and any known interferences before final interpretation [^115JHfQD].

> Next, I should review confirmatory testing. Molecular genetic testing is the definitive approach to identify the specific beta thalassemia mutation and to confirm HbC status, and it is recommended when hemoglobin analysis suggests a complex or compound hemoglobinopathy or when results are discordant with the clinical picture; this also enables accurate counseling and family planning [^111yeUaE] [^117W34wZ]. Let me first confirm that guidelines endorse DNA-based diagnostics in this setting; yes, contemporary reviews emphasize molecular confirmation for precise classification and cascade screening of relatives [^111yeUaE] [^117W34wZ].

> I will now examine counseling and management implications. HbC/beta thalassemia is a chronic hemolytic process with risk of iron overload from increased intestinal absorption and transfusions, so I should counsel on avoidance of unnecessary iron, monitor ferritin and transferrin saturation, and arrange genetic counseling for family members and reproductive planning; management is individualized based on anemia severity and complications, with some patients requiring intermittent or chronic transfusion and iron chelation if transfusion-dependent [^11746xaS] [^117W34wZ]. Wait, I should verify that iron overload risk is indeed a concern in non–transfusion-dependent thalassemia intermedia phenotypes; yes, even without regular transfusion, ineffective erythropoiesis drives iron loading, so surveillance and judicious iron management are warranted [^11746xaS].

> In summary, I should double-check that my conclusion aligns with the data. The triad of low HbA, increased HbA2, and presence of HbC most likely reflects compound heterozygosity for beta thalassemia trait and hemoglobin C, i.e. HbC/beta thalassemia, which explains the reduced normal adult hemoglobin, the diagnostic elevation of HbA2 from beta thalassemia, and the presence of HbC from the structural variant; confirmatory molecular testing and iron studies will refine the diagnosis and guide management and counseling [^notfound].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **compound heterozygous β-thalassemia (β-thalassemia/HbC)** [^notfound], characterized by low HbA, elevated HbA2, and presence of HbC on hemoglobin electrophoresis [^notfound]. This reflects reduced β-globin synthesis from β-thalassemia and co-inheritance of the HbC variant, producing microcytic, hypochromic anemia with mild to moderate severity [^11746xaS]. Confirm with **hemoglobin electrophoresis** [^117Qtn7C] and **genetic testing** [^117W34wZ], and counsel on inheritance and pregnancy implications [^111yeUaE].

## Clinical significance of laboratory findings

### Low hemoglobin A (HbA)

Low HbA reflects **reduced β-globin synthesis** due to β-thalassemia mutations, leading to microcytic, hypochromic anemia [^1154PtmH].

---

### Increased hemoglobin A2 (HbA2)

Increased HbA2 is a hallmark of β-thalassemia trait and disease [^115JHfQD], typically 3.5–7% in carriers and higher in affected individuals [^112sww17]. It reflects **compensatory δ-globin synthesis** and is a key diagnostic marker [^114AX1p8].

---

### Presence of hemoglobin C (HbC)

HbC results from a **Glu6Lys β-globin mutation** [^notfound]; when present with β-thalassemia, it indicates compound heterozygosity and contributes to anemia severity [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology of compound heterozygous β-thalassemia (β-thalassemia/HbC)

- **Β-thalassemia**: Reduced or absent β-globin synthesis causes α/β-globin imbalance, ineffective erythropoiesis, and hemolysis [^11746xaS].
- **HbC**: The HbC variant alters red cell deformability, increases rigidity, and promotes hemolysis, worsening anemia when combined with β-thalassemia [^notfound].
- **Combined effect**: The combination yields moderate anemia with microcytosis, hypochromia, and splenomegaly, often requiring intermittent transfusions [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation and complications

Patients typically present with:

- **Anemia**: Mild to moderate, often requiring intermittent transfusions [^notfound].
- **Splenomegaly**: Common due to increased red cell destruction [^notfound].
- **Jaundice**: From chronic hemolysis [^notfound].
- **Growth retardation**: In untreated or poorly managed cases [^notfound].
- **Iron overload**: From repeated transfusions and increased intestinal absorption [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation

Confirm the diagnosis with:

- **Hemoglobin electrophoresis**: Quantifies HbA, HbA2, and HbC; typical pattern shows low HbA, elevated HbA2, and HbC present [^111wbP4h].
- **Genetic testing**: Identifies β-thalassemia mutations and HbC variant, confirming compound heterozygosity [^112sww17].
- **Family studies**: Assess carrier status and genetic counseling needs [^117W34wZ].

---

## Management strategies

Management includes:

- **Regular monitoring**: Track hemoglobin, ferritin, and liver function [^notfound].
- **Transfusion therapy**: Intermittent transfusions as needed to maintain hemoglobin levels [^notfound].
- **Iron chelation**: Prevent or treat iron overload from transfusions [^notfound].
- **Splenectomy**: Consider for symptomatic splenomegaly or hypersplenism [^notfound].
- **Genetic counseling**: Essential for family planning and prenatal diagnosis [^117W34wZ].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **generally favorable** with appropriate management, though severity varies with the specific β-thalassemia mutation and HbC expression [^111yeUaE]. Regular follow-up and adherence to therapy are critical to prevent complications [^11746xaS].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **compound heterozygous β-thalassemia (β-thalassemia/HbC)** [^111yeUaE], defined by low HbA, elevated HbA2, and HbC on electrophoresis. Confirm with hemoglobin electrophoresis and genetic testing, then manage with transfusions, iron chelation, and genetic counseling [^117Qtn7C].

### Increased haemoglobin A2 percentage in HIV infection: disease or treatment? [^112iM4qa]. AIDS (2007). Low credibility.

An elevated haemoglobin A2 percentage has been reported in HIV-infected patients, possibly attributable to therapy. In cross-sectional and cohort studies we have established that A2 is often elevated in untreated patients; a further rise during treatment is attributable specifically to zidovudine. The haemoglobin A2 may be high enough to lead to a misdiagnosis of beta thalassemia trait if there is a lack of awareness of this unexpected effect of HIV infection and its treatment.

### The role of haemoglobin A (2) testing in the diagnosis of thalassaemias and related haemoglobinopathies [^115JHfQD]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

The increase in haemoglobin (Hb)A(2) level is the most significant parameter in the identification of beta thalassaemia carriers. However, in some cases the level of HbA(2) is not typically elevated and some difficulties may arise in making the diagnosis. For these reasons the quantification of HbA(2) has to be performed with great accuracy and the results must be interpreted together with other haematological and biochemical evidence. The present document includes comments on the need for accuracy and standardisation, and on the interpretation of the HbA(2) value, reviewing the most crucial aspects related to this test. A practical flow-chart is presented to summarise the significance of HbA(2) estimation in different thalassaemia syndromes and related haemoglobinopathies.

### Implications of increased haemoglobin A2 values in HIV positive women in the antenatal clinic [^116bC38c]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Universal antenatal haemoglobinopathy screening in this hospital has identified several women with increased haemoglobin A(2) values, but without hypochromic microcytic red cell indices. This report describes two cases where there is evidence that the raised haemoglobin A(2) value is not caused by heterozygous beta thalassaemia, but rather results from these patients being human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive and on antiretroviral therapy. This will have important implications as universal antenatal haemoglobinopathy screening becomes more widespread, and as the number of HIV positive women of childbearing age increases.

### Current controversies in the use of haemoglobin A1c [^115RTvpq]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) has recently been adopted by the World Health Organization into its recommended criteria for diabetes diagnosis. Much debate continues regarding the relative benefits and potential disadvantages surrounding the use of HbA(1c) for this purpose. There is a lack of consensus as to whether this alteration to the definition of diabetes is a step forward or whether it could add further confusion and ambiguity to the debate on the method and criteria for the diagnosis of this globally important disease. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current issues surrounding how HbA(1c) is measured and reported; and of the evidence for and against its use in diagnosis.

### Work-up of patients with decreased hemoglobin A2 identified by capillary zone electrophoresis: a north American institutional experience [^111qYKnh]. Laboratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Isolated low hemoglobin A2 (HbA2) is rarely encountered in our clinical practice using capillary zone electrophoresis. The study goal was to characterize the work-up at our institution of patients with low HbA2.

Methods

Patients with low HbA2 and a control cohort with normal capillary zone electrophoresis were identified and relevant information extracted from the medical record.

Results

Of 44 patients with isolated decreased HbA2, 28 (64%) had corresponding complete blood count/ferritin values. Compared to control patients, patients with low HbA2 were more likely to have iron deficiency and demonstrated a more microcytic, hypochromic blood picture. However, 46% (13/28) of patients with low HbA2 and ferritin for evaluation did not have iron deficiency. Only 2 patients had genetic testing.

Conclusion

This study redemonstrates the association between low HbA2 and iron deficiency and reinforces the need for iron indices to interpret capillary zone electrophoresis results. Our study population showed incomplete or absent iron studies in most cases.

### How we diagnose and manage altered oxygen affinity hemoglobin variants [^114jDrrQ]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Altered oxygen affinity variant hemoglobins (Hbs) are caused by mutations of the globin genes. Changes in Hb oxygen affinity shift the oxygen dissociation curve, and can be identified by abnormal p50 measurements of patient red blood cells. Variants are categorized as either low oxygen affinity (high p50) or high oxygen affinity (low p50). Accurate diagnosis requires recognition of typical clinical and laboratory findings. In this case-based review, we present two patients with altered oxygen affinity variants, illustrating barriers to prompt and accurate diagnosis, and issues in management. We then review pathophysiology, diagnostic tests, clinical features, and management strategies.

### Evaluation of microcytosis [^111wbP4h]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Microcytosis is typically an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients who received a complete blood count for other reasons. The condition is defined as a mean corpuscular volume of less than 80 µm3 (80 fL) in adults. The most common causes of microcytosis are iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia trait. Other diagnoses to consider include anemia of chronic disease, lead toxicity, and sideroblastic anemia. Serum ferritin measurement is the first laboratory test recommended in the evaluation of microcytosis. Low ferritin levels suggest iron deficiency. Once a presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has been made, an underlying source for the deficiency should be determined. Iron deficiency anemia in adults is presumed to be caused by blood loss; the most common source of bleeding is the gastrointestinal tract. The possibility of gastrointestinal malignancy must be considered. If the serum ferritin level is not initially low, further evaluation should include total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation level, serum iron level, and possibly hemoglobin electrophoresis. Anemia of chronic disease is suggested with low iron levels and decreased total iron-binding capacity. Patients with beta-thalassemia trait usually have elevated levels of hemoglobin A2.

### The detection and diagnosis of hemoglobin A2' by high-performance liquid chromatography [^116vwkXT]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin (Hb) A2' is a hematologically silent variant of HbA2 that is detected easily by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), where it elutes in the S window. Our purposes were to define diagnostic criteria for the HbA2' trait using the Variant II (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and to determine the prevalence of HbA2' in a metropolitan patient population. All Hb screens (N = 5,862) performed during a 26-month period were reviewed for new hemoglobinopathies. We identified 57 cases of HbA2' trait, making it the fourth most prevalent Hb variant detected in this population after HbS, HbC, and beta-thalassemia minor For HbA2' trait cases, the mean HbA2 level was 1.7% (SD, 0.17%), and the mean HbA2' level was 1.3% (SD, 0.18%). Six possible HbA2'/beta-thalassemia double heterozygotes were identified, for whom the sum of the HbA2 and HbA2' exceeded 4% of total Hb. Hb variants that might interfere with detection of HbA2' include HbS, glycosylated HbC, and HbG2. Diagnostic criteria proposed for the HbA2' trait by HPLC are HbA2 of 2% or less, S window peak of 1% to 2%, no previous diagnosis of HbS, and absence of HbG and HbC.

### Hemoglobin A-using epidemiology to guide medical practice: kelly west award lecture 2020 [^114FexsG]. Diabetes Care (2021). Medium credibility.

The discovery that HbA 1c was a valid and reliable measure of average glucose exposure was one of the most important advances in diabetes care. HbA 1c was rapidly adopted for monitoring glucose control and is now recommended for the diagnosis of diabetes. HbA 1c has several advantages over glucose. Glucose assessment requires fasting, has poor preanalytic stability, and is not standardized; concentrations are acutely altered by a number of factors; and measurement can vary depending on sample type (e.g., plasma or whole blood) and source (e.g., capillary, venous, interstitial). HbA 1c does not require fasting, reflects chronic exposure to glucose over the past 2–3 months, and has low within-person variability, and assays are well standardized. One reason HbA 1c is widely accepted as a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker is that epidemiologic studies have demonstrated robust links between HbA 1c and complications, with stronger associations than those observed for usual measures of glucose. Clinical trials have also demonstrated that lowering HbA 1c slows or prevents the development of microvascular disease. As with all laboratory tests, there are some clinical situations in which HbA 1c is unreliable (e.g., certain hemoglobin variants, alterations in red blood cell turnover). Recent studies demonstrate that fructosamine and glycated albumin may be substituted as measures of hyperglycemia in these settings. Other approaches to monitoring glucose have recently been introduced, including continuous glucose monitoring, although this technology relies on interstitial glucose and epidemiologic evidence supporting its routine use has not yet been established for most clinical settings. In summary, a large body of epidemiologic evidence has convincingly established HbA 1c as a cornerstone of modern diabetes care.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline and clinical practice recommendations for anemia in chronic kidney disease: 2007 update of hemoglobin target [^115oVjDG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI anemia — study quality grading (Table 14) classifies individual studies as A, B, or C. Category A is described as, "Least bias; results are valid. A study that mostly adheres to the commonly held concepts of high quality, including the following: a formal study; clear description of the population and setting; clear description of an appropriate reference standard; proper measurement techniques; appropriate statistical and analytic methods; no reporting errors; and no obvious bias". Category B is "Susceptible to some bias, but not sufficient to invalidate the results. A study that does not meet all the criteria in category above. It has some deficiencies but none likely to cause major bias". Category C is "Significant bias that may invalidate the results. A study with serious errors in design or reporting. These studies may have large amounts of missing information or discrepancies in reporting".

### HbA2: biology, clinical relevance and a possible target for ameliorating sickle cell disease [^114AX1p8]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

HbA2, a tetramer of α- and δ-globin chains, provides a diagnostic clue to the presence of β-thalassaemia trait. This minor haemoglobin, which forms about 2–3% of the total, has no known physiological role, but has the interesting property of preventing polymerization of deoxy-sickle haemoglobin. If it were possible to increase the level of HbA2 sufficiently it could have a benefit in sickle cell disease similar to that of foetal haemoglobin. Moreover, HbA2 is present in all erythrocytes, an advantage not found with foetal haemoglobin, which is heterocellularly expressed. The molecular basis of HbA2 gene (HBD) expression is partially understood, and with new molecular tools, it might be possible to induce levels of HbA2 that could be clinically important. However, high concentrations of this positively charged haemoglobin might damage the erythrocyte membrane; also, the reciprocal relationship of δ- and γ-globin gene (HBD and HBG1/2, respectively) expression might negate any benefit of increasing transcription of the former.

### Clinical classification, screening, and diagnosis in beta-thalassemia and hemoglobin E / beta-thalassemia [^111yeUaE]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

This article reviews the classification of beta-thalassemia syndromes, correlating clinical severity and genotype in the earlier classification, and broadening it recently based on clinical severity and transfusion status. The classification is dynamic, and individuals may progress from transfusion-independent to transfusion-dependent. Early and accurate diagnosis prevents delays in instituting treatment and comprehensive care, and precludes inappropriate and potentially harmful interventions. Screening can inform risk in an individual and subsequent generations when partners may be carriers as well. This article discusses the rationale for screening of the at-risk population. In the developed world, a more precise genetic diagnosis must be considered.

### Some observations on the measurement of haemoglobin A2 and S percentages by high performance liquid chromatography in the presence and absence of alpha thalassaemia [^113eUn3X]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the accuracy and precision of measuring haemoglobin A(2) by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in the presence and absence of sickle cell trait, with or without alpha thalassaemia trait.

Methods

The haemoglobin A(2) percentage and the haemoglobin A(2) plus S percentages were determined by HPLC on 82 normal controls and 78 patients with sickle cell trait, respectively; the alpha thalassaemia status of each patient was determined by polymerase chain reaction. Red cell indices and haemoglobin A(2) and S percentages were compared in patients with two, three, or four alpha genes.

Results

Of the 78 patients with sickle cell trait, 17 were heterozygous for alpha(+) thalassaemia (-alpha(3.7)/alphaalpha) and 13 were homozygous (-alpha(3.7)/-alpha(3.7)). Microcolumn chromatography showed that the haemoglobin A(2) percentage was slightly, but significantly, higher than normal in sickle cell trait. HPLC determinations of haemoglobin A(2) percentage in patients with sickle cell trait are precise but inaccurate, the percentage being appreciably overestimated. The measured haemoglobin A(2) percentage is stable for one week, but inaccuracy increases by two weeks in most samples. Despite this inaccuracy, there are significant differences in the HPLC "haemoglobin A(2) percentage" between groups of individuals with two, three, and four alpha genes.

Conclusions

Haemoglobin A(2) determinations by HPLC are precise but inaccurate. Nevertheless, there are significant differences in the haemoglobin A(2) percentage in subjects with two, three, and four alpha genes. Although there is some overlap between groups, this can be useful, together with the red cell indices, in predicting the likelihood of coexisting alpha thalassaemia.

### Haemoglobin A1c analysis in the management of patients with diabetes: from chaos to harmony [^114eyDeP]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Effective management of patients with diabetes mellitus requires accurate assessments of blood glucose control. The best characterised marker of long term glycaemic control is whole blood haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)). Published clinical trials have identified quantitative and direct relationships between the HbA(1c) concentration and risks of diabetic microvascular complications. However, in order to practice evidence-based medicine, assays used to measure patient samples should ideally produce values comparable to the assays used in these trials. Numerous assays using chromatographic and immunological detection methods are used around the world. This paper briefly reviews the scientific evolution of HbA(1c) and its analysis, discusses the reasons why HbA(1c) assay standardisation is a challenge, describes the approaches that have been adopted to harmonise HbA(1c) assays, and addresses the current initiatives to standardise HbA(1c) globally. These efforts have established HbA(1c) as an essential component in the management of patients with diabetes mellitus and are likely to lead to the use of HbA(1c) in the screening/diagnosis of diabetes.

### Low hemoglobin A (1c) in nondiabetic adults: an elevated risk state? [^116YC3Dw]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify predictors of low hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) (< 5.0%) and to investigate the association of low HbA(1c) with cause-specific mortality and risk of liver disease hospitalization.

Research Design and Methods

Prospective cohort study of 13,288 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. Logistic regression was used to identify cross-sectional correlates of low HbA(1c), and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the association of low HbA(1c) with cause-specific mortality.

Results

Compared with participants with HbA(1c) in the normal range (5.0 to < 5.7%), participants with low HbA(1c) were younger, less likely to smoke, had lower BMI, lower white cell count and fibrinogen levels, and lower prevalence of hypercholesterolemia and history of coronary heart disease. However, this group was more likely to have anemia and had a higher mean corpuscular volume. In adjusted Cox models with HbA(1c) of 5.0 to < 5.7% as the reference group, HbA(1c) < 5.0% was associated with a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.13–1.55) and of cancer death (1.47, 95% CI: 1.16–1.84). We also noted nonsignificant trends toward increased risk of death from cardiovascular causes (1.27, 95% CI: 0.93–1.75) and respiratory causes (1.42, 95% CI: 0.78–2.56). There was a J-shaped association between HbA(1c) and risk of liver disease hospitalization.

Conclusions

No single cause of death appeared to drive the association between low HbA(1c) and total mortality. These results add to evidence that low HbA(1c) values may be a generalized marker of mortality risk in the general population.

### Pitfalls in the use of HbA ₁ (C) as a diagnostic test: the ethnic conundrum [^1119QvZn]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2010). Medium credibility.

The purpose of a diagnostic test is to identify individuals who have a disorder and reassure those who do not. An HbA₁(c)-based diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or prediabetes fails to meet that purpose. Diabetes mellitus is a disorder of glucose, not HbA₁(c), metabolism. Microvascular complications in diabetes mellitus are driven by chronic hyperglycemia. The correlation of these complications with HbA₁(c) levels is convenient; however, unlike the direct information provided by glucose, HbA₁(c) values reflect glycemic and nonglycemic factors. The latter include modulators of glucose transport across the erythrocyte membrane, intracellular protein glycation and deglycation, erythrocyte turnover, systemic illness and hematological and medical disorders, among others. Genetic rather than glycemic factors explain most of the variance in HbA₁(c) levels. Finally, HbA₁(c) values are misleading as a measure of average blood glucose among persons of African, Asian, Hispanic and other non-European ancestry. Given the numerous pitfalls, the use of HbA₁(c) levels for diagnosing diabetes mellitus or prediabetes is ill-advised.

### Measurement of HbA ₂ by capillary electrophoresis for diagnosing β-thalassemia / HbE disease in patients with low HbF [^112sww17]. Laboratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Capillary electrophoresis (CE) has the ability to detect hemoglobin (Hb) A2 in the presence of HbE. The aim of this study was to compare levels of HbA2 measured by CE between β-thalassemia/HbE and homozygous HbE patients.

Methods

Molecular analysis for diagnosing of β-thalassemia gene mutations and HbE was performed in 28 blood samples containing of HbE > 75% and HbF levels varying from 5% to 15% quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Levels of HbA2, HbE, and HbF were then measured using CE.

Results

Nine patients were diagnosed with β-thalassemia/HbE disease and 19 with homozygous HbE. All patients with β-thalassemia/HbE disease and only one patient (5%) with homozygous HbE had HbA2 higher than 6.0%.

Conclusions

The analysis of HbA2 level (> 6.0%) by CE may be an alternative method for preliminary diagnosis of β-thalassemia/HbE with uncertain β-thalassemia/HbE disease and homozygous HbE.

### Abnormally low hemoglobin A1c as harbinger of hemoglobinopathy [^116c43SF]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c is frequently used in primary care to screen for and monitor disorders of glucose metabolism. A number of clinical syndromes may impact the accuracy of this laboratory value. This report describes a case of abnormally low hemoglobin A1c that was the result of an asymptomatic compound hemoglobinopathy (homozygous hemoglobin S disease and hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin) that had gone previously undiagnosed. Primary care physicians must be aware of such pitfalls in the use of this laboratory value and be prepared to use other values to monitor for and assess disorders of glucose metabolism.

### Hb adana (HBA2 or HBA1: C.179G > A) and alpha thalassemia: genotype-phenotype correlation [^111CZDer]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Alpha thalassemia due to nondeletional mutations usually leads to more severe disease than that caused by deletional mutations. Devastating outcomes such as hydrops fetalis can occur with two nondeletional mutations, therefore warranting DNA-based workup for suspected carriers with subtle hematological abnormalities for family counseling purposes. We describe three cases with hemoglobin (Hb) Adana, a nondeletional alpha chain mutation, compounded with an alpha globin gene deletion resulting in thalassemia intermedia. We review the literature, draw genotype-phenotype correlations from published cases of Hb Adana, and propose that this correlation can be used by clinicians to help direct diagnostic studies and urge hematologists to thoroughly workup high-risk patients.

### Pathology consultation on HbA (1c) methods and interferences [^115frxM4]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the various hemoglobin (Hb) A1c methods, with a focus on interferences resulting from Hb variants.

Methods

HbA1c is a marker used for the diagnosis and management of diabetes. Each available HbA1c method has advantages and challenges, such as its susceptibility to interferences.

Results

The presence of Hb variants and/or abnormalities in RBC turnover cannot only interfere analytically with HbA1c measurements but also may affect the clinical interpretation of HbA1c values.

Conclusions

Familiarity with the advantages and challenges of the various methods used for HbA1c testing is essential when establishing therapeutic management and goals based on HbA1c results, especially in populations with a high prevalence of Hb variants.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^114ATRq4]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline — adjunctive testing in men with low testosterone states that in patients with low testosterone, clinicians should measure serum luteinizing hormone levels (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). Serum prolactin levels should be measured in patients with low testosterone levels combined with low or low/ normal luteinizing hormone levels (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A), and patients with persistently high prolactin levels of unknown etiology should undergo evaluation for endocrine disorders (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). Serum estradiol should be measured in testosterone deficient patients who present with breast symptoms or gynecomastia prior to the commencement of testosterone therapy (Expert Opinion). Men with testosterone deficiency who are interested in fertility should have a reproductive health evaluation performed prior to treatment (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Prior to offering testosterone therapy, clinicians should measure hemoglobin and hematocrit and inform patients regarding the increased risk of polycythemia (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). PSA should be measured in men over 40 years of age prior to commencement of testosterone therapy to exclude a prostate cancer diagnosis (Clinical Principle).

### Haemoglobinopathies that occur with decreased HbA2 levels: a gene mutation set involving the δ gene at a Spanish centre [^115PKFAE]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

Haemoglobin A 2 (HbA 2) consists of two globin chains, α and β. Alterations in any of these genes influences the level of HbA 2. Here, we present cases of structural Hb variants and thalassaemias which present either alone or together and reduce the level of HbA 2 at varying degrees. Furthermore, we present a novel structural mutation in the δ globin gene, called Hb A 2 -Madrid.

Methods

The levels of HbA 2 and HbF and the different haemoglobin variants were measured and analysed by ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, VARIANT II), the types of haemoglobins were determined by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) (Sebia) and the globin chains were determined by reversed-phase HPLC. Genetic analysis was performed by automatic sequencing of the α and δ genes as well as by multiple PCRs for the α globin genes.

Results

In α thalassaemia (n = 94), the HbA 2 levels ranged from 1.39% to 2.43%. Among individuals with δ thalassaemia (n = 5), the HbA 2 level of those with δ + thalassaemia was 1.77%, and that of those with δ 0 thalassaemia was 1.70%. Among the individuals with δβ thalassaemia (n = 13), those who were homozygous lacked HbA 2. All structural haemoglobinopathies (n = 97) were heterozygous; the α chain variants (n = 84) presented with an HbA 2 level of 1.76%, while the δ chain variants (n = 13) presented with a level of 1.75%.

Conclusion

HbA 2 is an essential parameter in the diagnostics of haemoglobinopathies. HPLC-EC and CZE allow the quantification of HbA 2. Here, we show that quantification of HbA 2 is critical for the identification of α, δ and βδ thalassaemias. Structural variants are discovered by HPLC. Molecular genetics is required for the proper identification of the mutations. Only with this knowledge is genetic counselling possible.

Sickle cell disease — acute ischemic neurologic deficit transfusion strategy specifies immediate hemoglobin augmentation and exchange. For children and adults presenting with a focal neurological deficit suggestive of an ischemic event, including a TIA, increasing the hemoglobin level with a red blood cell transfusion is stated as the best option to improve oxygen delivery to the brain. If the hemoglobin level is less than ~8.5 g/dL, the panel recommends increasing the hemoglobin to ~10.0 g/dL with a simple transfusion within 2 hours after presentation, and after the hemoglobin has reached ~10.0 g/dL with simple transfusion or if the baseline hemoglobin level is greater than ~8.5 g/dL, the panel recommends an automated-exchange red blood cell transfusion (apheresis). The relationship between hemoglobin and oxygen delivery notes that the maximal hemoglobin (Hbmax) to deliver oxygen transport in sickle cell patients is 10 to 11 g/dL and that when the HbS level is low (∼20%), a higher hemoglobin level (such as 13 g/dL) may be beneficial; red cell apheresis can rapidly lower the HbS to levels that maximize oxygen delivery.

### Prevalence of elevated hemoglobin A2 measured by the CAPILLARYS system [^114sMcD8]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin (Hb) A2 electrophoresis has been used for prenatal screening for the beta-thalassemia trait (betaTT). We retrospectively reviewed Hb capillary electrophoresis performed in our laboratory. We found that of the 122 cases showing elevated HbA2 levels, 79 cases were due to hemoglobinopathies, mostly HbS. Review of the RBC indices suggested that 3 of 36 cases with elevation of HbA2 in the HbAA-pregnancy group had betaTT and 29 had normal RBC indices; data were not available for 4 patients. Among 7 cases with elevation of HbA2 in the HbAA-other group, 5 had betaTT and 2 were normal. The number of patients without betaTT but with HbA2 elevation in the pregnant group was significantly higher than that in the nonpregnant group. When a higher HbA2 cutoff (3.5%) was used, only 3 pregnant patients without betaTT had HbA2 elevation, similar to the nonpregnant group. We found that a significant number of pregnant women with mild HbA2 elevation had no evidence of betaTT, compared with the nonpregnant group.

Compound heterozygous and variant genotypes — screening considerations: a small population of children with SCD (< 3%) who are compound heterozygotes for HbS and do not have HbSC are at high risk of stroke, and the decision as to which children with compound heterozygous SCD should receive TCD screening and subsequent treatment should be made on an individual basis; in children with compound heterozygous SCD, we cannot identify a single marker of hemolysis or a threshold for markers of hemolysis that should be screened; for children with HbSC, the risk of abnormal TCD measurements and stroke is less than for those with HbSS; in HbSβ+ thalassemia, hemoglobin levels vary, with the range from hemoglobin levels of 7 g/dL to values within the normal range, and consequently, we cannot state with high certainty which children with HbSβ+ thalassemia should receive TCD screening.

Hemoglobinopathies are priority genetic diseases for prevention programs in at-risk populations. We implemented an accurate and simple methodology to identify hemoglobin (Hb) variants and to quantify HbA2 and HbF in capillary blood samples stored at room temperature for up to 7 days after collection. This methodology is particularly indicated for screening for carriers in primary care medical centers in which facilities for collecting venous blood are not available.

### The diagnostic dilemma of congenital unstable hemoglobinopathies [^111ejCYa]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Unstable hemoglobin variants represent a rare etiology of congenital hemolytic anemia. Without a high index of suspicion, plus proper laboratory testing and interpretation, the correct diagnosis can be elusive. We report on five children who were initially thought to have other congenital disorders such as hereditary spherocytosis or thalassemia, before β-globin gene sequencing led to the definitive diagnosis. Recognizing the variable clinical presentation and laboratory data reported will aid clinicians in diagnosis of unstable hemoglobins variants in children with atypical forms of hemolytic anemia, particularly those with low pulse oximetry values or whose hemoglobin electrophoresis suggest β-thalassemia trait.

### Is the beta thalassaemia trait of clinical importance? [^111mZqKe]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Although the beta thalassaemia trait affects millions of people worldwide, there have been no controlled studies to determine whether it is associated with any clinical disability or abnormal physical signs. To address this question, 402 individuals were studied: 217 with beta thalassaemia trait, of whom 154 were aware of the diagnosis and 63 were unaware until after the completion of the study; 89 normal controls; and 96 controls with mild hypochromic anaemia. There was a significant increase in symptoms ascribable to anaemia and episodes of pyrexia in those with the beta thalassaemia trait that were not influenced by prior knowledge that they had this condition. There was no difference in physical findings, notably splenomegaly, between those with beta thalassaemia trait and either control group.

Table 7 (Cont'd) — randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different hemoglobin (Hb) targets in the hemodialysis chronic kidney disease (HD-CKD) and peritoneal dialysis chronic kidney disease (PD-CKD) populations — details study grades, key results, and limitations: grade distributions include 4 Grade A; 2 Grade B and 1 Grade C trial, and another set of 3 Grade A, 1 Grade B and 1 Grade C in which the 3 A studies comprise 93% of patients. The largest trial showed significantly higher mortality in the higher Hb group, whereas the remaining studies showed not statistically significant difference. Follow-up was short in several trials, with the duration of 3 of 7 trials < 1 year. Reported outcomes included 5/5 studies reporting angina, 4/5 non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and 3/5 pulmonary edema or heart failure; access composition included that the Besarab study had 76% grafts. For blood pressure assessments, only 6 involve placebo arms (others are ESA vs. ESA), with substantial heterogeneity in definitions and measurements (e.g., casual vs ambulatory blood pressure monitoring [ABPM], mean of systolic blood pressure [SBP] vs diastolic blood pressure [DBP]). Operationally, only 1 coordinator recorded and classified events centrally and likely did not do site visits. Regarding dialysis dose, it is relatively likely that even a statistically significant increase in Kt/V is unlikely to affect mortality (presume spKt/V > ~1.3 URR 66%), and adverse event reporting was limited, with ascertainment not consistently or prospectively monitored and only AEs that occurred during duration of RCTs captured.

### Beta thalassemia: monitoring and new treatment approaches [^11746xaS]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Beta thalassemias are a significant global health problem. Globin chain imbalance leads to a complex physiologic cascade of hemolytic anemia, ineffective erythropoiesis, and iron overload. Management of the broad spectrum of phenotypes requires the careful use of red blood transfusions, supportive care, monitoring, and management of iron overload. In this article, the authors discuss recommendations for monitoring of individuals with thalassemia, as well as ongoing preclinical and clinical trials of therapies targeting different aspects of thalassemia pathophysiology.

### Homozygous mild β-thalassaemia promoter transversion-71 C > T HBB: C.-121 C > T [^1154PtmH]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Beta-thalassaemia is one of the most common genetic disorders worldwide, which is caused by absent or decreased synthesis of beta-globin chain subunits. Beta-thalassaemias are diverse groups of disease with a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes. The clinical phenotypes can include asymptomatic forms of beta-thalassaemia minor, intermediate and severe transfusion dependent beta-thalassaemia major. Clinical severity varies depending on the underlying β globin gene mutation. There are a number of mild β-thalassaemia gene defects that could be referred as a 'silent carrier'. Identifying the underlying molecular defect is essential to predict phenotype severity for optimal management, tailored treatment and improved quality of life. We report the first identification of a homozygous point mutation located within the promoter region of the β-globin gene at position -71 (C > T). The patient was a female child, who was referred to our clinic after she was found to have hypochromic microcytic anaemia with low haemoglobin (Hb) (67g/L) and an Hb A 2 level at the upper limit of the normal value (3.7%). This observation is a new example of homozygous mild β-thalassaemia with a borderline Hb A 2 level, and illustrates a potential source of pitfall in the diagnosis of β-thalassaemia disease.

### Hemoglobinopathies mimicking Hb S / β-thalassemia: Hb S / S with α-thalassemia and Hb S / volga [^1126WzZx]. American Journal of Hematology (2006). Low credibility.

There are approximately 1200 known natural mutations of the human globin genes. In most clinical laboratories, the diagnosis of hemoglobin disorders is based on blood counts, hemoglobin electrophoresis, or column chromatography, which can identify common variant hemoglobins such as Hb S, C, and E, but are unable to definitively diagnose most other hemoglobin variants and thalassemia mutations. We report two unrelated cases, both thought initially to have Hb S/beta-thalassemia. Subsequent mutational analyses revealed that one is Hb S/S with compound heterozygosity for nondeletional alpha-thalassemia mutations. The other is the first reported case of compound heterozygosity for Hb S and an unstable hemoglobin, Hb Volga. Correct diagnoses of these hereditary disorders are needed for prognosis and proper management and also for genetic counseling. These studies underscore the importance to correlate clinical course with laboratory diagnosis and to make DNA-based diagnostics more widely available for patients with unusual or complicated hemoglobin disorders.

### Minor hemoglobins other than A2 in iron deficiency [^1141Jrfk]. Laboratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine any difference in levels of minor hemoglobins, other than hemoglobin A2 (HbA2), in patients with iron deficiency.

Methods

We divided ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-anticoagulated blood specimens from 188 patients into 2 groups, of which 94 displayed a normal or high ferritin level and the remaining 94 had a low ferritin level. We correlated the red cell indices, hemoglobin levels, and ferritin levels with the percentage of various minor hemoglobins. The Student's t-test was used to assess the statistical significance of the difference between the mean concentrations of minor hemoglobins in the 2 groups.

Results

Only hemoglobin HbA1a had a positive correlation (0.33 in iron-deficient and 0.35 in iron-replete specimens) with serum ferritin concentration. Among the minor hemoglobins, HbA1a (P = 0.008) and HbA2 (P < .001) were significantly different between the 2 groups.

Conclusion

HbA1a may be low in iron deficiency, independent of HbA2. This information may be used to predict coexistent iron deficiency in β-thalassemia traits, in which concomitant infection or inflammation leads to normal ferritin levels.

### Optimal strategies for carrier screening and prenatal diagnosis of α-and β-thalassemia [^117W34wZ]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

The thalassemias are inherited quantitative disorders of hemoglobin synthesis with a significant worldwide burden, which result in a wide spectrum of disease from the most severe transfusion-dependent form to the mildest asymptomatic carrier state. In this article, we discuss the importance of carrier, prenatal, and newborn screening for thalassemia. We examine the rationale for who should be screened and when, as well as the current methodology for screening. Deficiencies in the newborn screening program are highlighted as well. With the advent of inexpensive and rapid genetic testing, this may be the most practical method of screening in the future, and we review the implications of population-based implementation of this strategy. Finally, a case-based overview of the approach for individuals with the trait as well as prospective parents who have a potential fetal risk of the disease is outlined.

### Routine laboratory testing before endoscopic procedures [^115QPZZY]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Hemoglobin/hematocrit testing before endoscopy — routine screening is not advised for minor procedures without anemia symptoms, but selective testing is appropriate for high-risk scenarios. Severe anemia is found in less than 1% of asymptomatic patients, and a hemoglobin level less than 8 mg/dL has been associated with cardiac morbidity and operative death. Although determining a baseline hemoglobin or hematocrit level is recommended before major surgery with anticipated significant blood loss, such testing is not recommended for patients undergoing minor surgeries in the absence of clinical findings suggestive of anemia. Measurement of hemoglobin should be considered for patients with preexisting anemia or risk factors for bleeding, a high risk of adverse events with significant bleeding, advanced liver disease, or a hematologic disorder when undergoing endoscopic procedures in which there is a high risk of bleeding adverse events.

Sickle cell disease — postapheresis targets and thresholds for exchange transfusion emphasize HbS percentage and hemoglobin limits to optimize oxygen delivery while avoiding viscosity-related complications. Evidence suggests that oxygen delivery to the brain in SCD is dependent not only on the total hemoglobin concentration, but also on the percentage of HbS, and the goal of red blood cell exchange with apheresis is to lower HbS while preventing an excessive rise in hemoglobin. Thresholds for postapheresis HbS percentage and hemoglobin level are typically set at 15% to 20% and 10 g/dL, respectively, and the HbS level of 15% to 20% allows a threshold of < 30% HbS to persist for ~4 weeks. When the HbS level is < 20%, the total hemoglobin level can generally be > 10 g/dL, up to ~12 to 13 g/dL, without concern for viscosity-related complications. When the hemoglobin level is < 5.0 g/dL, a simple transfusion to increase the total hemoglobin to ~10.0 g/dL may be required, and generally, red blood cell exchange with apheresis is not recommended for patients with SCD and hemoglobin levels < 5.0 g/dL.

### The range of hemoglobin A (2) in hemoglobin E heterozygotes as determined by capillary electrophoresis [^117FZ4Mc]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is capable of distinguishing hemoglobin E (HbE) from hemoglobin A(2) (HbA(2)), thus permitting quantification of HbA(2) in patients with HbE. In this study, routine samples submitted for evaluation of hemoglobinopathy that demonstrated HbE were studied by high-pressure liquid chromatography and CE. The data for 52 samples from adult HbE heterozygotes were compared with those for a control group consisting of 209 patients. The mean HbA(2) of patients with HbE trait was 3.4% (SD, 0.4%), which was significantly higher (P < .001) than the 2.6% (SD, 0.4%) for the control group. Seven samples from adults homozygous for HbE were also evaluated. The mean HbA(2) of HbE homozygotes was 4.4%, which was significantly greater (P < .001) than the HbA(2) values for the HbE heterozygotes. Data from these cases provide an estimate of the range of HbA(2) in patients with HbE when evaluated by CE.

Hemochromatosis (HH) — genetic prevalence and clinical penetrance are characterized by C282Y homozygosity seen in approximately one in 250 Caucasians, with fully expressed disease with end-organ manifestations in fewer than 10% of these individuals, and full clinical manifestations seen approximately one in 2500. The heterozygote genotype (C282Y/wild type) is found in approximately one in 10 individuals and may be associated with elevated serum iron markers, but without associated tissue iron overload or damage. Approximately 75% did not have symptoms and did not exhibit any of the end-stage manifestations of the disease when identified in this way, and in large population screening studies only approximately 70% of C282Y homozygotes are found to have an elevated ferritin level; more men than women have increased ferritin levels.

### Genetic modifiers of sickle cell disease [^111yTkXE]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

Sickle cell anemia is associated with unusual clinical heterogeneity for a Mendelian disorder. Fetal hemoglobin concentration and coincident α thalassemia, both which directly affect the sickle erythrocyte, are the major modulators of the phenotype of disease. Understanding the genetics underlying the heritable subphenotypes of sickle cell anemia would be prognostically useful, could inform personalized therapeutics, and might help the discovery of new "druggable" pathophysiologic targets. Genotype-phenotype association studies have been used to identify novel genetic modifiers. In the future, whole genome sequencing with its promise of discovering hitherto unsuspected variants could add to our understanding of the genetic modifiers of this disease.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^112RybHJ]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Testosterone therapy — hemoglobin/hematocrit monitoring and polycythemia risk: Prior to offering testosterone therapy, clinicians should measure hemoglobin and hematocrit and inform patients regarding the increased risk of polycythemia (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). Prior to commencing therapy, all patients should undergo a baseline measurement of Hb/Hct; if the Hct exceeds 50%, clinicians should consider withholding testosterone therapy until the etiology is explained, and while on therapy, a Hct ≥ 54% warrants intervention. In men with elevated Hct and high on-treatment testosterone levels, dose adjustment should be attempted as first-line management; in men with elevated Hct and low/normal on-treatment testosterone levels, measuring a SHBG level and a free testosterone level using a reliable assay is suggested. If SHBG levels are low/free testosterone levels are high, dose adjustment of the testosterone therapy should be considered, and men with elevated Hct and on-treatment low/normal total and free testosterone levels should be referred to a hematologist for further evaluation and possible coordination of phlebotomy. Polycythemia is generally defined as a hematocrit (Hct) > 52%. Elevation of Hb/Hct is the most frequent adverse event related to testosterone therapy, and Hb/Hct generally rise for the first six months and then tend to plateau. Across 5 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of men with mean baseline testosterone < 300 ng/dL treated for 12 weeks to 1 year, elevated Hct was more common with testosterone (OR = 6.46; CI: 1.86, 22.40). Trials indicate injectable testosterone is associated with the greatest treatment-induced increases in Hb/Hct, and a meta-analysis found mean Hb increases of 1.4 mg/dL (long-acting IM), 1.6 mg/dL (short-acting IM), 0.9 mg/dL (transdermal), and 0.7 mg/dL (topical patches).

### Preoperative evaluation and methods to reduce blood use in orthopedic surgery [^111Qfk3Y]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Major elective orthopedic surgery may be associated with significant blood loss and allogeneic transfusion risk. Identifying patients at risk for allogeneic transfusion is best accomplished with a thorough preoperative evaluation of the patient's hematopoietic system, which, unfortunately, is not always carried out. An evaluation of the hematopoietic system begins with an evaluation of the patient's hemoglobin level a minimum of 30 days before the scheduled surgical procedure. This allows for expedited diagnosis and treatment of underlying comorbidities. An unexplained low level of hemoglobin or a hemoglobin level low enough to increase the patient's allogeneic risk should cause elective surgery to be deferred until an evaluation can be preformed and blood management strategies put in place.

### Unintended reporting of misleading Hb A (1c) values when using assays incapable of detecting hemoglobin variants [^1121dDw8]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Context

It is recommended that hemoglobin (Hb) A1c (Hb A1c) not be used to assess average glycemia in patients who have altered red blood cell life span.

Objective

To investigate the frequency of reporting an Hb A1c value for Hb variant samples that do not include Hb A.

Design

Hb A1c samples (n = 500) were procured and screened for Hb variants that may affect Hb A1c interpretation (Hb SS, Hb SC, and Hb S-β-thalassemia). Five of each of these samples were tested by ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography, immunoturbidimetric assay, second-generation immunoturbidimetric assay, and affinity chromatography.

Results

Eleven (2.2%) homozygous Hb SS, 6 (1.2%) Hb SC, and 5 (1.0%) Hb S-β-thalassemia samples were identified out of the 500 samples tested. Three of 4 instruments investigated in this study are known to not be plagued by analytic interference from these Hb variants but disturbingly reported Hb A1c values in the absence of Hb A.

Conclusions

The improved analytic specificity of Hb A1c platforms has by and large eliminated interferences from the most common heterozygous Hb variants. A consequence, however, is the potential for unintended reporting of Hb A1c results in the presence of homozygous and compound heterozygous Hb variants that lack Hb A and the inability to distinguish those samples not recommended to be used for patient care. The ability to identify samples harboring Hb variants that preclude the utility of Hb A1c may be beneficial in high prevalence populations.

Limitations of evidence — patient outcomes: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) reporting is incomplete, meta-analyses are dominated by a few randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and key trials had methodological issues including early stopping and baseline imbalances; in CHOIR, after adjustment the association between higher hemoglobin (Hb) assignment and the primary composite outcome was no longer statistically significant (hazard ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.62; P = 0.11) compared with the unadjusted hazard ratio of 1.34; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.74; P = 0.03. Additional limitations include censoring at dialysis initiation, a lower-than-predicted event rate in CREATE that reduced power, failure in several studies to achieve the higher Hb target in the majority of patients, premature termination of subcutaneous epoetin alfa studies due to reports of pure red cell aplasia, and underrepresentation of subgroups such as children, young adults, and patients with ischemic vascular disease or chronic lung disease.

Algorithm for acute suspected ischemic stroke in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) — adults > 18 years old with new-onset neurologic deficit: The goal is prompt transfusion beginning within 2 hours to achieve hemoglobin (Hb) 10 g/dL and HbS 15% to 20%. For early presentation, initiate simple transfusion and obtain a noncontrast head CT; if hemorrhage is present, consult hematology and neurosurgery, and if no hemorrhage, consider IV‑tPA according to established inclusion/exclusion criteria and assess for moyamoya on vascular imaging. If there is no moyamoya vasculopathy and a large vessel occlusion, evaluate for endovascular thrombectomy; if moyamoya vasculopathy is present, use simple transfusion to achieve Hb 10 g/dL and exchange transfusion to reach Hb S 15–20%. If symptom onset or worsening of deficit is within 24–72 hours, provide oxygen supplementation, assess whether Hb > 8.5 g/dL, and give prompt simple transfusion to achieve Hb 10 g/dL with exchange transfusion to reach Hb S 15–20%; if not in that window, assess for anemia and % Hb S and consider transfusion case by case.

### HbA2 levels in children with β-thalassemia trait associated with iron deficiency: a perspective for pediatricians [^112uj6ng]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

A critical factor in β-thalassemia trait screening is a hemoglobin A2 (HbA2) level of 3.5% or higher. In children with iron deficiency, HbA2 levels decrease, and diagnosis may be missed. Studies with adult carriers have yielded conflicting results on this issue. The effectiveness of HbA2-based thalassemia screening in carrier children with iron deficiency has not been studied before.

Methods

In this study, among 213 children with β-thalassemia trait, those with iron deficiency were determined based on ferritin value (< 15 ng/mL), and their HbA2 levels were examined. We compared HbA2 levels of iron-deficient and iron-sufficient carriers and examined the correlation between low HbA2 levels and ferritin level. Because ferritin is an acute-phase reactant, similar evaluations were made by using transferrin saturation as the criterion for iron deficiency.

Results

The median HbA2 value of iron-deficient carrier children was 4.1% and within the diagnostic range (≥ 3.5%) in the majority of children. Median HbA2 levels in iron-deficient carriers differed from levels in iron-sufficient carriers (4.1% vs 4.9%, P < .007). No correlation was present between low HbA2 levels and ferritin levels (0.226). Furthermore, among children without iron deficiency, there were individuals with low HbA2 levels (26.9%). Similar results were obtained when transferrin saturation was used.

Conclusions

Hemoglobin A2 can be used as a screening test in children with β-thalassemia trait, despite accompanying iron deficiency. Low HbA2 levels in these children may be the result of underlying thalassemia mutation, not the result of accompanying iron deficiency. Therefore, in suspected cases of β-thalassemia trait, evaluation should continue, regardless of iron status or treatment.

GRADE system for grading quality of evidence — starting grades are based on study design with Randomized trials = High, Observational studies = Low, and Any other evidence = Very Low. To reduce grade, criteria include Study quality (-1 level if serious limitations; -2 levels if very serious limitations), Consistency (-1 level if important inconsistency), Directness (-1 level if some uncertainty; -2 levels if major uncertainty), and Other Considerations (-1 level if sparse or imprecise data; -1 level if high probability of reporting bias). To raise grade, Strength of association allows +1 level if strong*; no plausible confounders, +2 levels if very strong; no major threats to validity, +1 level if evidence of a dose response gradient, and +1 level if all residual plausible confounders would have reduced the observed effect; strong evidence is defined as 'significant relative risk of > 2 (< 0.5)' from two or more observational studies with no plausible confounders, and very strong evidence as 'significant relative risk of > 5 (< 0.2)' based on direct evidence with no major threats to validity. Final grades are defined as High = Further research is unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of the effect, Moderate = Further research is likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate, Low = Further research is very likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate and may change the estimate, and Very Low = Any estimate of effect is very uncertain.

### Clinical classification, screening and diagnosis for thalassemia [^117Qtn7C]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

At present, thalassemia diseases are classified into transfusion-dependent thalassemia and non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia. This classification is based on the clinical severity of patients determining whether they do require regular blood transfusions to survive (transfusion-dependent thalassemia) or not (non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia). In addition to the previous terminology of "thalassemia major" or "thalassemia intermedia", this classification has embraced all other forms of thalassemia syndromes such as α-thalassemia, hemoglobin E/β-thalassemia and combined α- and β-thalassemias. Definitive diagnosis of thalassemia and hemoglobinopathies requires a comprehensive workup from complete blood count, hemoglobin analysis, and molecular studies to identify mutations of globin genes.

### Primary prevention of ASCVD and T2DM in patients at metabolic risk: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^115UQikT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Glycemic tests for identifying elevated glycemia — Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour plasma glucose after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and/or HbA1c can be used; the FPG test is automated and inexpensive but reflects only a single time point, the OGTT is more sensitive but more time-consuming, costly, and variable than FPG, and some evidence suggests the OGTT is a better predictor for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality than FPG. HbA1c is a more long-term measure of glycemia with less sensitivity and less variability than glucose tests and can be performed in the nonfasting state; marked discrepancies between HbA1c and plasma glucose may indicate Hb variant assay interference, for which an assay without analytic interference should be used. In conditions with increased red blood cell turnover (e.g., sickle cell disease or hemodialysis), plasma blood glucose criteria should be used to diagnose diabetes; emerging data suggest that genetic variants such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency can significantly impact HbA1c levels. There is a strong, continuous association between HbA1c and subsequent diabetes risk, and within the HbA1c spectrum of prediabetes the yearly incidence of diabetes increases from ~3% with an HbA1c of 5.7% to ~9.5% with an HbA1c of 6.5%.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: myelodysplastic syndromes, version 2.2025 [^115tiRmv]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Childhood myelodysplastic syndromes — differential diagnosis and diagnostic thresholds are noted: Differential diagnoses include aplastic anemia (AA) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Compared to AA, children with MDS have a significantly elevated mean corpuscular volume and clonal hematopoiesis is confirmatory, and higher expression of p53, lower expression of survivin, or MDS-related cytogenetic abnormalities can also help differentiate MDS from AA. Compared with AML, low WBC count, multi-lineage dysplasia, and clonal hematopoiesis with numerical rather than structural cytogenetic abnormalities suggest MDS, and a bone marrow blast count of < 20% also suggests MDS, with biologic features more important than a strict blast cutoff value. Monosomy 7 strongly suggests MDS. When patients present with AML, dysplasia does not necessarily indicate antecedent MDS and criteria for MDS diagnosis in a patient who presents with AML are stringent; dysplasia may reflect infection, deficiencies of B12 and copper, drug therapy, or chronic disease, and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, congenital sideroblastic anemia, and Pearson syndrome should also be excluded.

### HbE / β-thalassemia: basis of marked clinical diversity [^112BAsin]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin E thalassemia accounts for about one-half of all cases of severe beta thalassemia. There is marked variability in its clinical severity ranging from an asymptomatic to a transfusion-dependent phenotype. The phenotypic variability and inadequate longitudinal data present challenges in determining the optimal management of patients. This article summarizes findings on the natural history of Hemoglobin E thalassemia and some factors responsible for its clinical heterogeneity. Major genetic factors include the type of beta thalassemia mutation, the co-inheritance of alpha thalassemia, and polymorphisms associated with increased synthesis of fetal hemoglobin. Other factors, including response to anemia, and the influence of infection with malaria and other environmental influences, may be important. The remarkable variation and instability of clinical phenotypes in Hemoglobin E thalassemia require individual management plans for each patient, which should be reassessed over time.

### Evaluation of the validity of Hb A2 and mean corpuscular haemoglobin action values in antenatal screening for beta thalassaemia carriers in england [^1178jDCn]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

National antenatal screening of all pregnant women in England is carried out using standards and guidelines produced by the National Health Service Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Screening Programme. The algorithms for detection of beta thalassaemia carrier status rely on action criteria, which are set using the percentage Hb A2 and mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) values. Three groups of samples: MCH < 27 pg and Hb A2 3.5–3.9%, MCH ≥ 27 pg and Hb A2 4–4.3% and MCH ≥ 27 pg and Hb A2 3.5–3.9% were selected from a sample population of 59 500 to assess the validity and predictive value of the action criteria - 25 false positives (0.042% of total) and nine false negatives (0.015% of total) were detected. These findings support the continuation of the current action values.

### Congenital methemoglobinemia: a rare cause of cyanosis in the newborn – a case report [^111eUGTd]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Cyanosis is a physical finding that can occur at any age but presents the greatest challenge when it occurs in the newborn. The cause is multiple, and it usually represents an ominous sign, especially when it occurs in association with neonatal sepsis, cyanotic congenital heart disease, and airway abnormalities. Cyanosis caused by abnormal forms of hemoglobin can also be life-threatening, and early recognition is mandatory to prevent unnecessary investigations and delay in management. Abnormal hemoglobin, such as hemoglobin M, is traditionally discovered by electrophoresis, so the newborn screen, which is mandatory in several states, is a useful tool for the diagnosis. Although acquired methemoglobinemia, caused by environmental oxidizing agents, is common, congenital deficiency of the innate reducing enzyme is so rare that only a few cases are documented in the medical literature around the world. We present a neonate with cyanosis as a result of congenital deficiency of the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme. This infant was found to be blue at a routine newborn follow-up visit. Sepsis, structural congenital heart disease, prenatal administration, and ingestion of oxidant dyes were excluded as a cause of the cyanosis by history and appropriate tests. Chocolate discoloration of arterial blood provided a clue to the diagnosis. A normal newborn screen and hemoglobin electrophoresis made the diagnosis of hemoglobin M unlikely as the cause of the methemoglobinemia (Hb A 59.4%, A2 1.8%, and F 38.8%). Red blood cell enzyme activity and DNA analysis revealed a homozygous form of the cytochrome b5 reductase enzyme deficiency. He responded very well to daily methylene blue and ascorbic acid administration, and he has normal growth and developmental parameters, although he shows an exaggerated increase in his methemoglobin level with minor oxidant stress such as diarrhea.

### A review of variant hemoglobins interfering with hemoglobin A1c measurement [^111kfdSB]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is used routinely to monitor long-term glycemic control in people with diabetes mellitus, as HbA1c is related directly to risks for diabetic complications. The accuracy of HbA1c methods can be affected adversely by the presence of hemoglobin (Hb) variants or elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF). The effect of each variant or elevated HbF must be examined with each specific method. The most common Hb variants worldwide are HbS, HbE, HbC, and HbD. All of these Hb variants have single amino acid substitutions in the Hb beta chain. HbF is the major hemoglobin during intrauterine life; by the end of the first year, HbF falls to values close to adult levels of approximately 1%. However, elevated HbF levels can occur in certain pathologic conditions or with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin. In a series of publications over the past several years, the effects of these four most common Hb variants and elevated HbF have been described. There are clinically significant interferences with some methods for each of these variants. A summary is given showing which methods are affected by the presence of the heterozygous variants S, E, C, and D and elevated HbF. Methods are divided by type (immunoassay, ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography, boronate affinity, other) with an indication of whether the result is artificially increased or decreased by the presence of a Hb variant. Laboratorians should be aware of the limitations of their method with respect to these interferences.
