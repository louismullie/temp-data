## Question

Fistualizing Crohn's disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of fistulizing Crohn's disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the disease phenotype and its burden. Then, I should verify the initial assessment priorities, especially sepsis control and imaging. Next, I will examine first-line medical therapy, including antibiotics and anti-TNF agents, and check combination strategies. After that, I should review alternative biologics and novel therapies. Then, I will integrate surgical options and when to escalate. Finally, I need to consider maintenance, monitoring, and special scenarios like isolated perianal disease and non-perianal fistulas, ensuring each step aligns with guideline strength and evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and epidemiology. Fistulizing Crohn's disease is a penetrating phenotype with transmural inflammation that drives abnormal epithelial–mesenchymal signaling and matrix remodeling, leading to fistula formation; perianal involvement occurs in roughly 10–26% of patients and cumulates to about 26% by 20 years, with substantial quality-of-life impairment and disability, so I need to keep both the inflammatory biology and the patient-centered burden in mind as I plan care [^115igaeP] [^111YxAnw] [^114JoZvL].

> Wait, let me verify the initial priorities before any medical therapy. Control of sepsis is paramount: any abscess must be drained and a draining seton placed to prevent premature closure and recurrent sepsis; I should not jump to immunosuppression without source control, and I need early surgical input for complex disease to guide drainage and seton strategy [^112fsSF6] [^114dHdSx]. I should also confirm anatomy with high-quality imaging; MRI pelvis is preferred to define tracts, internal openings, and occult abscesses, and an EUA by an experienced surgeon complements imaging, especially when MRI is unavailable or contraindicated [^111zXN17] [^115zbuGd].

> Next, I should review first-line medical therapy for symptom control while sepsis is addressed. Antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin or metronidazole can reduce drainage and pain but are not sufficient alone to induce remission; I need to ensure I do not overstate their role and remember they are adjuncts rather than definitive therapy [^112CHVQQ] [^116WNvkF]. Hold on, I should verify the evidence signal: randomized data support adding antibiotics to anti-TNF for induction, which I will come back to shortly [^1117BQ5L].

> I will now examine anti-TNF therapy, since this is the cornerstone for fistula closure. Infliximab has the most robust evidence and is recommended as first-line for induction and maintenance of fistula remission; adalimumab is a reasonable alternative, though the evidence base is smaller and the recommendation strength is conditional rather than strong [^111PJeBr] [^111PJeBr]. Let me double-check the guideline language: AGA gives a strong recommendation for infliximab and conditional recommendations for adalimumab, ustekinumab, and vedolizumab, while noting certolizumab pegol appears ineffective for induction of fistula remission, which I should factor into sequencing decisions [^116yFMq3] [^113nnjYf].

> Hold on, I should verify combination therapy details because this is easy to misstate. Initially, I thought the AGA recommended anti-TNF plus thiopurine for all patients; wait, that is too broad. The strongest evidence-based combination is anti-TNF plus a 12-week course of ciprofloxacin for induction, which improves fistula closure rates compared with anti-TNF alone; thiopurine co-therapy can be considered to optimize pharmacokinetics, but the evidence for added fistula-specific benefit is less definitive, so I should frame thiopurine combination as reasonable but not universally mandated [^1117BQ5L] [^1145LoQe]. I need to ensure I communicate that the antibiotic combination is time-limited for induction, whereas immunomodulator co-therapy, if used, is typically continued for maintenance depending on disease course and tolerability [^1117BQ5L] [^115UvU4M].

> Let me consider alternatives when anti-TNF is contraindicated, unavailable, or not tolerated. Ustekinumab and vedolizumab have conditional recommendations for fistula induction and maintenance, with ustekinumab generally favored over vedolizumab for penetrating disease phenotypes; certolizumab pegol lacks supportive evidence for fistula induction and should not be first choice for this indication [^116yFMq3] [^113nnjYf]. I should confirm that these agents are reasonable second-line options after anti-TNF failure or intolerance, aligning with guideline sequencing language [^116yFMq3].

> But wait, what if standard pathways fail or the patient seeks to avoid systemic immunosuppression. Darvadstrocel, an allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell therapy, has RCT-level evidence demonstrating superiority to placebo for complex perianal fistulas, with durable responses and acceptable safety; I should discuss this as a promising option in refractory cases or when minimizing systemic exposure is a priority, while acknowledging that access and long-term data vary by region [^113vDn87] [^115igaeP]. Let me reconsider the practicalities: patient selection, absence of active proctitis, and concurrent seton management remain important predictors of success in real-world use [^115igaeP].

> Next, I should review surgical integration, because medical therapy alone is often insufficient in complex disease. Seton placement facilitates drainage and allows medical therapy to work; in carefully selected patients without proctitis, fistulotomy can be curative for simple low fistulas; for complex transsphincteric disease, LIFT and advancement flap repairs are appropriate when luminal inflammation is controlled; and for refractory, devastating perianal disease, fecal diversion with ileostomy or colostomy and, in select cases, proctectomy may be necessary [^117FyKh9] [^116sZzdN] [^112KNYqF] [^114rxQsu] [^1131d5wK]. I should confirm that ECCO emphasizes combining medical therapy with surgical fistula closure in amenable patients to improve long-term outcomes, reinforcing the need for coordinated multidisciplinary care [^116yFMq3].

> I need to ensure maintenance and monitoring are explicit. After induction, continuation of the effective biologic is recommended to sustain remission, with periodic clinical assessment and MRI at 6–12 months to document tract closure; I should double-check that guidelines advise against relying on antibiotics alone for maintenance once induction is complete, and that immunomodulator withdrawal in quiescent disease remains an area of uncertainty with no firm recommendation either way [^113y65sE] [^116yFMq3] [^115UvU4M]. Hold on, I should verify that shared decision-making is emphasized given the balance of benefits, risks, and costs over time [^115NcoAr].

> Let me think about special scenarios. Isolated perianal Crohn's disease without luminal inflammation is increasingly recognized; diagnostic criteria are evolving, and management still hinges on anti-inflammatory therapy, with anti-TNF as a reasonable first-line approach despite absent bowel disease, though I should communicate the uncertainty and tailor to patient goals and risk tolerance [^11391bmj]. For non-perianal fistulas such as enterocutaneous or enterovesical, anti-TNF therapy can control inflammation and avert or delay surgery in a meaningful proportion, but I should counsel that cumulative surgery rates rise over time and that multidisciplinary reassessment is essential if response lags [^111dyEgp] [^1138EqiW].

> I should double-check prognostic modifiers that influence sequencing and expectations. Active proctitis, complex branching tracts, and high inflammatory burden predict poorer healing and favor earlier anti-TNF and combined strategies; conversely, simple low fistulas without rectal inflammation have the best chance of durable closure with either medical or surgical therapy, which should inform shared decision-making and timing of definitive repair [^115igaeP] [^115zbuGd]. Let me verify that guidelines also stress early biologic introduction rather than prolonged step-up delays in high-risk phenotypes to mitigate complications, aligning with treat-to-target principles [^1157cCR3].

> In summary, I need to ensure the care pathway remains coherent: control sepsis and define anatomy first; use infliximab as preferred anti-TNF with a 12-week antibiotic adjunct for induction; consider adalimumab, ustekinumab, or vedolizumab as alternatives based on tolerance and availability; integrate seton drainage and selective surgical closure for complex disease; maintain remission with ongoing biologic therapy and objective reassessment; and individualize decisions using classification frameworks and patient goals, recognizing that best-reported healing rates with combined approaches hover around 50% and that iterative adjustments are often necessary [^116WNvkF] [^1117BQ5L] [^111SN5kR]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about any single modality curing all fistulas; the evidence consistently supports a multidisciplinary, treat-to-target strategy with realistic expectations and close follow-up to optimize outcomes [^116WNvkF] [^113nnjYf].

---

Fistulizing Crohn's disease is best managed with a **multidisciplinary approach** that combines medical and surgical therapies [^116WNvkF]. Anti-TNF agents (especially infliximab) are the **cornerstone of medical therapy** [^116yFMq3], with antibiotics as adjuncts for symptom control [^112CHVQQ] and immunomodulators to optimize pharmacokinetics [^1145LoQe]. Surgery is reserved for refractory cases or complications, with setons, fistulotomy, LIFT, and advancement flaps as options [^117FyKh9] [^116sZzdN] [^112KNYqF] [^114dyBip]. MRI is the **gold standard for imaging** [^111zXN17] to define anatomy and guide therapy [^115igaeP]. Despite advances, recurrence is common, so ongoing monitoring and individualized care are essential [^116NmRFF].

---

## Epidemiology and clinical significance

Fistulas occur in approximately 25% of patients with Crohn's disease [^116KTGkU] and are associated with significant morbidity, including pain, infection, and impaired quality of life [^114XXBZR] [^111SN5kR]. Perianal fistulas are the most common, but fistulas can also occur in other locations, such as enteroenteric, enterocutaneous, and enterovesical [^114JoZvL].

---

## Pathophysiology

Fistula formation in Crohn's disease is driven by **chronic transmural inflammation**, leading to the formation of abnormal tracts between the bowel and adjacent structures. Key cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-13, and TGF-β, play significant roles in promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and tissue remodeling, facilitating fistula formation [^115igaeP].

---

## Classification and diagnostic evaluation

Classification of fistulas is based on **anatomical location, complexity, and presence of abscesses** [^notfound]. Diagnostic evaluation includes:

- **Clinical examination**: Identification of external openings, assessment of disease activity, and evaluation of rectal involvement [^115igaeP].

- **Imaging**: MRI is the gold standard for defining fistula anatomy, identifying abscesses, and guiding surgical planning [^notfound]. Endoscopic ultrasound and CT are adjunctive modalities [^notfound].

- **Endoscopy**: Assessment of rectal mucosa and identification of active inflammation or proctitis [^115igaeP].

---

## Medical management

Medical therapy aims to **control inflammation, promote fistula healing, and prevent recurrence**. The following medications are commonly used:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Role in management** |
|-|-|-|
| Antibiotics | - Ciprofloxacin <br/> - Metronidazole | Adjunctive therapy for symptom control and reduction of drainage [^112CHVQQ] |
| Anti-TNF agents | - Infliximab <br/> - Adalimumab | Induction and maintenance of fistula remission; infliximab has the most robust evidence [^116yFMq3] [^114zjuea] |
| Immunomodulators | - Azathioprine <br/> - Methotrexate | Adjunctive therapy to optimize pharmacokinetics and enhance anti-TNF efficacy [^1145LoQe] |
| Stem cell therapy | Darvadstrocel | Promising option for complex perianal fistulas refractory to conventional therapy [^113vDn87] |

---

## Surgical management

Surgical intervention is indicated for **refractory fistulas, abscess drainage, or complications**. Common surgical techniques include:

- **Seton placement**: Facilitates drainage, reduces recurrence, and allows medical therapy to work effectively [^117FyKh9].

- **Fistulotomy**: Reserved for simple, low-lying fistulas without proctitis [^116sZzdN].

- **LIFT (ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract)**: Effective for complex fistulas [^112KNYqF].

- **Advancement flap repair**: Useful for complex fistulas without active proctitis [^114dyBip].

- **Fecal diversion**: Temporary ileostomy or colostomy for refractory disease [^114rxQsu].

- **Proctectomy**: Last resort for severe, refractory perianal disease [^1131d5wK].

---

## Multidisciplinary care

Effective management of fistulizing Crohn's disease requires a **multidisciplinary approach** involving gastroenterologists, colorectal surgeons, radiologists, and nursing staff [^116WNvkF]. This collaborative approach ensures comprehensive evaluation, individualized treatment planning, and optimal outcomes [^116KTGkU].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Fistulizing Crohn's disease has a high recurrence rate, with approximately 50% of patients experiencing recurrence within 2 years despite medical and surgical therapy [^notfound]. Persistent inflammation, smoking, and inadequate medical therapy are significant risk factors for recurrence [^notfound].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Recent advances include the development of novel biologic agents, stem cell therapies, and **minimally invasive surgical techniques** [^1149v3u3]. Darvadstrocel, an **adipose-derived stem cell therapy**, has shown promising results in promoting fistula healing and reducing recurrence [^113vDn87]. Ongoing research aims to improve understanding of fistula pathogenesis and develop **targeted therapies** [^115igaeP].

---

Fistulizing Crohn's disease is a complex condition requiring a **multidisciplinary approach** that combines medical and surgical therapies. Anti-TNF agents are the cornerstone of medical therapy, while surgical interventions are reserved for refractory cases or complications. Despite advances, recurrence remains common, necessitating ongoing monitoring and individualized care.

### Clinical practice guideline for the medical management of perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease: the toronto consensus [^116KTGkU]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Fistulas occur in about 25% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and can be difficult to treat. The aim of this consensus was to provide guidance for the management of patients with perianal fistulizing CD.

Methods

A systematic literature search identified studies on the management of fistulizing CD. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Statements were developed through an iterative online platform using a modified Delphi process, then finalized, and voted on by a group of specialists.

Results

The quality of evidence for treatment of fistulizing CD was generally of very low quality, and because of the scarcity of good randomized controlled trials (RCTs), these consensus statements generally provide conditional suggestions (5 of 7 statements). Imaging and surgical consultations were recommended in the initial assessment of patients with active fistulizing CD, particularly those with complicated disease. Antibiotic therapy is useful for initial symptom control. Antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy was recommended to induce symptomatic response, and continued use was suggested to achieve and maintain complete remission. The use of concomitant immunosuppressant therapies may be useful to optimize pharmacokinetic parameters when initiating anti-TNF therapy. When there has been an inadequate symptomatic response to medical management strategies, surgical therapy may provide effective fistula healing for some patients.

Conclusions

Optimal management of perianal fistulizing CD requires a collaborative effort between gastroenterologists and surgeons and may include the evidence-based use of existing therapies, as well as surgical assessments and interventions when needed. 10.1093/ibd/izy247_video1izy247.video15978518763001.

### Current review of the management of fistulising perianal Crohn's disease [^11339W38]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Perianal manifestations of Crohn's disease constitute a distinct disease phenotype commonly affecting patients and conferring an increased risk of disability and disease burden. Much research has gone into management of fistulising manifestations, with biological therapy changing the landscape of treatment. In this article, we discuss the up-to-date surgical and medical management of perianal fistulas, highlighting current consensus management guidelines and the evidence behind them, as well as future directions in management.

### Medical and surgical management of perianal Crohn's disease [^111zY4p7]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease is increasingly thought to encompass multiple possible phenotypes. Perianal manifestations account for one such phenotype and represent an independent disease modifier. In its more severe form, perianal Crohn's disease confers a higher risk of a severe and disabling disease course, relapses, hospital admissions and operations. This, in turn, imposes a considerable burden and disability on patients. Identification of the precise manifestation is important, as management is nuanced, with both medical and surgical components, and is best undertaken in a multidisciplinary setting for both diagnosis and ongoing treatment. The introduction of biologic medication has heralded a significant addition to the management of fistulizing perianal Crohn's disease in particular, albeit with modest results. It remains a very challenging condition to treat and further work is required to optimize management in this group of patients.

### Diagnosis and management of fistulizing Crohn's disease [^114XXBZR]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

The transmural inflammation characteristic of Crohn's disease predisposes patients to the formation of fistulas. Up to 50% of patients with Crohn's disease are affected by fistulas, which is a major problem given the considerable morbidity associated with this complication. Appropriate treatment of fistulas requires knowledge of specific pharmacological and surgical therapies. Treatment options depend on the severity of symptoms, fistula location, the number and complexity of fistula tracts, and the presence of rectal complications. Internal fistulas, such as ileoileal or ileocecal fistulas, are mostly asymptomatic and do not require intervention. By contrast, perianal fistulas can be painful and abscesses may develop that require surgical drainage with or without seton placement, transient ileostomy, or in severe cases, proctectomy. This Review describes the epidemiology and pathology of fistulizing Crohn's disease. Particular focus is given to external and perianal fistulas, for which treatment options are well established. Available therapeutic options, including novel therapies, are discussed. Wherever possible, practical and evidence-based treatment regimens for Crohn's disease-associated fistulas are provided.

### Treatment of fistulizing Crohn's disease [^112fsSF6]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The primary goals of the clinician in the treatment of fistulizing Crohn's disease (CD) include (1) defining the anatomy of the fistula, (2) draining any associated infectious material, (3) eradicating the fistulous tract through medical or surgical therapies, and (4) preventing recurrence of fistulas. Evaluation and therapeutic decisions require close collaboration between the gastroenterologist and surgeon. Appropriate evaluation should include identification of septic complications, delineation of the fistulous tract including the origin and terminus of the fistula, and determination of the extent of bowel involvement with active CD. Drainage of abscesses and control of septic complications through the placement of drains or setons is essential. Conservative therapy with avoidance of sphincter muscle-cutting procedures is the standard approach. The appropriate approach to asymptomatic patients is uncertain because there are little data to indicate if treatment alters the natural course of disease.

### French national consensus clinical guidelines for the management of Crohn's disease [^112bQ91c]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic and disabling condition. There is no curative medical treatment but current treatments provide increasingly sustainable control of the disease and allow patients a better quality of life. There is limited evidence supporting CD management in specific clinical situations, thus precluding an evidence-based approach.

Aims

To help clinicians in making informed treatment decisions, a group of 59 French gastroenterologists with experience in the management of CD met to develop straightforward and practical algorithms based on the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) recommendations.

Methods

This experts' opinion was developed following a Nominal Group consensus methodology. Nine clinical situations were identified: mildly active CD; uncomplicated moderately active CD, with, and without poor prognostic factors; uncomplicated severely active CD; perianal CD with a single fistula; perianal CD with complex fistula with or without abscess; complicated CD with abscess; intestinal stricture; and post-operative CD. Two working groups were formed and proposed algorithms that were then approved by a two-thirds majority of the Nominal Group.

Results

These algorithms represent the pragmatic consensus of a group of experts in gastroenterology on the modalities of therapeutic care in different clinical situations in CD. They are available via a web application at: www.algorithmici.com.

### Identifying outcomes in clinical trials of fistulizing Crohn's disease for the development of a core outcome set [^114JoZvL]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Fistulizing complications develop in approximately one third of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), resulting in morbidity and impaired quality of life. 1 Sites of fistulae most commonly include perianal fistulae, but also enterocutaneous, enteroenteric, enterovesical, and rectovaginal. Its management requires combined medical and surgical strategies to prevent abscess formation and induce healing. Biologic agents have improved the medical treatment of CD-related fistulae, but many patients still require surgical intervention. Hence, there is considerable interest in the development of novel pharmaceutical agents to treat fistulizing CD.

---

### Infliximab in fistulizing Crohn's disease [^117EzqYF]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The treatment of fistulizing CD has evolved greatly in the last 15 years, largely caused by improvements in medical therapy. Tables 2 and 3 summarize all published controlled and uncontrolled trials of immunomodulator and biologic therapy for the treatment of Crohn's fistulae. The advent of immunomodulators and anti-TNF-alpha agents has transformed the treatment of Crohn's fistulae from almost exclusively surgical to placing a much larger emphasis on medical therapy, either as initial therapy alone, with surgery reserved for refractory cases, or in combination with surgery from the start. For this reason, surgeons and gastroenterologists must work in concert to provide the best care for each patient. Proper fistula management also relies heavily on accurate diagnosis, especially defining the anatomy of the fistula, ascertaining whether abscess formation is present, and determining the location and extent of intestinal inflammation.

### Modern management of perianal fistulas in Crohn's disease: future directions [^111SN5kR]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Perianal fistulae in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) can be associated with significant morbidity resulting in negative impact on quality of life. The last two decades have seen significant advancements in the management of perianal fistulas in CD, which has evolved into a multidisciplinary approach that includes gastroenterologists, colorectal surgeons, endoscopists and radiologists. Despite the introduction of new medical therapies such as antitumour necrosis factor and novel models of care delivery, the best fistula healing rates reported with combined medical and surgical approaches are approximately 50%. More recently, newer biologics, cell-based therapies as well as novel endoscopic and surgical techniques have been introduced raising new hopes that outcomes can be improved upon. In this review, we describe the modern management and the most recent advances in the management of complex perianal fistulising CD, which will likely impact clinical practice. We will explore optimal use of both older and newer biological agents, as well as new data on cell-based therapies. In addition, new techniques in endoscopic and surgical approaches will be discussed.

### Crohn's disease: how modern is the management of fistulizing disease? [^1152M1Jh]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Considerable advances in tools for the diagnosis and management of Crohn's disease have been made. Despite technological progress, a new study reports that more than one-third of patients with Crohn's disease are still diagnosed with fistulizing disease intraoperatively and that the surgical management of these patients is not well characterized.

### Perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease: pathogenesis, diagnosis and therapy [^115igaeP]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease has a major negative effect on patient quality of life and is a predictor of poor long-term outcomes. Factors involved in the pathogenesis of perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease include an increased production of transforming growth factor β, TNF and IL-13 in the inflammatory infiltrate that induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases, leading to tissue remodelling and fistula formation. Care of patients with perianal Crohn's disease requires a multidisciplinary approach. A complete assessment of fistula characteristics is the basis for optimal management and must include the clinical evaluation of fistula openings, endoscopic assessment of the presence of proctitis, and MRI to determine the anatomy of fistula tracts and presence of abscesses. Local injection of mesenchymal stem cells can induce remission in patients not responding to medical therapies, or to avoid the exposure to systemic immunosuppression in patients naive to biologics in the absence of active luminal disease. Surgery is still required in a high proportion of patients and should not be delayed when criteria for drug failure is met. In this Review, we provide an up-to-date overview on the pathogenesis and diagnosis of fistulizing Crohn's disease, as well as therapeutic strategies.

### Recent developments in the surgical management of perianal fistula for Crohn's disease [^116NmRFF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Concluding remarks

Even with modern medical and surgical advancements for treatment of perianal CD, it remains challenging to treat. Most of the literature to guide our practice is based on small case series, often with limited follow up. With most of the existing case reports and series it is hard to draw conclusions, especially considering the variability of disease presentation. There is still no one definitive or long-term effective treatment for all perianal CD. Recurrences are high and surgical treatments must be individualized in order to minimize risks. A proposed algorithm is shown in Fig. 1. It is imperative that perianal CD fistulizing disease is approached with a multidisciplinary team comprising surgeons, gastroenterologists, radiologists and pathologists.

AGA guideline methodology — critical outcomes, effect metrics, and minimal clinically important difference are specified. "In formulating this guideline, the predetermined critical outcomes were induction and maintenance of remission", and for fistulizing disease, "induction and maintenance of fistula remission was generally defined as complete cessation of fistula drainage". Estimates of effect are "presented as the risk for failure to induce or maintain remission", and "a relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) < 1 suggests that the drug under consideration is more effective than the comparison drug or placebo for induction or maintenance of remission". For trials versus placebo, "a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was set at 10%", and "Failure to meet the MCID was considered to have no clinically meaningful impact over placebo". Important outcomes also included "induction and maintenance of endoscopic remission, maintenance of corticosteroid-free remission, serious adverse events (including serious infections and malignancy), and treatment tolerability (drug discontinuation due to adverse events)".

### The potential for medical therapies to address fistulizing Crohn's disease: a state-of-the-art review [^1149v3u3]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, relapsing immune mediated disease, which is one of the two major types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Fistulizing CD poses a significant clinical challenge for physicians. Effective management of CD requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving a gastroenterologist and a GI surgeon while tailoring treatment to each patient's unique risk factors, clinical representations, and preferences.

Areas Covered

This comprehensive review explores the intricacies of fistulizing CD including its manifestations, types, impact on quality of life, management strategies, and novel therapies under investigation.

Expert Opinion

Antibiotics are often used as first-line therapy to treat symptoms. Biologics that selectively target TNF-α, such infliximab (IFX), have shown high efficacy in randomized controlled trials. However, more than 50% of patients lose response to IFX, prompting them to explore alternative strategies. Current options include adalimumab and certolizumab pegol combination therapies, as well as small-molecule drugs targeting Janus kinases such as Upadacitinib. Furthermore, a promising treatment for complex fistulas is mesenchymal stem cells such as Darvadstrocel (Alofisel), an allogeneic stem cell-based therapy. However, surgical interventions are necessary for complex cases or intra-abdominal complications. Setons and LIFT procedures are the most common surgical options.

### A global consensus on the classification, diagnosis and multidisciplinary treatment of perianal fistulising Crohn's disease [^115zbuGd]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop a consensus on the classification, diagnosis and multidisciplinary treatment of perianal fistulising Crohn's disease (pCD), based on best available evidence.

Methods

Based on a systematic literature review, statements were formed, discussed and approved in multiple rounds by the 20 working group participants. Consensus was defined as at least 80% agreement among voters. Evidence was assessed using the modified GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) criteria.

Results

Highest diagnostic accuracy can only be established if a combination of modalities is used. Drainage of sepsis is always first line therapy before initiating immunosuppressive treatment. Mucosal healing is the goal in the presence of proctitis. Whereas antibiotics and thiopurines have a role as adjunctive treatments in pCD, anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) is the current gold standard. The efficacy of infliximab is best documented although adalimumab and certolizumab pegol are moderately effective. Oral tacrolimus could be used in patients failing anti-TNF therapy. Definite surgical repair is only of consideration in the absence of luminal inflammation.

Conclusions

Based on a multidisciplinary approach, items relevant for fistula management were identified and algorithms on diagnosis and treatment of pCD were developed.

### Classifying perianal fistulising Crohn's disease: an expert consensus to guide decision-making in daily practice and clinical trials [^112xhxii]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Perianal fistulising Crohn's disease is an aggressive disease phenotype that can have a substantial detrimental impact on patients' quality of life. Current biological understanding of perianal fistulising Crohn's disease remains inadequate and previous classification systems have not provided clear guidance on therapy in clinical practice nor on defining patient cohorts within clinical trials. We propose a new classification system for perianal fistulising Crohn's disease that was developed through a modified nominal group technique expert consensus process. The classification identifies four groups of patients. Key elements include stratification according to disease severity as well as disease outcome; synchronisation of patient and clinician goals in decision making, with a proactive, combined medical and surgical approach, on a treat to patient goal basis; and identification of indications for curative fistula treatment, diverting ostomy, and proctectomy. The new classification retains an element of flexibility, in which patients can cycle through different classes over time. Furthermore, with each specific class comes a paired treatment strategy suggestion and description of clinical trial suitability. The proposed classification system is the first of its kind and is an important step towards tailored standardisation of clinical practice and research in patients with perianal fistulising Crohn's disease.

### Perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease: utilizing the TOpClass classification in clinical practice to provide targeted individualized care [^115sfp24]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Perianal fistulation is a challenging phenotype of Crohn's disease, with significant impact on quality of life. Historically, fistulae have been classified anatomically in relation to the sphincter complex, and management guidelines have been generalized, with lack of attention to the clinical heterogenicity seen. The recent 'TOpClass classification system' for perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease (PFCD) addresses this issue, and classifies patients into defined groups, which provide a focus for fistula management that aligns with disease characteristics and patient goals. In this article, we discuss the clinical applicability of the TOpClass model and provide direction on its use in clinical practice.

Methods

An international group of perianal clinicians participated in an expert consensus to define how the TOpClass system can be incorporated into real-life practice. This included gastroenterologists, inflammatory bowel disease surgeons, and radiologists specialized in PFCD. The process was informed by the multi-disciplinary team management of 8 high-volume fistula centres in North America, Europe, and Australia.

Results

The process produced position statements to accompany the classification system and guide PFCD management. The statements range from the management of patients with quiescent perianal disease to those with severe PFCD requiring diverting-ostomy and/or proctectomy. The optimization of medical therapies, as well as the use of surgery, in fistula closure and symptom management is explored across each classification group.

Conclusion

This article provides an overview of the system's use in clinical practice. It aims to enable clinicians to have a pragmatic and patient goal-centered approach to medical and surgical management options for individual patients with PFCD.

### Management of patients with complex perianal fistulas in Crohn's disease: optimal patient flow in the Italian clinical reality [^113QGb1w]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease (PFCD) is a common, disabling and aggressive phenotype that negatively impacts on the quality of life of affected patients. Its successful treatment is still a struggle for both physicians and patients. Significant advances in the management of this condition have occurred in the last two decades holding promise for a better future. This culminated into the concept of a collaborative multidisciplinary approach using the latest medical therapies combined with modern surgical and endoscopic techniques. Despite this, PFCD management and treatment have not been standardized yet. Thus the gastroenterologist and surgeon have to be familiar with several approaches and/or techniques. The positioning of each therapeutic option will certainly evolve with new data, but for the time being it should be driven by patient's characteristics, physician's preference and/or experience, costs and availability in local practice. Additionally, patient's perception of benefits and risks of treatment may differ from those of physicians and recognition of this difference is a starting point for difficult clinical decision-making. In this paper, a multidisciplinary group of Italian IBD experts explore and discuss current medical and surgical therapeutic options, highlighting areas of unmet needs in PFCD, with particular focus on the optimal patient flow within the Italian clinical reality.

Perianal manifestations of Crohn's disease (CD) are common and, of them, fistulas are the most common. Perianal fistulas can be extremely debilitating for patients and are often very challenging for clinicians to treat. CD perianal fistulas usually require multidisciplinary and multimodality treatment, including both medical and surgical approaches. The majority of patients require multiple surgical interventions. CD patients with perianal fistulas have a high rate of primary non-healing, surgical morbidity, and high recurrence rates. This has led to constant efforts to improve surgical management of this disease process.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® Crohn disease-child [^111zXN17]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Crohn disease is an inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract with episodes of exacerbation and remission occurring in children, adolescents, and adults. Crohn disease diagnosis and treatment depend upon a combination of clinical, laboratory, endoscopic, histological, and imaging findings. Appropriate use of imaging provides critical information in the settings of diagnosis, assessment of acute symptoms, disease surveillance, and therapy monitoring. Four variants are discussed. The first variant discusses the initial imaging for suspected Crohn disease before established diagnosis. The second variant pertains to appropriateness of imaging modalities during suspected acute exacerbation. The third variant is a substantial discussion of recommendations related to disease surveillance and monitoring of Crohn disease. Finally, panel recommendations and discussion of perianal fistulizing disease imaging completes the document. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Early combination therapy versus step-up management in Crohn's disease — The REACT open-label cluster randomized trial comparing an algorithmic approach of early combination therapy with an immunomodulator and biologic drug versus conventional management reported at 12 months no significant difference in corticosteroid-free remission (66% early combination therapy vs 62% in usual care), but at 24 months lower rates of major adverse disease-related complications with early combination therapy (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62–0.86). In an RCT of 122 patients randomized to early azathioprine within 6 months of Crohn's disease diagnosis versus conventional management, there were no significant differences over 3 years in corticosteroid-requiring flare (58 of 65 [89%] vs 61 of 67 [91%]; p = 0.73), hospitalization (22 of 65 [34%] vs 26 of 67 [39%]; p = 0.74), or CD-related surgery (5 of 65 [8%] vs 4 of 67 [6%]; p = 0.68). The guideline panel noted that delaying appropriate therapy by using a step-up policy may result in clinical harm, while earlier combination or biologic monotherapy may overtreat some patients and the step-up paradigm is associated with a potential risk of harm from disease progression.

### Positioning biologics in the management of moderate to severe Crohn's disease [^114YGDuE]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Since there is a lack of head-to-head randomized controlled trials, little direction is provided from guidelines on the positioning of biologics for the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD). This review utilizes comparative effectiveness and safety results from real-world data and network meta-analyses to inform clinical practice for positioning of biological therapies in the treatment of moderate-to-severe CD.

Recent Findings

We summarize the results of studies pertaining to the identification of predictors for response to biologics in CD. Recently published studies about the management of moderate-to-severe CD are discussed and a positioning algorithm is proposed for the therapeutic approach of these patients.

Summary

Different classes of biologics are comparable with regards to safety and almost similar in effectiveness in the management of CD. There are certain clinical scenarios in which one biologic is more effective than another. For instance, patients with a more aggressive disease phenotype such as fistulizing disease would benefit from infliximab over other biologics, whereas in older patients at a higher risk for infectious complications, it may be more appropriate to use ustekinumab or vedolizumab over the anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents. More data pertaining to identifying predictors of response to the different available therapies and head-to-head comparison trials are needed to personalize our therapeutic approach of CD patients.

Combination therapy withdrawal in quiescent Crohn's disease (CD) is not directed by the guideline, as the AGA makes no recommendation for withdrawal of either the immunomodulator or the biologic over ongoing combination therapy of a biologic and an immunomodulator (No recommendation, knowledge gap). Across 3 randomized controlled trials including 161 patients on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) antagonist–based combination therapy for at least 6 months, there were no significant differences in relapse over 12–24 months when continuing therapy versus withdrawing immunomodulators (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.71–1.46). In a prospective cohort of 115 patients discontinuing infliximab, the risks of relapse were 44% at 1 year and 52% at 2 years, and based on limited observational data, stopping the biologic while continuing the immunomodulator might lead to a high risk of relapse; therefore the panel opted to make no recommendation.

### Adalimumab for the treatment of Crohn's disease [^111BRDMm]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

The advent of biologic therapy for Crohn's disease has revolutionized our approach to disease management and redefined our goals. Infliximab (Remicade), an intravenously delivered murine-chimeric monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha was released in 1998 and shown to have significant benefits in patients with refractory luminal and fistulizing Crohn's disease. Since then other anti-TNF strategies have undergone investigation with variable results. Adalimumab (Humira), a self administered, subcutaneous, fully human monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha represents the next generation of therapy. It has demonstrated efficacy for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's in three large double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials. In addition it has demonstrated steroid-sparing properties and the ability to reduce hospitalizations and improve quality of life. It is anticipated, given its clinical efficacy, its fully human nature, and the convenience of self administration that it will have a significant effect on the management of Crohn's disease.

### Human mesenchymal stem cell therapy in the management of luminal and perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease-review of pathomechanism and existing clinical data [^1151R6kA]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, recurring, idiopathic disease which is associated with imbalanced mucosal immune response, manifesting as a chronic inflammation of any location throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The purpose of currently available therapy is to suppress the heightened immune response. However, these treatments have no direct influence on the healing process of damaged tissues. The mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy may represent a new alternative solution in both luminal and fistulizing CD, as it is able to inhibit the inflammation and promote the regeneration process at the same time.

Areas Covered

Aim of this review is to summarize the existing clinical data about the clinical impact of MSC therapy in luminal and perianal fistulizing CD.

Expert Opinion

Clinical trials demonstrated that MSC transplantation has an outstanding, durable efficacy with low fistula recurrence in biological therapy-refractory fistulizing CD; however, further clinical trials are required to confirm its effectiveness in luminal CD. Unlike to biological therapy, MSCs are able to promote the regeneration process of damaged tissues as well. This additional benefit besides their sustained immunosuppressive effect with no decrease of efficiency over time makes MSCs a new, highly potential therapeutic approach in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.

### Medical and surgical management of perianal Crohn's disease [^112GmLzU]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Crohn's disease (CD) affects approximately 145 people per 100,000 population in the UK and between 4 and 250 people per 100,000 population worldwide, having a varied presentation. Perianal CD (PCD) represents one phenotype and is an independent disease modifier. PCD encompasses a range of manifestations, from skin tags, to fissures, ulcers, strictures, abscesses, and fistulas. Various attempts have been made to classify these manifestations, but the uptake of these has been poor to date, possibly because of their limited clinical applicability and prognostic relevance, especially in relation to treatment. In 2003, the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) clinical practice committee adopted a pragmatic approach, classifying perianal lesions based on broad groupings of fistulizing manifestations (perianal and rectovaginal fistula/abscess) and non-fistulizing manifestations (skin tags, fissures, ulcers, anorectal stricture, hemorrhoids, anal cancer).

The true incidence of PCD is difficult to determine given the heterogeneity in definition and reporting. A wide range of prevalence is reported and accuracy is further hampered by the variable data sources (including single-center experiences and small population studies). Perianal fistulas account for a particularly disabling disease phenotype and occur in approximately a third of patients with CD. The management of PCD is multidisciplinary and in this review we describe evidence-based surgical and medical aspects of treatment.

Fistulas manifest frequently in Crohn disease and can result in significant morbidity and often lead to the need for surgical intervention. Historically, it has been more difficult to obtain complete fistula closure in patients with perianal Crohn disease. Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha agents and the use of more accurate imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging and rectal endoscopic ultrasound have enhanced the ability to manage fistulizing Crohn disease. A combined medical and surgical approach usually presents the best option for most patients.

Methotrexate route and dosing in moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) — efficacy and guidance: The AGA suggests the use of subcutaneous or intramuscular methotrexate monotherapy over no treatment for the induction and maintenance of remission and suggests against the use of oral methotrexate monotherapy over no treatment for the induction and maintenance of remission. The panel evaluated oral versus intramuscular/subcutaneous methotrexate separately due to differences related to route and total dose. Subcutaneous methotrexate dosed at 25 mg/wk in 1 trial of 141 patients was effective for induction of remission (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61–0.93). For maintenance, subcutaneous methotrexate dosed at 15 mg/wk in 1 trial of 76 patients after 16–25 weeks of 25 mg/wk was more effective than placebo for maintaining corticosteroid-free remission (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34–0.94). In contrast, oral methotrexate at 12.5 mg/wk was not effective for induction (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.72–1.82) and was not more effective than placebo for maintenance (RR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.04–2.27); the panel noted the single oral RCT may have used a suboptimal dose.

### Isolated perianal Crohn's disease: a systematic review and expert consensus proposing novel diagnostic criteria and management advice [^11391bmj]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Perianal fistulae can present a diagnostic challenge when distinguishing perianal Crohn's disease from idiopathic perianal fistulae. This distinction is key, as perianal Crohn's disease requires inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) therapy, whereas idiopathic perianal fistulae are primarily managed surgically. When luminal inflammation is absent, but Crohn's disease is suspected, the term isolated perianal Crohn's disease is sometimes applied. However, no formal guidance exists for diagnosing or managing isolated perianal Crohn's disease. Furthermore, whereas fistula granuloma might provide specific evidence of Crohn's disease, they are rarely detected in perianal fistulae, so are unlikely to sensitively delineate aetiology. This project aimed to develop an opinion-based framework for isolated perianal Crohn's disease. A systematic review evaluated clinical features suggestive of isolated perianal Crohn's disease and evidence for IBD therapies in patients with perianal fistulae without luminal IBD. The findings of this systematic review informed a multidisciplinary consensus process with IBD specialists, resulting in the formulation of diagnostic criteria and management recommendations for isolated perianal Crohn's disease. We then tested this diagnostic approach in a prospective cohort of 50 patients treated as having idiopathic perianal fistulae at a proctology referral centre, identifying six (12%) individuals as meeting the diagnostic criteria. Our findings underscore the scarcity of evidence guiding isolated perianal Crohn's disease diagnosis and the need for a composite risk-based assessment. The proposed framework provides a tool for clinical practice and research but requires validation and refinement. Clear communication with patients is essential, given the diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainties. Future studies should refine these criteria, explore biological markers for isolated perianal Crohn's disease, and establish evidence-based methods to differentiate isolated perianal Crohn's disease within the perianal fistulae spectrum.

Patients with Crohn's disease often develop perianal disease, successfully managed in most cases. However, its most aggressive form, complex perianal disease, is associated with high morbidity and a significant impairment in patients' quality of life. The aim of this review is to provide an updated approach to this condition, reviewing aspects of its epidemiology, diagnosis and therapeutic alternatives. Emerging treatment options are also discussed. A multidisciplinary assessment of these patients with a coordinated medical and surgical approach is crucial.

### Developing a core outcome set for fistulising perianal Crohn's disease [^113nCFS7]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first study to standardise outcome reporting in fistulising pCD. An exhaustive list of candidate outcome measures was generated through a systematic review of contemporary outcomes, together with patient views. Using an online tool, a large number of stakeholders were able to participate in a pragmatic Delphi consensus process that ensured emphasis on patient perspective and clinical relevance. Consensus voting and discussion generated a COS that all stakeholders supported with applicability to all study designs. The aim is to improve research and to use this COS as an impetus to drive improvement in clinical management within the field. The COS allows measurement of outcomes for all cohorts of adult patients with pCD, regardless of disease state, the intervention under assessment or the presence of luminal disease. In this study, we established an eight-domain COS for use in studies evaluating interventions in fistulising pCD. A two-domain radiological module is also strongly advocated for use wherever possible.

### Effectiveness and safety of darvadstrocel in patients with complex perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease: a systematic review [^113vDn87]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Managing complex perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease (CD) remains challenging, despite current medical and surgical treatment approaches. Darvadstrocel, a therapy utilizing adipose-derived stem cells, shows promise in promoting tissue regeneration and healing, offering a novel and effective treatment for fistula management.

Method

A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed and Scopus to identify studies involving patients with complex perianal fistulizing CD treated with darvadstrocel.

Results

In total, 2 randomized controlled trials (RCT), 5 observational studies with retrospective data collection and 2 observational studies with prospective design were included in the final review. Data from the European ADMIRE-CD RCT demonstrated that darvadstrocel is superior to placebo in terms of clinical and imaging improvement over both the short and long term. These findings align with the prospective studies analyzed in this systematic review. The rate of treatment-emergent adverse events in the ADMIRE-CD trial's RCTs was similar in both the darvadstrocel and control groups, with perianal abscess being the most common adverse event up to 52 weeks after drug administration. Retrospective studies indicated no side-effects beyond 52 weeks.

Conclusions

Darvadstrocel appears to be a new, potentially effective and safe treatment option for the management of complex perianal fistulas. However, more randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of the drug.

JAMA Netw Open. 2020; 3: e207378. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.7378 After propensity score matching, patients who received steroid-sparing therapy were less likely than those who did not to develop PFCs. Numbers in parentheses represent PFC events. Note that SST may have been started at any time after Crohn disease diagnosis but before PFC development or the end of the study. Graphical assessment indicates proportionality assumption was met. Question Does steroid-sparing therapy for Crohn disease reduce the risk of developing perianal fistulizing complications. Findings. Meaning Steroid-sparing therapy should be considered for treatment of Crohn disease to reduce the risk of perianal fistulizing complications.

Importance Perianal fistulizing complications develop in 15% to 30% of patients with Crohn disease, are difficult to treat, worsen quality of life, increase cost of care, and commonly recur. Evidence-based strategies to prevent PFCs are lacking. Crohn disease is a chronic condition, with estimated prevalence in the Western world ranging from 250 to 1300 cases per 100 000 individuals. 1, 2 It can cause severe destructive transmural intestinal inflammation, 3, 4 which may create fistulas that penetrate through the bowel wall. SST was categorized as immunomodulators alone, anti-TNFα alone, or anti-TNFα plus immunomodulators. Consequently, we used ostomies as markers of PFC severity because patients with complex or recalcitrant PFCs commonly require diverting ostomy to facilitate healing.

19 Because ostomy can be performed for reasons other than PFCs, we limited the assessment to ostomy that first occurred in claims at or after PFC development but before the end of the 2-year study period.
