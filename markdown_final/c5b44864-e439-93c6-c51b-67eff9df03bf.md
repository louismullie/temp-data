## Question

prognosis of brugada syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the prognosis of Brugada syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why prognosis varies by phenotype. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence on event rates across symptomatic strata. Next, I will examine risk modifiers, including ECG pattern, electrophysiology, genetics, age, and sex. After that, I should review guideline positions and how they translate into management. Finally, I will synthesize a practical risk framework and highlight uncertainties and controversies that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why prognosis is heterogeneous. Brugada syndrome is a primary electrical disorder with a structurally normal heart, characterized by a type 1 coved ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads and an increased risk of ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death, with marked geographic and phenotypic variability and a male predominance, which already hints that risk is not uniform across populations and presentations [^d180973f] [^9349571a].

> I will now examine the highest-quality registry data to anchor event rates by symptom status. The FINGER registry of 1,029 patients showed that during a median follow-up of 31.9 months, annual event rates were 7.7% with prior aborted SCD, 1.9% with syncope, and 0.5% in asymptomatic patients, establishing a clear gradient of risk that has been repeatedly corroborated in subsequent cohorts and meta-analyses [^77df6e72] [^e4fecc41].

> Wait, let me verify the asymptomatic subgroup more carefully, because this is where management is most controversial. A large 2023 prospective study of 1,149 asymptomatic patients reported an overall arrhythmic event rate of 0.2% per year, with 0.4% per year in those with spontaneous type 1 ECG versus 0.03% per year in those with drug-induced–only type 1 ECG, reinforcing that spontaneous type 1 pattern carries a nontrivial, albeit low, absolute risk in otherwise asymptomatic individuals [^82cb6c3b] [^689aa506].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about electrophysiology. I initially thought EPS inducibility consistently predicts events, but I should double-check the strength and consistency of evidence. Some single-center series and meta-analyses suggest inducibility increases risk, with hazard ratios around 8–11 in selected cohorts, yet broader meta-analyses and guideline appraisals highlight heterogeneity and limited specificity, so EPS is best viewed as a risk modifier rather than a standalone arbiter of ICD candidacy, particularly in asymptomatic patients with spontaneous type 1 ECG where it may refine risk for shared decision-making [^78662426] [^e4fecc41] [^ed9a20b5] [^255cc244].

> Next, I should review ECG features beyond the type 1 pattern that portend higher risk. Systematic reviews identify at least a dozen ECG markers associated with increased events, including fragmented QRS, QRS duration greater than 120 ms, first-degree AV block, atrial fibrillation, early repolarization in inferolateral leads, and localization of the type 1 pattern in V2 with extension to peripheral leads, though effect sizes vary and a multiparametric approach is prudent given the dynamic nature of Brugada ECG patterns [^42b3d756] [^3c472313] [^bc38976c].

> I need to check the role of genetics in prognosis. SCN5A variants are found in roughly 20–30% of cases, and while some studies associate SCN5A positivity with a more severe phenotype, contemporary guidelines state that genotype does not independently guide risk stratification or management in the proband, though it aids cascade screening of relatives; emerging data in SCN5A loss-of-function cohorts suggest symptomatic status, male sex, and QRS prolongation predict events, but this is hypothesis-generating rather than practice-changing at present [^e5d693b0] [^20c2a9c1] [^fa28f11c] [^91aaef79].

> Let me consider demographic modifiers. Male sex consistently associates with higher event rates and worse prognosis, whereas women have fewer spontaneous type 1 patterns and lower event rates, though they are not risk-free and may have different risk markers such as conduction disturbances; importantly, older age appears protective, with patients over 60–70 years exhibiting very low event rates in observational series, which should temper aggressive prophylactic therapy in the elderly [^78662426] [^ddcd83d0] [^85a80144] [^9c1dd101].

> I should confirm guideline positions to ensure my synthesis aligns with standards. Contemporary ESC and AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines recommend ICD for secondary prevention after aborted SCD or sustained VT, and for primary prevention in patients with spontaneous type 1 ECG and recent syncope presumed arrhythmic; for asymptomatic patients with spontaneous type 1 ECG, EPS may be considered for further risk stratification, but routine ICD is not recommended, and observation is advised for those with only drug-induced type 1 pattern, reflecting the low absolute risk and potential device complications [^7e582514] [^46e2718d] [^255cc244] [^3120a10e].

> But wait, what about device outcomes and complications that could offset benefit in low-risk patients. Meta-analyses of ICD cohorts show appropriate therapy around 3 per 100 patient-years with non-negligible inappropriate shocks and lead-related complications, underscoring the need to individualize primary prevention decisions, particularly in younger patients with decades of expected device exposure and in those with drug-induced–only type 1 patterns where risk is minimal [^3172493b] [^2ac82052].

> Let me synthesize a practical risk framework, while acknowledging uncertainties. High risk includes prior aborted SCD or sustained VT, and spontaneous type 1 ECG with recent syncope, for whom ICD is indicated; intermediate risk includes asymptomatic spontaneous type 1 ECG, where EPS may refine risk and shared decision-making is essential; low risk includes drug-induced–only type 1 ECG, elderly patients, and women without high-risk ECG features, for whom observation with surveillance is reasonable, with periodic ECG and Holter monitoring to detect evolution of spontaneous type 1 pattern [^46e2718d] [^82cb6c3b] [^85a80144] [^ddcd83d0].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and evolving therapies. In children and adolescents, event rates are low but not zero, and a validated pediatric score incorporating syncope, spontaneous type 1 ECG, conduction disease, and EPS inducibility can identify a high-risk subset; for recurrent VF or electrical storm, quinidine and epicardial substrate ablation are guideline-supported options, and ongoing trials and registries may expand the role of ablation in selected patients, though this remains adjunctive rather than replacing ICD in high-risk phenotypes [^5b1456a5] [^46e2718d] [^09fe572a].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. Prognosis in Brugada syndrome spans from very high in survivors of aborted SCD to very low in asymptomatic patients with drug-induced–only type 1 ECG, with a roughly 10-fold gradient in annual event rates; spontaneous type 1 ECG, prior syncope, male sex, and inducibility at EPS identify higher risk, whereas advanced age, female sex, and drug-induced–only patterns mark lower risk, and current guidelines prioritize ICD for secondary prevention and selected primary prevention scenarios while endorsing observation and selective EPS for low-risk profiles [^77df6e72] [^82cb6c3b] [^46e2718d] [^7e582514].

---

Brugada syndrome has a **variable prognosis** [^d180973f] determined by clinical presentation and ECG pattern. Patients with prior cardiac arrest or syncope have a **high risk** of recurrent ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD) [^77df6e72], with event rates of 7–10% per year for aborted SCD and 1–2% per year for syncope. Asymptomatic patients with a spontaneous type 1 ECG have a **low but nontrivial risk** (~0.5% per year) [^82cb6c3b], while those with only drug-induced type 1 ECG have minimal risk (~0.05% per year) [^82cb6c3b]. Male sex, spontaneous type 1 ECG, and inducible ventricular arrhythmias increase risk [^ac54073d] [^e4fecc41], whereas female sex and older age are associated with lower risk [^78662426] [^9c1dd101]. ICD implantation is the only proven therapy to prevent SCD [^c21ea289] [^7e582514], and risk stratification remains challenging, especially in asymptomatic patients [^a0cbf944] [^6e6526d8].

---

## Clinical presentation and risk stratification

Brugada syndrome presents with a spectrum of symptoms, ranging from **asymptomatic ECG findings** to **syncope**, **seizures**, or **sudden cardiac death** due to ventricular fibrillation (VF) [^9349571a]. Risk stratification is primarily based on clinical presentation, ECG findings, and electrophysiological study (EPS) results [^46e2718d].

| **Risk category** | **Clinical features** | **Annual event rate** |
|-|-|-|
| High risk | - Prior cardiac arrest or documented VF <br/> - Syncope with spontaneous type 1 ECG | - 7–10% [^notfound] |
| Intermediate risk | - Asymptomatic with spontaneous type 1 ECG <br/> - Inducible VF on EPS | - 0.5–1% [^82cb6c3b] [^e4fecc41] |
| Low risk | - Drug-induced type 1 ECG only <br/> - No symptoms | - 0.05–0.1% [^82cb6c3b] |

---

## Prognostic factors

Several factors influence prognosis in Brugada syndrome:

- **Clinical presentation**: Prior cardiac arrest or syncope significantly increases the risk of recurrent events [^77df6e72] [^3e399c37].
- **ECG pattern**: Spontaneous type 1 ECG (coved ST-segment elevation ≥ 2 mm in V1-V3) indicates higher risk than drug-induced type 1 ECG [^3e399c37] [^82cb6c3b].
- **Electrophysiological study (EPS)**: Inducible ventricular arrhythmias during EPS predict higher risk, although the test's specificity is limited [^e4fecc41] [^ed9a20b5].
- **Gender**: Male patients have a higher risk than females [^78662426] [^3e399c37].
- **Age**: Older patients (> 60 years) generally have a more benign prognosis, possibly due to a lower prevalence of spontaneous type 1 ECG and inducible arrhythmias [^85a80144] [^9c1dd101].
- **Genetics**: SCN5A mutations are present in 20–30% of patients but do not independently predict risk [^e5d693b0] [^20c2a9c1].

---

## Long-term outcomes

Long-term follow-up studies show that **event rates remain relatively stable** over time, with a mean annual event rate of approximately 0.5% in asymptomatic patients with spontaneous type 1 ECG [^82cb6c3b]. The risk of arrhythmic events persists throughout life, particularly in high-risk patients [^e42ea518].

---

## Impact of therapy on prognosis

Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy is the only proven intervention to prevent sudden cardiac death in high-risk patients [^c21ea289] [^7e582514]. Meta-analyses show appropriate ICD interventions in 3.1 per 100 person-years, with low cardiac mortality but significant rates of inappropriate shocks and device-related complications [^3172493b]. Pharmacological therapy (e.g. quinidine) and catheter ablation are reserved for specific cases, such as recurrent VF or electrical storms [^46e2718d].

---

## Controversies and uncertainties

Despite advances, **risk stratification remains challenging**, particularly in asymptomatic patients [^a0cbf944]. The role of EPS, genetics, and novel biomarkers is still debated, and management decisions often rely on individualized risk assessment and shared decision-making [^ed9a20b5] [^a0cbf944].

---

Brugada syndrome has a **variable prognosis** [^d180973f], with risk ranging from high in patients with prior cardiac arrest or syncope to low in asymptomatic patients with drug-induced type 1 ECG. ICD implantation is the only proven therapy to prevent SCD, and ongoing research aims to improve risk stratification and personalize management [^c21ea289].

### Brugada syndrome: update and future perspectives [^6e6526d8]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited cardiac disorder, characterised by a typical ECG pattern and an increased risk of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD). BrS is a challenging entity, in regard to diagnosis as well as arrhythmia risk prediction and management. Nowadays, asymptomatic patients represent the majority of newly diagnosed patients with BrS, and its incidence is expected to rise due to (genetic) family screening. Progress in our understanding of the genetic and molecular pathophysiology is limited by the absence of a true gold standard, with consensus on its clinical definition changing over time. Nevertheless, novel insights continue to arise from detailed and in-depth studies, including the complex genetic and molecular basis. This includes the increasingly recognised relevance of an underlying structural substrate. Risk stratification in patients with BrS remains challenging, particularly in those who are asymptomatic, but recent studies have demonstrated the potential usefulness of risk scores to identify patients at high risk of arrhythmia and SCD. Development and validation of a model that incorporates clinical and genetic factors, comorbidities, age and gender, and environmental aspects may facilitate improved prediction of disease expressivity and arrhythmia/SCD risk, and potentially guide patient management and therapy. This review provides an update of the diagnosis, pathophysiology and management of BrS, and discusses its future perspectives.

### Prediction and prevention of sudden death in the Brugada syndrome [^a64ef1eb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) secondary to sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a leading cause of death in the United States, claiming over a quarter million lives annually, and is directly responsible for 50% of all cardiovascular mortality. Brugada Syndrome (BrS) is an arrhythmogenic cardiovascular channelopathy that predisposes asymptomatic patients who have no identified disease to a high-risk of SCD/SCA as their first cardiac event/disease manifestation. Limited progress has been made in risk prediction of SCA and SCD, with the greatest challenge being the ability to identify the small high-risk subgroups concealed within the larger general population. In conclusion, accurate identification of high-risk asymptomatic BrS patients (through multiparametric risk scores composed of reliable and validated unambiguous clinical variables and biomarkers) may hold utility in improving current SCD prediction algorithms, and the appropriate primary prevention therapy may prove valuable in reducing risk of sudden death for this patient population. This systematic review aims to comprehensively summarize qualitative evidence that explore proposed clinical, electrocardiographic, electrophysiological, and genetic markers for risk stratification of patients with BrS phenotype, and to discuss the best available contemporary evidence regarding therapeutic approach.

### Clinical characteristics, management, and prognosis of elderly patients with Brugada syndrome [^85a80144]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical course and prognosis of Brugada syndrome (BS) in the elderly is unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics, management, and prognosis of BS in an elderly population.

Methods and Results

A total of 437 patients with BS were included in this study. Patients were categorized in 2 groups according to the age at the time of diagnosis: < 60 years (N = 363) and ≥ 60 years (N = 74). Moreover, an elderly patients' subgroup analysis was performed between patients with an age between 60 and 70 years (N = 49) and subjects older than 70 years (N = 25). Among elderly patients (50% male, mean age: 67 ± 6 years), family history of sudden death (SD) and induction of sustained ventricular arrhythmias during programmed ventricular stimulation were less frequent as compared to younger patients. Two patients (3%) had a previous episode of aborted SD. Elderly patients with BS presented more frequently with ECG conduction disturbances or previous transient advanced atrioventricular block as compared to younger patients. Of the elderly patients, 42% underwent implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation and 7% received a pacemaker. After a mean follow-up time of 54 ± 18 months, none of the elderly patients with BS older than 70 years experienced documented life-threating ventricular arrhythmias. Family screening was performed in 58 family members and a BS diagnosis was confirmed in 49%.

Conclusion

The clinical features and the benign prognosis of BS patients older than 70 years likely identify a lower risk category of patients as compared to younger individuals. The device-guided management in this setting remains individualized and sometimes controversial. Moreover, BS diagnosis in the elderly should not be missed, mainly due to the clinical impact on the family of elderly patients.

### The Brugada syndrome revisited [^c21ea289]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The Brugada syndrome is a rare but well-defined cause of sudden cardiac death. The key underlying abnormality is a decrease in net depolarising current due to a genetic defect, though recent evidence also implicates structural abnormalities in some patients. Diagnosis requires a Brugada-type ECG as well as typical clinical features: such clinical considerations are currently key in guiding risk stratification and hence management. Whilst pharmacological therapies are under investigation, the only intervention with a robust evidence base remains insertion of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Further research will be required to allow more effective risk stratification and hence more rational therapy.

### Pathogenesis and management of Brugada syndrome [^1e5889e0]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Brugada syndrome is an inherited disease characterized by an increased risk of sudden cardiac death owing to ventricular arrhythmias in the absence of structural heart disease. Since the first description of the syndrome > 20 years ago, considerable advances have been made in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved and the strategies to stratify at-risk patients. The development of repolarization-depolarization abnormalities in patients with Brugada syndrome can involve genetic alterations, abnormal neural crest cell migration, improper gap junctional communication, or connexome abnormalities. A common phenotype observed on the electrocardiogram of patients with Brugada syndrome might be the result of different pathophysiological mechanisms. Furthermore, risk stratification of this patient cohort is critical, and although some risk factors for Brugada syndrome have been frequently reported, several others remain unconfirmed. Current clinical guidelines offer recommendations for patients at high risk of developing sudden cardiac death, but the management of those at low risk has not yet been defined. In this Review, we discuss the proposed mechanisms that underlie the development of Brugada syndrome and the current risk stratification and therapeutic options available for these patients.

Search Strategy

We conducted the systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses guidelines. 13, 14, 15 Two reviewers (A.B. F.V.) elaborated the search strategy in November 2019. The search terms used were the following: ((ECG) OR (EKG) OR (electrocardiogram) OR (electrocardiographic)) AND ((sign) OR (predictor) OR (marker)) AND (Brugada) AND ((sudden death) OR (death) OR (syncope) OR (arrhythmia) OR (ventricular fibrillation) OR (ventricular tachycardia)). The databases analyzed were PubMed and EMBASE. Only articles published in English and in peer‐reviewed journals were eligible for inclusion. A total of 3 independent reviewers (A.B. F.V. M.S.) analyzed the records and decided those that warranted full‐text analysis. The same reviewers (A.B. F.V. M.S.) independently analyzed the references of all the evaluated articles to identify other articles not found through the database search. Disagreement was resolved by consensus. The protocol of this systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO international prospective register for systematic reviews (registration number CRD42019123794).

Selection Criteria

Studies were eligible for selection only if they (1) were an observational or interventional trial in patients with BrS and (2) contained data on ECG signs and arrhythmic events, syncope, cardiac arrest, SCD, and/or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) interventions during follow‐up. We excluded (1) duplicate reports, (2) reports with a duplicated sample size, (3) case report/series, (4) review articles, and (5) articles with no outcome of interest.

Data Extraction and End Points

The reviewers recorded the following information for each article: journal, year of publication, sample characteristics including events at enrollment, outcome, ECG signs related to prognosis with hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs), and sensitivity/specificity when available. The primary outcome of the systematic review was to synthesize the relationship of specific ECG signs of BrS with "arrhythmic risk" defined as the risk of syncope, cardiac arrest, SCD, or appropriate ICD interventions during follow‐up.

### Does the age of sudden cardiac death in family members matter in Brugada syndrome? [^3e12c075]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a heterogeneous genetic ion channel disorder that is associated with an increased risk of major arrhythmic events (MAE) and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Brugada syndrome is characterized by coved‐type (Type‐1) ST elevation appearances in the right precordial leads. The prevalence of patients with a Brugada ECG Type‐1 pattern varies among different populations, ranging from 0% to 0.4%. The most common mutation responsible for BrS is the SCN5A mutation, which is present in 20% to 30% of patients and has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of a family history of SCD in characterizing the disease and prognosis. However, data from other studies report conflicting results and suggest that a family history of SCD is not useful as a risk stratification tool. Risk stratification for ventricular arrhythmias and increased risk of SCD remains challenging in asymptomatic patients with Brugada syndrome. In this study, we aimed to assess whether a family history of SCD is associated with an increased risk of MAE in patients with BrS by performing a systematic review and meta‐analysis.

### Risk stratification of individuals with the Brugada electrocardiogram: a meta-analysis [^3e399c37]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

We performed a meta-analysis of prognostic studies of patients with a Brugada ECG to assess predictors of events.

Background

The Brugada syndrome is an increasingly recognized cause of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation; however, there is wide variation in the prognosis of patients with the Brugada ECG.

Methods and Results

We retrieved 30 prospective studies of patients with the Brugada ECG, accumulating data on 1,545 patients. Summary estimates of the relative risk (RR) of events (sudden cardiac death [SCD], syncope, or internal defibrillator shock) for a variety of potential predictors were made using a random-effects model. The overall event rate at an average of 32 months follow-up was 10.0% (95% CI 8.5%, 11.5%). The RR of an event was increased (P < 0.001) among patients with a history of syncope or SCD (RR 3.24 [95% CI 2.13, 4.93]), men compared with women (RR 3.47 [95% CI 1.58, 7.63]), and patients with a spontaneous compared with sodium-channel blocker induced Type I Brugada ECG (RR 4.65 [95% CI 2.25, 9.58]). The RR of events was not significantly increased in patients with a family history of SCD (P = 0.97) or a mutation of the SCN5A gene (P = 0.18). The RR of events was also not significantly increased in patients inducible compared with noninducible by electrophysiologic study (EPS) (RR 1.88 [95% CI 0.62, 5.73], P = 0.27); however, there was significant heterogeneity of the studies included.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that a history of syncope or SCD, the presence of a spontaneous Type I Brugada ECG, and male gender predict a more malignant natural history. Our findings do not support the use of a family history of SCD, the presence of an SCN5A gene mutation, or EPS to guide the management of patients with a Brugada ECG.

### Long-term prognosis of patients diagnosed with Brugada syndrome: results from the FINGER Brugada syndrome registry [^77df6e72]. Circulation (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Brugada syndrome is characterized by ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Fundamental questions remain on the best strategy for assessing the real disease-associated arrhythmic risk, especially in asymptomatic patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prognosis and risk factors of SCD in Brugada syndrome patients in the FINGER (France, Italy, Netherlands, Germany) Brugada syndrome registry.

Methods and Results

Patients were recruited in 11 tertiary centers in 4 European countries. Inclusion criteria consisted of a type 1 ECG present either at baseline or after drug challenge, after exclusion of diseases that mimic Brugada syndrome. The registry included 1029 consecutive individuals (745 men; 72%) with a median age of 45 (35 to 55) years. Diagnosis was based on (1) aborted SCD (6%); (2) syncope, otherwise unexplained (30%); and (3) asymptomatic patients (64%). During a median follow-up of 31.9 (14 to 54.4) months, 51 cardiac events (5%) occurred (44 patients experienced appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks, and 7 died suddenly). The cardiac event rate per year was 7.7% in patients with aborted SCD, 1.9% in patients with syncope, and 0.5% in asymptomatic patients. Symptoms and spontaneous type 1 ECG were predictors of arrhythmic events, whereas gender, familial history of SCD, inducibility of ventricular tachyarrhythmias during electrophysiological study, and the presence of an SCN5A mutation were not predictive of arrhythmic events.

Conclusions

In the largest series of Brugada syndrome patients thus far, event rates in asymptomatic patients were low. Inducibility of ventricular tachyarrhythmia and family history of SCD were not predictors of cardiac events.

### The Brugada syndrome [^73594e8e]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Brugada syndrome describes the syndrome of sudden cardiac death in the setting of the following electrocardiographic findings: right bundle branch block pattern with ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads. The right bundle branch block may be incomplete while the ST segment elevation is minimal. The electrocardiographic findings are not constant. Patients suspected of having Brugada syndrome should be promptly referred for electrophysiological testing and treatment. Rapid referral and placement of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is associated with an excellent prognosis, whereas failure to diagnose this condition is associated with a high risk for sudden death. Therefore, it is imperative that all emergency physicians be familiar with the typical ECG manifestations of Brugada syndrome. Three illustrative cases are presented with a review of the syndrome.

### Brugada syndrome [^9349571a]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an "inherited" condition characterized by predisposition to syncope and cardiac arrest, predominantly during sleep. The prevalence is ∼1:2,000, and is more commonly diagnosed in young to middle-aged males, although patient sex does not appear to impact prognosis. Despite the perception of BrS being an inherited arrhythmia syndrome, most cases are not associated with a single causative gene variant. Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings support variable extent of depolarization and repolarization changes, with coved ST-segment elevation ≥ 2 mm and a negative T-wave in the right precordial leads. These ECG changes are often intermittent, and may be provoked by fever or sodium channel blocker challenge. Growing evidence from cardiac imaging, epicardial ablation, and pathology studies suggests the presence of an epicardial arrhythmic substrate within the right ventricular outflow tract. Risk stratification aims to identify those who are at increased risk of sudden cardiac death, with well-established factors being the presence of spontaneous ECG changes and a history of cardiac arrest or cardiogenic syncope. Current management involves conservative measures in asymptomatic patients, including fever management and drug avoidance. Symptomatic patients typically undergo implantable cardioverter defibrillator insertion, with quinidine and epicardial ablation used for patients with recurrent arrhythmia. This review summarizes our current understanding of BrS and provides clinicians with a practical approach to diagnosis and management.

A major limitation of this study is the heterogeneity of the input data because of differences in methodology, population, and ethnicity. Variabilities in the ascertainment of ECG markers and adjudication of the outcomes may affect the quality of the overall data.

Our systematic review considered the overall data of the published series. We didn't go into detail about specific issues regarding subgroups such as women and children, who have a very challenging risk profile. 53, 54, 55 In addition, many of the pathophysiological mechanisms proposed in these studies are hypothetical, that is, not based on experimental data. Therefore, further rigorous studies are needed to confirm these hypotheses.

### Does the age of sudden cardiac death in family members matter in Brugada syndrome? [^e87f8540]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrated that a history of SCD among family members of age younger than 40 years was associated with a higher risk of MAE. A mere presence of a family history of SCD without a clear age definition is not a risk predictor in BrS. We propose that a family history of SCD in the young could be a prognostic factor to predict MAE in patients with BrS. Larger prospective cohort studies are needed to valid our observation.

### Comparative effectiveness of implantable defibrillators for asymptomatic Brugada syndrome: a decision-analytic model [^1de58eaa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our decision‐analytic model found that ICD‐based strategies are likely to be effective in subsets of average‐risk individuals with asymptomatic BrS and spontaneous type I Brugada pattern, particularly those diagnosed at younger ages. Nevertheless, observation appears appropriate in certain subgroups, such as individuals aged > 50 years, or those in whom the expected malignant arrhythmia rate is < 0.5%/year upon initial diagnosis. Therefore, ICD‐based management of asymptomatic BrS should be tailored based on patient characteristics. Future studies of the epidemiology of BrS would enable more precise clinical and cost‐effectiveness estimates and clarify the potential roles of emerging therapies (eg, quinidine, catheter ablation) and improved forms of risk stratification.

### Genetics can contribute to the prognosis of Brugada syndrome: a pilot model for risk stratification [^5ec6cca0]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Brugada syndrome is an inherited arrhythmogenic disorder leading to sudden death predominantly in the 3–4 decade. To date the only reliable treatment is the implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator; however, better criteria for risk stratification are needed, especially for asymptomatic subjects. Brugada syndrome genetic bases have been only partially understood, accounting for < 30% of patients, and have been poorly correlated with prognosis, preventing inclusion of genetic data in current guidelines. We designed an observational study to identify genetic markers for risk stratification of Brugada patients by exploratory statistical analysis. The presence of genetic variants, identified by SCN5A gene analysis and genotyping of 73 candidate polymorphisms, was correlated with the occurrence of major arrhythmic events in a cohort of 92 Brugada patients by allelic association and survival analysis. In all, 18 mutations were identified in the SCN5A gene, including 5 novel, and statistical analysis indicated that mutation carriers had a significantly increased risk of major arrhythmic events (P = 0.024). In addition, we established association of five polymorphisms with major arrhythmic events occurrence and consequently elaborated a pilot risk stratification algorithm by calculating a weighted genetic risk score, including the associated polymorphisms and the presence of SCN5A mutation as function of their odds ratio. This study correlates for the first time the presence of genetic variants with increased arrhythmic risk in Brugada patients, representing a first step towards the design of a new risk stratification model.

Brugada syndrome — genetic risk and testing considerations: Because only a single gene has been linked to the Brugada syndrome, there is still insufficient information about the contribution of genetic defects in predicting clinical outcome, and mutations in the SCN5A gene do not identify a subset of patients at higher risk of cardiac events. Genetic analysis may help identify silent carriers so that they can remain under clinical monitoring to detect early manifestations of the syndrome; furthermore, once identified, silent mutation carriers should receive genetic counseling and discussion of the risk of transmitting the disease.

### Standard ECG in Brugada syndrome as a marker of prognosis: from risk stratification to pathophysiological insights [^bc38976c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this systematic review of the literature on Brugada ECG pattern (BrS type 1 ECG), we quantitatively evaluated the incremental risk related to a spectrum of ECG features and provide some insights into the pathophysiology of BrS. Before discussing the different ECG signs and their relative prognostic implications, the following general points need to be considered:

Unlike other channelopathies in which the extent of the primary pathogenetic alteration is directly related to the prognosis (typically the length of QT in long QT syndromes), in the case of BrS, the severity of the ST‐T alterations of the type 1 pattern has not a defined role for the prognosis.
The diagnosis of BrS is based on a single element of standard ECG, the so‐called type 1 pattern. However, a very broad spectrum of ECG changes is present, with variable frequency and clinical significance. This makes the disease — which still lacks precise nosographic boundaries — even more challenging and intriguing.
To explain such a broad spectrum of ECG manifestations, it is necessary to hypothesize other mechanisms besides the main mechanism underlying the type 1 ECG Brugada pattern, such as the epi‐endocardial gradient in myocells of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) attributed to loss of function of the sodium current.

Clinical Perspective

Editorial, see p

Thirty years after the first description of the Brugada syndrome, the knowledge of the condition has increased. Currently, consensus exists regarding the treatment of symptomatic patients, including patients with previous history of aborted sudden death or arrhythmic syncope. For these patients, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is recommended, based on the consideration that the risk of sudden death outweighs the risk of ICD-related complications. However, symptomatic patients represent only a small percentage of the Brugada patient population. Risk stratification and treatment of the asymptomatic patients are the major challenges at the present time.

Although asymptomatic patients have a low risk of sudden death according to previous studies with relatively short follow-up, the total number of arrhythmic events cannot be overlooked. This is because the asymptomatic patient group comprises the majority of patients with Brugada ECG (BrECG) pattern; notably, 80% of patients with sudden death are asymptomatic until the occurrence of the event. The current guidelines, do not provide clear indications on how to manage these patients for whom the risk associated with ICD implantation can be equal to or even greater than the intrinsic risk of the disease. Because most patients with BrECG pattern are young, asymptomatic, and have a long life expectancy, it becomes very important to define the real incidence of arrhythmic events during long-term follow-up and to identify those patients at higher risk.

The study aimed to evaluate arrhythmic risk in a large population of asymptomatic patients with BrECG pattern, consecutively collected and assessed during long-term (range, 2–22 years) follow-up. The study focused on the event rate in asymptomatic patients with spontaneous type-1 BrECG pattern compared with the event rate of patients with drug-induced–only type-1 BrECG pattern. Moreover, the role of electrophysiologic study (EPS) in the risk stratification of asymptomatic patients with spontaneous type-1 BrECG pattern was investigated further.

### Illuminating the path from genetics to clinical outcome in Brugada syndrome [^91aaef79]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

This editorial refers to 'Brugada syndrome genetics is associated with phenotype severity' †, by G. Ciconte et al. on page.

Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a relatively rare arrhythmia disorder that can lead to sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF), predominantly in adults. Despite being considered an inherited disease, the genetic basis of BrS appears to be considerably more complex than other genetic cardiac conditions such as long QT syndrome (LQTS) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) that have a more prominent Mendelian-like inheritance. Although rare variants in numerous genes encoding ion channels and related proteins have been implicated in BrS, recent re-evaluation of the evidence for these associations has downgraded all but one gene, SCN5A, to disputed status. Rare pathogenic variants in SCN5A, which encodes for the Na V 1.5 sodium channel, are detected in only about 20% of BrS cases of European descent however (with diagnostic yields lower still in East Asian populations where BrS is much more prevalent). It is now believed that most BrS patients, particularly those without a rare SCN5A variant, are likely to have a complex aetiology comprising multiple genetic and non-genetic factors rather than as yet undiscovered Mendelian causes of disease. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified an unexpectedly strong contribution of common genetic variants to the BrS phenotype, with common non-coding variants at the SCN5A locus being particularly prominent.

Genetic testing to identify rare pathogenic variants in SCN5A can be pursued in patients with BrS with a Class IIa recommendation. While the identification of a causative rare variant may be used for identifying at risk family members through cascade genetic screening, knowledge of the genetic status plays little role in the clinical management or prognosis for BrS patients. This is despite the fact that the presence of a rare pathogenic SCN5A variant has been associated with a more severe phenotype in BrS patients, including a higher occurrence of major arrhythmic events. While it is not atypical in cardiac disease for worse outcomes to be associated with the presence of rare pathogenic variants (HCM patients with pathogenic variants in sarcomere genes also have a poorer prognosis than those without), the mechanism underlying this in BrS patients is not fully understood. Now, a new study by Ciconte and colleagues has investigated this issue through the analysis of a critical intermediate phenotype, the epicardial arrhythmogenic substrate area, in a cohort of BrS patients with and without SCN5A variants.

### The Brugada syndrome: clinical, genetic, cellular, and molecular abnormalities [^f16f5a46]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The Brugada syndrome is an arrhythmic syndrome characterized by a right bundle branch block pattern and ST segment elevation in the right precordial leads of the electrocardiogram in conjunction with a high incidence of sudden death secondary to ventricular tachyarrhythmias. No evidence of structural heart disease is noted during diagnostic evaluation of these patients. In 25% of families, there appears to be an autosomal dominant mode of transmission with variable expression of the abnormal gene. Mutations have been identified in the gene that encodes the alpha subunit of the sodium channel (SCN5A) on chromosome 3. This genetic defect causes a reduction in the density of the sodium current and explains the worsening of the above electrocardiographic abnormalities when patients are treated with sodium channel blocking antiarrhythmic agents, which further diminish the already reduced sodium current. The prognosis is poor with up to a 10% per year mortality. Antiarrhythmic drugs including beta-blockers and amiodarone have no benefit in prolonging survival. The treatment of choice is the insertion of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.

### Clinical characteristics and long-term prognosis of senior patients with Brugada Syndrome [^9c1dd101]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study investigated clinical characteristics and prognosis of Brugada syndrome (BrS) in patients older than 60 years of age during a long-term follow-up period.

Background

Clinical characteristics and prognosis of senior patients with BrS have not been clearly elucidated.

Methods

A total of 181 patients with BrS were divided into 2 groups by age at the time of diagnosis: the younger group was < 60 years of age (n = 123), and the senior group was ≥ 60 years of age (n = 58).

Results

Mean ages were 42.7 ± 11 years and 68.6 ± 7.1 years, respectively. Prevalence of spontaneous type 1 electrocardiogram (ECG) was lower in the senior group (22 of 58; 37.9%) than in the younger group (64 of 123; 51.9%) (p = 0.027). Among various ECG parameters, the senior group had a lower incidence of prolonged r-J intervals in V 2 ≥ 90 ms than the younger group (34 of 58; 58.6% vs. 90 of 123; 73.1%, p = 0.049) and day-to-day variation of Brugada ECG patterns (3 of 58; 5.2% vs. 23 of 123; 18.7%, p = 0.032). During a mean follow-up period of 7.6 ± 5.8 years, no senior patients experienced documented fatal ventricular arrhythmias, but 11 younger patients did. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a better prognosis in the senior group than in the younger group (log-rank, p = 0.011).

Conclusions

Senior BrS patients, ≥ 60 years of age, had a better prognosis than those < 60 years of age. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator insertion for senior patients with BrS needs careful consideration.

### Long-term prognosis of women with Brugada syndrome and electrophysiological study [^a4c608d0]. Heart Rhythm (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

A male predominance in Brugada syndrome (BrS) has been widely reported, but scarce information on female patients with BrS is available.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics and long-term prognosis of women with BrS.

Methods

A multicenter retrospective study of patients diagnosed with BrS and previous electrophysiological study (EPS) was performed.

Results

Among 770 patients, 177 (23%) were female. At presentation, 150 (84.7%) were asymptomatic. Females presented less frequently with a type 1 electrocardiographic pattern (30.5% vs 55.0%; P < .001), had a higher rate of family history of sudden cardiac death (49.7% vs 29.8%; P < .001), and had less sustained ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) on EPS (8.5% vs 15.1%; P = 0.009). Genetic testing was performed in 79 females (45% of the sample) and was positive in 34 (19%). An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was inserted in 48 females (27.1%). During mean (± SD) follow-up of 122.17 ± 57.28 months, 5 females (2.8%) experienced a cardiovascular event compared to 42 males (7.1%; P = 0.04). On multivariable analysis, a positive genetic test (18.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.82–192.53; P = 0.01) and atrial fibrillation (odds ratio 21.12; 95% CI 1.27–350.85; P = 0.03) were predictive of arrhythmic events, whereas VAs on EPS (neither with 1 or 2 extrastimuli nor 3 extrastimuli) were not.

Conclusion

Women with BrS represent a minor fraction among patients with BrS, and although their rate of events is low, they do not constitute a risk-free group. Neither clinical risk factors nor EPS predicts future arrhythmic events. Only atrial fibrillation and positive genetic test were identified as risk factors for future arrhythmic events.

### Standard ECG in Brugada syndrome as a marker of prognosis: from risk stratification to pathophysiological insights [^42b3d756]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background The 12-lead ECG plays a key role in the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome (BrS). Since the spontaneous type 1 ECG pattern was first described, several other ECG signs have been linked to arrhythmic risk, but results are conflicting. Methods and Results We performed a systematic review to clarify the associations of these specific ECG signs with the risk of syncope, sudden death, or equivalents in patients with BrS. The literature search identified 29 eligible articles comprising overall 5731 patients. The ECG findings associated with an incremental risk of syncope, sudden death, or equivalents (hazard ratio ranging from 1.1–39) were the following: localization of type 1 Brugada pattern (in V2 and peripheral leads), first-degree atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, fragmented QRS, QRS duration > 120 ms, R wave in lead aVR, S wave in L1 (≥ 40 ms, amplitude ≥ 0.1 mV, area ≥ 1 mm²), early repolarization pattern in inferolateral leads, ST-segment depression, T-wave alternans, dispersion of repolarization, and Tzou criteria. Conclusions At least 12 features of standard ECG are associated with a higher risk of sudden death in BrS. A multiparametric risk assessment approach based on ECG parameters associated with clinical and genetic findings could help improve current risk stratification scores of patients with BrS and warrants further investigation.

ACC/AHA/HRS 2008 — Brugada syndrome: Brugada syndrome is defined by "ST-segment elevation across the right precordial leads in association with a high risk of SCD", shows autosomal dominant inheritance with "more than 90% of those affected" being male, and cardiac events "occur predominantly in the third and fourth decades of life". For prevention, "implantation of an ICD is the only therapeutic measure to prevent SCD". Syncope with spontaneous ECG changes signals higher risk: "Patients with syncope and the ECG pattern of spontaneous ST-segment elevation have a 6-fold higher risk of cardiac arrest than patients without syncope and the spontaneous ECG pattern". Electrophysiological testing "had a low positive predictive value (23%), but over a 3-year follow-up, it had a very high negative predictive value (93%)", while genetics currently has limited prognostic utility: "Specific mutations in the SCN5A gene do not identify a subset of patients at higher risk of cardiac events". Holter ectopy is typically absent: "Patients with Brugada syndrome usually do not have ventricular extrasystoles or nonsustained runs of VT at Holter recording". SCD denotes sudden cardiac death; ICD denotes implantable cardioverter-defibrillator; ECG denotes electrocardiogram; VT denotes ventricular tachycardia.

### Brugada syndrome [^d180973f]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2025). High credibility.

Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a cardiac channelopathy associated with an elevated risk of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death compared with the general population. Since its initial description in 1992 by Pedro and Josep Brugada, there has been tremendous progress in our understanding and management of BrS. The condition is characterized by 'coved' ST segment elevations in the anterior precordial electrocardiogram leads, which occasionally requires additional pharmacological provocation for diagnosis. Substantial geographical variation in the prevalence, genetic characteristics and clinical behaviour of BrS exists. Improvements in the understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms of the condition have been made over the past 30years, opening avenues for the discovery of diagnostic and management opportunities. In this Primer, we discuss the evolving epidemiology of BrS, the emerging genetic understanding of the condition, as well as its diagnosis and management. We summarize the major societal guideline recommendations pertaining to BrS and highlight the potential for technological advancements, such as digital health and machine learning, to improve patient care.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Genetic considerations in arrhythmia syndromes — Class I, Level C-EO: In patients and family members in whom genetic testing for risk stratification for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or sudden cardiac death (SCD) is recommended, genetic counseling is beneficial. The diagnosis of most inherited arrhythmia syndromes is based on clinical features and family history, and genetic testing can provide opportunity to confirm a suspected clinical diagnosis and sometimes provide prognostic information for the proband and offer cascade screening of potentially affected family members when a disease-causing mutation is identified. The yield of genetic testing varies by disease, verification of pathogenicity is evolving with more variants of uncertain significance identified by exome sequencing, and genotyping can have therapeutic implications for some arrhythmogenic phenotypes such as long QT syndrome and Fabry's disease; in contrast, in Brugada syndrome the genotype does not provide therapeutic or prognostic information for the proband.

Brugada syndrome — prognosis and risk stratification: Since the first reporting, the reported annual rate of events has decreased. Among survivors of a first ventricular fibrillation, there is general agreement that these patients should be protected with an ICD (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator), irrespective of the presence of other risk factors. Most studies agree that syncope episodes in patients with a spontaneous type I ECG at baseline have high risk of cardiac arrhythmic events at follow-up. Additional indicators recently proposed include fragmented QRS and an effective refractory period below < 200 ms, and male gender has consistently been shown to be associated with more arrhythmic events.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Brugada syndrome — genetic testing and interpretation: The yield of genetic testing in phenotype positive patients is approximately 20% to 30% in Brugada syndrome, with SCN5A variants accounting for most of this subset; however, 2% to 10% of otherwise healthy individuals host a rare variant of SCN5A. A negative genetic test does not exclude the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome, which is usually based on electrocardiographic and clinical characteristics. Risk stratification is based on symptoms and clinical findings; the risk of adverse events is not correlated with the genotype status, and identification of a pathogenic mutation may help facilitate recognition of carrier status in family members, allowing for lifestyle modification and potential treatment.

### A clinical score model to predict lethal events in young patients (≤ 19 years) with the Brugada syndrome [^5b1456a5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Risk stratification in Brugada syndrome in young patients remains challenging. We investigated the clinical characteristics, prognosis, and risk in young patients with the Brugada syndrome. We studied 95 patients with the Brugada syndrome aged ≤ 19 years. The median age at diagnosis was 12.9 years. The clinical presentation was sudden cardiac death in 7% and syncope in 21%. The remaining 72% were asymptomatic at diagnosis. Electrical abnormalities were present in 36%, including spontaneous type I electrocardiogram (12%), sinus node dysfunction (9%), atrioventricular block (17%), intraventricular conduction delay (16%), and atrial arrhythmias (8%). An electrophysiologic study was performed in 75%; ventricular arrhythmias were induced in 3%. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was placed in 25%. During a mean follow-up of 59 months, 9 patients presented with arrhythmic events (event rate: 1.9% per year). Variables significantly associated with events were: presentation with sudden cardiac death or syncope, spontaneous type I electrocardiogram, sinus node dysfunction and/or atrial tachycardia, conduction abnormality, and induction of ventricular arrhythmias during programmed ventricular stimulation. A model including the previous 4 main clinical variables (1, sudden cardiac death or syncope; 2, spontaneous type I electrocardiogram; 3, sinus node dysfunction and/or atrial tachycardia; and 4, conduction abnormality) had a high predictive power (C: 0.93) for the risk of lethal events. A score of ≥ 4 conferred a 5-year event probability of 30% that increased to 53% if the score was ≥ 6. In conclusion, our study validated a model to predict risk in young patients with the Brugada syndrome, which takes into account 4 clinical measures.

### Standard ECG in Brugada syndrome as a marker of prognosis: from risk stratification to pathophysiological insights [^3c472313]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The 12‐lead ECG plays a key role in the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome (BrS). Since the spontaneous type 1 ECG pattern was first described, several other ECG signs have been linked to arrhythmic risk, but results are conflicting.

Methods and Results

We performed a systematic review to clarify the associations of these specific ECG signs with the risk of syncope, sudden death, or equivalents in patients with BrS. The literature search identified 29 eligible articles comprising overall 5731 patients. The ECG findings associated with an incremental risk of syncope, sudden death, or equivalents (hazard ratio ranging from 1.1–39) were the following: localization of type 1 Brugada pattern (in V2 and peripheral leads), first‐degree atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, fragmented QRS, QRS duration > 120 ms, R wave in lead aVR, S wave in L1 (≥ 40 ms, amplitude ≥ 0.1 mV, area ≥ 1 mm²), early repolarization pattern in inferolateral leads, ST‐segment depression, T‐wave alternans, dispersion of repolarization, and Tzou criteria.

Conclusions

At least 12 features of standard ECG are associated with a higher risk of sudden death in BrS. A multiparametric risk assessment approach based on ECG parameters associated with clinical and genetic findings could help improve current risk stratification scores of patients with BrS and warrants further investigation.

### Asymptomatic patients with Brugada ECG pattern: long-term prognosis from a large prospective study [^82cb6c3b]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

Brugada syndrome poses significant challenges in terms of risk stratification and management, particularly for asymptomatic patients who comprise the majority of individuals exhibiting Brugada ECG pattern (BrECG). The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term prognosis of a large cohort of asymptomatic patients with BrECG.

METHODS:

Asymptomatic patients with BrECG (1149) were consecutively collected from 2 Italian centers and followed-up at least annually for 2 to 22 years. For the 539 asymptomatic patients (men, 433 [80%]; mean age, 46 ± 13 years) with spontaneous type 1 documented on baseline ECG (87%) or 12-lead 24-hour Holter monitoring (13%), an electrophysiologic study (EPS) was proposed; for the 610 patients with drug-induced–only type 1 (men, 420 [69%]; mean age, 44 ± 14 years), multiple ECGs and 12-lead Holter were advised in order to detect the occurrence of a spontaneous type-1 BrECG. Arrhythmic events were defined as sudden death or documented ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia.

RESULTS:

Median follow-up was 6 (4–9) years. Seventeen (1.5%) arrhythmic events occurred in the overall asymptomatic population (corresponding to an event-rate of 0.2% per year), including 16 of 539 (0.4% per year) in patients with spontaneous type-1 BrECG and 1 of 610 in those with drug-induced type-1 BrECG (0.03% per year; P < 0.001). EPS was performed in 339 (63%) patients with spontaneous type-1 BrECG. Patients with spontaneous type-1 BrECG and positive EPS had significantly higher event rates than patients with negative EPS (7 of 103 [0.7% per year] versus 4 of 236 [0.2% per year]; P = 0.025). Among 200 patients who declined EPS, 5 events (0.4% per year) occurred. There was 1 device-related death.

CONCLUSIONS:

The entire population of asymptomatic patients with BrECG exhibits a relatively low event rate per year, which is important in view of the long life expectancy of these young patients. The presence of spontaneous type-1 BrECG associated with positive EPS identifies a subgroup at higher risk. Asymptomatic patients with drug-induced–only BrECG have a minimal arrhythmic risk, but ongoing follow-up with 12-lead Holter monitoring is recommended to detect the appearance of spontaneous type-1 BrECG pattern.

### Long-term trends in newly diagnosed Brugada syndrome: implications for risk stratification [^be58ace7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

A proband of Brugada syndrome (BrS) is the first patient diagnosed in a family. There are no data regarding this specific, high-risk population.

Objectives

This study sought to investigate the Brugada probands diagnosed from 1986 through the next 28 years.

Methods

We included 447 probands belonging to families with a diagnostic type 1 electrocardiogram Brugada pattern. The database was divided into 2 periods: the first period identified patients who were part of the initial cohort that became the consensus document on BrS in 2002 (early group); the second period reflected patients first diagnosed from 2003 to January 2014 (latter group).

Results

There were 165 probands in the early group and 282 in the latter group. Aborted sudden death as the first manifestation of the disease occurred in 12.1% of the early group versus 4.6% of the latter group (p = 0.005). Inducibility during programmed electrical stimulation was achieved in 34.4% and 19.2% of patients, respectively (p < 0.001). A spontaneous type 1 electrocardiogram pattern at diagnosis was present in 50.3% early versus 26.2% latter patients (p = 0.0002). Early group patients had a higher probability of a recurrent arrhythmia during follow-up (19%) than those of the latter group (5%) (p = 0.007). The clinical suspicion and use of a sodium-channel blocker to unmask BrS has allowed earlier diagnoses in many patients.

Conclusions

Since being first described, the presentation of BrS has changed. There has been a decrease in aborted sudden cardiac death as the first manifestation of the disease among patients who were more recently diagnosed. These variations in initial presentation have important clinical consequences. In this setting, the value of inducibility to stratify individuals with BrS has changed.

### Asymptomatic Brugada syndrome: clinical characterization and long-term prognosis [^444f845c]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Among Brugada syndrome patients, asymptomatic individuals are considered to be at the lowest risk. Nevertheless, arrhythmic events and sudden cardiac death are not negligible. Literature focused on this specific group of patients is sparse. The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical characteristics, management, and long-term prognosis of asymptomatic Brugada syndrome patients.

Methods and Results

Patients presenting with spontaneous or drug-induced Brugada type I ECG and no symptoms at our institution were considered eligible. A total of 363 consecutive patients (200 men, 55.1%; mean age, 40.9 ± 17.2 years; 41 [11.3%] with spontaneous type I ECG) were included. Electrophysiological study was performed in 321 (88.4%) patients, and ventricular arrhythmias were induced in 32 (10%) patients. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator was implanted in 61 (16.8%) patients. After a mean follow-up time of 73.2 ± 58.9 months, 9 arrhythmic events occurred, accounting for an annual incidence rate of 0.5%. Event-free survival was 99.0% at 1 year, 96.2% at 5 years, and 95.4% at 10 and 15 years. Univariate analysis identified as risk factors: electrophysiological study inducibility (hazard ratio, 11.4; P < 0.01), spontaneous type I (hazard ratio, 4.0; P = 0.04), and previous sinus node dysfunction (hazard ratio, 8.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.0–63.9; P = 0.05). At the multivariate analysis, only inducibility remained significant (hazard ratio, 9.1; P < 0.01).

Conclusions

Arrhythmic events in asymptomatic Brugada syndrome patients are not insignificant. Ventricular arrhythmia inducibility, spontaneous type I ECG, and presence of sinus node dysfunction might be considered as risk factors and used to drive long-term management.

### Standard ECG in Brugada syndrome as a marker of prognosis: from risk stratification to pathophysiological insights [^95956918]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

Controversies still exist about the risk stratification of BrS and BrS type 1 ECG. Clinical findings, such as a history of syncope, aborted cardiac death, or sustained VT, remain the only clear means to identify patients with high arrhythmic risk. The predictive role of electrophysiological study with programmed ventricular stimulation in patients with BrS is still debated. 56 Family history of SCD is of uncertain value and the results of genetic analysis are often confounding. Given that 12‐lead ECG analysis is 1 of the major diagnostic tools in this syndrome, several different ECG markers of ventricular depolarization and repolarization have emerged over time but with variable and conflicting results.

In this review, we discussed 12 different ECG signs identified as high‐risk markers in patients with BrS: localization of type 1 Brugada pattern (in V2 and peripheral leads), first‐degree AVB, AF, fragmented QRS, QRS duration > 120 ms, R wave > 0.3 mV in lead aVR, S wave in L1 (≥ 40 ms, amplitude ≥ 0.1 mV, area ≥ 1 mm²), ER pattern in inferolateral leads, ST‐segment depression, TWA, dispersion of repolarization, and Tzou criteria. A multiparametric risk assessment approach based on ECG parameters associated with clinical and genetic findings could help improve current risk stratification scores of patients with BrS 57, 58, 59 and warrants further investigation.

In addition to prognostic hints, ECG signs within the Brugada pattern can provide useful insights into the complex pathophysiology of this entity.

### Clinical presentation and outcome of Brugada syndrome diagnosed with the new 2013 criteria [^4aa3da52]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The 2013 HRS/EHRA/APHRS consensus statement recommends the use of V1 and V2 leads recorded in the second and third intercostal spaces (High-ICS) for diagnosis of Brugada syndrome (BrS) creating a new category of patients discovered only with modified leads. The clinical presentation and the arrhythmic risk in these patients are ill defined. This study was aimed at assessing the role of High-ICS in the analysis of BrS and the clinical profile of the patients diagnosed only when ECG leads are moved to upper intercostal spaces.

Methods and Results

We searched our Brugada syndrome registry and identified 300 subjects (age 36 ± 13 years), without a diagnostic coved ST-segment elevation in conventional V1 -V3 leads, both at baseline and after provocative drug challenge. Sixty-four subjects (21.3%, mean age at last follow-up 42 ± 11 years) were diagnosed with High-ICS. Diagnosis was possible at baseline only in 4 subjects while in 60 it was made after drug challenge with sodium channel blockers. Three subjects (4.7%) with spontaneous abnormal ECG experienced cardiac events with an annual event rate (0.11%) superimposable to that of the low risk category of BrS diagnosed in standard leads.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that the use of new diagnostic criteria for BrS allows increasing the diagnostic yield by 20% and that the arrhythmic risk is low when BrS can be established only in High-ICS. We also show that the prognostic value of spontaneous ECG pattern is confirmed in this subgroup.

### Standard ECG in Brugada syndrome as a marker of prognosis: from risk stratification to pathophysiological insights [^c2d968be]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The 12‐lead ECG plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome (BrS). ECG signs of right bundle branch block with persistent elevation of the ST‐segment and T‐wave inversion in the right precordial leads were first identified in 1953 by Osher and Wolff as a normal variant ECG pattern. 1 A few decades later, an association between this ECG pattern and sudden cardiac death (SCD) was described in young adults without cardiac disease, and in 1992 Pedro and Josep Brugada outlined a new "distinct clinical and electrocardiographic syndrome". 2, 3 Despite increasing knowledge of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of BrS, the risk stratification remains challenging. Clinical signs such as a previous unexplained syncope and spontaneous type 1 ECG pattern in patients with a history of aborted cardiac death or sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) are to date the only objective data to identify patients at high arrhythmic risk. 3 Presence of a family history of SCD is of uncertain value. 4 The predictive role of electrophysiological examination to evaluate the arrhythmic risk in these patients remain uncertain, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and it should be used with caution. 10 Unfortunately, even genetic analysis of BrS has not yet made a significant contribution to risk stratification. Currently the single most frequent gene involved in the pathogenesis of the syndrome is SCN5A (sodium voltage‐gated channel alpha subunit 5), but it is found in only 25% of patients with BrS. 11, 12 Mutations in the SCN5A gene causing truncation or inactivation of the Nav1.5 protein combined with a history of SCD in young relatives are so far the only clinical‐genetic data with prognostic significance. 11

Several studies have investigated the prognostic value of qualitative and quantitative ECG features in the presence of the Brugada pattern, but with conflicting results. A possible explanation relates to the dynamic nature of the ECG pattern in BrS, which limits the prognostic value of ECG in these patients. We performed a systematic review of the literature on the spectrum of ECG signs associated with negative prognosis in BrS to quantify the incremental risk of each sign and to unravel the electrogenetic and pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the different ECG features.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Systematic review questions on sudden cardiac death (SCD) prevention identify two topics: for asymptomatic patients with Brugada syndrome, "what is the association between an abnormal programmed ventricular stimulation study and SCD and other arrhythmia endpoints?" and "What is the impact of ICD implantation for primary prevention in older patients and patients with significant comorbidities?", where ICD indicates implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.

### A score model to predict risk of events in patients with Brugada syndrome [^e42ea518]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

Risk stratification in Brugada Syndrome (BS) remains challenging. Arrhythmic events can occur life-long and studies with long follow-ups are sparse. The aim of our study was to investigate long-term prognosis and risk stratification of BS patients.

Methods and Results

A single centre consecutive cohort of 400 BS patients was included and analysed. Mean age was 41.1 years, 78 patients (19.5%) had a spontaneous type I electrocardiogram (ECG). Clinical presentation was aborted sudden cardiac death (SCD) in 20 patients (5.0%), syncope in 111 (27.8%) and asymptomatic in 269 (67.3%). Familial antecedents of SCD were found in 184 individuals (46.0%), in 31 (7.8%) occurred in first-degree relatives younger than 35 years. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was placed in 176 (44.0%). During a mean follow-up of 80.7 months, 34 arrhythmic events occurred (event rate: 1.4% year). Variables significantly associated to events were: presentation as aborted SCD (Hazard risk [HR] 20.0), syncope (HR 3.7), spontaneous type I (HR 2.7), male gender (HR 2.7), early SCD in first-degree relatives (HR 2.9), SND (HR 5.0), inducible VA (HR 4.7) and proband status (HR 2.1). A score including ECG pattern, early familial SCD antecedents, inducible electrophysiological study, presentation as syncope or as aborted SCD and SND had a predictive performance of 0.82. A score greater than 2 conferred a 5-year event probability of 9.2%.

Conclusions

BS patients remain at risk many years after diagnosis. Early SCD in first-degree relatives and SND are risk factors for arrhythmic events. A simple risk score might help in the stratification and management of BS patients.

### Comparative effectiveness of implantable defibrillators for asymptomatic Brugada syndrome: a decision-analytic model [^cc28f9be]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited disorder associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) attributable to ventricular arrhythmias. Yet SCD risk is variable and most patients will not have an event. Implantable cardioverter‐defibrillators (ICDs) can avert SCD, but are associated with immediate and long‐term risks, require repeated interventions to maintain, are expensive, and may reduce quality‐of‐life. Therefore, proper risk stratification and recommendations for ICD implantation are of critical importance in BrS management.

Some individuals are at sufficiently high SCD risk that ICDs are clearly indicated, such as those with a history of malignant arrhythmias. Conversely, some are at recognizably low risk such that ICDs are not recommended, such as asymptomatic individuals with normal resting ECGs. In contrast, the optimal management of asymptomatic individuals with spontaneous ST‐segment elevation in the right precordial leads (ie, type I Brugada pattern), who have an ≈3‐fold SCD risk, is unclear and current guidelines do not provide explicit recommendations for or against ICD. Management typically includes observation, though risk stratification with electrophysiologic study (EPS) and ICD implant for high risk findings may be reasonable. At the same time, recent innovations such as the subcutaneous ICD may offer a favorable adverse event profile, thereby potentially altering the risk‐benefit equation in favor of ICD‐based strategies.

Although uncertainty in the optimal management of BrS remains a challenge, the rarity of the condition renders a definitive clinical trial impractical. We therefore developed a decision‐analytic model to estimate the comparative effectiveness of contemporary management strategies for individuals with asymptomatic BrS and spontaneous type I electrographic pattern, across a range of plausible clinical scenarios.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Brugada syndrome — programmed ventricular stimulation for risk stratification: Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) induced by programmed stimulation has been associated with an increased risk of VA in some patients with spontaneous type 1 Brugada ECG, but the specificity of programmed stimulation for assessing risk decreases with the inclusion of triple extrastimuli. Some experts use the results of programmed ventricular stimulation for informing shared decision-making in consideration of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). In symptomatic patients with Brugada syndrome, programmed ventricular stimulation for risk stratification does not add anything to the evaluation of the patients as an ICD is warranted, and a report found that the prognostic value has decreased over time, possibly as patients with less severe phenotypes have been recognized and studied.

### Risk stratification in Brugada syndrome: clinical characteristics, electrocardiographic parameters, and auxiliary testing [^5badab10]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Low credibility.

Risk stratification in Brugada syndrome remains a clinical challenge because the event rate is low but the presenting symptom is often cardiac arrest (CA). We review the data on risk stratification. A history of CA or malignant syncope is a strong predictor of spontaneous ventricular fibrillation (VF), whereas the prognostic value of a history of familial sudden death and the presence of a SCN5A mutation are less well defined. On the electrocardiogram, the presence of spontaneous type I electrocardiogram increases the risk for VF in all studies, whereas the presence of fragmented QRS complexes and early repolarization correlates with increased risk in several studies. Signal-averaged techniques using late potentials and microscopic T-wave alternans show some promising results in small studies that need to be confirmed. The value of electrophysiologic studies for predicting spontaneous VF remains controversial, and this includes programmed stimulation protocols that avoid a third extrastimuli or stimulation from the right ventricular outflow. Risk prediction is particularly challenging in children and women.

### Gender differences in clinical manifestations of Brugada syndrome [^78662426]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to assess differences in phenotype and prognosis between men and women in a large population of patients with Brugada syndrome.

Background

A male predominance has been reported in the Brugada syndrome. No specific data are available, however, concerning gender differences in the clinical manifestations and their role in prognosis.

Methods

Patients with Brugada syndrome were prospectively included in the study. Data on baseline characteristics, electrocardiogram parameters before and after pharmacological test, and events in follow-up were recorded for all patients.

Results

Among 384 patients, 272 (70.8%) were men and 112 (29.2%) women. At inclusion, men had experienced syncope more frequently (18%) or aborted sudden cardiac death (6%) than women (14% and 1%, respectively, p = 0.04). Men also had greater rates of spontaneous type-1 electrocardiogram, greater ST-segment elevation, and greater inducibility of ventricular fibrillation (p < 0.001 for all). Conversely, conduction parameters and corrected QT intervals significantly increased more in women in response to sodium blockers (p = 0.03 and p = 0.001, respectively). During a mean follow-up of 58 ± 48 months, sudden cardiac death or documented ventricular fibrillation occurred in 31 men (11.6%) and 3 women (2.8%; p = 0.003). The presence of previous symptoms was the most important predictor for cardiac events in men, whereas a longer PR interval was identified among those women with a greater risk in this series.

Conclusions

Men with Brugada syndrome present with a greater risk clinical profile than women and have a worse prognosis. Although classical risk factors identify male patients with worse outcome, conduction disturbances could be a marker of risk in the female population.

### Clinical characterisation and long-term prognosis of women with Brugada syndrome [^ddcd83d0]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Brugada syndrome (BS) in women is considered an infrequent condition with a more favourable prognosis than in men. Nevertheless, arrhythmic events and sudden cardiac death (SCD) also occur in this population. Long-term follow-up data of this group are sparse. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the clinical characteristics and long-term prognosis of women with BS.

Methods

A consecutive cohort of 228 women presenting with spontaneous or drug-induced Brugada type I ECG at our institution were included and compared with 314 men with the same diagnosis.

Results

Mean age was 41.5 ± 17.3 years. Clinical presentation was SCD in 6 (2.6%), syncope in 51 (22.4%) and the remaining 171 (75.0%) were asymptomatic. As compared with men, spontaneous type I ECG was less common (7.9% vs 23.2%, p < 0.01) and less ventricular arrhythmias were induced during programmed electrical stimulation (5.5% vs 22.3%, p < 0.01). An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was implanted in 64 women (28.1%). During a mean follow-up of 73.2 ± 56.2 months, seven patients developed arrhythmic events, constituting an event rate of 0.7% per year (as compared with 1.9% per year in men, p = 0.02). Presentation as SCD or sinus node dysfunction (SND) was risk factor significantly associated with arrhythmic events (hazard risk (HR) 25.4 and 9.1).

Conclusion

BS is common in women, representing 42% of patients in our database. Clinical presentation is less severe than men, with more asymptomatic status and less spontaneous type I ECG and prognosis is more favourable, with an event rate of 0.7% year. However, women with SCD or previous SND are at higher risk of arrhythmic events.

### Prognostic value of programmed electrical stimulation in Brugada syndrome: 20 years experience [^ac54073d]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The prognostic value of electrophysiological investigations in individuals with Brugada syndrome remains controversial. Different groups have published contradictory data. Long-term follow-up is needed to clarify this issue.

Methods and Results

Patients presenting with spontaneous or drug-induced Brugada type I ECG and in whom programmed electric stimulation was performed at our institution were considered eligible for this study. A total of 403 consecutive patients (235 males, 58.2%; mean age, 43.2 ± 16.2 years) were included. Ventricular arrhythmias during programmed electric stimulation were induced in 73 (18.1%) patients. After a mean follow-up time of 74.3 ± 57.3 months (median 57.3), 25 arrhythmic events occurred (16 in the inducible group and 9 in the noninducible). Ventricular arrhythmias inducibility presented a hazard ratio for events of 8.3 (95% confidence interval, 3.6–19.4), P < 0.01.

Conclusions

Programmed ventricular stimulation of the heart is a good predictor of outcome in individuals with Brugada syndrome. It might be of special value to guide further management when performed in asymptomatic individuals. The overall accuracy of the test makes it a suitable screening tool to reassure noninducible asymptomatic individuals.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Brugada syndrome — electrocardiographic features, inheritance, risk modifiers, and prevention are detailed. The syndrome is characterized by ST-segment elevation across the right precordial leads with a high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD), and the Brugada pattern most commonly shows J-point segment elevation in leads V1 to V3 with right bundle-branch block; the ECG pattern can be intermittent and less commonly occurs in the inferior leads. Patients have a structurally normal heart with a primary channelopathy transmitted with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, and more than 90% of those affected are male; the genetic basis involves the cardiac sodium channel gene (SCN5A). Cardiac events such as syncope or cardiac arrest occur predominantly in the third and fourth decades of life, and fever can acutely predispose to cardiac arrest. For risk reduction, implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is the only prophylactic measure able to prevent SCD. Family history does not predict cardiac events among family members, asymptomatic individuals with the characteristic ECG but no family history are not necessarily at low risk, and family members of an individual with SCD due to Brugada syndrome should not be assumed to be at increased risk of SCD. Prognosis is worse for patients with a spontaneous Brugada pattern than when the typical ECG is observed only after pharmacological drug challenge, and among patients with syncope and the ECG pattern of spontaneous ST-segment elevation there is a 6-fold higher risk of cardiac arrest than in patients without syncope and the spontaneous ECG pattern.

### Meta-analysis on risk stratification of asymptomatic individuals with the Brugada phenotype [^e4fecc41]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

The prognosis of asymptomatic subjects remains the most controversial issue in Brugada syndrome (BS). A meta-analysis on the prognostic role of spontaneous type 1 electrocardiographic (ECG) pattern and programmed ventricular stimulation (PVS) in asymptomatic subjects with Brugada electrocardiogram was performed. Current databases were searched until March 2014. Fourteen prospective observational studies were included in the present meta-analysis, accumulating data on 3,536 asymptomatic subjects (2,820 men) with BS phenotype. The mean follow-up period varied from 20 and 77 months. Data regarding 1,398 asymptomatic subjects with spontaneous type 1 ECG pattern of BS were retrieved from 6 studies. During follow-up, arrhythmic events (sustained ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, appropriate device therapies, or arrhythmic death) occurred in 42 patients (3%). The meta-analysis of these studies demonstrated that asymptomatic subjects with spontaneous type 1 ECG pattern of BS exhibit an increased risk of future arrhythmic events (odds ratio = 3.56, 95% confidence interval 1.70 to 7.47, Z = 3.37, p = 0.0008); 1,104 asymptomatic subjects with BS ECG pattern from 12 studies underwent PVS and were available for analysis. During follow-up, arrhythmic events occurred in 36 subjects (3.3%). Inducible ventricular arrhythmias at PVS were predictive of future arrhythmic events (odds ratio = 3.51, 95% confidence interval 1.60 to 7.67, Z = 3.14, p = 0.002). In conclusion, this meta-analysis showed that asymptomatic subjects with either spontaneous diagnostic ECG pattern or inducible ventricular arrhythmias at PVS are at increased risk.

Graphical Abstract

Graphical Abstract
Use, misuse, and pitfalls of the drug challenge test in the diagnosis of the Brugada syndrome. *Diagnosis of Brugada syndrome is based on the modified Shanghai criteria (see Table 2). Indications to perform SCBT depend on symptoms, family history, and baseline ECG. Before performing the test, patients should be informed about test specificity, risk of complications, and generally excellent prognosis if asymptomatic. All-comers: asymptomatic patients and patients with symptoms including ventricular fibrillation/aborted cardiac arrest. Lethal arrhythmic events: sudden cardiac death, ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia, and appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator interventions (i.e. shocks or antitachycardia pacing delivered for ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation). ECG, electrocardiogram; RVOT, right ventricular outflow tract; SCBT, sodium channel blocker test.

### Long-term prognosis of patients with an SCN5A loss-of-function variant and progressive cardiac conduction disorder or Brugada syndrome [^fa28f11c]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The long-term prognosis of patients with a loss-of-function variant in the cardiac sodium channel gene SCN5A is unknown.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the long-term arrhythmic risk in patients with an SCN5A loss-of-function variant to identify predictors of arrhythmic events.

Methods

Probands and family members with (likely) pathogenic SCN5A loss-of-function variants were retrospectively included. Clinical and electrocardiographic data at baseline and last follow-up were collected. Patients with a history of cardiac arrest, sustained ventricular tachycardia, symptomatic or documented atrial tachy- or bradyarrhythmia, or arrhythmogenic syncope were categorized as symptomatic. Arrhythmic events at follow-up were defined as sudden death, aborted cardiac arrest, documented ventricular fibrillation, and/or sustained ventricular tachycardia.

Results

We included 615 patients (349 men, 242 probands, 157 with a spontaneous type 1 Brugada electrocardiogram, and 111 symptomatic at baseline). During a median follow-up of 9.5 (Q1, Q3 5.0–14.3) years, arrhythmic events occurred in 41 patients (6.7%), equating an overall event rate of 0.7%/y: 2.0%/y in symptomatic and 0.3%/y in asymptomatic patients. In the overall study population, symptoms at baseline, male sex, and QRS prolongation were identified as independent predictors of arrhythmic events. In asymptomatic patients, male sex and QRS prolongation were also identified as predictors. Asymptomatic women with QRS interval < 100 ms did not experience arrhythmic events at follow-up.

Conclusion

Key predictors of arrhythmic risk in patients with an SCN5A loss-of-function variant, regardless of a Brugada syndrome diagnosis, are symptoms at baseline, male sex, and prolonged QRS interval. Our findings may enable more tailored management strategies in patients with an SCN5A loss-of-function variant based on their individual risk profiles.

### Determinants of sudden cardiac death in individuals with the electrocardiographic pattern of Brugada syndrome and no previous cardiac arrest [^0687730a]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with Brugada syndrome who were resuscitated from an episode of ventricular fibrillation are at high risk for recurrent sudden death. There is general agreement about the therapeutic strategy for these patients. Conversely, the prognosis and approach in patients with a diagnostic ECG but without a previous history of sudden cardiac death is controversial. We analyzed a large cohort of patients with Brugada syndrome without previous cardiac arrest to understand the determinants of prognosis.

Methods and Results

A total of 547 patients with an ECG diagnostic of Brugada syndrome and no previous cardiac arrest were studied. The mean age was 41 ± 15 years, and 408 were male. The diagnostic ECG was present spontaneously in 391 patients. In the remaining 156 individuals, the abnormal ECG was noted only after the administration of an antiarrhythmic drug. One hundred twenty-four patients had suffered from at least 1 episode of syncope. During programmed ventricular stimulation, a sustained ventricular arrhythmia was induced in 163 of 408 patients. During a mean follow-up of 24 ± 32 months, 45 patients (8%) suffered sudden death or documented ventricular fibrillation. Multivariate analysis identified the inducibility of a sustained ventricular arrhythmia (P < 0.0001) and a history of syncope (P < 0.01) as predictors of events. Logistic regression analysis showed that a patient with a spontaneously abnormal ECG, a previous history of syncope, and inducible sustained ventricular arrhythmias had a probability of 27.2% of suffering an event during follow-up.

Conclusions

Individuals with Brugada syndrome and no previous cardiac arrest have a high risk of sudden death. Inducibility of ventricular arrhythmias and a previous history of syncope are markers of a poor prognosis.

Brugada syndrome — systematic review methods of electrophysiological study in asymptomatic patients: The objective was to ascertain the prognostic value of electrophysiological study in asymptomatic patients with Brugada syndrome. Searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE limited to English human studies from 1966 to 2016 were performed, including asymptomatic Brugada syndrome patients who underwent electrophysiological study and excluding symptomatic patients, syncope, SCD, sustained VA, and hyperthyroid cardiomyopathy. Patients with inducible VA were compared with those without; the primary outcome was any major arrhythmic event (documented VA, SCD, and appropriate ICD therapy), and patients with < 3 months of follow-up were excluded. Meta-analysis used the DOC Data 2.0 platform, summarized raw event rates, applied a Random Effect model with 0.1 continuity correction, and also used the Mantel-Haenszel and PETO methods.

### Type-I paradox of Brugada syndrome [^71a680a9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The Present Study: A Shift From Diagnostic to Prognostic Test?

Ueoka et al described 245 patients with Brugada syndrome who underwent a SCB test with pilsicainide. The patients were typical of Brugada syndrome: their mean age was 46 years, all but 2% were male, and the majority (62%) were asymptomatic at presentation. 6 Importantly, 74% of patients had previous documentation of spontaneous type‐I, or had a spontaneous type‐I at the onset of the test but nevertheless underwent a SCB test to assess its prognostic (rather than diagnostic) value. This is remarkable because, in view of the risks involved (see below) and perceived lack of diagnostic added‐value, this test is generally considered contraindicated for patients who already have documentation of a type‐I Brugada pattern on a resting ECG. 7 That "orthodox" view of the test, however, is evolving: SCB tests have been performed in patients with documentation of a type‐I pattern during fever 8 or to better delineate the arrhythmogenic substrate during radiofrequency ablation. 9

Brugada syndrome — management recommendations and levels: Clinical monitoring for the development of a spontaneous ST-segment elevation pattern is reasonable for patients whose ST-segment elevation is induced only with provocative pharmacological challenge with or without symptoms (Level of Evidence: C). An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is reasonable for Brugada syndrome patients with documented ventricular tachycardia (VT) that has not resulted in cardiac arrest and who have reasonable expectation of survival with a good functional status for more than 1 y (Level of Evidence: C). Isoproterenol can be useful to treat an electrical storm in the Brugada syndrome (Level of Evidence: C). Under Class IIb, electrophysiology (EP) testing may be considered for risk stratification in asymptomatic Brugada syndrome patients with spontaneous ST elevation with or without a mutation in the SCN5A gene (Level of Evidence: C), and quinidine might be reasonable for the treatment of electrical storm in patients with Brugada syndrome (Level of Evidence: C).

Asymptomatic Brugada syndrome — risk and device therapy is summarized as follows: "The risk of major adverse cardiac events in asymptomatic patients without spontaneous type 1 electrocardiographic changes of Brugada syndrome (Figure 15), or with only medication-induced electrocardiographic changes, is low". Moreover, "A positive family history of Brugada syndrome or SCA is not a significant predictor of adverse events in Brugada syndrome". Finally, "Implantation of an ICD in an asymptomatic patient without a spontaneous type 1 Brugada electrocardiographic has not been shown to confer any benefit".

Brugada syndrome — genetic testing yield and interpretation: The yield of genetic testing in phenotype positive patients is approximately 20% to 30%, with SCN5A variants accounting for most of this subset; however, 2% to 10% of otherwise healthy individuals host a rare variant of SCN5A, a negative test does not exclude diagnosis, risk stratification is based on symptoms and clinical findings and the risk of adverse events is not correlated with genotype status, and identifying a pathogenic mutation may help recognize carrier status in family members allowing lifestyle modification and potential treatment.

Brugada syndrome — initial management and diagnostic evaluation are as follows: In asymptomatic patients with only inducible type 1 Brugada electrocardiographic pattern, observation without therapy is recommended. In patients with Brugada syndrome with spontaneous type 1 Brugada electrocardiographic pattern and cardiac arrest, sustained ventricular arrhythmia (VA) or a recent history of syncope presumed due to VA, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is recommended if meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected. In patients with Brugada syndrome experiencing recurrent ICD shocks for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), intensification of therapy with quinidine or catheter ablation is recommended. In patients with spontaneous type 1 Brugada electrocardiographic pattern and symptomatic VA who either are not candidates for or decline an ICD, quinidine or catheter ablation is recommended. In patients with suspected Brugada syndrome in the absence of a spontaneous type 1 Brugada electrocardiographic pattern, a pharmacological challenge using a sodium channel blocker can be useful for diagnosis.

Brugada syndrome — causes, inheritance, demographics, and triggers: The syndrome is associated with a characteristically abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) and a high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in individuals with a structurally normal heart; the disease is transmitted with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, and the clinical expression is modified by gender as 90% of the affected individuals with a diagnostic ECG are male. Only 1 Brugada syndrome disease gene has been identified so far, the cardiac sodium channel gene (SCN5A), although non-SCN5A loci have also been reported but the disease gene(s) at these loci remain to be identified. Cardiac events occur predominantly in males in the third and fourth decades of life, and fever is a predisposing factor for cardiac arrest in the Brugada syndrome.

### Brugada syndrome… [^948e180f]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

A patient who presented with a new apparent seizure was found to have abnormal electrocardiographic findings, with classic features of the Brugada syndrome. He had spontaneous episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, easily inducible ventricular fibrillation at electrophysiological study in the absence of structural heart disease, and a negative neurological evaluation. These findings suggested that sustained ventricular arrhythmias known to be associated with the Brugada syndrome and resultant cerebral hypoperfusion, rather than a primary seizure disorder, were responsible for the event. Patients with the Brugada syndrome often present with sudden death or with syncope resulting from ventricular arrhythmias. In consideration of its variability in presentation sometimes mimicking other disorders, primary care physicians and internists should be aware of its often transient electrocardiographic features.

Brugada syndrome — risk stratification principle and family history: Because implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is the only prophylactic measure able to prevent sudden cardiac death (SCD), risk stratification is of major importance in these patients. As with long QT syndrome (LQTS), there are no data showing that family history predicts cardiac events among family members; therefore, it should not be assumed that asymptomatic individuals with the characteristic electrocardiogram (ECG) but without family history are at low risk or that family members of an individual with SCD are at increased risk.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Brugada syndrome — This primary electrical disease is characterized by ST‑segment elevation across the right precordial leads with high sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk; the electrocardiogram (ECG) most commonly shows J‑point segment elevation in leads V1 to V3 with right bundle‑branch block, the pattern can be intermittent, and less commonly the J‑point elevation occurs in the inferior leads. Patients have a structurally normal heart with a primary channelopathy, inheritance is autosomal dominant, and more than 90% of those affected are male; the genetic basis involves the cardiac sodium channel gene SCN5A. Cardiac events such as syncope or cardiac arrest occur predominantly in the third and fourth decades of life, although presentation with cardiac arrest in neonates or children has been reported, and fever can acutely predispose to cardiac arrest. Risk stratification is important because implantation of an implantable cardioverter‑defibrillator (ICD) is the only prophylactic measure able to prevent SCD; family history does not predict events among family members with Brugada syndrome, asymptomatic individuals with the characteristic ECG but no family history are not necessarily at low risk, and family members of an individual with SCD due to Brugada syndrome should not be assumed to be at increased risk of SCD. Patients with a spontaneous Brugada pattern have a worse prognosis than those in whom the typical ECG is observed only after pharmacological drug challenge, and a patient with syncope and spontaneous ST‑segment elevation has a 6‑fold higher risk of cardiac arrest than patients without syncope and the spontaneous ECG pattern.

### Role of programmed ventricular stimulation in patients with Brugada syndrome: a meta-analysis of worldwide published data [^608d8770]. European Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

Brugada syndrome (BS) is an ion channelopathy with the risk of sudden cardiac death. The role of programmed ventricular stimulation (PVS) in risk stratification has been controversially discussed. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis on the prognostic role of PVS in BS.

Methods and Results

A Medline search until July 2006 documented 822 entries for BS. Only English publications with > 10 patients and a follow-up period were considered (n = 15). Patients [n = 1217; 974 males (80%)] were divided into three groups: survived sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) [n = 222 (18%)], syncope (Syncope) [n = 275 (23%)], and asymptomatic patients (Asympt) [n = 720 (59%)]. PVS was conducted in 1036 patients (85%). In 548 patients (53%), sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) was inducible. During follow-up (34 ± 40 months), VT/VF occurred in 141 patients. SCA bore the highest chance for a VT/VF occurrence during follow-up [odds ratio (OR) 14.4 compared with asymptomatic patients; P < 0.0005]. However, except for one study, the OR for VT/VF during follow-up in relation to VT/VF inducibility was non-significant (OR 1.5; P = ns).

Conclusion

The main finding is that we were unable to identify a significant role of PVS with regard to arrhythmic events during follow-up in BS, thus questioning the role of PVS for risk stratification in patients with BS. Patients with BS and survived SCA show the highest chance for VT/VF occurrence during follow-up.

### A tale of 2 diseases: the history of long-QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome [^2e72fa1b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The Brugada syndrome (BrS) and long-QT syndrome (LQTS) present as congenital or acquired disorders with diagnostic electrocardiograms (ST-segment elevation and prolonged QT interval, respectively) and increased risk for malignant arrhythmias. Our understanding of the 2 disease forms (congenital vs. acquired) differs. A female patient on quinidine for atrial fibrillation who develops ventricular fibrillation is diagnosed with "acquired LQTS" and is discharged with no therapy other than instructions to avoid QT-prolonging medications. In contrast, an asymptomatic male patient who develops a Brugada electrocardiogram on flecainide is diagnosed with "asymptomatic BrS" and could be referred for an electrophysiological evaluation that could result in defibrillator implantation. The typical patient undergoing defibrillator implantation for BrS is asymptomatic but has a Brugada electrocardiogram provoked by a drug. The authors describe how the histories of LQTS and BrS went through the same stages, but in different sequences, leading to different conclusions.

### Prevention of sudden cardiac death [^d6476eeb]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2005). Low credibility.

Although the annual incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) is dropping in the United States, therapies for the patient who has survived a SCD episode or is at high risk of developing SCD in the future are now well established. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) has emerged from a series of well done randomized clinical trials of the 1990s as providing a survival benefit in carefully defined patient groups with low ejection fraction of any cause. Patients with either an ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and an EF ≤ 35% show a significant survival benefit with the ICD and maximal medical therapy. Many challenging patients (e.g., those with long QT syndrome or Brugada syndrome) who have a reasonably high incidence of sudden death have not been the subject of clinical trials involving the ICD and therapy depends on risk stratification that is currently not completely agreed upon. An exciting research frontier of the future will be those that attempt to integrate the appropriate role of the ICD with the ability of chronic resynchronization therapy to enhance left ventricular function in the damaged ventricle.

### Brugada syndrome: clinical and genetic findings [^470be29a]. Genetics in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Brugada syndrome is a rare, inherited cardiac disease leading to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death in structurally normal hearts. Clinical diagnosis requires a Brugada type I electrocardiographic pattern in combination with other clinical features. The most effective approach to unmasking this diagnostic pattern is the use of ajmaline and flecainide tests, and the most effective intervention to reducing the risk of death is the implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator. To date, 18 genes have been associated with the disease, with the voltage-gated sodium channel α type V gene (SCN5A) being the most common one to date. However, only 30–35% of diagnosed cases are attributable to pathogenic variants in known genes, emphasizing the need for further genetic studies. Despite recent advances in clinical diagnoses and genetic testing, risk stratification and clinical management of patients with Brugada syndrome remain challenging. Genet Med 18 1, 3–12.

This study sought to summarize the clinical outcome of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy in patients with Brugada syndrome.

Background

Brugada syndrome is characterized by cardiac conduction abnormalities and a high risk of ventricular arrhythmias that may result in sudden cardiac death. A complete overview of clinical outcome, appropriate and inappropriate interventions, and complications after ICD therapy in patients with Brugada syndrome is lacking.

Methods

The online MEDLINE database was searched for published reports and yielded 828 studies on outcome and complications after ICD therapy in patients with Brugada syndrome. After careful evaluation, 22 studies including a total of 1,539 patients were included in the meta-analysis.

Results

In total, 1,539 patients (mean age 45 years, 18% women) underwent ICD implantation for primary (79%) or secondary (21%) prevention of sudden cardiac death. During a mean follow-up of 4.9 years, the appropriate and inappropriate ICD intervention rates were 3.1 and 3.3 per 100 person-years, respectively. The cardiac mortality rate was 0.03 per 100 person-years and noncardiac mortality rate was 0.3 per 100 person-years. ICD-related complications per 100 person-years consisted of lead malfunction (1.6), psychological complication (1.3), infection (0.6), lead dislocation (0.4), and any complication (0.6).

Conclusions

Patients with Brugada syndrome judged to be at high risk for ventricular arrhythmia may significantly benefit from ICD therapy, which is associated with an appropriate ICD intervention rate of 3.1 per 100 person-years and low cardiac and noncardiac mortality rates. Inappropriate ICD interventions and ICD-related complications may lead to considerable morbidity.

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope [^e613a008]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for Brugada syndrome, more specifically with respect to ICD, ESC 2018 guidelines recommend to do not perform ICD placement in patients with Brugada ECG pattern and reflex-mediated syncope in the absence of other risk factors.
