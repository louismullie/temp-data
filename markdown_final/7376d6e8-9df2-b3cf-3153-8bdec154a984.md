## Question

A practitioner is engaged to express an opinion on management's assertion that the square footage of a warehouse offered for sale is 150,000 square feet. The practitioner should refer to which of the following sources for professional guidance?

Answer Choices:
A. Statements on Auditing Standards
B. Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements
C. Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services
D. Statements on Standards for Consulting Services

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which professional standard applies when a practitioner is engaged to express an opinion on management's assertion about the square footage of a warehouse. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the nature of the engagement and whether it constitutes an attestation service. Then, I should verify which AICPA standard governs attestation engagements. Next, I will consider why the other options (audit, review, consulting) do not fit. Finally, I will confirm the correct answer and briefly justify it.

> Let me first confirm the engagement type. Expressing an opinion on a specific assertion made by management — in this case, the warehouse square footage — is a classic attestation engagement, where the practitioner evaluates management's claim and issues a conclusion, rather than performing a full audit or a compilation/review of financial statements [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the governing standard. The AICPA Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) specifically cover engagements in which a practitioner is engaged to issue or does issue an examination, review, or agreed-upon procedures report on subject matter or an assertion that is the responsibility of another party, which matches this scenario precisely [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review why the alternatives are incorrect. Statements on Auditing Standards (SAS) govern financial statement audits and would be overkill and misaligned for a single assertion like square footage, so A is not appropriate. Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARS) govern compilations and reviews of financial statements, not standalone assertions, so C is not applicable. Statements on Standards for Consulting Services (SSCS) govern consulting engagements that provide advice or recommendations, not expressions of opinion on assertions, so D is not the right fit either [^notfound].

> I should double-check the conclusion. Given that the task is to opine on management's assertion about square footage, the correct source of professional guidance is the Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements, which provide the framework for examination, review, or agreed-upon procedures on subject matter or assertions [^notfound].

> Final answer: B. Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements.

---

The correct answer is **B. Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE)**. This is because expressing an opinion on management's assertion about the warehouse's square footage is an attestation engagement, which is governed by SSAE. The other options are incorrect: SAS applies to audits, SSARS applies to compilations and reviews, and SSCS applies to consulting services, none of which fit this scenario [^notfound].

---

## Analysis of the engagement

The practitioner is engaged to **express an opinion on management's assertion** regarding the square footage of a warehouse. This type of engagement involves evaluating a specific claim made by management and providing a conclusion based on evidence and professional judgment. The key characteristics of this engagement include:

- **Subject matter**: The square footage of the warehouse.
- **Management's assertion**: The warehouse is 150,000 square feet.
- **Practitioner's role**: Express an opinion on the accuracy of management's assertion.
- **Nature of engagement**: Attestation, as the practitioner is providing assurance on a specific assertion.

---

## Relevant professional standards

In the accounting and auditing profession, **different standards apply to different types of engagements**. The main categories include:

| **Standard** | **Full name** | **Scope and applicability** |
|-|-|-|
| A. SAS | Statements on Auditing Standards | Governs audits of financial statements and related audit engagements. |
| B. SSAE | Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements | Governs attestation engagements, including examinations, reviews, and agreed-upon procedures on subject matter or assertions. |
| C. SSARS | Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services | Governs compilations and reviews of financial statements. |
| D. SSCS | Statements on Standards for Consulting Services | Governs consulting engagements, providing advisory and consultative services. |

---

## Applicability of SSAE to the engagement

SSAE is the **most appropriate standard** for this engagement because it specifically addresses attestation engagements, where a practitioner is engaged to issue an examination, review, or agreed-upon procedures report on subject matter or an assertion that is the responsibility of another party. The engagement described fits this definition, as the practitioner is expressing an opinion on management's assertion about the warehouse's square footage.

---

## Why other standards are not applicable

- **SAS (Option A)**: SAS applies to audits of financial statements and related audit engagements. This engagement is not an audit of financial statements, so SAS is not applicable.
- **SSARS (Option C)**: SSARS applies to compilations and reviews of financial statements. This engagement does not involve compiling or reviewing financial statements, so SSARS is not applicable.
- **SSCS (Option D)**: SSCS applies to consulting engagements, which involve providing advisory and consultative services. This engagement is not a consulting service, so SSCS is not applicable.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The practitioner should refer to the **Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE)** for professional guidance in expressing an opinion on management's assertion regarding the warehouse's square footage. SSAE provides the appropriate framework for attestation engagements, ensuring that the practitioner's work is conducted in accordance with professional standards and that the opinion expressed is reliable and credible.

### Why questionnaire scores are not measures: a question-raising article [^3d475008]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

The Puzzle of Missing Values

Missing items are common in questionnaires, resulting from different reasons. Typical examples are made by subjects who may inadvertently skip over some questions or may not have enough time to complete the test. Subjects would prefer not to answer if higher penalties are assigned to wrong than missing answers. Sometimes, some items are reserved to some respondents, for example, those who attempted in the past a given activity or have other characteristics such as sex or language.

When missing answers are found, the easiest and most practiced solution would be to transform scores into the percentage of the total score given by the answered items. For example, if a subject misses two items and totals seven on a questionnaire of 10 dichotomous items, the subject's "total score" is 87.5% (7/8). Note that this procedure is equivalent to the common "mean substitution" procedure, assigning the missing items the average score observed in the other items. This method relies on the (strong and unlikely) assumption that questionnaires' items are all indicators of the same quantity of the latent variable of interest and thus exchangeable (i.e. they all share the same difficulty level).

Table 2 provides an example showing why this solution does not work. Suppose 10 items again, each scored 0 or 1, aligned from left to right for increasing difficulty. The "x" symbol flags a missing response. According to traditional psychometrics, subjects A and B are assigned the same score. Subject C, providing two missing answers, is assigned a lower score. However, it seems that subject A's missing response should be given a higher score estimate, given that the subject passed five more difficult items. In contrast, subject B failed three items easier than the missed one. It is doubtful that subject C deserves a lower score than subject B: he/she passed four items more difficult than the missed items.

TABLE 2
Estimation of missing values, based on average scores across answered items

Presumably, subjects A and C were careless in their answers or had not enough time to complete the test.

This example is intentionally simplistic. The treatment of missing data is a complex research field, faced by the whole field of statistics. As far as psychometric statistics is concerned, RA provides a satisfactory answer to this problem.

### Good or best practice statements: proposal for the operationalisation and implementation of GRADE guidance [^3074ff53]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Construct a statement that is clear and actionable

A GPS should be constructed as any recommendation is framed and expressed in actionable terms with the intended intervention, population and setting clearly specified. In the presentation of the GPS, guideline developers should ensure that users are not confused with formally graded recommendations and follow the suggestions made by the GRADE Working Group, using a separate heading for GPS or adding 'ungraded' next to the statement. However, an important concept in the operationalisation of the guidance is to separate the evaluation of a GPS (answering the question of if the statement is clear and actionable) from the actual development of a GPS. A guideline panel should clearly define the population, interventions and comparator that are the subject of the actionable statement, as they would do for a formal recommendation.

### Spanish-dementia knowledge assessment scale (DKAS-S): psychometric properties and validation [^0a26fa9a]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Until the date of publication of the Dementia Knowledge Assessment Scale (DKAS), there were thirteen scales, but only three with acceptable reliability and validity were available to measure the degree of knowledge about dementias: the Dementia Quiz (DQ), the Knowledge of Aging and Memory Loss and Care (KAML-C) and the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS). According to a systematic review, all measures followed the process of developing a standardized scale, and most have acceptable psychometric properties in terms of reliability and validity. However, some of the limitations indicated by the authors are that these scales have limited scope, some are outdated, and the evaluation does not cover different conceptual domains. Thus, Annear and collaborators designed the DKAS with the aim of correcting these limitations. The test-retest reliability values ​​were high, and the internal consistency and preliminary construct, concurrent and factor validity were good. The same authors compared the efficacy of the DKAS with that of the ADKS and concluded that the DKAS had a superior internal consistency, a wider response distribution and a lower ceiling effect than the ADKS, as well as better discrimination between scores obtained before and after respondents received health education on dementia. The scale comprises 25 statements about dementias, and subjects are asked to answer on a Likert scale with five response options: true, probably true, probably false, false, and don't know. The same authors performed the factor analysis establishing four domains: 1) causes and characteristics (dementia pathology and terminal course), 2) communication and behaviour (how a person with dementia engages with the world, 3) care considerations (dementia symptoms relevant to the provision of care) and 4) health risk and promotion (risk factors and conditions that are associated with or mistaken for dementia).

### PRISMA 2020 explanation and elaboration: updated guidance and exemplars for reporting systematic reviews [^0cbeec2c]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Item 23d. Discuss implications of the results for practice, policy, and future research

Explanation: There are many potential end users of a systematic review (such as patients, healthcare providers, researchers, insurers, and policy makers), each of whom will want to know what actions they should take given the review findings. Patients and healthcare providers may be primarily interested in the balance of benefits and harms, while policy makers and administrators may value data on organisational impact and resource utilisation. For reviews of interventions, authors might clarify trade-offs between benefits and harms and how the values attached to the most important outcomes of the review might lead different people to make different decisions. In addition, rather than making recommendations for practice or policy that apply universally, authors might discuss factors that are important in translating the evidence to different settings and factors that may modify the magnitude of effects.

Explicit recommendations for future research — as opposed to general statements such as "More research on this question is needed" — can better direct the questions future studies should address and the methods that should be used. For example, authors might consider describing the type of understudied participants who should be enrolled in future studies, the specific interventions that could be compared, suggested outcome measures to use, and ideal study design features to employ.

### Development and validation of a tool to assess the quality of clinical practice guideline recommendations [^f2266d59]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Final Refinements

Based on the study results and feedback from participants, changes were made to the tool. Table 5 lists the final items and criteria. eAppendix 1 in the Supplement compares the draft with the final version 1 of the tool and eAppendix 2 provides the entire AGREE-REX User's Guide.

Table 5.
AGREE-REX (Version 1) Items and Criteria

Abbreviation: AGREE-REX, Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation–Recommendations Excellence.

The original 11 items were edited to 9 items (2 items combined and 1 item deleted) and clustered into 3 conceptual categories: clinical applicability, values, and implementability.

The original 3 response scales were modified to 2. The mandatory quality assessment scale asked appraisers to rate on the 7-point scale the overall quality of the item by considering whether the item criteria were addressed in the CPG and influenced the recommendations — for example, the extent to which data on the values and preferences of the various stakeholders were obtained and reported and extent to which these data were explicitly considered in formation of the recommendation.

The optional 7-point suitability for use scale is appropriate when a CPG is being considered for endorsement, adaptation, or implementation. This response scale considers whether the content of the criteria and its consequences for recommendations align with what would be expected in the context in which the CPG recommendations would be applied — for example, whether the potential users of a CPG perceive that the values and preferences of patients and policy makers collected and used to inform the CPG recommendations align with those in their own context. Appraisers are asked to rate the suitability for use in their setting/context.

In response to feedback, the 2 overall assessment questions (implementability and clinical credibility) were replaced by 2 new overall assessment questions to align with the AGREE II overall assessment items. The first new question (required) asked raters whether they would recommend the CPG for use in an appropriate context and the optional second new question asked raters whether they would recommend the CPG for use in their own context. A categorical response scale of yes, yes with modifications, and no is used to answer these assessment questions.

There was debate whether to integrate the new items into the existing AGREE II or have a separate AGREE-REX tool. A decision was made to create a separate tool to provide optimal flexibility to potential users. A resource to provide directions for use of the AGREE suite of tools has been written (M. C. Brouwers, PhD, unpublished data, 2020).

### A summary of the methods that the national clinical guideline centre uses to produce clinical guidelines for the national institute for health and clinical excellence [^e6498189]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline formats, recommendation wording, and implementation — Each guideline is produced in 4 formats, including a full version detailing methods, evidence, and the link between evidence and recommendations; a NICE version that lists the recommendations; a quick reference guide summarizing recommendations for health care professionals; and an "understanding NICE guidance" version for patients, carers, and the general public. The wording of each recommendation is considered carefully to ensure that it is clear and concise, and recommendations are action-based and attempt to be specific about the intervention and the population to which the recommendation applies; justifications are not normally included because they are available in the full version's section describing the link between evidence and recommendations. The guideline development group selects 5 to 10 recommendations as key priorities for implementation; these are not necessarily all "strong" and are chosen as being likely to do at least 1 of the following: result in significant benefits for patients, reduce variation in care and outcomes, lead to more efficient use of National Health Service resources, promote patient choice, or promote more equitable access to health care. The guideline development group also identifies recommendations likely to benefit from implementation support, with criteria including not being part of routine care, requiring changes in service delivery or retraining, needing implementation across several agencies or settings, being potentially contentious, or being difficult to implement. While assessing the evidence and making recommendations for best practice, the group also considers how the recommendations will be implemented, and NICE has set up a team to assist with implementation that helps disseminate guidelines and provides tools to put them into practice.

### Summary benchmarks-full set – 2024 [^76ffec10]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Preferred Practice Pattern (PPP) guidelines — scope and principles emphasize that Preferred Practice Patterns provide guidance for the pattern of practice, not for the care of a particular individual, and that the Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines are not medical standards to be adhered to in all individual situations. The series is based on three principles: each Preferred Practice Pattern should be clinically relevant and specific enough to provide useful information to practitioners; each recommendation that is made should be given an explicit rating that shows its importance to the care process; and each recommendation should also be given an explicit rating that shows the strength of evidence that supports the recommendation and reflects the best evidence available. Adherence to these Preferred Practice Patterns will not ensure a successful outcome in every situation, and these practice patterns should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably directed at obtaining the best results.

Importance

Clinicians may rely on recommendations from clinical practice guidelines for management of patients.

Observations

A clinical practice guideline is a published statement that includes recommendations that are intended to optimize patient care. In the guideline development process, a panel of experts formulates recommendation questions that guide the retrieval of evidence that is used to inform the recommendations. Typically, methods of guideline development, a summary of the supporting evidence, and a justification of the panel's decisions accompany the recommendations. To use such guidelines optimally, clinicians must understand the implications of the recommendations, assess the trustworthiness of the development process, and evaluate the extent to which the recommendations are applicable to patients in their practice settings. Helpful recommendations are clear and actionable, and explicitly specify whether they are strong or weak, are appropriate for all patients, or depend on individual patients' circumstances and values. Rigorous guidelines and recommendations are informed by appropriately conducted, up-to-date systematic reviews that consider outcomes important to patients. Because judgments are involved in the interpretation of the evidence and the process of moving from evidence to recommendations, useful guidelines consider all relevant factors that have a bearing in a clinical decision and are not influenced by conflicts of interest.

Conclusions and Relevance

In considering a guideline's recommendations, clinicians must decide whether there are important differences between the factors the guideline panel has considered in making recommendations and their own practice setting.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to follow-up, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain a baseline axial (lumbar spine and hip; 1/3 radius if indicated) DEXA and repeat every 1–2 years until findings are stable. Consider obtaining 1/3 radius DEXA as an alternative site if the lumbar spine/hip is not evaluable or as an additional site in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Consider repeating it every 1–2 years or at a less frequent interval, depending on clinical circumstances. (Grade B; BEL 2) Monitor serial changes in lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck bone mineral density. Consider monitoring with 1/3 radius site if the lumbar spine, hip, or both are not evaluable, recognizing that it is limited by a small area and a very large least significant change. (Grade B; BEL 1) Attempt monitoring patients in the same facility with the same DEXA system, provided the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation adhere to International Society for Clinical Densitometry DEXA best practices.

### When and how to update systematic reviews: consensus and checklist [^c60b4b0c]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Step 1: assess currency

Does the published review still address a current question?

An update is only worthwhile if the question is topical for decision making for practice, policy, or research priorities (fig 1). For agencies, people responsible for managing a portfolio of systematic reviews, there is a need to use both formal and informal horizon scanning. This type of scanning helps identify questions with currency, and can help identify those reviews that should be updated. The process could include monitoring policy debates around the review, media outlets, scientific (and professional) publications, and linking with guideline developers.

Has the review had good access or use?

Metrics for citations, article access and downloads, and sharing via social or traditional media can be used as proxy or indicators for currency and relevance of the review. Reviews that are widely cited and used could be important to update should the need arise. Comparable reviews that are never cited or rarely downloaded, for example, could indicate that they are not addressing a question that is valued, and might not be worth updating.

In most cases, updated reviews are most useful to stakeholders when there is new information or methods that result in a change in findings. However, there are some circumstances in which an up to date search for information is important for retaining the credibility of the review, regardless of whether the main findings would change or not. For example, key stakeholders would dismiss a review if a study is carried out in a relevant geographical setting but is not included; if a large, high profile study that might not change the findings is not included; or if an up to date search is required for a guideline to achieve credibility. Box 3 provides such examples. If the review does not answer a current question, the intervention has been superseded, then a decision can be made not to update and no further intelligence gathering is required (fig 1).

Did the review use valid methods and was it well conducted?

If the question is current and clearly defined, the systematic review needs to have used valid methods and be well conducted. If the review has vague inclusion criteria, poorly articulated outcomes, or inappropriate methods, then updating should not proceed. If the question is current, and the review has been cited or used, then it might be appropriate to simply start with a new protocol. The appraisal should take into account the methods in use when the review was done.

### Committee opinion no. 676: health literacy to promote quality of care [^fe31a18b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Patient tasks and system demands related to health literacy — When "patients encounter the health care system, they are expected to understand and apply verbal information pertaining to consent, diagnosis, medical advice, and treatment; have access to and use various forms of technology, including computers and smartphones; calculate and interpret numerical data; and comprehend graphs and visual information". Furthermore, "patients are expected to articulate accurate information about their symptoms, concerns, and medical history". The report cautions that "The current health care system asks consumers to make sophisticated health-related decisions using information relayed in encounters that often are brief and may not consider the individual's distinct information needs".

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^8ce2912e]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care 8 (SOC-8) — aim, evidence base, and scope: The overall goal of SOC-8 is to provide health care professionals (HCPs) with clinical guidance to assist transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people in accessing safe and effective pathways to achieving lasting personal comfort with their gendered selves and to optimize overall physical health, psychological well-being, and self-fulfillment; SOC-8 is based on the best available science and expert professional consensus, with recommendation statements developed from independent systematic literature reviews, background reviews, and expert opinions. A total of 18 chapters were developed that contain recommendations for health care professionals, each followed by explanatory text with relevant references; general areas include Terminology, Global Applicability, Population Estimates, and Education; population-focused chapters include Assessment of Adults, Adolescents, Children, Nonbinary, Eunuchs, Intersex Individuals, and people living in Institutional Environments; treatment-focused chapters include Hormone Therapy, Surgery and Postoperative Care, Primary Care, Voice and Communication, Reproductive Health, Sexual Health, and Mental Health. The SOC-8 updates are intended to be flexible and adaptable to specific health care needs of TGD people globally and, as clinical guidelines, individual health care professionals and programs may modify these in consultation with the TGD person, while offering standards for promoting optimal health care and guidance for the treatment of people experiencing gender incongruence.

### Identifying experts for clinical practice guidelines: perspectives from the ASH guideline oversight subcommittee [^256eb5dd]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Recognizing that trusted experts are required and that a well-established method for identifying these individuals does not exist, the ASH Committee on Quality forms an ad hoc group to oversee the development of new guideline panels. A public recruitment process can be used to assure the generation of a large, diverse pool of candidates who will then be vetted to assess the interest, availability, and eligibility to serve on the panel. Through an iterative process, a final panel of ∼25 individuals can be developed and sent to the ASH Committee on Quality for approval.

Guideline developers and end users place a high value on the panelist's expertise; however, it can be challenging to determine whether actual panelists are genuine experts or not. Expertise cannot be identified a priori. However, proxy markers of productivity, reputation, and experience, in combination with a transparent and explicit guideline development process, can make it more likely that individuals in guideline panels are truly experts, thus, increasing the likelihood that their recommendations are robust and trustworthy.

### Clinical practice guidelines: towards better quality guidelines and increased international collaboration [^bbb7abfc]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

The final AGREE instrument consists of 23 key items (Table 1

Table 1
The AGREE instrument) categorised into six domains (see:). Each domain is intended to measure a separate dimension of guideline quality.

Scope and purpose (items 1–3): These items are concerned with the overall aim of the guideline, the specific clinical questions and the target patient population.

Stakeholder involvement (items 4–7): These items focus on the extent to which the guideline represents the views of its intended users. Guideline development needs to be carried out by a multidisciplinary group involving all stakeholders whose clinical activities are likely to be covered in the proposed guideline. This also includes patient groups.

Rigour of development (items 8–14): These items relate to the process used to gather and synthesise the evidence, and the methods used to formulate the recommendations and to update them. The recommendations should be explicitly linked to the supporting evidence. However, because most current guidelines use a mixture of 'expert' judgement and literature review, disclosure of disagreement or uncertainties encountered during the development may help to clarify the process. Guidelines should be reviewed externally before publication, and the process used clearly described. They should also always include a date of publication, and because guidelines need to reflect current research, they should contain a clear statement about the updating procedures.

Clarity and presentation (items 15–18): These items deal with the language and format of the guidelines. Since the main role of guidelines is to help clinicians and patients make better decisions, busy clinicians need simple, patient-specific, user-friendly guidelines that are easy to understand. Good guidelines present clear information about the management options available and the likely consequences of each. This information can be presented in a variety of formats to suit the needs of the user.

Applicability (items 19–21): These items cover the likely organisational, behavioural and cost implications of applying the guidelines. Guidelines should be feasible to use in the current organisation of care and must fit into routine practice and the time constraints present. In addition, review criteria should be developed that link the guideline use to audits and other quality improvement initiatives.

### A summary of the methods that the national clinical guideline centre uses to produce clinical guidelines for the national institute for health and clinical excellence [^b4391244]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline external review and updating — For new guidelines, external review usually takes 8 weeks (or 4 weeks for a short guideline); updated guidelines may have a shorter consultation period, depending on the scope of the update. All NICE guidelines have a validation phase that involves a consultation period for stakeholders, with the first draft posted on the NICE Web site and stakeholders invited to submit comments; the guideline center and the guideline development group respond to all comments and make changes. A guideline review panel convened by NICE reviews responses to stakeholder comments to check they have been answered appropriately and that the scope has been covered, and before publication stakeholders are invited to check for factual errors or inaccuracies in the full version; corrections are made and the final guideline is published on the NICE Web site. A check for new evidence is made 3 years after publication, after which NICE decides whether to commission a full update, a partial update, or no update.

### 2025 ACC / AHA clinical practice guidelines core principles and development process: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^dd017bc9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Decision aids for cardiovascular care — Decision aids can accelerate patient learning and enhance shared decision-making (SDM) processes and patient decision aids (PDAs) are used to guide, not replace, preference-sensitive treatment discussions when patients and clinicians face equipoise, presenting balanced, unbiased, literacy-sensitive, culturally congruent information about risks and benefits based on the latest evidence. The page specifies that PDAs should be utilized in advance of the treatment decision and that an inclusive design approach should be used, with PDAs that should adhere to the International Patient Decision Aid Standards, be personalized, written in plain language, and tailored to patient-specific information and available treatment options. For outcomes and use preferences, individuals who are at risk for or have cardiovascular conditions have been shown to benefit from PDAs, which improve knowledge of treatment options, reduce decisional conflict, enhance patient-clinician communication, and improve patient and clinician satisfaction with treatment choices without significantly affecting encounter duration; patients prefer using PDAs collaboratively with a clinician rather than as a standalone tool, and when PDAs are coupled with a decision coach there is more active participation in decision-making and the highest improvement in knowledge. It also notes that paper-based PDAs are the most common delivery form compared with web-based, video, or CD delivery.

### Finding and evaluating the evidence: a critical step in evidence-based medicine [^869937eb]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Practitioners of evidence-based medicine are expected to review the evidence for treatment effectiveness with their patients as part of the shared decision-making process. This requires practitioners to know the evidence or to know how to find and evaluate it. To find the evidence, the practitioner must craft the search question by considering the domains of population, intervention, and outcome as a means to individualize the search for each patient. To evaluate the evidence, the practitioner needs to understand the strengths and weaknesses of various types of scientific evidence. Most practitioners will consult EBP guidelines first. If guidelines do not answer the search question, the practitioner will turn to systematic reviews, ensuring that their methods of selection and evaluation are explicit and appropriate. Searching the scientific literature for single studies is also possible, but evaluating primary sources is more difficult. Given the constraints of time and expertise, the authors anticipate that computerized expert systems, based on current evidence, will become increasingly prominent.

### Reporting guideline for overviews of reviews of healthcare interventions: development of the PRIOR statement [^1f30d692]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Round 2 results — online survey

Eighty five per cent (n = 44/52) of the round 1 participants responded to the round 2 survey. Agreement (≥ 70%) was not reached for the inclusion or exclusion of any of the nine items on the survey (four items that did not reach agreement in the first round, and five new items; appendix 4 in the supplementary materials). Based on the comments, no new items were added or changed after this round.

Round 3 results — virtual face-to-face meeting

A total of 19 individuals participated in the virtual face-to-face meetings: six core team members, three EAG members, and 10 of the 11 invited expert panellists. Thirteen individuals participated in the voting process (all but the core team, who did not vote). One invited expert could not attend and did not contribute to voting but provided comments on the meeting minutes.

During the initial voting process, agreement was reached for excluding five of the nine items (≥ 77% agreement) for which agreement had not been reached on the round 2 survey (appendix 5 in the supplementary materials). For three items (two on risk of bias owing to missing results in a synthesis (a methods item and a corresponding results item) and one on summarising the risk of bias of primary studies), there was substantial discussion regarding their wording. Voting for these items was for their concept (irrespective of wording). Voting members agreed that the items should be retained (≥ 85% for each item); the core team committed to reworking the items during post-meeting revisions. For the final item (reporting of the method for managing and tracking records during selection), there was near agreement (69%) for exclusion. In an attempt to gain ≥ 70% agreement, discussion continued and the following edits were suggested: the item itself would be removed, and the content of the item would instead be incorporated into the associated checklist item on study selection (item 8a). Ninety two per cent agreement was achieved for this decision.

### Glatiramer acetate [^2cbd46e0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide and Instructions for Use).

Important Administration Instructions

Advise patients with new or existing glatiramer acetate prescriptions to consult their pharmacist or healthcare provider if they would like information about using an optional compatible autoinjector device, if available.

Additionally, advise patients who would like to use an autoinjector for administration, should one be available, that not all available autoinjectors are compatible with all glatiramer acetate products and the availability of compatible autoinjectors may change with time. If you have questions about the availability or compatibility of an autoinjector, contact the manufacturer of the prescribed glatiramer acetate product for more information.

Advise patients that using an optional autoinjector that is not compatible with the glatiramer acetate product may increase the risk for medication errors, such as missing a dose or administration of a partial dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Anaphylactic Reactions

Advise patients and their caregivers that glatiramer acetate injection may cause life-threatening and fatal anaphylactic reactions shortly after injection, and that reactions may occur months to years after initiation of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Inform patients and their caregivers about the signs and symptoms specific for anaphylactic reactions, and that signs and symptoms of anaphylactic reactions may overlap with those of immediate post-injection reactions. Instruct them to seek immediate emergency medical care if they experience any signs or symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Patients should be advised to also contact their healthcare provider, and that treatment should be discontinued immediately and permanently if anaphylactic reactions occur.

In Round 1, the mean ratings for the item inclusion scale ranged from 5.37 to 6.67 (M = 6.06; SD = 0.31; Table S2) with a median agreement ranging from 6 = Agree to 7 = Strongly Agree. No new standards were suggested. The feedback resulted in the removal of one reporting standard and the clarification and reformulation of 20 standards. The standard on Transparency and replicability was rated as relevant but removed because it is achieved by reporting the other reporting standards. Standard 4.2 Validity and Standard needed a major clarification about the meaning of validity as well as standard. Minor clarifications and reformations, such as grammar or word changes, were made for 19 standards (see open material). The mean ratings in Round 2 ranged from 5.47 to 6.70 (M = 6.20; SD = 0.37; Table S3), with open feedback resulting in minor clarifications and reformulations of nine standards.

2.3. Refining the guideline through expert consensus

The authors finalized the guidelines in an expert consensus meeting. The meeting was held online with nine working and steering group members. The content and structure of the consensus meeting were prepared by the working group, and the meeting was led by the last author (O.K.). Participants had access to the guidelines, inclusion rationales (i.e. elaboration and explanation), and the drafted paper before the meeting, where they also had the option to provide comments and feedback in writing. The meeting included reviewing the Delphi Rounds 1 and 2 findings and discussing the paper draft, including the individual reporting standards and groups. We decided not to carry out another Delphi round since i) the median agreement for each reporting standard in both Delphi Rounds 1 and 2 ranged from 6 = Agree to 7 = Strongly Agree, ii) no new standards were suggested, and iii) only minor changes were needed after Round 2, which taken together suggest consensus.

### Use of a web-based educational intervention to improve knowledge of healthy diet and lifestyle in women with gestational diabetes mellitus compared to standard clinic-based education [^003f4a64]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Questionnaire

The questionnaire included health questionnaires developed/adapted by the authors and used in previous studies of Australian women, which included demographic information, health, knowledge of GDM, knowledge of testing blood glucose level, knowledge of food choice and self-managing GDM. The Diabetes Knowledge Scale was specifically adapted to focus on pregnancy and GDM, and used in a previous study to assess knowledge about GDM. Most questions had one correct answer and were scored as correct/incorrect. (eg, "in uncontrolled diabetes the blood sugar is: (a) Normal; (b). Increased; and (c). Decreased". The correct answer is b. increased) (Fig. 1a). Questions evaluating levels of knowledge had more than one correct answer (eg, "Because I have gestational diabetes, my baby may be: (a). Larger than usual; (b). Smaller than usual; (c). Born early; (d). Admitted to special care; (e). I don't know". The correct answer is a, c and d) (Fig. 1b). A score was given for each correct answer to a total of 1 per question (Score 0.33 = one correct out of 3 answers; Score 0.66 = two correct out of 3 answers; Score 0.25 = one correct out of 4 answers; Score 0.5 = two correct out of 4 answers; Score 0.75 = three correct out of 4 answers; and Score 1 = all correct answers). Detailed information about the questionnaire and scoring system is included in Fig. 1a and b.

### Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) guidelines development: standard operating procedure [^45a60069]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). High credibility.

SAGES guidelines development methods and project conception state that the steps are informed by The Institute of Medicine's recommendations and that both Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) are utilized; the PRISMA statement is a 27-point checklist and GRADE is used to evaluate the quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations. The development of new SAGES guidelines considers input from the SAGES membership via surveys and the SAGES Executive Committee and Board of Governors, and guideline projects are often initiated around the biannual committee meetings; once a topic is chosen, a committee member is assigned by the committee chair to lead and the Lead and Committee Chair recruit a working group tasked with gathering evidence in the form of a systematic review. The lead and committee chairs invite experts within and outside SAGES Guidelines Committee to the panel and often reach out to other societies to increase the breadth of expertise and ensure more widespread consensus of eventual guidelines endorsement, and these colleagues work on the panel to help develop the final recommendations. SAGES believes that patient engagement in guidelines development is critical, and every effort is made to involve patient advocates at three points: deciding on the key questions a guideline should answer, determining what outcomes should be collected from research to answer these questions, and serving as a voting member of the guideline panel.

### Amphetamine (dyanavel XR) [^4d150a5e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.1 Controlled Substance

DYANAVEL XR contains amphetamine, a Schedule II controlled substance.

9.2 Abuse

DYANAVEL XR has a high potential for abuse and misuse which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. DYANAVEL XR can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution.

Abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, to achieve a desired psychological or physiological effect. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence.

Misuse and abuse of amphetamine may cause increased heart rate, respiratory rate, or blood pressure; sweating; dilated pupils; hyperactivity; restlessness; insomnia; decreased appetite; loss of coordination; tremors; flushed skin; vomiting; and/or abdominal pain. Anxiety, psychosis, hostility, aggression, and suicidal or homicidal ideation have also been observed with CNS stimulants abuse and/or misuse. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including DYANAVEL XR, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)], and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

9.3 Dependence

Physical Dependence

DYANAVEL XR may produce physical dependence. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug.

Withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or dose reduction following prolonged use of CNS stimulants including DYANAVEL XR include dysphoric mood; depression; fatigue; vivid, unpleasant dreams; insomnia or hypersomnia; increased appetite; and psychomotor retardation or agitation.

Tolerance

DYANAVEL XR may produce tolerance. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose).

Survey quality assessment consensus scoring

Following the consensus discussion, of all of the individual survey items scored, only 26% (n = 65) scored as good methodological quality, with 40% (n = 101) and 34% (n = 84) scoring as fair and poor methodological quality respectively. A higher proportion of the survey items were scored as very useful (38%, n = 95), with 21% (n = 53) and 41% (n = 102) as somewhat useful and not useful, respectively. In the overall quality assessment of survey items (combining methodological score and usefulness score) only 19% (n = 47) of survey items were recommended, with 35% (n = 87) requiring improvements, and 46% (n = 116) not recommended (figure 3).

Figure 3
Quality assessment of survey items.

For the overall survey only 20% (n = 4) were scored as good methodologically, with 55% (n = 11) scoring fair, and 25% (n = 5) scoring poor. In terms of overall survey usefulness 30% (n = 6) scored very useful, 50% (n = 10) somewhat useful and 20% (n = 4) not useful. For the overall quality assessment of surveys only 15% (n = 3) were recommended, the large majority required improvement 65%, (n = 13) and 20% (n = 4) were not recommended (see online supplemental file 1).

Of the three surveys that were 'recommended', 25 of the 29 survey items were rated recommended, and four required improvement (S2: 9 survey items, 6 recommend, 3 required improvement; S4: 9 survey items, 8 recommended, 1 required improvement; S8, all 11 items were recommended).

### Clinical guidelines and standardization of practice to improve outcomes: ACOG committee opinion, number 792 [^ad05564b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion — protocol use and local implementation describes how protocols and checklists are to be applied and adapted, stating, "Protocols and checklists should be recognized as a guide to the management of a clinical situation or process of care that will apply to most patients." For exceptions, "the physician should document in the medical record why the protocol or checklist is not being followed," and, "once the protocol has been finalized, staff should be reminded that they may deviate from the protocol as long as the record reflects awareness of the protocol and documents the rationale and reasoning for not following it." Development guidance states, "The process to develop protocols must be collaborative, inclusive, and multidisciplinary, and should include hospital administration working with and supporting physicians, nurses, patient advocates, and other staff members," and implementation steps include, "It is important that physicians are informed whenever checklists or protocols are to be initiated," and "Procedures should be in place for notifying and training all practitioners whenever the use of these tools is to be implemented."

### A summary of the methods that the national clinical guideline centre uses to produce clinical guidelines for the national institute for health and clinical excellence [^4b3af3d4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

Stakeholder involvement and guideline development group (GDG) composition — stakeholders register with NICE through the Web site and may include patient and carer organizations; national organizations that represent health care professionals; clinicians; manufacturers; providers and commissioners in England, Wales and Northern Ireland; and statutory and research organizations. All registered stakeholders are involved during development, being invited to a workshop to discuss the proposed scope, to comment on the draft scope during a consultation period, and to comment on the first draft and a prepublication check version posted on the NICE Web site. An independent guideline review panel assesses the scope and whether stakeholder comments have been answered. The center recruits an independent GDG of health care professionals and patient and carer representatives regarded as an advisory group to the Department of Health, with each group having 10 to 12 members, and if voting is used the technical team has a maximum of 3 votes.

### Effect of exercise for depression: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^dffc7946]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Our findings suggest that practitioners could advocate for most patients to engage in exercise. Those patients may benefit from guidance on intensity (ie, vigorous) and types of exercise that appear to work well (eg, walking, running, mixed aerobic exercise, strength training, yoga, tai chi, qigong) and be well tolerated (eg, strength training and yoga). If social determinants permit, engaging in group exercise or structured programmes could provide support and guidance to achieve better outcomes. Health services may consider offering these programmes as an alternative or adjuvant treatment for major depression. Specifically, although the confidence in the evidence for exercise is less strong than for cognitive behavioural therapy, the effect sizes seem comparable, so it may be an alternative for patients who prefer not to engage in psychotherapy. Previous reviews on those with mild-moderate depression have found similar effects for exercise or SSRIs, or the two combined. In contrast, we found some forms of exercise to have stronger effects than SSRIs alone. Our findings are likely related to the larger power in our review (n = 14 170) compared with previous reviews (eg, n = 2551), and our ability to better account for heterogeneity in exercise prescriptions. Exercise may therefore be considered a viable alternative to drug treatment. We also found evidence that exercise increases the effects of SSRIs, so offering exercise may act as an adjuvant for those already taking drugs. We agree with consensus statements that professionals should still account for patients' values, preferences, and constraints, ensuring there is shared decision making around what best suits the patient. Our review provides data to help inform that decision.

### Disclosure of interests and management of conflicts of interest in clinical guidelines and guidance statements: methods from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^45ec8dd8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American College of Physicians (ACP) clinical guidelines — mandated disclosures and public reporting require that participants disclose all active and inactive financial and intellectual interests related to health care, with reportable categories including all employment; research and consulting support; investments and proprietary interests; positions held; professional career or intellectual interests; and any other aspect of the participant's background or present interests that might be perceived as affecting objectivity or independence. The CGC's policy does not mandate disclosure of interests related primarily to personal matters or relationships outside the household, which may include nonhousehold familial and personal relationships, political, religious, or ideological views, philanthropic donations, and personal or family health issues or experiences. Participants involved in the development of ACP guidelines disclose interests using a structured electronic format with specific categorical prompts and sign and date the form after each review and update, certifying full disclosure and commitment to promptly disclose changes. For transparency, the DOI forms for committee members, staff, and any other participant, which are signed after each meeting, are publicly available on ACP's Web site, and all ACP clinical guidelines and guidance statements contain a link to these reports.

### Contemporary cardiac SPECT imaging-innovations and best practices: an information statement from the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology [^b1ca0a5e]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

High-sensitivity SPECT interpretation — images acquired on these systems require special considerations, familiar clues to attenuation and motion artifacts may not be available on systems without standard collimator or projection images, and attenuation patterns may produce myocardial perfusion images significantly different from standard SPECT systems, particularly with upright imaging. A "recalibration" of the interpretive eye is required and can be achieved with experience, and both attenuation correction and the 2-position approach to attenuation artifact recognition require that the interpreter integrate two images for comparison (attenuation correction/Non-attenuation correction, supine/prone, upright/supine); software packages for interpretation support these comparisons.

### Evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, and guidelines in interventional pain management, part I: introduction and general considerations [^e88b376d]. Pain Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, and guidelines are part of modern interventional pain management. As in other specialties in the United States, evidence-based medicine appears to motivate the search for answers to numerous questions related to costs and quality of health care as well as access to care. Scientific, relevant evidence is essential in clinical care, policy-making, dispute resolution, and law. Consequently, evidence based practice brings together pertinent, trustworthy information by systematically acquiring, analyzing, and transferring research findings into clinical, management, and policy arenas. In the United States, researchers, clinicians, professional organizations, and government are looking for a sensible approach to health care with practical evidence-based medicine. All modes of evidence-based practice, either in the form of evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, meta-analysis, or guidelines, evolve through a methodological, rational accumulation, analysis, and understanding of the evidentiary knowledge that can be applied in clinical settings. Historically, evidence-based medicine is traceable to the 1700s, even though it was not explicitly defined and advanced until the late 1970s and early 1980s. Evidence-based medicine was initially called "critical appraisal" to describe the application of basic rules of evidence as they evolve into application in daily practices. Evidence-based medicine is defined as a conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. Evidence-based practice is defined based on 4 basic and important contingencies, which include recognition of the patient's problem and construction of a structured clinical question, thorough search of medical literature to retrieve the best available evidence to answer the question, critical appraisal of all available evidence, and integration of the evidence with all aspects and contexts of the clinical circumstances. Systematic reviews provide the application of scientific strategies that limit bias by the systematic assembly, critical appraisal, and synthesis of all relevant studies on a specific topic. While systematic reviews are close to meta-analysis, they are vastly different from narrative reviews and health technology assessments. Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed statements that aim to help physicians and patients reach the best health care decisions. Appropriately developed guidelines incorporate validity, reliability, reproducibility, clinical applicability and flexibility, clarity, development through a multidisciplinary process, scheduled reviews, and documentation. Thus, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines represent statements developed to improve the quality of care, patient access, treatment outcomes, appropriateness of care, efficiency and effectiveness and achieve cost containment by improving the cost benefit ratio. Part 1 of this series in evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, and guidelines in interventional pain management provides an introduction and general considerations of these 3 aspects in interventional pain management.

### Committee opinion no. 681: disclosure and discussion of adverse events [^02157876]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Adverse outcomes, preventable or otherwise, are a reality of medical care. Most importantly, adverse events affect patients, but they also affect health care practitioners. Disclosing information about adverse events has benefits for the patient and the physician and, ideally, strengthens the patient-physician relationship and promotes trust. Studies show that after an adverse outcome, patients expect and want timely and full disclosure of the event, an acknowledgment of responsibility, an understanding of what happened, expressions of sympathy, and a discussion of what is being done to prevent recurrence. Surveys have shown that patients are less likely to pursue litigation if they perceive that the event was honestly disclosed. Barriers to full disclosure are many and include fear of retribution for reporting an adverse event, lack of training, a culture of blame, and fear of lawsuits. To reduce these concerns, it is recommended that health care facilities establish a nonpunitive, blame-free culture that encourages staff to report adverse events and near misses (close calls) without fear of retaliation. Health care institutions should have written policies that address the management of adverse events. Having a responsive process to inform and aid the patient, loved ones, and practitioners is required. A commitment on the part of all health care practitioners and institutions to establish programs and develop the tools needed to help patients, families, health care practitioners, and staff members deal with adversity is essential.

### Committee opinion no. 681: disclosure and discussion of adverse events [^65f783e0]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Disclosure and discussion of adverse events — organizational guidance emphasizes culture, policies, and support. Health care facilities should establish a nonpunitive, blame-free culture that encourages staff to report adverse events and near misses (close calls) without fear of retaliation, and health care institutions should have written policies that address the management of adverse events. Coordinated responses to adverse events also must include identification and treatment of the health care practitioners and ancillary staff who become "second victims." The document adds that having a responsive process to inform and aid the patient, loved ones, and practitioners is required, and that after an adverse outcome, patients expect and want timely and full disclosure of the event, an acknowledgment of responsibility, an understanding of what happened, expressions of sympathy, and a discussion of what is being done to prevent recurrence.
