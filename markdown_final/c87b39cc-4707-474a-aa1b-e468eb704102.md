## Question

Is an increased TIBC observed in iron deficiency?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking if an increased total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) is observed in iron deficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what TIBC actually measures and its physiologic basis. Then, I should verify the expected iron study patterns in absolute iron deficiency. Next, I will examine how inflammation alters transferrin and TIBC in functional iron deficiency. After that, I should cross-check guideline statements and supportive study data. Finally, I will synthesize diagnostic implications and provide a direct answer with caveats, making sure I don't overgeneralize without considering exceptions [^111wSktU].

> Let me first confirm the definitions. TIBC is a surrogate for circulating transferrin concentration, reflecting the maximal iron-binding capacity in serum; transferrin saturation (TSAT) is calculated as serum iron divided by TIBC and gauges iron availability to tissues, which in health is typically around one-third saturated, roughly 30% on average.

> Now, I should verify the pattern in absolute iron deficiency. When total body iron stores are depleted, the liver upregulates transferrin synthesis to scavenge scarce iron, which raises TIBC; in parallel, serum iron and TSAT fall and ferritin becomes low, yielding the classic profile of low ferritin, low serum iron, low TSAT, and elevated TIBC. Wait, let me verify this against guidelines: multiple sources explicitly list raised TIBC as a marker of iron deficiency and define iron deficiency as low TSAT with elevated TIBC, which aligns with standard teaching [^116Ln8KB] [^1156eU7K].

> Hold on, I should also check whether observed changes in TIBC reverse with iron repletion to support causality. In a heart failure cohort treated with oral iron, TIBC decreased significantly over approximately six months as iron status improved, consistent with higher baseline TIBC in iron-deficient states and downregulation of transferrin once iron supply was restored. Wait, I need to confirm the directionality: yes, median TIBC fell from 343 to 313 μg/dL with repletion, supporting that elevated TIBC accompanies deficiency and normalizes with treatment [^115KdR9j].

> Next, I will examine functional iron deficiency due to inflammation. I need to ensure I don't conflate absolute and functional deficiency. In inflammatory states, cytokine-driven hepcidin increases restrict iron egress and absorption, while hepatic transferrin synthesis is suppressed, so serum iron and TIBC are generally low and TSAT can be limited in utility. Let me double-check: surgical consensus guidance notes serum iron and TIBC are generally low in inflammation; CHF studies similarly describe decreased TIBC in the context of low TSAT; IBD-focused reviews of anemia of chronic disease also characterize reduced TIBC. This pattern contrasts with the raised TIBC seen in absolute deficiency, and it's crucial to keep this distinction clear [^111wSktU] [^1116hpFo].

> But wait, what if malnutrition or chronic disease lowers transferrin so much that TSAT looks misleadingly normal or even elevated? I should confirm that caution. Reviews in cardiometabolic populations emphasize that low transferrin production can artifactually increase TSAT relative to iron content, underscoring why TSAT must be read alongside ferritin, CRP, and TIBC, particularly when transferrin is depressed. Hmm, wait a minute, this means a "normal" TSAT doesn't always exclude iron-restricted states if TIBC is suppressed by illness or protein-energy deficits [^114JLXDd] [^111Ekzn2].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic implications are precise. Elevated TIBC supports absolute iron deficiency when ferritin is low and TSAT is reduced, whereas low or normal TIBC in the face of low TSAT points toward functional iron deficiency from inflammation. Let me reconsider whether TIBC itself discriminates well between IDA and ACD: classic data suggest TIBC performs at least comparably to soluble transferrin receptor for this distinction, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — no single test is definitive in isolation, and a therapeutic trial or integrated indices often help adjudicate ambiguity. A robust hemoglobin rise after brief oral iron strongly supports absolute iron deficiency even if studies are equivocal, which I should remember when planning management [^1155i1DV] [^114J4SK1] [^1156eU7K].

> At first, I almost said "TIBC increases in iron deficiency" as a blanket statement, but I should correct that to be clinically accurate: TIBC increases in absolute iron deficiency, while in functional or inflammatory deficiency it is typically normal or decreased due to suppressed transferrin synthesis. Let me first confirm this final point against guidelines and reviews: gastroenterology guidance highlights elevated TIBC as a marker of iron deficiency, whereas perioperative consensus and heart failure literature emphasize low TIBC in inflammatory states. This reconciles the apparent contradiction and aligns with the hepcidin-centric physiology of iron sequestration during inflammation [^116Ln8KB] [^111wSktU] [^114JLXDd].

> Bottom line, with the caveats verified: Yes, increased TIBC is characteristic of absolute iron deficiency because transferrin production rises as a compensatory response to depleted stores; however, this does not hold in functional iron deficiency from inflammation, where TIBC is often normal or reduced. Accurate interpretation requires integrating TIBC with ferritin, serum iron, TSAT, inflammatory markers, and, when needed, response to iron therapy to avoid misclassification and to tailor treatment appropriately [^116Ln8KB] [^1156eU7K] [^111wSktU] [^114J4SK1].

Yes, **elevated TIBC is a hallmark of iron deficiency** because the liver increases transferrin production [^116Ln8KB] to maximize iron transport when stores are low. This rise in TIBC **helps distinguish iron deficiency from anemia of chronic disease** [^1155i1DV], where TIBC is normal or low due to inflammation-driven hepcidin effects [^111Ekzn2]. TIBC is most useful when interpreted with ferritin and transferrin saturation [^114JLXDd], and may be less reliable in chronic inflammation [^111wSktU] or liver disease.

---

## Physiological basis of elevated TIBC in iron deficiency

- **Transferrin production**: The liver increases transferrin synthesis [^116Ln8KB] when iron stores are low, raising TIBC.
- **Iron transport capacity**: Higher transferrin increases iron-binding capacity, reflected as elevated TIBC [^116Ln8KB].
- **Compensatory mechanism**: This response aims to maximize iron delivery to tissues despite low stores [^115TJZBu] [^116Ln8KB].

## Laboratory findings in iron deficiency anemia

Typical laboratory profile in **iron deficiency anemia**:

| **Laboratory parameter** | **Typical finding in IDA** |
|-|-|
| Serum ferritin | Low (< 15 µg/L) [^111C8V5M] [^116Ln8KB] |
| Serum iron | Low [^115TJZBu] [^116Ln8KB] |
| Transferrin saturation | Low (< 20%) [^114JLXDd] [^116Ln8KB] |
| Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) | Elevated [^1155i1DV] [^116Ln8KB] |
| Serum transferrin receptor (sTfR) | Elevated [^115LDMYR] [^116Ln8KB] |
| Reticulocyte hemoglobin content (Retic-Hb) | Low [^111svRYK] [^116Ln8KB] |
| Red cell distribution width (RDW) | Elevated [^111Y5frp] [^116Ln8KB] |

---

Elevated TIBC is a consistent feature of **iron deficiency anemia**, reflecting increased transferrin production and greater iron-binding capacity [^1156eU7K].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated TIBC

Elevated TIBC **helps differentiate iron deficiency anemia from other anemias**, particularly anemia of chronic disease (ACD) [^1155i1DV]. In ACD, TIBC is typically normal or low [^1116hpFo] due to inflammation-induced hepcidin, which reduces iron availability and suppresses transferrin synthesis.

---

## Limitations and considerations

While elevated TIBC is useful for identifying iron deficiency, **several limitations should be considered**:

- **Inflammation**: Chronic inflammation can suppress transferrin synthesis [^111Ekzn2], potentially masking elevated TIBC in iron deficiency anemia [^111wSktU].
- **Liver disease**: Liver dysfunction can alter transferrin production [^114JLXDd], affecting TIBC levels [^116VTxiw].
- **Nutritional status**: Malnutrition can influence transferrin synthesis and TIBC levels [^114JLXDd].

Therefore, **interpret TIBC alongside other iron parameters** — such as serum ferritin and transferrin saturation — to accurately diagnose iron deficiency anemia.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the **role of TIBC in diagnosing iron deficiency anemia**; the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) recommends confirming iron deficiency with iron studies, including TIBC, before initiating further investigations [^116Ln8KB]. Additionally, a good response to iron therapy (hemoglobin rise ≥ 10 g/L within 2 weeks) strongly suggests absolute iron deficiency, even if iron studies are equivocal [^114J4SK1].

---

Elevated TIBC is a hallmark of **iron deficiency anemia**, reflecting increased transferrin production and iron-binding capacity. It is a useful marker for distinguishing iron deficiency anemia from other types of anemia, particularly anemia of chronic disease [^1155i1DV]. However, TIBC should be interpreted alongside other iron parameters and clinical context to ensure accurate diagnosis and management [^111wSktU].

Automated cell counters provide measurements of the changes in red cells that accompany iron deficiency, including reduced mean cell Hb (MCH) — hypochromia; and reduced mean cell volume (MCV) — microcytosis. MCH is probably a more reliable marker of iron deficiency as it is less dependent on storage and the counting machine used, and a reduction is seen in both absolute and functional iron deficiency (FID). MCH may also be more sensitive for iron deficiency than MCV. Both microcytosis and hypochromia lose sensitivity for iron deficiency in the presence of chronic disease, thalassaemia, or vitamin B12/folate deficiency.

The specificity of MCV and MCH for iron deficiency is limited, as microcytosis and hypochromia also occur in many haemoglobinopathies (such as thalassaemia, when the MCV is typically reduced out of proportion to the level of anaemia), in sideroblastic anaemia, and in some cases of anaemia of chronic disease. To prevent unnecessary GI investigation, Hb electrophoresis is recommended in those with microcytosis and normal iron studies, particularly if there is an appropriate ethnic background.

The serum markers of iron deficiency include low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, low iron, raised total iron-binding capacity, raised red cell zinc protoporphyrin, increased serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), low reticulocyte Hb (Retic-Hb), and raised percentage hypochromic red cells. Serum ferritin (SF) is the most specific test for iron deficiency in the absence of inflammation. An SF level of < 15 µg/L is indicative of absent iron stores.

### Iron metabolism and iron disorders revisited in the hepcidin era [^111Ekzn2]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

Notwithstanding spectacular advances in our understanding of iron metabolism and homeostasis, our diagnostic approach to iron disorders still relies mainly on three historical tests: serum iron, transferrin (or total iron-binding capacity), and ferritin. Transferrin saturation (Tsat), i.e. the ratio of serum iron/total iron-binding capacity, and serum ferritin, coupled with genetic testing and non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging measurements of liver iron content, define the nature and severity of iron loading in both hemochromatosis and thalassemia. Other useful markers are the level of serum soluble transferrin receptor (sTFRC), related to the expansion of erythropoiesis or iron deficiency, the sTFRC/log ferritin ratio for the diagnosis of iron deficiency in inflammation, and the Tsat/log hepcidin ratio to suspect IRIDA.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits can measure serum hepcidin levels, but this does not provide any information additional to serum ferritin, since the two variables are tightly related. Some researchers propose determining hepcidin levels to choose the better therapeutic route of administration of iron supplementation (oral vs. intravenous), as well as its correct timing and schedule. However, besides being subject to circadian oscillations, hepcidin levels change rapidly in response to activating and inhibitory signals, making their measurement useful in only a limited number of conditions. A kit to measure human serum ERFE concentration is available for research purposes.

Iron deficiency is considered to be present if ferritin is less than 30 ng/mL and/or TSAT is less than 20%. It has been considered uncommon in patients with anemia of inflammation (or anemia of chronic disease), but this may be attributable to difficulties using the usual iron parameters in this setting. Because ferritin is an acute-phase reactant in inflammatory states, ferritin levels are often elevated independent of iron status; therefore, a higher cutoff (less than 100 µg/L) is needed to define IDA in these settings. Also in inflammatory states, serum iron and total iron-binding capacity are generally low, limiting the utility of TSAT for diagnosing IDA. This may be explained by the potential for inflammation to dysregulate iron homeostasis.

The key regulator of iron homeostasis is hepcidin, a peptide that is produced primarily by hepatocytes. Increased hepcidin levels decrease iron absorption from the gut and iron release from macrophages and hepatocytes. In inflammatory states, hepcidin levels generally increase as a response to inflammatory cytokines, and the net effect is decreased iron availability for erythropoiesis. Patients with inflammatory disorders and iron deficiency exhibit lower levels of hepcidin than those with "pure" anemia of inflammation. Consequently, hepcidin levels can help distinguish between IDA and other anemias where there is no iron deficiency. The serum hepcidin level may be more reliable than ferritin or TSAT for identifying iron deficiency. For example, in patients discharged from the intensive care unit, a low hepcidin level (less than 20 µg/L) identified iron deficiency in 37% of patients.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, particularly in patients with IBD concerning the management of recurrence, the ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend initiating re-treatment with IV iron as soon as serum ferritin drops below 100 mcg/L or hemoglobin falls below 12–13 g/dL (depending on gender) following successful treatment of IDA with IV iron.

### Repletion of iron stores with the use of oral iron supplementation in patients with systolic heart failure [^115KdR9j]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is associated with reduced functional capacity and increased mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Correction of iron deficiency in HFrEF patients with the use of intravenous iron improves symptoms, quality of life, and exercise performance. However, whether oral iron improves iron stores in HFrEF patients is unknown. We conducted a retrospective study to assess the efficacy of oral iron supplementation in iron-deficient HFrEF patients.

- **Methods and results**: Iron-deficient HFrEF patients with a record of oral iron supplementation and iron studies before and approximately 180 days after supplementation were identified. Iron deficiency was defined as ferritin < 100 ng/mL or as ferritin 100–300 ng/mL with transferrin saturation (Tsat) < 20%. Spearman correlation was performed to assess for treatment responsiveness. In 105 patients, ferritin (from median 39 ng/mL to 75 ng/mL), Tsat (from 10% to 21%), iron (from 34 μg/dL to 69 μg/dL), and hemoglobin (from 10.4 g/dL to 11.6 g/dL) values increased (P < .0001), whereas total iron-binding capacity decreased (from 343 to 313 μg/dL; p = 0.0007) at 164 days after initiation of oral iron supplementation.

- **Conclusions**: In this retrospective study, oral iron supplementation improved iron stores similarly to previously reported results with the use of intravenous iron repletion in HFrEF patients, suggesting that oral iron merits prospective evaluation as an intervention strategy in HFrEF.

### Iron deficiency anemia [^1156qyBS]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in Black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants aged six to 12 months.

Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning. Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); a bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis.

In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended, beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.

The absorption of oral iron salts is significantly impaired if taken with food, reducing bioavailability by up to 75%. This necessitates that iron be taken either in the fasting state first thing in the morning or in periods between meals during the day. It is not clear how soon after oral iron, food can be taken, but the inhibitory effect of tea on iron absorption dissipates within 60 minutes. Despite previous suggestions of benefit, coadministration of vitamin C with oral iron therapy (IRT) is not recommended — a recent large randomized controlled trial confirmed that it neither enhances the hematological response or rate of iron loading, nor diminishes side effects.

Iron absorption from oral preparations is determined by a complex interplay involving total body iron stores, erythropoietic activity of the bone marrow, recent exposure of the small intestine to iron, and systemic inflammation. Hepcidin is the most important inhibitor of iron absorption. Hepcidin levels follow a diurnal pattern and increase after oral iron intake, impairing fractional absorption of subsequent doses.

Short-term studies of iron-depleted but otherwise healthy women have shown that oral doses of 60 mg elemental iron stimulate increased hepcidin levels for the next 24 hours, thus reducing subsequent iron absorption by 35%–45%. As a consequence, the overall absorption of iron from 60 mg of elemental iron taken once a day was similar to that from 60 mg taken two times a day. Therapy with low-dose oral iron has been reported to be successful and safe in elderly patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) — a daily dose of 15 mg of elemental iron achieves therapeutic outcomes without significant adverse effects.

### Marginal iron deficiency without anemia impairs aerobic adaptation among previously untrained women [^113Tx9Hu]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency without anemia has been shown to reduce both muscle tissue oxidative capacity and endurance in animals. However, the consequences of iron deficiency in humans remain unclear.

- **Objective**: We investigated the effects of iron supplementation on adaptation to aerobic training among marginally iron-depleted women. We hypothesized that iron supplementation for six weeks would significantly improve iron status and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) after four weeks of aerobic training.

- **Design**: Forty-one untrained, iron-depleted, non-anemic women were randomly assigned to receive either 50 mg FeSO4 or a placebo twice daily for six weeks in a double-blind trial. All subjects trained on cycle ergometers five days per week for four weeks, beginning on week three of the study.

- **Results**: Six weeks of iron supplementation significantly improved serum ferritin and serum transferrin receptor (sTfR) concentrations and transferrin saturation without affecting hemoglobin concentrations or hematocrit. Average VO2max and maximal respiratory exchange ratio improved in both the placebo and iron groups after training; however, the iron group experienced significantly greater improvements in VO2max. Both iron-status and fitness outcomes were analyzed after stratifying by baseline sTfR concentration (> and ≤ 8.0 mg/L), which showed that the previously observed treatment effects were due to iron-status and fitness improvements among subjects with poor baseline iron status.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings strongly suggest that iron deficiency without anemia but with elevated sTfR status impairs aerobic adaptation among previously untrained women.

### Jesduvroq [^115WBDrq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Pre-treatment and on-treatment evaluations of anemia, iron stores, and liver tests**: Correct and exclude other causes of anemia (e.g. vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding) before initiating Jesduvroq. Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment with Jesduvroq. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 ng/ml or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of therapy. Assess serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin prior to initiation. Repeat the liver tests if the patient develops signs or symptoms consistent with liver disease during treatment.

- **Important dosing information**: Individualize dosing and use the lowest dose of Jesduvroq sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions. Do not target a hemoglobin higher than 11 g/dL. Jesduvroq can be taken with or without food and without regard to concomitant administration of iron or phosphate binders. Ensure Jesduvroq is swallowed whole; tablets should not be cut, crushed, or chewed. It can be administered without regard to the timing or type of dialysis. If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible, unless it coincides with the next dose.

### Data-driven physiologic thresholds for iron deficiency associated with hematologic decline [^111vFXg5]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency contributes to approximately 50% of anemia prevalence worldwide, but reference intervals for iron status tests are not optimized for anemia diagnosis. To address this limitation, we identified the serum ferritin (SF) thresholds associated with hematologic decline in iron-deficient patients and the SF thresholds from which an SF increase was associated with hematologic improvement. Paired red blood cell and SF measurements were analyzed from two adult cohorts at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), from 2008–2011 (N = 48,409), and 2016–2018 (N = 10,042).

Inter-patient measurements in the first cohort were used to define optimal SF thresholds based on the physiologic relationship between SF and red cell measurements. Intra-patient measurements (1–26 weeks apart) in the second cohort were used to identify SF thresholds from which an SF increase was associated with an increase in red cell measurements. The identified optimal SF thresholds varied with age, sex, and red cell measure. Thresholds associated with a ~5% decline in red cell index were typically in the range of 10–25 ng/mL.

Thresholds for younger women (18–45 years) were ~5 ng/mL lower than for older women (60–95 years), and ~10 ng/mL lower than for men. Thresholds from which a subsequent increase in SF was associated with a concomitant increase in red cell measure showed similar patterns: younger women had lower thresholds (~15 ng/mL) than older women (~25 ng/mL), or men (~35 ng/mL). These results suggest that diagnostic accuracy may be improved by setting different SF thresholds for younger women, older women, and men.

### The effect of alcohol consumption on the prevalence of iron overload, iron deficiency, and iron deficiency anemia [^115Ag2t1]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Our aim was to investigate the relationship between alcohol consumption and iron overload, iron deficiency, or iron deficiency anemia in the U.S. population.

- **Methods**: Adult participants of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey who did not consume alcohol (n = 8,839) were compared with participants who consumed 1 to 2 alcoholic drinks/day (n = 915) during the preceding 12 months. We examined the following markers of iron overload: elevated serum transferrin-iron saturation (TS) level (> 45%, > 50%, and > 60%), elevated serum ferritin level (> 300, > 400, > 500, and > 600 ng/mL), and combinations of both elevated serum TS and ferritin levels. Iron deficiency was defined as the presence of at least 2 of the following: serum ferritin level < 1.24 micromol/L. Iron deficiency anemia was defined as the presence of both iron deficiency and anemia.

- **Results**: Compared with nondrinkers, the prevalence of all markers of iron overload was significantly elevated among those who consumed > 2 alcoholic drinks/day after adjusting for potential confounders. Consumption of any amount of alcohol was associated with a 40% reduction in the risk of iron deficiency anemia.

- **Conclusions**: Consumption of up to 2 alcoholic drinks/day seems to be associated with reduced risk of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia without a concomitant increase in the risk of iron overload. Consumption of > 2 alcoholic drinks/day is associated with a significant elevation in the risk of iron overload.

### Monoclonal immunoglobulin with antitransferrin activity: A rare cause of hypersideremia with increased transferrin saturation [^111kp4HK]. Blood (2007). Low credibility.

Two unusual but similar cases of very high serum iron, extremely high transferrin concentrations (5.4 to 6.5 g/L), and increased transferrin saturation are reported. No anemia or microcytosis was observed. The ferritin concentration remained within the normal range, and no iron overload was observed. In one case, the in vivo half-life of 59Fe-labeled transferrin was shown to be prolonged (206 minutes versus 75 minutes for controls). In both patients, a monoclonal IgG was observed in the serum. The association between serum transferrin and monoclonal IgG was demonstrated by Western blot analysis and affinity chromatography.

We suggest that the transferrin bound to the monoclonal IgG molecule has a prolonged half-life in the circulation, leading to high transferrin concentrations, and that the increased serum iron values prevent the onset of anemia. The antitransferrin activity of the monoclonal antibody should be added to the list of situations accounting for elevated serum iron with elevated transferrin saturation.

### Intravenous iron therapy for non-anaemic, iron-deficient adults [^115Y5XQc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies and has a number of physiological manifestations. Early or non-anaemic iron deficiency can result in fatigue and diminished exercise capacity. Oral iron preparations have a high incidence of intolerable side effects and are ineffective in certain forms of iron deficiency. Consequently, intravenous iron preparations are increasingly used in the treatment of non-anaemic iron deficiency. The newer, more stable iron preparations in particular purport to have a lower incidence of side effects and are now used across a range of different patient populations.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of intravenous iron therapy in the treatment of adults with non-anaemic iron deficiency.

- **Search methods**: On 18 October 2019, we electronically searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two further databases, and two trial registries. We hand-searched the references of full-text extracted studies and contacted relevant study authors for additional data.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials that compared any intravenous iron preparation to placebo in adults. We excluded other forms of comparison such as oral iron versus placebo, intramuscular iron versus placebo, or intravenous iron studies where other iron preparations were used as the comparator. We also excluded studies involving erythropoietin therapy or obstetric populations.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors screened references for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We resolved differences in opinion.

### European consensus on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases [^112puEXA]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2015). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for ulcerative colitis, specifically concerning the management of anemia, the ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend considering the administration of IV iron as first-line therapy. This recommendation targets patients with clinically active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who have previously shown intolerance to oral iron, have hemoglobin levels below 10 g/dL, or require erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs).

### Discriminating between iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease using traditional indices of iron status vs transferrin receptor concentration [^1155i1DV]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

We compared the ability of soluble serum transferrin receptor (TfR) concentration, quantified using the R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) enzyme-linked immunosorbent TfR assay, with other, more traditional indicators of iron status. These include total iron binding capacity (TIBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), percent transferrin saturation (%TS), RBC distribution width (RDW), and serum iron concentration (SIC) for discriminating between patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) or anemia of chronic disease (ACD).

The TfR concentration was determined in 72 serum samples selected from men and non-pregnant women classified biochemically based on ferritin concentration as having IDA (n = 41) or ACD (n = 31). Using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the diagnostic accuracy of the various indicators of iron status that we evaluated for discriminating between IDA and ACD decreased in the following order: TIBC > TfR > MCV > (%TS = RDW) > SIC. There was no significant difference between the diagnostic accuracy of TIBC and TfR.

Thus, the routine measurement of TfR offers no advantage over TIBC for discriminating between people with biochemically defined IDA or ACD.

### Serum ferritin as an indicator of iron status: What do we need to know [^111C8V5M]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Determination of iron status in pregnancy and in young children is essential for both clinical and public health practice. Clinical diagnosis of iron deficiency (ID) through sampling of bone marrow to identify the absence of body iron stores is impractical in most cases. Serum ferritin (SF) concentrations are the most commonly deployed indicator for determining ID, and low SF concentrations reflect a state of iron depletion. However, there is considerable variation in SF cutoffs recommended by different expert groups to diagnose ID. Moreover, the cutoffs used in different clinical laboratories are heterogeneous.

There are few studies of diagnostic test accuracy to establish the sensitivity and specificity of SF compared with key gold standards such as absent bone marrow iron stores, increased intestinal iron absorption, and hemoglobin response to SF among non-inflamed, outpatient populations. The limited data available suggest the commonly recommended SF cutoff of 30 years ago does not reflect ethnic or geographic diversity and was performed in an era for which laboratory methods no longer reflect present practice.

Future studies to define the appropriate SF cutoffs are urgently needed and would also provide an opportunity to compare this indicator with other established and emerging iron indexes. In addition, future work would benefit from a focus on elucidating cutoffs and indexes.

### Critical re-evaluation of the identification of iron deficiency states and effective iron repletion strategies in patients with chronic heart failure [^111Ws2Lt]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). High credibility.

According to guidelines, iron deficiency is defined by a serum ferritin level of less than 100 ng/mL or a transferrin saturation (TSAT) of less than 20% if the serum ferritin level is between 100–299 μg/L. These criteria were developed to encourage the use of intravenous iron as an adjunct to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in the treatment of renal anemia. However, in patients with heart failure, these criteria are not supported by any pathophysiological or clinical evidence that they identify an absolute or functional iron deficiency state.

A low baseline TSAT — but not serum ferritin level — appears to be a reliable indicator of the effect of intravenous iron to reduce major heart failure events. In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), intravenous iron decreased the risk of cardiovascular death or total heart failure hospitalization in patients with a TSAT of less than 20% (risk ratio 0.67 [0.49–0.92]) but not in patients with a TSAT of 20% or more (risk ratio 0.99 [0.74–1.30]), with the magnitude of risk reduction being proportional to the severity of hypoferraemia.

Patients who were enrolled in clinical trials solely because they had a serum ferritin level of less than 100 μg/L showed no significant benefit on heart failure outcomes, and it is noteworthy that serum ferritin levels of 20–300 μg/L lie entirely within the range of normal values for healthy adults. Guidelines reflect the eligibility criteria of clinical trials, which inadvertently adopted unvalidated criteria to define iron deficiency. Reliance on these guidelines would lead to the treatment of many patients who are not iron deficient (serum ferritin level less than 100 μg/L).

### Association of anemia with health-related quality of life and survival: A large population-based cohort study [^116xLgTE]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

Anemia was defined using the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria as a hemoglobin concentration of 340 nmol/L. This definition was applied specifically when the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was greater than 30 mL/min. This is because methylmalonic acid levels can be elevated in individuals with severely impaired renal function. In cases where nutrient deficiency was not evident, subjects with anemia were evaluated for other underlying causes.

Subjects were classified as having anemia related to chronic renal disease if their eGFR was less than 30 mL/min. The Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration (CDK-EPI) formula was used for this classification.

### Anemia, iron deficiency, and iron deficiency anemia in 12–36-mo-old children from low-income families [^114M3C4q]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common nutritional deficiency in the world and remains relatively common in at-risk groups in the United States. The actual prevalence of anemia, ID, and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in California remains unclear.

- **Objective**: The objective was to determine the prevalence of anemia, low iron stores, ID, and IDA in children participating in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) population, and to assess the value of using hemoglobin to predict ID.

- **Design**: This was a cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of 12–36-month-old children from WIC clinics in two California counties.

- **Results**: The prevalence of anemia was 11.1% (hemoglobin less than 11 g/dL). Prevalence of ID based on low serum ferritin concentrations (≥ 8.4 or > 10.0 µg/mL) and transferrin saturation (≥ 2 abnormal iron measures) were 16.2% and 8.8%, and of IDA (ID with low hemoglobin) were 3.4% and 3.2% on the basis of study- and literature-determined cutoffs, respectively. Hemoglobin concentration was used to predict study- and literature-determined ID based on receiver operating characteristic curves. The sensitivity of low hemoglobin in predicting study- and literature-determined ID was low (23.2% and 40.0%, respectively).

- **Conclusions**: Anemia and ID were prevalent in this WIC sample.

### How we diagnose and treat iron deficiency anemia [^1156eU7K]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

It is estimated that one-third of the world's population is anemic, with the majority of cases due to iron deficiency (ID). In adults, ID is associated with fatigue in the absence of anemia, restless legs syndrome, and pica. In neonates, it can lead to delayed growth and development. Among adolescents, ID is linked to declines in learning and the emergence of behavioral abnormalities.

In the absence of a clear cause, searching for a source of bleeding is indicated. No single test is definitive for diagnosing ID unless there is low serum ferritin or low percent transferrin saturation with an elevated total iron-binding capacity. Oral iron is considered the frontline therapy except in conditions such as gastric bypass, heavy uterine bleeding, inflammatory bowel disease, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Oral iron often has unpleasant side effects, resulting in low patient adherence. For patients who are intolerant of, or unresponsive to, oral iron, intravenous (IV) administration is the preferred route.

- **Newer formulations**: While early formulations were associated with a high incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), newer formulations are much safer, with SAEs occurring very infrequently. Full replacement doses can be administered in a matter of minutes to a few hours. Nonetheless, there remains reluctance to use IV iron due to misunderstandings about the safety of available formulations.

- **IV iron safety**: IV iron is safe and effective in all clinical circumstances, including pregnancy. The preponderance of published evidence suggests IV iron therapy is underutilized, and we believe that IV iron should be prioritized in the treatment of ID.

### Iron-deficiency anemia [^115TJZBu]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). High credibility.

Iron-deficiency anemia can be associated with a variety of symptoms and conditions, including anemia secondary to blood loss, frequent blood donation, and cravings for non-nutritive substances, such as ice, dirt, or starch. Additional symptoms may include a sore and red tongue, hypochromic anemia, fatigue, loss of appetite, and an increased serum soluble transferrin receptor.

- **Demographic and clinical characteristics**:
	- Decreased mean corpuscular volume (MCV), infants, female sex, weakness, increased platelet count, lightheadedness, increased red cell distribution width (RDW), pregnancy, dizziness, tachycardia, cold skin, and pale skin.
	- Heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, dyspnea, headache, vegetarianism, brittle nails, and lack of iron in the diet are also noted.

- **Pathophysiology**:
	- Sideroblastic anemia, inability to absorb iron, chest pain, koilonychia, asthenia, and decreased reticulocyte count.

### Iron deficiency in young basketball players: Is a 100 μg/L ferritin cut-off appropriate for iron supplementation? Results of a randomized placebo-controlled study [^111TwXSA]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) is one of the most common contributing factors that may affect sports performance, although screening, diagnosis, and supplementation have not yet been standardized related to athletes. Compared to the general population, athletes have a higher demand for oxygen transport and energy production, in which iron plays a key role. For basketball players, both good cardiovascular endurance and mental concentration are necessary for success. The dynamic part of basketball playing requires a good aerobic capacity. However, several other skills are required to make sudden changes of direction at high speed, such as strength, power, and agility. In this combined (endurance and non‐endurance) team sport, although the significance of an optimal nutritional status is potentially highly important, relevant studies are not yet available.

The main causes of ID are the higher iron demand and loss, coupled with lower intake and absorption. In athletes, all these mechanisms are pronounced due to extreme physical burden and special nutrition habits, including the intake of supplements, vitamins, and minerals. Young and/or female athletes are at a higher risk of ID as a result of increased iron requirements due to menstruation, growth, and development. Therefore, it is essential to diagnose ID in the preclinical stage, called iron deficiency without anemia (IDNA), to prevent performance decrement. ID in female athletes has been studied extensively, though there are only limited data to indicate that IDNA also occurs in young male athletes. There is no guideline for iron supplementation in these cases.

### High serum transferrin receptor level in anemia of chronic disorders indicates coexistent iron deficiency [^115LDMYR]. American Journal of Hematology (2003). Low credibility.

Blood transferrin receptor (TR) level is largely determined by the quantum of erythropoiesis and by the intracellular iron content of the cells of the erythroid lineage. Hence, a high serum TR level has been found to be useful in distinguishing iron deficiency anemia (IDA) from anemia of chronic disorders (ACD). To examine its potential role in diagnosing concomitant iron deficiency in ACD, we determined serum TR levels in 130 cases of ACD, 25 cases of IDA, and 40 normal adults. As expected, all patients with IDA had significantly higher serum TR levels compared to the normal subjects (4.2–19.2 microg/dL vs. 1.3–3.0 microg/dL) (P < 0.002).

In 11 out of 25 cases of IDA, the total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) was in the normal range, although bone marrow iron stores were absent and serum TR levels were high. This finding highlights the superiority of TR level in diagnosing iron deficiency compared to TIBC. Although 54% (70 out of 130) of ACD patients had normal or low serum TR levels (0.9–3.0 microg/dL) as expected, in 46% (60 out of 130) of ACD patients, serum TR levels were high (3.2–11.0 microg/dL).

Mean corpuscular volume, red cell distribution width, and transferrin saturation were significantly lower (P < 0.001) in the latter group of patients compared to the former, and these parameters resembled those in IDA patients. Additionally, serum iron was lower and TIBC was higher in this group of ACD patients compared to those with normal or low serum TR. All these features point to an "IDA-like" profile of ACD patients with high TR and support the possibility of coexistent iron deficiency.

### Iron deficiency in adults: A review [^111vsMJh]. JAMA (2025). High credibility.

Absolute iron deficiency, defined as low iron stores with or without anemia, affects approximately 2 billion people worldwide and 14% of adults in the US. Iron-deficiency anemia, defined as low hemoglobin due to low iron stores, affects approximately 1.2 billion people worldwide, including 10 million in the US.

Absolute iron deficiency progresses from low iron stores to iron-deficiency anemia. Individuals with nonanemic iron deficiency or iron-deficiency anemia may be asymptomatic or experience fatigue, irritability, depression, difficulty concentrating, restless legs syndrome (32%-40%), pica (40%-50%), dyspnea, lightheadedness, exercise intolerance, and worsening heart failure (HF). Symptom prevalences vary depending on age, comorbidities (e.g. chronic kidney disease [CKD], HF), and severity and rate of development of iron deficiency.

The most common causes of iron deficiency are bleeding (menstrual, gastrointestinal), impaired iron absorption (atrophic gastritis, celiac disease, bariatric surgical procedures), inadequate dietary iron intake, and pregnancy. In high-income countries, approximately 38% of nonpregnant, reproductive-age women have iron deficiency without anemia, and about 13% have iron-deficiency anemia. During the third trimester of pregnancy, iron deficiency affects up to 84% of pregnant women, based on data from high-income countries.

Additional risk factors include the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD [13%-90%]), and other chronic inflammatory conditions, such as CKD (24%-85%) and HF (37%-61%).

### Effect of low-dose ferrous sulfate vs iron polysaccharide complex on hemoglobin concentration in young children with nutritional iron-deficiency anemia: A randomized clinical trial [^117QVBmY]. JAMA (2017). Low credibility.

Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) affects millions of persons worldwide and is associated with impaired neurodevelopment in infants and children. Ferrous sulfate is the most commonly prescribed oral iron, despite iron polysaccharide complex possibly being better tolerated.

- **Objective**: To compare the effect of ferrous sulfate with iron polysaccharide complex on hemoglobin concentration in infants and children with nutritional IDA.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Double-blind, superiority randomized clinical trial of infants and children aged 9 to 48 months with nutritional IDA (assessed by history and laboratory criteria). The study was conducted in an outpatient hematology clinic at a US tertiary care hospital from September 2013 through November 2015; a 12-week follow-up ended in January 2016.

- **Interventions**: Participants received 3 mg/kg of elemental iron once daily as either ferrous sulfate drops or iron polysaccharide complex drops for 12 weeks.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was the change in hemoglobin over 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included the complete resolution of IDA (defined as hemoglobin concentration > 11 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume > 70 fL, reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent > 25 pg, serum ferritin level > 15 ng/mL, and total iron-binding capacity < 425 μg/dL at the 12-week visit). Other measures included changes in serum ferritin level and total iron-binding capacity, and adverse effects.

- **Results**: Of 80 randomized infants and children (median age, 22 months; 55% male; 61% Hispanic white; 40 per group), 59 completed the trial (28 [70%] in the ferrous sulfate group; 31 [78%] in the iron polysaccharide group).

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^111etdk1]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis is defined as an MCV above the upper limit of normal for age, a parameter that varies from infants to adults. Increased MCV in an automatic complete blood count (CBC) may be artifactual, such as with marked compensatory reticulocytosis in response to anemia; reticulocytes are normally larger than mature circulating red cells (up to 126 fL for healthy adults). They can be even larger in conditions of stress erythropoiesis, raising the perceived MCV of the total erythrocytes (mature and non-mature) in automated CBC measurements. Cold agglutinins may also cause spurious macrocytosis due to cell counting errors of red cell aggregates. Obtaining the reticulocyte count and evaluating the blood smear are always valuable first steps to confirm true macrocytosis and start the diagnostic evaluation.

True macrocytosis, typically associated with anemia, can have numerous causes based on clinical context, encompassing both acquired and congenital disorders. The most common pathophysiologic mechanisms involved are:

- **Impaired DNA synthesis**: In the erythroblast nuclei during terminal erythropoiesis, causing megaloblastic bone marrow changes because of nuclear-cytoplasmic asynchrony.
- **Altered red cell hydration**: Increasing cell volume.
- **Altered composition of the lipid bilayer**: Affects the RBC membrane structure.

Impaired DNA synthesis in megaloblastic anemia is caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, both being critical components in the thymidine synthesis pathway. Deficiency of folate and/or vitamin B12 occurs either due to dietary restrictions or malabsorption syndromes such as short-gut syndrome.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease - a practical approach [^1116hpFo]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves multiple contributing factors. The two most prevalent etiologies are IDA, which arises from iron deficiency due to mucosal ulcerations leading to blood loss, compromised iron absorption, and reduced dietary intake; and anemia of chronic disease (ACD), first described by Cartwright in 1946. ACD is characterized by normal or reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV), diminished serum iron, decreased total iron binding capacity (TIBC), normal to elevated serum ferritin levels, and reticuloendothelial system (RES) stores that are elevated relative to total body iron. Although less common, vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, and drug-induced anemia caused by medications such as sulfasalazine, thiopurines, methotrexate, and calcineurin inhibitors should also be evaluated.

The human body stores approximately 3–4 grams (40–50 mg/kg) of iron. Daily iron losses, approximately 1–2 mg, occur due to the shedding of epithelial cells from the skin, gastrointestinal tract, bile ducts, urinary tract, and blood loss during menstruation. Mammalian iron homeostasis is primarily regulated through iron absorption in the duodenum, and to a lesser extent, in the proximal jejunum, regardless of health or inflammatory states. This process is tightly controlled by the hepcidin protein.

Hepcidin serves as the master regulator of iron homeostasis in IBD. Its gene expression increases during inflammation, illustrating its critical role in maintaining iron balance in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory contexts.

### Monoferric [^115wwb21]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Monoferric for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) were evaluated in two randomized, open-label, actively controlled clinical trials, involving a total of 3050 patients with IDA from various etiologies.

- **Clinical studies**:
	- **Trial 1**: Included patients with IDA who had intolerance to oral iron, an unsatisfactory response to oral iron, or a clinical need for rapid repletion of iron stores.
	- **Trial 2**: Included patients with IDA who had non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD-CKD).

In these two 8-week trials, patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive treatment with Monoferric or iron sucrose. Monoferric was administered intravenously as a single dose of 1000 mg.

- **Iron deficiency anemia in patients with intolerance or unsatisfactory response to oral iron**:
	- Trial 1 (NCT02940886) enrolled 1512 adult patients with IDA due to various causes, who showed documented intolerance or lack of response to oral iron, or had screening hemoglobin (Hb) levels sufficiently low to necessitate rapid iron repletion. Patients, all adults aged ≥ 18 years with baseline Hb ≤ 11 g/dL, transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20%, and serum ferritin < 100 ng/mL, were eligible for enrollment. The median age of patients was 44 years, with an age range of 18 to 91 years, and 89% were women. The efficacy of Monoferric was established based on the change in Hb from baseline to week 8, demonstrating non-inferiority for the change in Hb from baseline to week 8.

### Threshold ferritin and hepcidin concentrations indicating early iron deficiency in young women based on upregulation of iron absorption [^114BVQ7A]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). High credibility.

- **Determination of iron absorption**: In all studies, we measured iron absorption after an overnight fast (no food intake after 8 PM, no drink intake after 12 AM) using a standardized stable-isotope technique, which measured the incorporation of oral 57 Fe-, 58 Fe-, or 54 Fe into erythrocytes 14 days after administration. We measured height and weight using standardized methods and collected an overnight fasting venous blood sample in the morning to measure ferritin, hepcidin, and C-reactive protein, either at baseline screening (8 studies) or just before meal administration (16 studies). The test meals (see Supplementary Material) were administered between 7 and 9 AM under standardized conditions and close supervision. All meals were extrinsically labelled with ferrous sulfate, added just before feeding. No intake of food and fluids was allowed for at least 3 hours after test meal intake. Fourteen days after test meal administration, we collected another fasting morning venous blood sample for isotopic measurements.

- **Blood analyses**: All hematological and biochemical measurements were performed at the time of each study. We measured hemoglobin on the day of venipuncture using a Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, Indianapolis, USA) or Hemocue (HemoCue AB, Ängelholm, Sweden). Plasma was separated by centrifugation and stored at −20 °C until analysis. We measured hepcidin using an immunoassay (DRG GmbH, Marburg, Germany). Ferritin (n = 368 observations) and C-reactive protein (n = 322 observations) concentrations were measured using a multiplex sandwich ELISA.

### Screening, diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency in chronic heart failure: Putting the 2016 European Society of Cardiology heart failure guidelines into clinical practice [^114L59rA]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Practical recommendations on the screening and diagnosis of iron deficiency in patients with heart failure: The current 2016 ESC HF guidelines recommend that evaluation of iron status should be considered in the diagnostic work-up of all newly diagnosed HF patients (class of recommendation I, level of evidence C). A practical recommendation of the working group is that iron status should also be evaluated in patients with existing CHF, particularly if they are symptomatic despite receiving optimal background HF medications. In addition, as part of routine follow-up, consideration should be given to the re-evaluation of iron status 1–2 times per year, as well as after hospitalization for HF.

Ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) are widely available blood markers for evaluating iron status, and their use for the diagnosis of iron deficiency is recommended by the 2016 ESC HF guidelines. Ferritin is an intracellular iron-storage protein secreted by iron-storing tissues (e.g. liver and reticuloendothelial system). Serum ferritin concentrations are a surrogate marker of stored iron quantity. TSAT, defined as the percentage of transferrin that has iron bound to it, is used as a marker of the availability of circulating iron to supply metabolizing cells. TSAT value is calculated by dividing the serum iron concentration by the total iron-binding capacity (TIBC).

The 2016 ESC HF guidelines recommend treating iron deficiency based on a serum ferritin level < 100 µg/L, or 100–299 µg/L when TSAT < 20%. Two different cut-offs are used because ferritin levels may become elevated in the pre.

### Dynamic control of hepatic Plasmodium numbers by hepcidin despite elevated liver iron during iron supplementation [^116jjGdC]. Microbes and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in malaria-endemic areas poses challenges, as iron supplementation increases malaria risk while malaria decreases iron absorption. We measured the influence of hepcidin expression and non-heme iron during iron supplementation on hepatic Plasmodium berghei numbers in anemic and non-anemic mice. Despite elevated hepatic non-heme iron on a high iron diet, elevated hepcidin expression is associated with less parasite bioavailable iron and lower hepatic parasite loads in anemic, iron-deficient mice after both two and six weeks of supplementation. A marginal trend to lower hepatic parasite numbers was observed in non-anemic, iron-replete mice.

In a transgenic model of severe anemia, mice with a deletion in Sec15l1, which reportedly have normal liver iron and normal hepcidin expression, showed no changes in liver parasite numbers, blood stage numbers, or outcomes in the lethal Plasmodium yoelii model. In summary, during iron supplementation, the lower hepatic malaria numbers are regulated more by hepcidin than by the absolute level of non-heme hepatic iron.

### Are hematinic deficiencies the cause of anemia in chronic heart failure [^111wu8WB]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Anemia in chronic heart failure (CHF) is common, varying in prevalence between 14.4% and 55%, and is more frequent in patients with more severe heart failure. Patients with CHF who have anemia have a poorer quality of life, higher hospital admission rates, and reduced exercise tolerance. We explored the relation between hematinic levels and hemoglobin (Hb) levels and exercise tolerance in a group of patients with CHF.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from 173 patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), 123 patients with symptoms of heart failure but preserved left ventricular (LV) systolic function ("diastolic dysfunction"), and 58 control subjects of similar age. Each underwent echocardiography, a 6-minute walk test, and blood tests for renal function and Hb and hematinic levels (vitamin B12, iron, and folate). We classified patients as having no anemia (Hb level > 12.5 g/dL), mild anemia (Hb level from 11.5–12.5 g/dL), or moderate anemia (Hb level < 11.5 g/dL).

- **Results**: Of patients with LVSD, 16% had moderate anemia and 19% had mild anemia. Of patients with preserved LV function, 16% had moderate anemia and 17% had mild anemia. Four control subjects had a Hb level < 12.5 g/dL. Of all patients, 6% were vitamin B12 deficient, 13% were iron deficient, and 8% were folate deficient. There was no difference between patients with LVSD and the diastolic dysfunction group. In patients with LVSD, the average Hb level was lower in New York Heart Association class III than classes II and I. The distance walked in 6 minutes correlated with Hb level in both groups.

### Clinical utility of the reticulocyte hemoglobin content in the diagnosis of iron deficiency [^111svRYK]. Blood (2002). Low credibility.

Determination of the reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) provides an early measure of functional iron deficiency because reticulocytes are the earliest erythrocytes released into blood and circulate for only 1 to 2 days. The CHr in 78 patients undergoing bone marrow examination was measured to assess its clinical utility for the diagnosis of iron deficiency. Twenty-eight patients were identified as iron deficient based on the lack of stainable iron in the aspirate. The diagnostic power of CHr is limited in patients with high mean cellular volume (MCV) or red cell disorders such as thalassemia. However, when patients with MCV greater than 100 fL are excluded, receiver operator curve analysis of CHr, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and MCV demonstrates that CHr has the highest overall sensitivity and specificity of these peripheral blood tests for predicting the absence of bone marrow iron stores.

### Iron status of the free-living, elderly Framingham Heart Study cohort: an iron-replete population with a high prevalence of elevated iron stores [^1166TELi]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Although iron deficiency commonly occurs in vulnerable groups such as women of reproductive age, infants, and children, less is known about the iron nutriture of the elderly. The objective of this study was to evaluate the iron status of a noninstitutionalized, elderly US population. There were two concerns unique to the elderly: the potential confounding effects of chronic disease on iron measures and the increased occurrence of elevated iron stores.

Multiple iron measures, including serum ferritin (SF), transferrin saturation, mean cell volume, and hemoglobin, were used to evaluate the prevalence of iron deficiency (ID), iron deficiency anemia (IDA), and other measures of iron nutriture in 1,016 elderly white Americans aged 67–96 years from the Framingham Heart Study. "Diseased" subjects were defined as those with possibly pathologically altered iron measures due to inflammation, infection, elevated liver enzymes, hereditary hemochromatosis, or cancer. The effect of altered iron status on various prevalence estimates was assessed.

The results indicated that the elderly subjects had a low prevalence of ID (2.7%), IDA (1.2%), and depleted iron stores (3%; SF > 300 µg/L in men and SF > 200 µg/L in women), with only 1% attributable to chronic disease. The prevalence of ID, IDA, and depleted iron stores was unaffected by the presence of chronic disease.

In conclusion, the Framingham Heart Study cohort is an iron-replete elderly population with a high prevalence of elevated iron stores.

### Injury-associated anemia and iron homeostasis following orthopaedic trauma: a prospective observational study of 844 patients [^113Kinmo]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2025). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of injury-associated anemia and functional iron deficiency following operative fracture care.

- **Methods**: Design was a prospective cohort study. The setting was a Level 1 academic trauma center. All operative fracture patients who presented between April 2022 and August 2023 were screened.

- **Outcome measure and comparisons**: Laboratory tests for anemia were performed on post-operative day one. This included complete blood count, serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), percent transferrin saturation (TSAT), transferrin, and ferritin levels. Values were enumerated to capture the previously unknown incidence of injury-associated anemia.

The results indicated that 844 patients were screened following operative fracture management (mean age: 52 years, SD 22; 58% male). Injury-associated anemia was present in 94.7% of the 844 eligible patients, with a median hemoglobin level of 10.0 (IQR: 8.5–11.1). Of the patients with anemia, 72.5% did not reach transfusion requirements, with hemoglobin levels greater than 8.0 in 89.8% of patients overall and 96.9% in patients with low levels in all other iron studies. Patients with fractures in multiple extremities demonstrated a 52% higher odds of elevated ferritin levels than patients with isolated fractures after controlling for transfusions and sex (adjusted OR 1.52, 95% CI: 1.06–2.17, p = 0.02).

### Feraheme [^114BXkfB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Feraheme for the episodic treatment of iron deficiency anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) were assessed in three randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trials, namely CKD Trial 1 (Trial 62745–7, NCT 00255437), CKD Trial 2 (Trial 62745–6, NCT 00255424), and CKD Trial 3 (Trial 62745–5, NCT 00233597). In these trials, Feraheme was administered as a rapid intravenous injection, a method no longer approved. Each trial also included an uncontrolled follow-up phase, where patients with persistent iron deficiency anemia could receive two additional 510 mg intravenous injections of Feraheme.

- **Major efficacy results**: The primary outcomes from the controlled phases of each study are presented in the associated data table, illustrating efficacy [Note: Table 5 is referenced but not provided here for context].

In all three trials, patients with CKD and iron deficiency anemia were randomized to receive either Feraheme or oral iron. Feraheme was given as two 510 mg undiluted intravenous injections, while oral iron (ferrous fumarate) was administered at a total daily dose of 200 mg elemental iron for 21 days. The major trial outcomes assessed the change in hemoglobin levels from baseline to Day 35. CKD Trial 1 and Trial 2 enrolled patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD, whereas CKD Trial 3 focused on patients undergoing hemodialysis.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: International expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^114G1cVV]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Our review of international guidelines available for chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) reveals no consensus on practical guidance for diagnosing iron deficiency independent of anemia. However, only some guidelines recognize iron deficiency as a standalone condition. It is difficult to establish whether this is due to a lack of awareness of iron deficiency or an intentional omission. Iron deficiency can be simply diagnosed with routinely available blood tests measuring serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT). Yet, guidelines often lack agreement on test cut-off values for these parameters. Serum ferritin levels are sensitive to inflammation, and some guidelines recommend assessment of chronic inflammation according to inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. However, there is little consensus across many conditions on when this should be measured. Should it be standard practice for all patients, or measured only when serum ferritin is > 30 µg L−1 or if patients are symptomatic? Moreover, no standard CRP cut-off values are provided. Although a CRP level of 5 mg L−1 is the most common threshold, this is not recognized in most guidelines.

- **Iron deficiency anemia coverage**: There is more guideline coverage for iron deficiency anemia than for iron deficiency.

### Iron deficiency and heart failure: Diagnostic dilemmas and therapeutic perspectives [^114JLXDd]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Circulating iron bound to transferrin, or total iron binding capacity (TIBC), reflects the amount of iron available for metabolizing target cells. Importantly, neither serum iron nor serum transferrin alone should be used as biomarkers of iron status. Instead, transferrin saturation (Tsat), the percentage of transferrin that has iron bound to it (calculated as the ratio of serum iron to TIBC × 100), is recommended. Reduced Tsat (< 20%) is considered a surrogate for insufficient iron available for metabolizing cells. With malnutrition accompanying chronic diseases, liver synthesis and blood transferrin levels may be low, which can artificially increase Tsat disproportionate to the iron content.

When serum ferritin is between 100 and 300 µg/L, a range frequently observed in patients with chronic diseases and pro-inflammatory activation, the diagnosis of iron deficiency (ID) becomes more complex. Such values are usually associated with normal or slightly increased intracellular iron stores, making the diagnosis of absolute ID difficult. If there is restricted iron delivery to target cells, indicated by reduced Tsat (< 20%), functional ID can be diagnosed.

For patients undergoing surgery with iron deficiency anemia, the ESAIC 2023 guidelines recommend allowing 1–2 weeks after parenteral stimulation of erythropoiesis for cases with uncomplicated anemia. In cases of oral correction of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and more complex causes of anemia, it is advised to allow 3–8 weeks.

### European consensus on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases [^115gs2r8]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2015). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining a comprehensive anemia workup if hemoglobin levels are below normal. This workup should include at least red blood cell (RBC) indices, such as red cell distribution width and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration.

- **Extended workup**: Include serum concentrations of vitamin B12, folic acid, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), soluble transferrin receptor, creatinine, and urea.

### Iron deficiency predicts impaired exercise capacity in patients with systolic chronic heart failure [^1148Cfv6]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Iron is an indispensable element of hemoglobin, myoglobin, and cytochromes. Beyond erythropoiesis, it is involved in oxidative metabolism and cellular energetics. Hence, iron deficiency (ID) is anticipated to limit exercise capacity. We investigated whether ID predicted exercise intolerance in patients with systolic chronic heart failure (CHF).

- **Methods and results**: We prospectively studied 443 patients with stable systolic CHF (age 54 ± 10 years, males 90%, ejection fraction 26 ± 7%, New York Heart Association Class I/II/III/IV 49/188/180/26). ID was defined as serum ferritin < 100 μg/L or serum ferritin 100–300 μg/L with serum transferrin saturation < 20%. Exercise capacity was expressed as peak oxygen consumption (VO₂) and ventilatory response to exercise (VE-VCO₂ slope). ID was present in 35 ± 4% (± 95% confidence interval) of patients with systolic CHF. Those with ID had reduced peak VO₂ and increased VE-VCO₂ slope compared to subjects without ID (peak VO₂: 13.3 ± 4.0 versus 15.3 ± 4.5 mL•min•kg, VE-VCO₂ slope: 50.9 ± 15.8 versus 43.1 ± 11.1, respectively, both P < .001, P < .05). In multivariable models, the presence of ID was associated with reduced peak VO₂ (β = -0.14, P < .01, P < .05) and higher VE-VCO₂ slope (β = 0.14, P < .01, P < .05), adjusted for demographics and clinical variables. Analogous associations were found between serum ferritin, and both peak VO₂ and VE-VCO₂ slope (P < .05).

- **Conclusions**: ID independently predicts exercise intolerance in patients with systolic CHF, but the strength of these associations is relatively low.

### European consensus on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases [^115VPcNR]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2015). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, particularly in patients with IBD, iron supplementation is crucial. The ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend considering the administration of IV iron as the first-line therapy. This approach is advised for patients with clinically active IBD, those with previous intolerance to oral iron, patients with hemoglobin levels less than 10 g/dL, and for those requiring ESAs.

### Disordered iron homeostasis in chronic heart failure: Prevalence, predictors, and relation to anemia, exercise capacity, and survival [^117UGN6E]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to comprehensively delineate iron metabolism and its implications in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Iron deficiency is an emerging therapeutic target in CHF. Iron and clinical indexes were quantified in 157 patients with CHF.

Several observations were made. First, iron homeostasis was deranged in anemic and nonanemic subjects, characterized by diminished circulating (transferrin saturation) and functional (mean cell hemoglobin concentration) iron status despite seemingly adequate stores (ferritin). Second, while iron overload and elevated iron stores were rare (1%), iron deficiency (transferrin saturation < 20%) was evident in 43% of patients. Third, disordered iron homeostasis related closely to worsening inflammation and disease severity, strongly predicting lower hemoglobin levels independently of age, sex, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, and creatinine. Fourth, the etiologies of anemia varied with disease severity, with an iron-deficient substrate (anemia of chronic disease and/or iron-deficiency anemia) evident in 16%, 72%, and 100% of anemic NYHA functional class I or II, III, and IV patients, respectively. Although anemia of chronic disease was more prevalent than iron-deficiency anemia, both conditions coexisted in 17% of subjects. Fifth, iron deficiency was associated with lower peak oxygen consumption and higher ratios of ventilation to carbon dioxide production, identifying those at enhanced risk for death.

### Is hepcidin a link between anemia, inflammation and liver function in hemodialyzed patients [^1129m94G]. American Journal of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Hepcidin synthesis in hepatocytes is modulated in response to anemia, hypoxia, or inflammation. A cross-sectional study was performed to assess hepcidin correlations with markers of iron status, erythropoietin therapy, and markers of inflammation in hemodialyzed patients and in healthy volunteers.

- **Methods**: Iron status, complete blood count, creatinine, albumin, and lipids were assessed using standard laboratory methods. Hepcidin and high-sensitivity CRP were measured using commercially available kits.

- **Results**: Serum iron, TIBC, TSAT, erythrocyte count, Hb, Ht, platelet count, albumin, and cholesterol were lower, whereas ferritin and hepcidin were higher in hemodialyzed patients compared to controls. Hepcidin correlated positively with triglycerides, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, lymphocyte count, ferritin, and erythropoietin dose, and negatively with erythrocyte count, Hb, and Ht in hemodialyzed patients. In multiple regression analysis, triglycerides (beta value was 0.28, p = 0.02) and albumin (beta value was -0.31, p = 0.006) were correlates of hepcidin in hemodialyzed patients.

- **Conclusions**: Elevated hepcidin levels in hemodialyzed patients may be due to functional iron deficiency and anemia. The liver plays an important role in the synthesis of hepcidin. Low-grade inflammation, frequently found in hemodialyzed patients, might also contribute to elevated hepcidin concentration. The hypothesis that hepcidin might link anemia, inflammation, and liver function in kidney disease should be further evaluated.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^113DECq2]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

In summary, an SF < 15 µg/L is highly specific for iron deficiency (specificity 0.99). A cut-off of 45 µg/L provides a respectable specificity of 0.92, and figures below this may warrant consideration of GI investigation, especially in the context of a chronic inflammatory process with anaemia.

The sTfR concentration is a good marker of iron deficiency in otherwise healthy subjects, but it can also be raised where there is increased erythropoietic drive, such as with haemolytic anaemias, thalassaemias, and Hb E. Most UK hospitals do not provide this test. The [sTfR/log 10 ferritin] ratio may provide superior discrimination to either test on its own, particularly in chronic disease.

A therapeutic trial of oral iron replacement therapy (IRT) for 2–4 weeks may aid with the diagnosis of IDA, contingent on compliance. A ≥ 10 g/L rise in Hb over a 2-week period is highly sensitive for absolute iron deficiency. While further tests to confirm iron deficiency are occasionally necessary, estimation of iron concentration in bone marrow is invasive, often subjective, and difficult to justify in most cases.

After excluding thalassaemia carriage, low Retic-Hb provides evidence of iron restriction and should be considered in the laboratory work-up of anaemia, particularly where there is chronic renal impairment. Retic-Hb is reported to be a more reliable marker of iron restriction than sTfR in healthy blood donors. An early indicator of response to iron therapy in IDA is provided by a rising Retic-Hb on day 4, similar to the observation of a falling percentage of hypochromic red cells.

### A diagnostic approach to hyperferritinemia with a non-elevated transferrin saturation [^114SLmej]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Elevated serum ferritin concentrations are common in clinical practice. In this review, we provide an approach to interpreting the serum ferritin elevation in relation to other clinical parameters, including patient history, transferrin saturation, and serum concentrations of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT, AST). Testing for HFE mutations, liver imaging, liver biopsy, and liver iron concentration are also considered. We used observations from a large series of patients with hepatic iron overload, documented by liver iron concentration measurement from two referral practices, as a gold standard to guide the interpretation of the predictive values of non-invasive iron tests. Three case studies illustrate common problems in interpreting iron blood tests.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^1135NgQD]. Gut (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic heart failure: Evidence of some degree of iron deficiency, as defined by an SF < 100 µg/L and/or a transferrin saturation of < 20%, is found in 40%–70% of cases with CHF. The causes are multifactorial, including malabsorption, malnutrition, and GI blood loss, potentially exacerbated by anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. Additionally, the chronic inflammatory state present in many patients with CHF can lead to increased hepcidin release by the liver, resulting in reduced iron absorption and mobilization.

Patients with CHF should be screened for iron deficiency by measurement of ferritin and transferrin saturation. Endoscopic evaluation of the upper and lower GI tract should be considered if they have evidence of absolute iron deficiency to exclude treatable GI causes. Decisions about the need for and safety of endoscopic evaluation should ideally be made in conjunction with the cardiology team.

The majority, however, have FID rather than absolute iron deficiency. Nevertheless, both forms of ID are associated with reduced functional capacity, impaired quality of life, and poorer prognosis in CHF. Patients who meet the criteria for iron deficiency should therefore be considered for intravenous IRT, as this has been shown to have prognostic benefit in meta-analyses. No prognostic benefit has been demonstrated for oral iron, and this is best avoided as it may be poorly absorbed due to gut edema and is frequently associated with side effects. Specific guidelines should be consulted for detailed recommendations.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^111Y5frp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

A complete blood cell count (CBC) for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocyte count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count, and leukocyte count. To differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to examine the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic, normocytic, or microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count to distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help identify the various causes of anemia.

In clinical practice, it must be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and anemia of chronic disease (ACD) can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), laboratory tests can show microcytic or even macrocytic anemia. This indicates that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in IDA but are usually normal in ACD.

The RDW indicates how much the erythrocytes vary in size. It is commonly increased in IDA and remains within normal range in thalassemia.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^116VTxiw]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of hemochromatosis is based on the documentation of increased iron stores, demonstrated by elevated serum ferritin levels, reflecting an increase in hepatic iron content. Hemochromatosis can be further defined genotypically by the familial occurrence of iron overload associated with C282Y homozygosity or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity. Serologic iron markers, such as transferrin saturation (TS) and ferritin, are widely available, and the majority of patients with hemochromatosis are now identified while still asymptomatic and without evidence of hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis.

There are certain high-risk groups that should be targeted for evaluation, such as those with a family history of hemochromatosis, those with suspected organ involvement, and those with chance detection of biochemical and/or radiological abnormalities suggestive of the possibility of iron overload. It is generally recommended that all patients with abnormal liver function have iron studies done at some point in their evaluation. The algorithm outlined in Fig. 3 can provide further direction regarding testing and is modified from the version used in the previous AASLD guidelines.

The initial approach to diagnosis is through indirect markers of iron stores, namely, TS or unsaturated iron-binding capacity and serum ferritin. Transferrin saturation is calculated from the ratio of serum iron to total iron-binding capacity.

### Serum biomarkers of iron stores are associated with worse physical health-related quality of life in nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease patients with or without anemia [^112KhNGz]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Low credibility.

In biological systems, iron exerts essential functions and can potentially result in cell toxicity, particularly in the context of increased intracellular iron content resulting in oxidative injury. This explains the complex regulation of iron metabolism in human physiology. Conversely, a decrease in iron availability in the body results not only in iron deficiency (ID) anemia but also in a disarrangement of energy metabolism, particularly in muscle cells, given that iron is essential for the synthesis of major proteins in a wide range of intracellular pathways.

A precise diagnosis of ID can be achieved by confirming reduced iron content in the bone marrow, although the clinical use of this evaluation is not practical. Although far from ideal, the most commonly used parameters to assess iron status in clinical practice are transferrin saturation (TSAT) and ferritin. Based on these biochemical parameters, there are two main ID subtypes: absolute ID, defined loosely as low TSAT and low ferritin levels, and functional ID, defined as high ferritin combined with low TSAT. While the former represents the most common subtype in the general population, the latter is commonly found in chronic inflammatory states, such as heart failure (HF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In fact, functional ID results in part from increased hepcidin levels, which reduce iron release from the reticuloendothelial system, thereby restricting iron availability for metabolic functions.

ID is a common finding in nondialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD), occurring in up to 60%.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for iron deficiency anemia, specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, the BSG 2021 guidelines recommend recognizing that a good response to iron therapy (hemoglobin rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal.
