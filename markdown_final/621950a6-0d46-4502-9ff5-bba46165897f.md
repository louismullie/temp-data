## Question

For a hypoxic patient unresponsive to diuretics with a prior pulmonary embolism, what are the guidelines for obtaining a CTA?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to obtain CTPA in a hypoxic patient with a prior PE who is not responding to diuretics. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about hemodynamic stability and whether this could be high-risk PE needing immediate imaging. Then, I should verify pretest probability using a validated rule because that dictates whether to go straight to CTPA or start with D-dimer. Next, I will examine the ESC 2019 diagnostic algorithm, including when to initiate anticoagulation while awaiting imaging. After that, I need to consider alternatives if CTPA is contraindicated or delayed and how prior PE and persistent hypoxia shift the threshold. Finally, I will review CTPA technical and interpretive nuances, risks of overuse, and craft a clear action pathway tailored to this scenario using high-credibility guidelines as anchors [^112u5zuH] [^111m2sux] [^115v1mMw].

> Let me first confirm hemodynamic status because instability changes everything; if there is shock, sustained hypotension, or cardiac arrest, the ESC advises urgent bedside echocardiography or emergency CTPA depending on availability, and the bar for immediate reperfusion therapy is lower in confirmed high-risk PE, so I should not delay appropriate imaging in that context [^111m2sux]. Hold on, I need to ensure I'm not attributing hypoxia to volume overload when the clinical picture suggests right ventricular failure from PE; the lack of response to diuretics reinforces PE as a likely culprit and should accelerate imaging and management decisions in a potentially high-risk trajectory [^111m2sux].

> If the patient is hemodynamically stable, I should verify the pretest probability using a validated rule such as Wells or revised Geneva because diagnostic performance and the next step depend on it, and this is strongly endorsed across international guidelines and best-practice statements [^112u5zuH] [^112kKbjQ] [^115j6zVt]. Wait, let me double-check how prior PE weighs in; a history of VTE is a major predictor that increases the pretest probability and, in a hypoxic patient without an alternative explanation, will typically shift the gestalt toward PE-likely, which argues against ordering D-dimer and favors direct imaging [^112u5zuH] [^112kKbjQ].

> For high clinical probability, I should go straight to CTPA without D-dimer, and I should start therapeutic anticoagulation while the diagnostic workup is in progress if there are no contraindications, aligning precisely with the ESC algorithm and minimizing time to treatment in a patient at real risk for recurrence and decompensation [^117Kqscd] [^112u5zuH]. I need to ensure the diagnostic threshold is appropriate; a segmental or more proximal filling defect on CTPA confirms acute PE and will guide definitive management decisions with confidence [^113ioWLG].

> For low or intermediate probability, I should obtain a high-sensitivity D-dimer first and proceed to CTPA only if positive; a negative D-dimer safely excludes PE in this strata, which avoids unnecessary radiation and contrast exposure while maintaining very low diagnostic failure rates in guideline-concordant pathways [^112UjLr8] [^112u5zuH] [^112kKbjQ] [^115j6zVt]. Wait, I should double-check that I do not mix rules; for example, in low-risk patients who meet all PERC, no D-dimer or imaging is needed, which further reduces overtesting when appropriately applied in the ED setting [^115j6zVt] [^116yPVPC].

> Now, let me consider the specifics of this patient; persistent hypoxia despite diuresis and a history of prior PE materially raises the pretest probability, and unless there is a clearly superior alternative explanation, this should generally be categorized as PE-likely, prompting direct CTPA and empiric anticoagulation while awaiting imaging if delays occur and bleeding risk is acceptable [^112u5zuH]. Hold on, I should verify the caveat: if there are strong contraindications to anticoagulation or imaging, I need to adapt with alternatives while maintaining timely diagnostic certainty [^112u5zuH].

> If CTPA is contraindicated or not feasible due to severe renal impairment, contrast allergy, or logistics, I should consider ventilation/perfusion imaging, preferably V/Q SPECT when available, or rely on proximal lower-extremity compression ultrasound to confirm VTE and obviate chest imaging, both of which are recognized in guidelines as valid diagnostic pivots in the right clinical context [^115v1mMw] [^117XvE2U] [^113vNAQD]. Let me verify availability and interpretive expertise locally because modality choice is often influenced by center capabilities and patient factors, but the strategic principle remains to confirm VTE with the least risk and greatest yield [^115v1mMw].

> If imaging is delayed and the clinical probability is high or intermediate-high, I should initiate therapeutic anticoagulation without waiting, since early treatment reduces early morbidity and mortality and is an explicit ESC recommendation for suspected PE in these strata when bleeding risk is not prohibitive [^112u5zuH] [^116VPpG9]. But wait, I need to ensure this is documented clearly, including rationale and bleeding risk assessment, to support safe interim management and to facilitate reassessment once imaging is obtained [^112u5zuH].

> I will now examine the CTPA technical and interpretive aspects that can affect diagnostic yield; adequate bolus timing and opacification of the pulmonary arteries, with target attenuation around 210 Hounsfield units, improves sensitivity and specificity, which is particularly important when the pretest probability is high and downstream decisions hinge on image quality [^115hukBv] [^113tcSXs]. Hold on, let me not jump to conclusions on tiny defects; isolated subsegmental findings have lower positive predictive value and interobserver agreement, so in that scenario I should correlate with DVT imaging and clinical risk before committing to long-term anticoagulation, and in very high pretest settings a negative CTPA may warrant additional testing rather than immediate exclusion of PE [^1111gEjg] [^115kSPmA] [^112hTUfX].

> Next, I should review stewardship to balance benefits and harms; while CTPA is fast and widely available, overuse exposes patients to radiation and contrast risks without proven outcome gains, so adhering to pretest probability assessment, PERC in appropriate low-risk patients, and D-dimer-first strategies reduces unnecessary scans without increasing missed PE or bounce-backs in ED quality programs [^114cys15] [^115j6zVt] [^112U4EnW] [^112zHoby]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost labeled CTPA the universal gold standard; I should correct that framing because guidelines endorse CTPA as first-line in most contexts, whereas invasive pulmonary angiography is no longer the reference test in routine care, and V/Q imaging remains an important alternative in selected populations such as contrast intolerance or pregnancy [^115v1mMw] [^117XvE2U].

> Let me synthesize a practical action pathway for this case; first, assess hemodynamics and obtain emergent bedside echo or CTPA if unstable, second, if stable, determine pretest probability using Wells or revised Geneva, third, in this likely-PE profile with prior PE and refractory hypoxia, proceed directly to CTPA and begin anticoagulation while awaiting imaging if not contraindicated, fourth, if CTPA is delayed or contraindicated, pivot to V/Q SPECT or proximal leg ultrasound to confirm VTE, fifth, if CTPA is negative but clinical suspicion remains high, consider additional testing such as V/Q imaging or serial ultrasound rather than stopping the workup prematurely [^111m2sux] [^112u5zuH] [^117Kqscd] [^113ioWLG] [^113vNAQD] [^117XvE2U]. I should confirm that if PE is excluded, alternative causes of hypoxia like pneumonia, COPD, interstitial lung disease, or heart failure are actively pursued, ideally leveraging the CTPA or adjunct imaging findings to redirect management efficiently [^115v1mMw].

> In summary, I need to ensure decisions are anchored to the ESC 2019 algorithm: use structured pretest probability, avoid D-dimer in high-probability cases, go straight to CTPA with concurrent anticoagulation when indicated, and select validated alternatives if CTPA is not feasible; in this hypoxic patient with prior PE and poor diuretic response, the pretest probability is high, justifying direct CTPA and early anticoagulation while imaging is arranged [^112u5zuH] [^117Kqscd] [^111m2sux] [^113ioWLG]. Hold on, I should verify local pathways and contraindications, but the core logic remains consistent across major guidelines and should be implemented promptly to mitigate the risk of recurrent or progressive PE in this presentation [^112kKbjQ] [^115v1mMw].

In a patient with refractory hypoxia, prior PE, and diuretic-refractory symptoms, CTPA is indicated [^111m2sux] when **clinical suspicion for recurrent PE is high or intermediate** [^113ioWLG]. Do not delay imaging for D-dimer in **high-probability cases** [^117Kqscd]; initiate **anticoagulation** while awaiting results [^112u5zuH]. If CTPA is contraindicated [^115v1mMw], use V/Q SPECT [^117XvE2U] or compression ultrasound as alternatives [^113vNAQD].

---

## Clinical assessment and pretest probability

Use **clinical prediction rules** such as Wells [^112kKbjQ] or revised Geneva to stratify PE probability [^115j6zVt]. In hypoxic, diuretic-refractory patients with prior PE and **high clinical suspicion**, pretest probability is often high or intermediate.

---

## Indications for CTA in suspected recurrent PE

According to ESC 2019 [^113ioWLG], obtain CTPA when:

- **High clinical probability**: Immediate CTPA [^115v1mMw] or bedside echocardiography if unstable [^111m2sux].
- **Intermediate probability**: CTPA if D-dimer [^112UjLr8] is positive or unavailable [^113ioWLG].
- **Low probability**: CTPA if D-dimer [^112UjLr8] is positive [^115v1mMw].

---

## Special considerations in patients with prior PE

Because **prior PE** increases recurrence risk, maintain a low threshold for imaging. In **refractory hypoxia**, strongly consider CTPA if no alternative explanation exists.

---

## Contraindications and alternative imaging modalities

Contraindications include severe renal impairment, contrast allergy, and pregnancy; **alternatives** include V/Q SPECT [^117XvE2U] or compression ultrasound for proximal DVT [^113vNAQD].

---

## Risks and benefits of CTA

The **benefits** of CTA include high sensitivity/specificity [^113tcSXs], rapid diagnosis, and guidance for management [^115v1mMw], whereas the **risks** include radiation exposure, contrast nephropathy, and allergic reactions [^113tcSXs] [^115v1mMw].

## Summary of guidelines for CTA in suspected recurrent PE

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended diagnostic approach** |
|-|-|
| High clinical probability | Immediate CTPA [^111m2sux] or bedside echocardiography |
| Intermediate probability | CTPA if D-dimer positive [^112UjLr8] or unavailable [^113ioWLG] |

In imaging tests for patients with low or intermediate clinical probability but positive D-dimer, and those with a high or likely clinical probability, lung imaging is required. The two main imaging modalities include V/P imaging with SPECT (V/P SPECT) or, in rare situations, planar scintigraphy (V/P planar). Occasionally, perfusion-only lung scanning is performed. V/P SPECT may also be combined with low-dose computed tomography (CT), resulting in V/P SPECT/CT. Another option is computed tomography of the pulmonary arteries (CTPA).

Invasive pulmonary angiography is no longer regarded as the gold standard for the diagnosis of PE due to its limited sensitivity, specificity, and wide interobserver variability.

Transthoracic echocardiography was discussed in former guidelines for hemodynamically unstable patients. A recent review underscores the need for further research on this topic.

- **Basic principles of PE diagnosis**: PE leads to a loss of perfusion to the area supplied by the occluded end artery, which may affect a whole lung, a lobe, a lung segment, or a subsegment. In general, bronchial circulation maintains the viability of the embolized volume, and ventilation remains largely intact. V/P SPECT exploits the unique pulmonary arterial segmental anatomy.

A segmental map of the two lungs in four coronal slices and two sagittal slices for each lung demonstrates this anatomy. A bronchopulmonary segment is conical, with its apex towards the hilum and its base projected onto the pleural surface.

### New methods for estimating pretest probability in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^115EMbar]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The clinical assessment of the probability of pulmonary embolism is a key step in proposed diagnostic strategies for pulmonary embolism because the interpretation of noninvasive test results is conditional on the pretest probability derived from the presence or absence of clinical factors. The past year has brought important progress in the general area of clinical prediction of pulmonary embolism with the publication of two new simple clinical prediction rules. Each of the prediction rules includes a total of seven clinical variables that, when combined, allow for the categorization of patients into categories of low, intermediate, or high pretest probability of pulmonary embolism. Although these clinical prediction rules are perhaps only slightly better than the estimates of experienced clinicians, they provide an explicit method for estimating the probability of PE as an adjunct to diagnostic testing. Further validation work is now needed to assess how well these new prediction rules perform in settings other than the derivation sites.

### EANM guideline for ventilation/perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and beyond [^113CLsVV]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

These guidelines update the previous EANM 2009 guidelines on the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). Relevant new aspects are related to:

- **Quantification of PE and other ventilation/perfusion defects**: The diagnosis of PE should be reported when a mismatch of one segment or two subsegments is found.
- **Follow-up of patients with PE, chronic PE, and additional pulmonary physiological changes**: These changes can lead to diagnoses of left ventricular heart failure (HF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia.
- **Recommendations for ventilation imaging in COPD patients**: Technegas or krypton gas is preferred over diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA).
- **V/P SPECT imaging**: Tomographic imaging with V/P SPECT has higher sensitivity and specificity for PE compared with planar imaging. The absence of contraindications makes V/P SPECT an essential method for the diagnosis of PE. When V/P SPECT is combined with a low-dose CT, the specificity of the test can be further improved, especially in patients with other lung diseases. Pitfalls in V/P SPECT interpretation are discussed.

In conclusion, V/P SPECT is strongly recommended as it accurately establishes the diagnosis of PE even in the presence of diseases like COPD, HF, and pneumonia and has no contraindications.

### Nonspecific tests for pulmonary embolism [^112nfW7r]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Many tests have been proposed as useful in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), but nonspecific tests for PE can only add to the level of suspicion one has for the diagnosis. As Anderson indicates, "virtually all clinical and laboratory findings neither diagnose nor exclude the diagnosis of PE. They merely serve to heighten suspicion of the diagnosis and prompt the clinician to pursue additional diagnostic studies". D-dimer measurement is promising as a test to exclude PE in young healthy outpatients, and further study and improvements in technology can clarify the usefulness of different methods of performing this assay. For now, diagnostic algorithms for PE should continue to incorporate multiple tests and decision points, but the standard remains specialized imaging techniques.

### Pulmonary artery CTA [^1168qM7T]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

With the introduction of multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT), CT has been firmly established as the modality of choice for imaging the pulmonary arteries, particularly as the de facto first-line test for imaging patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Before the introduction of MDCT, concerns regarding CT's accuracy for diagnosing isolated peripheral emboli prevented unanimous acceptance of this test as the reference standard for imaging PE.

After a decade of uncertainty, there is now conclusive evidence that CT, if positive, provides reliable confirmation of the presence of PE and, more importantly, if negative, effectively rules out clinically significant PE. Efforts to streamline and facilitate workflow for CT diagnosis of PE will further improve the acceptance, utility, and importance of this test. Examples include improvements in workflow, CT derivation of right ventricular function parameters for triage and prognostication of patients with acute PE, and the comprehensive assessment of patients with acute chest pain for PE, coronary disease, aortic disease, and pulmonary disease by means of a single, contrast-enhanced, ECG-synchronized CT scan.

Although the diagnosis or exclusion of acute PE is the most common and important application of CT pulmonary angiography, the ease of scan acquisition and the high spatial resolution of modern CT techniques make this test ideally suited for the majority of congenital and acquired, acute, and chronic disorders of the pulmonary arteries.

### Age and sex-dependent trends in pulmonary embolism testing and derivation of a clinical decision rule for young patients [^115RjrNu]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Despite the low prevalence of pulmonary embolism (PE) in young adults, this group is frequently imaged for PE, exposing them to radiation and incurring substantial financial cost. The objective of this study was to determine the use and positive proportions for PE imaging by age, assess differences in the clinical presentation of PE by age, and evaluate the projected impact of an age-targeted decision rule.

The study design involved the analysis of two national population-based datasets: the 2009 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample, a 20% sample of US emergency departments (EDs), and the 2003–2006 Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) dataset, a multisite cohort of ED patients with suspected PE from 12 US EDs.

The results indicated that the prevalence of PE was 10 times lower in young patients (18–35 years) than in older patients (> 65 years) (0.06% vs. 0.60%, p < 0.001), yet young patients were imaged for PE almost as frequently as older patients (2.3% vs. 3.2%). This led to a lower proportion of positive examinations in young adults compared to older adults (2.3% vs. 17.4%, p < 0.001 in women; 4.0% vs. 21.4%, p < 0.001 in men). Clinical predictors of PE differed by age, with tachycardia being a significant predictor in older patients (OR: 1.2–1.9, p < 0.001) but not in young patients, whereas fever was a significant predictor only in young patients (OR: 1.4–7.2, p < 0.01). A modification of the previously described PERC rule to include age-specific risk factors could potentially reduce PE imaging by 51% in young patients, with a missed PE rate of 0.6% in those excluded from imaging.

In conclusion, young patients undergo frequent imaging for PE but demonstrate lower positive imaging rates compared to older populations.

### Derivation and validation of a 4-level clinical pretest probability score for suspected pulmonary embolism to safely decrease imaging testing [^114cys15]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Despite the significant progress of the last decades, diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a clinical challenge. The standard diagnostic strategy, based on clinical probability assessment, D-dimer testing, and computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), is proven to have a very low rate of diagnostic failure. However, there has been a large increase in CTPA for suspected PE. The exact reasons are likely multifactorial.

- **Signs and symptoms**: The signs and symptoms of PE are very common and unspecific. As such, clinicians fear they might be missing a life-threatening condition and are prone to initiate a diagnostic process.

- **D-dimer testing**: Due to the lack of specificity of D-dimer testing, a large proportion of patients have a false-positive result and require imaging to rule out PE.

- **CTPA availability**: Finally, CTPA is readily available, fast, minimally invasive, and more sensitive than ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scans. A slight increase in PE diagnosis has been observed as a result but with no clear benefits in terms of outcome, especially PE-related mortality. One explanation is that because more CTPAs are being performed, there is a greater risk of false-positive results or non–clinically relevant diagnoses. Moreover, CTPA exposes patients to risks of allergies, kidney failure, and cumulative radiation-induced cancer. Several strategies have therefore been proposed to reduce PE overtesting and overdiagnosis. These have proved satisfactory in terms of safety and efficacy but are based on different methods of assessing clinical pretest probability (CPP; e.g. Wells or revised Geneva score).

### Finding an alternative diagnosis does not justify increased use of CT-pulmonary angiography [^112zHoby]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

We determined the total number of CTPA performed in patients over 18 years of age, and their results (as either positive or negative for PE) for each year from 2000–2010 in a 500-bed, academic teaching hospital in New York City. The study was approved by the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System's institutional review board, which waived the need for informed consent.

We studied in detail the medical records of patients who underwent CTPA in three index years: 2000, 2005, and 2008. We chose the year 2000 as a baseline reference year; the year 2005 was the first calendar year after the hospital obtained an additional CT scanner; and the year 2008 followed the publication of Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis II (PIOPED II) and its recommendations. We reviewed all available records for the year 2000 (74 records) and a random sample representative of all CTPA performed in 2005 and 2008. A total of 850 studies were reviewed for 2005 and 2008. We excluded CT chest angiograms performed for other reasons, such as aortic dissection. Demographic data, clinical presentation, risk factors for thromboembolic disease, documentation of pre-test probability of PE, use of therapeutic anticoagulation, and results of CTPA were abstracted from patients' medical records. Since increased use of CTPA may be replacing that of V/Q scans, we also determined the number of V/Q scans performed for the diagnosis of PE from 2000 to 2010.

Assessment of pre-test probability of PE was completed by assigning pre-test probability to all subjects using the Revised Geneva Score (RGS).

### Failure rate of the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria rule for adults 35 years or younger: findings from the RIETE registry [^116yPVPC]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

To address the potential overuse of CTPA and the subsequent overdiagnosis of PE, particularly in younger patients, a clinical decision rule, the pulmonary embolism rule‐out criteria (PERC) rule, has been developed to help rule out PE without additional testing in patients under 50 years with a low PE pretest probability by clinical gestalt or Wells score. This approach avoids unnecessary D‐dimer testing and pulmonary imaging. Our recent study using data from the Registro Informatizado de la Enfermedad Tromboembólica (RIETE) Registry demonstrated that the PERC rule had a low missed PE rate of 0.7%.

Age is a crucial risk factor for PE, with an incidence 10 times lower in adults aged 18–35 years than in those over 65 years. Despite these differences, CTPA rates are similar between younger and older patients, resulting in a diagnostic yield 5.6 and 7.6 times lower in younger male and female patients, respectively. According to a recent study in the United States, 21% of CTPAs were performed on women under 45 years. Young women are at higher risk of overtesting due to their greater lifetime risk of radiation‐induced breast cancer, estimated at 0.4% for 20‐year‐old female patients. Given the lower PE prevalence and increased radiation risk in young patients, the PERC‐35 rule, a modification of the original PERC rule, was specifically developed for patients aged 35 years and younger. This modification substitutes fever for heart rate, as tachycardia failed to meet the thresholds required by the creators of the rule to be retained as a final PE predictor.

### Comparison of international guideline recommendations for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^112kKbjQ]. The Lancet Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is one of the leading causes of death due to cardiovascular disease. Timely diagnosis is crucial but challenging, as the clinical presentation of pulmonary embolism is unspecific and easily mistaken for other common medical emergencies. Clinical prediction rules and D-dimer measurement allow stratification of patients into groups of expected prevalence and are key elements in the adequate selection of patients for diagnostic imaging. However, the strengths and weaknesses of the multiple proposed prediction rules, when to measure D-dimer, and which cutoff to apply might be elusive to a significant proportion of physicians.

Thirteen international guidelines authored by medical societies or expert author groups provide recommendations on facets of the diagnostic investigations in suspected pulmonary embolism, some of which are marked by pronounced heterogeneity. This review summarizes key recommendations of each guideline, considers the most recent evidence on the topic, compares guideline recommendations on each facet of the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, and provides a synthesis on the most common recommendations.

### Clinical and imaging aspects of pulmonary embolism: A primer for radiologists [^115hukBv]. Clinical Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

Although many advancements have been made in imaging modalities used to diagnose pulmonary embolism (PE), computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) remains the preferred gold standard. It allows prompt diagnosis of pulmonary embolism by identifying filling defects caused by emboli lodged within the main pulmonary artery or its branches. Radiologists typically make the diagnosis in emergency settings, where the quick detection of PE on CTPA aids the Pulmonary Embolism Response Team (PERT) in swift management. Therefore, it is essential to follow standard image acquisition protocols and optimal contrast administration techniques to achieve a contrast opacification of at least 210 Hounsfield units, enabling radiologists to easily pinpoint emboli within the pulmonary arteries.

Even when proper CTPA scan acquisition guidelines are followed, CTPA images are prone to several artifacts that can be mistaken for a PE, leading to false-positive readings. Additionally, many incidental findings that could be the cause of chest pain in a PE-suspected patient are often overlooked by emergency radiologists, who aim to provide quick reads to ensure timely management of PE.

This review paper offers a comprehensive understanding of the clinical aspects of pulmonary embolism and the imaging modalities used for its detection. The main focus is on CTPA, its acquisition protocols, and the various incidental findings and artifacts to be aware of while interpreting a CTPA scan.

### EANM guideline for ventilation/perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and beyond [^115kSPmA]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Computed tomography angiography of the pulmonary artery (CTPA) involves imaging the pulmonary arteries during the passage of intravenously injected iodinated contrast material. Pulmonary emboli are visualized as filling defects caused by emboli within otherwise homogeneously contrast-filled pulmonary arteries. CTPA is easy to perform in a few minutes.

CTPA should be embedded in decision strategies based on the assessment of clinical pulmonary embolism (PE) likelihood. CTPA confirms the diagnosis of PE in clinically high probability patients (PPV > 95%). In cases of high pretest probability of PE and a negative CTPA, data on diagnostic accuracy is inconsistent; CTPA is overused in numerous patients with low prevalence of PE. A PE located centrally in the pulmonary circulation can be detected by CTPA with a high PPV. However, the positive predictive value (PPV) decreases at segmental and subsegmental levels. When the clinical probability of PE is low or intermediate, CTPA may overdiagnose PE, leading to a low negative predictive value (NPV).

CTPA has the potential to visualize additional pathologies other than PE, such as pneumothorax, pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, pleural disease, aortic dissection, and pathologies of the spine and rib cage. In the case of PE, computed tomography is able to depict signs of right heart strain, which is of prognostic importance.

### Multidetector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography in patients with a high clinical probability of pulmonary embolism [^112hTUfX]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

When there is a high probability of pulmonary embolism (PE), the sensitivity of computed tomography (CT) is unclear. We investigated the sensitivity of multidetector CT among 134 patients with a high probability of PE. A normal CT alone may not safely exclude PE in patients with a high clinical pretest probability. In patients with no clear alternative diagnosis after CTPA, further testing should be strongly considered.

Whether patients with a negative multidetector computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) result and a high clinical pretest probability of PE should be further investigated is controversial.

This was a prospective investigation of the sensitivity of multidetector CTPA among patients with a priori clinical assessment of a high probability of PE according to the Wells criteria. Among patients with a negative CTPA result, the diagnosis of PE required at least one of the following conditions: a ventilation/perfusion lung scan showing a high probability of PE in a patient with no history of PE, abnormal findings on venous ultrasonography in a patient without previous deep vein thrombosis at that site, or the occurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in a 3-month follow-up period after anticoagulation was withheld because of a negative multidetector CTPA result.

We identified 498 patients with a priori clinical assessment of a high probability of PE and a completed CTPA study. CTPA excluded PE in 134 patients; in these patients, the pooled incidence of VTE was 5.2% (seven of 134 patients; 95% confidence interval).

The choice of imaging modality for diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) may be influenced by provider, patient, or hospital characteristics, or over time. However, little is known about the choice of diagnostic modalities in practice. The aim of this study was to evaluate the variations in the use of imaging modalities for patients with acute PE.

- **Methods**: Using data from the Registro Informatizado Enfermedad TromboEmbolica (RIETE), a prospective international registry of patients with venous thromboembolism (March 2001-January 2019), we explored the imaging modalities used in patients with acute PE. The imaging modalities included computed tomography pulmonary angiography, ventilation/perfusion scanning, pulmonary angiography, a combination of these tests, or PE signs and symptoms plus imaging-confirmed proximal deep vein thrombosis but no chest imaging.

- **Results**: Among 38,025 patients with confirmed PE (53.1% female, age: 67.3 ± 17 years), computed tomography pulmonary angiography was the dominant modality of diagnosis for all RIETE enrollees (78.2% [99% CI, 77.6–78.7]), including pregnant patients (58.9% [99% CI, 47.7%-69.4%]) and patients with severe renal insufficiency (62.5% [99% CI, 59.9–65.0]). A greater proportion of patients underwent ventilation/perfusion scanning in larger hospitals compared to smaller hospitals (13.1% versus 7.3%, P < 0.001). The use of computed tomography pulmonary angiography varied between 13.3% and 98.3% across countries, and its use increased over time (46.5% in 2002 to 91.7% in 2018, P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: In a large prospective registry, the use of computed tomography pulmonary angiography was the predominant imaging modality for diagnosing acute PE, with variation by country and hospital size.

### Best clinical practice: Current controversies in pulmonary embolism imaging and treatment of subsegmental thromboembolic disease [^1111gEjg]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) affects over 600,000 patients per year in the United States. Evaluation includes clinical decision rules, laboratory tests, and several imaging modalities. The diagnosis of PE has risen in recent years, particularly subsegmental PE (SSPE), and controversy exists concerning the diagnosis and treatment of these lesions.

We sought to provide emergency physicians with a review of the controversies surrounding PE testing and the diagnosis and treatment of SSPE. With the rise of computed tomography (CT) testing for PE, diagnosis has increased. Providers often omit risk stratification in favor of D-dimer or imaging, which does not have literature support. The detection of PE has risen by 80%, and this increased testing is associated with several risks, including contrast reaction, nephropathy, and increased radiation.

SSPE diagnosis has risen with improved imaging technology, but the literature shows low interobserver agreement with the diagnosis of true SSPE. Studies disagree on the clinical significance and dangers of this PE subset. The American College of Chest Physicians 2016 guidelines recommend withholding anticoagulation for SSPE with low risk for re-thrombus and no concurrent deep vein thrombosis. Patients at high risk for re-venous thromboembolism or with deep vein thrombosis warrant anticoagulation. The provider is ultimately responsible for appropriate evaluation with risk stratification and selective testing.

SSPE presents a quandary because the literature differs in showing harm despite increases in diagnosis.

### Ten years of imaging for pulmonary embolism: Too many scans or the tip of an iceberg [^113nthvT]. Clinical Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

To examine the number and nature of investigations performed for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) in a large teaching hospital and the change in incidence and severity of PE over a decade, this retrospective study reviewed records of all patients investigated for suspected PE using computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or lung scintigraphy during the 10 years leading up to March 2012. In the final year, all reportedly positive CTPA cases were reviewed, and the severity of PE was calculated for comparison with similar historical data.

From 2002 to 2012, total annual investigations for suspected acute PE increased by 163% (805 to 2121). CTPA saw an increase of 325% (475 to 2019). Detection of PE rose by 121% (193 to 426 per annum), with a stable distribution of severity scores. Notably, the positive scan rate decreased from 24% to 20%, while the mean age of patients being investigated for PE increased from 56 to 63 years.

In conclusion, the increased detection of PE is not attributed to a disproportionate increase in small PEs but rather to the enhanced detection of PE of all severities. This supports the hypothesis that PE is more prevalent in the general population than previously recognized, possibly indicating an iceberg phenomenon of previously undetected disease.

### Improving the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the emergency department [^111VJVLf]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) in the emergency department is challenging due to the wide range of non-specific symptoms, lack of clinical diagnostic criteria, and imperfect investigations. Various scoring systems exist to limit unnecessary investigations in those with a low risk of PE. Following a baseline audit and subsequent PDSA cycles, we implemented a flowchart for use in patients suspected of pulmonary embolism, encouraging the correct use of the Wells Score and Pulmonary Embolism Rule out Criteria (PERC).

The standard used for comparison was based on the NICE guidelines for the diagnosis of PE, with the addition that PERC could also be used if appropriate. Data was collected over four-week periods before and after the introduction of our flowchart in two emergency departments in Melbourne. We aimed to increase documentation of pre-test probability, reduce inappropriate investigations, and increase the use of interim parenteral anticoagulation where there was a delay to imaging.

Results showed an increase in the documentation of pre-test probability, and the proportion of investigations requested that were inappropriate was reduced. The percentage of inappropriate d-dimers was reduced from 36% to 24%; the percentage of inappropriate CTPAs was reduced from 34% to 10%; and the percentage of inappropriate V/Q scans was reduced from 42% to 14%.

Implementation of a simple diagnostic algorithm led to an increase in the documentation of pre-test probability and a reduction in inappropriate and unnecessary investigations. This intervention may be applicable to other settings.

### Advances in the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism [^113xn5sB]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

The diagnostic management of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is complicated by its heterogeneous clinical presentation. Diagnostic algorithms, which combine clinical probability estimation with D-dimer testing and imaging tests, are very safe to exclude PE, although they result in high numbers of CT examinations. In light of cost, time-saving, and safety issues, several attempts have recently been made to reduce the number of required imaging tests. Notably, the age-adjusted D-dimer threshold has greatly improved the ability to non-invasively exclude PE.

Once the diagnosis of PE is established, the immediate initiation of anticoagulant therapy is of vital importance. A new generation of direct oral anticoagulants, which overcomes the main disadvantages of conventional vitamin K antagonists, has recently emerged. Risk stratification of hemodynamically stable PE patients — using clinical decision rules, cardiac biomarkers, or imaging tests — assists physicians in determining the most appropriate treatment approach for the individual patient. This stratification is essential to differentiate patients at low risk of adverse outcomes, who may be safely treated at home, from intermediate-risk patients who require closer monitoring. For these intermediate-risk patients, recent studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of systemic thrombolytic therapy.

This article reviews recent advances and challenges that remain in the diagnostic work-up and initial management of acute, clinically stable PE.

### How I diagnose acute pulmonary embolism [^117Jd6ps]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is frequently considered in patients presenting to the emergency department or when hospitalized. Since symptoms are nonspecific and the consequences of anticoagulant treatment are considerable, objective tests to either establish or refute the diagnosis have become a standard of care. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA), which has replaced pulmonary angiography as the first-line imaging test, is associated with radiation exposure, several complications resulting from contrast dye administration, and overdiagnosis. Importantly, CTPA can be avoided in 20% to 30% of patients who present with a first or recurrent episode of clinically suspected acute PE by using a standardized algorithm.

This algorithm should always include a clinical decision rule to assess the likelihood that PE is present, followed by a D-dimer blood test and/or CTPA. The aim of this review is to provide clinicians with this practical diagnostic management approach using evidence from the literature.

### Automated pulmonary embolism risk classification and guideline adherence for computed tomography pulmonary angiography ordering [^111wbUWh]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The assessment of clinical guideline adherence for the evaluation of pulmonary embolism (PE) via computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) currently requires either labor-intensive, retrospective chart review or prospective collection of PE risk scores at the time of CTPA order. The recording of clinical data in a structured manner in the electronic health record (EHR) may make it possible to automate the calculation of a patient's PE risk classification and determine whether the CTPA order was guideline concordant.

- **Objective**: The objective of this study was to measure the performance of automated, structured data-only versions of the Wells and revised Geneva risk scores in emergency department (ED) encounters during which a CTPA was ordered. The hypothesis was that such an automated method would classify a patient's PE risk with high accuracy compared to manual chart review.

- **Methods**: We developed automated, structured data-only versions of the Wells and revised Geneva risk scores to classify 212 ED encounters during which a CTPA was performed as "PE likely" or "PE unlikely". We then combined these classifications with D-dimer ordering data to assess each encounter as guideline concordant or discordant. The accuracy of these automated classifications and assessments of guideline concordance were determined by comparing them to classifications and concordance based on the complete Wells and revised Geneva scores derived via abstractor manual chart review.

- **Results**: The automatically derived Wells and revised Geneva risk classifications were 91.5 and 92% accurate, respectively, when compared to manual chart review.

### Evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism: Best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^115j6zVt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) can be a severe disease and is difficult to diagnose, given its nonspecific signs and symptoms. Because of this, testing patients with suspected acute PE has increased dramatically. However, the overuse of some tests, particularly computed tomography (CT) and plasma d-dimer measurement, may not improve care while potentially leading to patient harm and unnecessary expense.

The literature search encompassed studies indexed by MEDLINE (1966–2014; English-language only) and included all clinical trials and meta-analyses on diagnostic strategies, decision rules, laboratory tests, and imaging studies for the diagnosis of PE. This document is not based on a formal systematic review but instead seeks to provide practical advice based on the best available evidence and recent guidelines. The target audience for this paper is all clinicians; the target patient population is all adults, both inpatient and outpatient, suspected of having acute PE.

- **Best practice advice 1**: Clinicians should use validated clinical prediction rules to estimate pretest probability in patients in whom acute PE is being considered.

- **Best practice advice 2**: Clinicians should not obtain d-dimer measurements or imaging studies in patients with a low pretest probability of PE and who meet all pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria.

- **Best practice advice 3**: Clinicians should obtain a high-sensitivity d-dimer measurement as the initial diagnostic test in patients who have an intermediate pretest probability of PE or in patients with low pretest probability of PE who…

### Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for the detection of pulmonary embolism (PE) among trauma patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115PCAQT]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is a standard imaging technique employed for the detection of pulmonary embolism (PE). This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to examine the prevalence of PE among trauma patients undergoing CTPA.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive search across PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science yielded 13 studies encompassing 5,570 individuals, conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies that used CTPA for the detection of PE among trauma patients were selected. This resulted in an evaluation of prevalence, trauma types, clinical manifestations, radiological findings, and mortality rates of PE among trauma patients undergoing CTPA.

- **Results**: The overall prevalence of PE among trauma patients undergoing CTPA was 18% (95% CI = 13–24%). After pooling the existing data, femur fractures were determined to be the most prevalent trauma type (12%). The most prevalent clinical manifestations of PE among trauma patients included shortness of breath, chest pain, and altered vital signs. Radiological findings encompassed various pulmonary abnormalities, such as opacity, ground-glass opacities, and pleural effusions. Mortality rates of PE among the trauma patients ranged from 0% to 29.4% across the included studies.

- **Conclusion**: This study provides comprehensive insights into the prevalence, clinical manifestations, radiological findings, and mortality of PE among trauma patients undergoing CTPA. According to our findings, lower threshold…

### Triage for suspected acute pulmonary embolism: Think before opening Pandora's box [^115xUb72]. European Journal of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

This is a review of the strengths and weaknesses of the various imaging modalities available for the diagnosis of suspected non-massive pulmonary embolism (PE). Without careful consideration for the clinical presentation and the timely application of clinical decision support (CDS) methodology, the overutilization of imaging resources for this disease will continue. For a patient with a low clinical risk profile and a negative D-dimer, there is no reason to consider further workup with imaging, as the negative predictive value in this scenario is the same as with imaging. While the efficacy and effectiveness data support the continued use of computed tomographic angiography (CTA) as the imaging golden standard for the diagnosis of PE, this test does have the unintended consequences of radiation exposure, possible overdiagnosis, and overuse. There is a persistent lack of appreciation on the part of ordering physicians for the effectiveness of the alternatives to CTA (ventilation-perfusion imaging and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography) in these patients. Careful use of standardized protocols for patient triage and the application of CDS will allow for better use of imaging resources.

### Diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism [^1176dRcj]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Advances in the management of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) have improved diagnostic accuracy and made management algorithms safer, easier to use, and well standardized. These diagnostic algorithms are mainly based on the assessment of clinical pretest probability, D-dimer measurement, and imaging tests — predominantly computed tomography pulmonary angiography. These diagnostic algorithms allow safe and cost-effective diagnosis for most patients with suspected PE.

In this review, we summarize signs and symptoms of PE, existing evidence for PE diagnosis, and focus on the challenge of diagnosing PE in special patient populations, such as pregnant women or patients with a prior venous thromboembolism (VTE). We also discuss novel imaging tests for PE diagnosis and highlight some of the additional challenges that might require adjustments to diagnostic strategies, such as the reduced clinical suspicion threshold, resulting in a lower proportion of PE among suspected patients, as well as the overdiagnosis of subsegmental PE.

### Finding an alternative diagnosis does not justify increased use of CT-pulmonary angiography [^115hXup1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Patients undergoing CTPA in 2008, as compared to those in 2000 and 2005, were significantly younger and less acutely ill. This was evidenced by their higher oxygen saturation levels and lower respiratory rates. Moreover, patients in 2008 were much less likely to have any risk factors for thrombosis or a prior history of venous thromboembolism. There was an observed increase in the use of CTPA for patients with chest pain and for "other" indications. This increase in the number of scans ordered was accompanied by a significant drop in the diagnosis of PE, from 22.6% in 2000 to 13% in 2010.

We also noted a change in the size and location of pulmonary emboli detected over time. In 2008, a greater proportion of PE was found distal to the lobar arteries in the segmental or subsegmental branches. Since younger patients and women may be more at risk from the potential carcinogenic effects of ionizing radiation, we examined age and gender in our sample. The number of CTPA performed on women under the age of 40 years increased significantly over the study period. While 11.8% of all CTPAs performed were on women less than 40 years of age, the presence of a PE in this cohort was lower than in all CTPAs reviewed (9.1% versus 17.7%).

- **Table 1: Demographics, signs and symptoms, risk factors and prior medical history by year for 850 patients undergoing CT angiography**.
- **Table 2: CTPA positivity rate and location of pulmonary emboli**.

Central PE was defined as PE in the pulmonary trunk, right or left main pulmonary arteries, or lobar arteries while PE in segmental branches was defined separately.

### Newer modalities for detection of pulmonary emboli [^117MU1X7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the third most common cardiovascular disease after myocardial infarction and stroke in the United States. Early and accurate diagnosis of this condition is imperative because many patients die within hours of presentation. Clinical and laboratory tests can be used to accurately determine the pretest probability of PE. When necessary, imaging techniques are then used to exclude or diagnose PE. Pulmonary angiography is the reference standard for the diagnosis of PE, but it is invasive and has a high morbidity and mortality rate. Ventilation and perfusion (V/Q) scanning in the past has been recommended as the initial diagnostic test for PE; however, this technique also has limitations.

Recently, new modalities for the diagnosis and exclusion of PE have been evaluated. These techniques include V/Q single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), single- and multi-detected computed tomography, and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), including gadolinium-enhanced MRA, real-time magnetic resonance imaging (RT-MR), and magnetic resonance perfusion imaging.

### CT imaging in acute pulmonary embolism: Diagnostic strategies [^117RAADB]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTA) has increasingly become accepted as a widely available, safe, cost-effective, and accurate method for a quick and comprehensive diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Pulmonary catheter angiography is still considered the gold standard and final imaging method in many diagnostic algorithms. However, spiral CTA has become established as the first imaging test in clinical routine due to its high negative predictive value for clinically relevant PE. Despite the direct visualization of clot material, depiction of cardiac and pulmonary function in combination with the quantification of pulmonary obstruction helps to grade the severity of PE for further risk stratification and to monitor the effect of thrombolytic therapy. Because PE and deep venous thrombosis are two different aspects of the same disease, additional indirect CT venography may be a valuable addition to the initial diagnostic algorithm if this was positive for PE, and demonstration of the extent and localization of deep venous thrombosis has an impact on clinical management. Additional and alternate diagnoses add to the usefulness of this method. Using advanced multislice spiral CT technology, some practitioners have advocated CTA as the sole imaging tool for routine clinical assessment in suspected acute PE. This will simplify standards of practice in the near future.

### Targeting the initial investigation and management in cases of acute pulmonary embolism [^116VPpG9]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Symptomatic pulmonary embolism has a > 10% mortality rate in the early stages if left untreated. Patients presenting with the symptom complex, including pleuritic chest pain, dyspnoea, haemoptysis, and evidence of venous thromboembolic disease, may warrant investigation. A serum d-dimer measurement has high sensitivity and low specificity and thus is useful for ruling out PE as a cause of these symptoms if the diagnosis is unlikely. A CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is both sensitive and specific, and is thus ideal for definitive diagnosis of PE. However, CTPA is limited by a lack of resources and the high dose of radiation required for this test.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline on venous thromboembolic diseases, published in June 2012, advises the use of a 2-level Well's score to determine which of these diagnostic tests is required. A low score (unlikely PE) should be investigated with d-dimer first, followed by CTPA in the event of a positive d-dimer. A high score (likely PE) should be investigated with a CTPA as soon as possible. In either case, if a CTPA is indicated but has been delayed, an interim therapeutic dose of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) should be given.

Close adherence to this guideline is important for quality of care for several reasons:

- **Delay in treatment**: Patients with likely PE who have an inappropriate d-dimer test will significantly delay treatment with LMWH. Urgent blood tests can take more than one hour from deciding to take the sample to having the result. Efficiently ruling out PE in patients allows for timely investigation of alternative diagnoses.

### Computed tomography angiography in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism-too often considered [^114eHYHY]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality associated with surgery and medical illnesses. In recent years, pulmonary computed tomography angiography (CTA) has become the diagnostic method of choice. However, it remains unclear when to perform CTA and how often a decision based on clinical judgment results in positive or negative findings.

- **Methods**: In a retrospective study, 261 patients admitted for suspected PE were evaluated with pulmonary CTA. Decisions to order CTA were based on clinical judgment and optionally quantitative d-dimer assays. Clinical, radiologic, and laboratory data were revisited and compared in patients with and without proven PE.

- **Results**: The patients' mean age was 63 ± 1 years; almost 30% of all participants had at least a moderately reduced renal function. Pulmonary CTA demonstrated PE in only 14.9%; both age and sex distribution was comparable in the PE and non-PE group. Proximal deep vein thrombosis or pathologic chest x-rays were significantly more likely in patients with PE (P < .001 and P < .05), whereas echocardiography results were comparable. D-dimer values were noticeably higher in the PE group (P < .001); however, C-reactive protein and troponin T levels were not helpful.

- **Conclusions**: Pulmonary CTA confirmed PE in only a minority of patients and may be overused. Clinical judgment in conjunction with d-dimer evaluation was of limited help to predict positive results but surprisingly comparable with previous results using pretest probability scoring systems. Using present and previous data, a simplified…

### Cta utilization for evaluation of suspected pulmonary embolism in a tertiary pediatric emergency department [^114LGyDo]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in the utilization of computed tomography angiography (CTA) for evaluating suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) and the positive rate of ancillary findings for those studies negative for PE over the last 13 years.

Materials and methods: A retrospective review was conducted on patients aged 20 years or younger who underwent chest CTA to rule out PE over a 13-year period. CT angiographies were categorized into three groups: positive for PE, negative for PE and positive for ancillary findings, and negative for any pathology. Among the exams with ancillary findings, the study examined how many had a chest radiograph performed within 24 hours prior to the CTA and how many of these radiographs had similar findings as the CTA.

Results indicated that 307 chest CT angiographies for suspected PE were included in the study. Of these, 50 (16%) were reported as positive for PE, and 91 (30%) were negative for PE but positive for ancillary findings. The most frequent ancillary findings were pneumonia (n = 26) and pleural effusion (n = 11). Out of the 91 cases with ancillary findings, 73 patients had a previous chest radiograph, of which 28 reported a diagnosis similar to that of the CTA. The number of CT angiographies indicated for PE increased by 3.2 studies per year, while the rate of CT angiographies positive for ancillary findings (slope = 1.5) and positive for PE (slope = 0.3) remained stable throughout the study period.

The conclusions demonstrate that CTA orders for PE have been increasing without any increased detection of PE or ancillary findings in children.

### Finding an alternative diagnosis does not justify increased use of CT-pulmonary angiography [^117XhPcx]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the preferred method to confirm or exclude a pulmonary embolism (PE). However, the non-selective use of CTPA has several disadvantages. These include long-term risks of exposure to high doses of radiation and a small but definite risk of kidney injury due to intravenous contrast. Moreover, CTPA is an expensive test and often reveals incidental findings of indeterminate implications that further increase healthcare costs.

Even with CTPA's technological advances, easy availability, and ever shorter scan times, the assessment of clinical pre-test probability remains central to the diagnosis of PE and ideally should influence the initial choice of diagnostic testing. However, it remains unclear how frequently pre-test probability algorithms are followed in daily clinical practice. Furthermore, while the number of CTPAs has increased dramatically, the majority do not show the presence of PE. The increase in the use of CTPA is often justified by the discovery of hitherto unknown pathological etiologies; however, a review of the literature indicates that this has not been rigorously examined.

In this study, we examined the patterns of CTPA use over an eleven-year period at a single center and assessed whether the use of CTPA was justified in those with low or intermediate pre-test probability by the finding of an alternative diagnosis that might have explained the patient's symptoms.

### EANM guideline for ventilation/perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and beyond [^1112brcF]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

These guidelines update the previous EANM 2009 guidelines on the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). Relevant new aspects are related to quantification of PE and other ventilation/perfusion defects, follow-up of patients with PE, chronic PE, and description of additional pulmonary physiological changes leading to diagnoses of left ventricular heart failure (HF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia.

The diagnosis of PE should be reported when a mismatch of one segment or two subsegments is found. For ventilation, Technegas or krypton gas is preferred over diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) in patients with COPD. Tomographic imaging with V/P SPECT has higher sensitivity and specificity for PE compared with planar imaging. Absence of contraindications makes V/P SPECT an essential method for the diagnosis of PE. When V/P SPECT is combined with a low-dose CT, the specificity of the test can be further improved, especially in patients with other lung diseases.

Pitfalls in V/P SPECT interpretation are discussed. In conclusion, V/P SPECT is strongly recommended as it accurately establishes the diagnosis of PE even in the presence of diseases like COPD, HF, and pneumonia, and has no contraindications.

### Pulmonary embolism during pregnancy: A 17-year single-center retrospective MDCT pulmonary angiography study [^112GDcRS]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

In many hospitals worldwide, including our own, CTPA has become the first-line modality to exclude acute PE in pregnant women, despite guidelines advocating V/Q scanning when available. V/Q scanning following a normal chest X-ray remains a valid approach but is often used as a second-line test when CTPA is inconclusive or contraindicated, such as in patients with renal impairment or intolerance to iodinated contrast agents. Only 9 (3.9%) patients in our cohort underwent V/Q scanning.

There are multiple reasons for the predominance of CTPA, such as its immediate and widespread availability, fast acquisition time, high accuracy with direct visualization of vascular emboli, and the ability to provide alternative diagnoses. This latter point is critical and is reflected in our study cohort, where CTPA revealed alternative diagnoses four times more often than the presence of PE. In a multicenter study including 512 pregnant women who underwent CTPA, van Strijen et al. found alternative diagnoses in 25% of patients, similar to our study, consisting mostly of pneumonia. In these patients, a chest X-ray, which is usually performed before V/Q scanning, would have been abnormal, casting doubt on the added value of V/Q scanning. Indeed, according to the most recent European guidelines, V/Q scanning is generally not performed in such patients.

Radiation risk is a continuing concern, especially in the pregnant population, given the radiation sensitivity of both the fetus and the maternal breast. Since CTPA delivers a slightly lower dose to the patient compared to other procedures, it is often preferred.

Admitting doctors are often criticized for the inappropriate use of investigations in the early stages of diagnosis. This not only wastes resources, but it also delays correct diagnosis and can, in some cases, be harmful to the patient. The unnecessary measurement of D-dimer in cases of pulmonary embolism (PE) is particularly high.

### Perform: Pulmonary embolism risk score for mortality in computed tomographic pulmonary angiography-confirmed patients [^111aH57c]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: According to the diagnosis strategy of the "2019 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of acute PE developed in collaboration with the European Respiratory Society (ERS)", we retrospectively analyzed patients who were hospitalized at Minhang Hospital, affiliated with Fudan University, from January 2010 to December 2017. We used ICD discharge diagnosis codes, including I26.0 or I26.9, to identify patients with PE. Clinical electronic medical records, laboratory findings, nursing records, and radiological reports for all patients with PE were reviewed. All patients received standardized treatment. Only patients with PE confirmed by CTPA were considered for inclusion in the study. Detailed admission data, including demographic information, past medical history, signs and symptoms, laboratory test results, and imaging reports, were collected for each patient.

- **Study design**: Using a computer-generated randomization list, the study cohorts were randomly divided into two groups (the proportion was approximately 2:1). One group was used to construct the model (training cohort, n = 339), while the other group was used to validate the model (validation cohort, n = 170). The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality. The secondary endpoints were the time to recovery in 30 days and mortality in 15 days. The time to recovery was defined by discharge from the hospital. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Minhang Hospital.

### Contemporary management of pulmonary embolism: The answers to ten questions [^111VUmNJ]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) cannot be diagnosed solely on a clinical basis due to the lack of sensitivity and specificity associated with clinical signs and symptoms. Pulmonary angiography is invasive and resource-demanding. Considering that the prevalence of PE is relatively low (20% or less) among individuals clinically suspected of having the disease, subjecting all of them to imaging, such as multi-detector CT angiography or ventilation/perfusion lung scintigraphy, would not be cost-effective. Therefore, diagnostic algorithms have been developed that include clinical probability assessment and D-dimer measurement to select the patients who require noninvasive imaging. Once the diagnosis is suspected or confirmed, therapy must be initiated to prevent potentially fatal recurrence.

Treatment begins with an initial 3-month period involving a 5-day course of parenteral unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux. This is followed by oral vitamin K antagonists monitored to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2–3. After this initial 3-month period, patients who experience an idiopathic thromboembolic event and are at low risk of bleeding may enter a long-term secondary prevention period. New oral anticoagulants, which might not require patient monitoring and may offer a more favorable benefit-risk balance, are currently under extensive clinical testing and could change this scenario in the near future. A critical appraisal of the contemporary management of suspected PE is provided in this overview through the discussion of 10 practical questions.

There is increased interest in and use of cardiac computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging as the technology continues to improve. Many small single-center trials have been conducted on the diagnostic accuracy of these techniques, yet no studies demonstrate a patient benefit from testing.

### ACR appropriateness criteria acute chest pain-suspected pulmonary embolism [^115v1mMw]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a common and important clinical condition that cannot be accurately diagnosed on the basis of signs, symptoms, and history alone. The diagnosis of PE has been facilitated by technical advancements and multidetector CT pulmonary angiography, which is the major diagnostic modality currently used. Ventilation and perfusion scans remain largely accurate and useful in certain settings. Lower-extremity ultrasound can substitute by demonstrating deep vein thrombosis; however, if negative, further studies to exclude PE are indicated. In all cases, correlation with the clinical status, particularly with risk factors, improves not only the accuracy of diagnostic imaging but also overall utilization. Other diagnostic tests have limited roles.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Computed tomography pulmonary angiography ventilation-perfusion lung scanning for diagnosing pulmonary embolism during pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11533pir]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

For this meta-analysis, we conducted a search for all relevant full publications in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library databases. We also searched EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library databases for relevant meeting abstracts. The complete search strategy is detailed in Online Supplementary Appendix A.

- **Selection of studies**: Search results were combined, and duplicates were removed. Studies were screened for relevance by two independent reviewers (CT and LvdP) using a specific three-step program and Covidence software. Disagreements were resolved by a third investigator (FK) through majority rule.

	- **Screening process**: The first and second steps consisted of title and abstract screening followed by full text screening for the remaining articles. The final selection of studies was based on the assessment of relevance and study quality.

- **Assessment of relevance**: This was based on the following criteria:
	- Prospective patient inclusion,
	- Inclusion of consecutive patients,
	- Reported rate of non-diagnostic test results,
	- Reported incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) at baseline.

- **Assessment of bias**: Evaluated in accordance with the PRISMA criteria:
	- Pre-specified study protocol,
	- Clear description of inclusion and exclusion criteria,
	- Inclusion of consecutive patients,
	- Objective diagnosis of PE,
	- Reported losses to follow-up,
	- Clear distinction between pregnant and postpartum patients,
	- Assessment of the primary endpoints in all patients.

### Improving the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the emergency department [^115A96qc]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) in the emergency department is challenging due to the wide range of non-specific symptoms, lack of clinical diagnostic criteria, and imperfect investigations. Various scoring systems exist to limit unnecessary investigations for those with a low risk of PE. Following a baseline audit and subsequent Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles, we implemented a flowchart for patients suspected of having a pulmonary embolism, encouraging the correct use of the Wells Score and Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC). The standard used for comparison was based on the NICE guidelines for diagnosing PE, with the addition that PERC could also be used if appropriate.

Data was collected over four-week periods before and after the introduction of our flowchart in two emergency departments in Melbourne. We aimed to increase the documentation of pre-test probability, reduce inappropriate investigations, and increase the use of interim parenteral anticoagulation when there was a delay to imaging. Results showed an increase in the documentation of pre-test probability and a reduction in the proportion of inappropriate investigations. The percentage of inappropriate D-dimers was reduced from 36% to 24%, the percentage of inappropriate CTPAs was reduced from 34% to 10%, and the percentage of inappropriate V/Q scans was reduced from 42% to 14%. Implementing a simple diagnostic algorithm led to an increase in documentation of pre-test probability and a reduction in inappropriate and unnecessary investigations. This intervention may be applicable to other settings.

### Pretest risk assessment in suspected acute pulmonary embolism [^113Urgm1]. Academic Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

To assess the pretest practices of US clinicians treating patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE), a survey was conducted among 855 practicing physicians randomly selected from three professional organizations. Participants were asked how often and by what method they determine the likelihood of PE before requesting confirmatory studies. They also reported their awareness of four published clinical practice guidelines related to acute PE and selected options for further diagnostic testing after reviewing clinical data from three hypothetical patients presenting with low, intermediate, and high probability of acute PE.

Completed surveys were received from 240 physicians practicing across 44 states. Although most (98.3%) report assessing pretest probability of PE before testing, slightly more than half do so routinely. A significant proportion (72.5%) prefer an unstructured approach to pretest assessment, whereas 22.9% use published prediction rules. While most respondents (93.0%) are aware of at least one published guideline for assessing acute PE, only 44.2% report using one or more in daily practice. Physicians who use published prediction rules, routinely estimate pretest probability, or use at least one practice guideline were more likely to request additional testing in low probability clinical scenarios. No differences in testing frequency or preferences were observed for intermediate or high probability clinical scenarios.

The survey concludes that the majority of clinicians employ an unstructured approach when estimating pretest probability of PE.

### EANM guideline for ventilation/perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and beyond [^116vcP5c]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Some patients tend to develop recurrent episodes of pulmonary embolism (rePE). Figure 4 presents a patient with rePE, shown by follow-up scans. Without both initial and follow-up images, it is often impossible to differentiate between old and new pulmonary embolisms. The risks in patients treated with thrombolysis for massive pulmonary embolism include not only bleeding but also those related to unresolved pulmonary embolism. Immediate imaging control provides objective information on the need for repeated thrombolysis. Symptomatic patients with small emboli are diagnosed with sensitive methods, particularly V/P SPECT. Figure 5 presents a case with pulmonary embolism in the middle lobe and pneumonia in the posterior right lung, which could not have been identified without SPECT and ventilation images.

- **Coronal slices (Figure 4)**: In a patient with rePE (red arrows), initially referred following a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism was not identified on CT. The first follow-up scan shows new perfusion defects that occurred after stopping therapy, and the final follow-up identifies improving perfusion after four months of treatment.

- **Sagittal slices (Figure 5)**: Of the left lung in a patient with pulmonary embolism in the medial lobe (red arrow) and pneumonia posteriorly (blue arrow). The VP mismatch may be highlighted in V/P quotient images.

The natural history and the efficacy of treatment in this group of patients are rather unknown. Thus, follow-up is indicated to individualize therapy.

- **Requirements for follow-up methods**:
	- Applicability to all patients
	- Low radiation dose
	- High sensitivity to allow estimation of resolution of events

### Single-detector helical computed tomography as the primary diagnostic test in suspected pulmonary embolism: A multicenter clinical management study of 510 patients [^114wn2we]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Helical computed tomography (CT) is a readily available tool for diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE); however, its role in the management of patients with clinically suspected PE has not been fully established.

- **Objective**: To determine the effectiveness and safety of using helical CT of the pulmonary arteries as the primary diagnostic test in patients with suspected PE.

- **Design**: Multicenter, prospective clinical outcome study.

- **Setting**: Two academic hospitals and one large teaching hospital in the Netherlands.

- **Patients**: 510 consecutive inpatients and outpatients with clinically suspected PE followed for 3 months.

- **Interventions**: Patients underwent helical CT of the pulmonary arteries within 24 hours after presenting with signs and symptoms of PE. If CT results were normal or inconclusive, compression ultrasonography was performed on the same day as CT and repeated on days 4 and 7 if findings on the first compression ultrasonography were normal. When CT or compression ultrasonography results were positive for thromboembolism, anticoagulation was started. Anticoagulation was not started when results of CT were negative for PE or indicated an alternative diagnosis that explained the clinical signs and symptoms, or when results on serial compression ultrasonography were normal.

- **Measurements**: Patients received instructions to report any symptoms or signs of PE or deep venous thrombosis (DVT) during the 3-month follow-up period. The authors performed compression ultrasonography or phlebography for suspected DVT and pulmonary angiography for suspected PE.

### Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for the detection of pulmonary embolism (PE) among trauma patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112wYSxi]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is a standard imaging technique employed for the detection of pulmonary embolism (PE). This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to examine the prevalence of PE among trauma patients undergoing CTPA.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive search across PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science yielded 13 studies encompassing 5,570 individuals conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline. Studies that used CTPA for the detection of PE among trauma patients were selected. This resulted in an evaluation of prevalence, trauma types, clinical manifestations, radiological findings, and mortality rates of PE among traumatic patients undergoing CTPA.

- **Results**: The overall prevalence of PE among trauma patients undergoing CTPA was 18% (95% CI = 13–24%). After pooling the existing data, femur fractures were determined to be the most prevalent trauma type (12%). The most prevalent clinical manifestations of PE among trauma patients included shortness of breath, chest pain, and altered vital signs. Radiological findings encompassed various pulmonary abnormalities, such as opacity, ground-glass opacities, and pleural effusions. Mortality rates of PE among trauma patients ranged from 0% to 29.4% across the included studies.

- **Conclusion**: This study provides comprehensive insights into the prevalence, clinical manifestations, radiological findings and mortality of PE among trauma patients undergoing CTPA.

### Improving the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the emergency department [^114ZHCnB]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) in the emergency department is challenging due to the lack of clinical diagnostic criteria and imperfect investigations. The presenting symptoms are common and non-specific, varying from chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, and hemoptysis, to syncope and cardiac arrest. There is a high false positive rate with non-invasive testing (d-dimer) but relatively significant potential adverse events (radiation and contrast-associated complications) with more invasive testing such as computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA).

Various scoring systems exist in an attempt to limit unnecessary imaging for those identified as having a low pre-test probability of pulmonary embolism without increasing the risk of missing the potentially life-threatening diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Using a combination of the Wells score and either a d-dimer (if PERC positive) or no testing (if PERC negative) can reduce the need for imaging. These scoring systems are particularly useful for junior doctors who may lack clinical experience. The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria (PERC) has been validated for use within the emergency department. Within the emergency departments in which this project was undertaken, there were no specific guidelines that junior doctors were required to follow, although discussion with senior clinicians prior to requesting a d-dimer or imaging was encouraged.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines describe proposed best standards that should be met when considering the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.

### Derivation and validation of a 4-level clinical pretest probability score for suspected pulmonary embolism to safely decrease imaging testing [^116ZBqZ5]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Another means to limit CTPA overuse is to optimize D-dimer testing. The ADJUST-PE study prospectively confirmed the safety and utility of an age-adjusted cutoff value for patients 50 years or older. However, the effect of the ADJUST-PE strategy on imaging testing rates remains limited (-10.8% or -5.2% in our high-prevalence and moderate-prevalence external validation cohorts, respectively), particularly in young patients. A further proposal, based on Bayes' theorem, is to adjust the D-dimer cutoff value to the pretest probability. This principle was assessed in two recent studies, the YEARS study and PEGeD study. Both studies used 1.0 μg/mL as the D-dimer cutoff value for patients with a low CPP, achieving a very low overall rate of false-negative testing.

Of note, the PEGeD study was the most recent and has the lowest PE prevalence (7.4%), with 87% of patients having a low CPP. It should be used with caution in a population of patients with higher PE prevalence. Indeed, recent external validation data of the PEGeD and YEARS strategies in cohorts of European patients suggest a higher failure rate. Moreover, since the methods of CPP assessment are different in the PERC strategy compared to other strategies aiming to reduce overtesting, it is difficult to combine them. For example, to combine the PERC and PEGeD strategies, the physician may have to first assess implicit clinical probability (gestalt); second, if low, apply the PERC strategy; and third, if positive, use the revised Wells score. The risk of misuse in clinical practice appears to be significant and may have severe consequences.

### Performance of 4 clinical decision rules in the diagnostic management of acute pulmonary embolism: a prospective cohort study [^116ZX9Dd]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Several clinical decision rules (CDRs) are available to exclude acute pulmonary embolism (PE), but they have not been directly compared. The objective of this study was to directly compare the performance of four CDRs (Wells rule, revised Geneva score, simplified Wells rule, and simplified revised Geneva score) in combination with d-dimer testing to exclude PE.

The design was a prospective cohort study conducted in seven hospitals in the Netherlands. A total of 807 consecutive patients with suspected acute PE were included. In the intervention, the clinical probability of PE was assessed using a computer program that calculated all CDRs and indicated the next diagnostic step. Results of the CDRs and d-dimer tests guided clinical care.

Measurements involved comparing the results of the CDRs with the prevalence of PE identified by computed tomography or venous thromboembolism at a 3-month follow-up. Results showed that the prevalence of PE was 23%. The proportion of patients categorized as PE-unlikely ranged from 62% (simplified Wells rule) to 72% (Wells rule). Combined with a normal d-dimer result, the CDRs excluded PE in 22% to 24% of patients. The total failure rates of the CDR and d-dimer combinations were similar, with 1 failure (0.5% to 0.6% [upper-limit 95% CI, 2.9% to 3.1%]). Notably, even though 30% of patients had discordant CDR outcomes, PE was not detected in any patient with discordant CDRs and a normal d-dimer result.

One limitation of this study is that management was based on a combination of decision rules and d-dimer testing rather than on only one CDR combined with d-dimer testing.

In conclusion, all four CDRs show similar performance for the exclusion of acute PE when combined with d-dimer testing.

### Finding an alternative diagnosis does not justify increased use of CT-pulmonary angiography [^114bykgq]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Accepted recommendations for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) continue to emphasize pre-test probability to guide the choice of testing, and the positive predictive value of CT-pulmonary angiography (CTPA) remains dependent on the pre-test probability of PE. We used documentation of pre-test probability in patients' medical records as a surrogate for assignment of pre-test probability by any means, subjective or objective. It is possible that assessment of pre-test probability was performed by physicians prior to CTPA but not specifically recorded. However, if this were the case, such assessment of pre-test probability occurred in a rather small minority of patients for the following two reasons.

- **Measurement specifics**: First, D-dimer was only measured in 20% of all patients with a low or intermediate pre-test probability of PE. Second, only 1 in 5 patients in the high pre-test probability category received anticoagulation while awaiting confirmation of PE with a CTPA.

Our study was designed to investigate the rates and indications for the use of CTPA in clinical practice and therefore only includes patients undergoing CTPA. It is possible that patients presented with low risk for PE were appropriately screened and did not undergo CTPA. We believe that such number is small as our data reveal that younger patients with fewer risk factors for PE were undergoing CTPA.

### Reci-pe (reducing CT in pulmonary embolism diagnosis): an emergency department quality intervention [^112U4EnW]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2025). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially deadly disease and a diagnostic challenge in emergency departments (EDs). Established strategies exist for risk stratification and test stewardship for CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA). However, the implementation of best practices has proven challenging, and rising CTPA utilization increases costs, radiation exposure, and ED crowding. We created a multimodal quality intervention to reduce excess CTPA studies and increase the use of d-dimer assays prior to CTPA. Balance measures included the rate of positive CTPA studies and ED returns within 72 hours of discharge.

- **Methods**: This was an observational, pre-post interventional design at three EDs. The intervention included an institutional PE diagnostic guideline, educational sessions, an electronic clinical decision support tool, and monthly feedback to individual providers. Consecutive patient data were analyzed one year before and one year after the intervention on 21 November 2021. Analyses used Pearson χ², logistic regression generalized linear models, and XmR statistical process control (SPC).

- **Results**: The study included 307,441 patient encounters, with 35,066 PE evaluations. CTPA utilization decreased from 6.0% to 5.1% (p < 0.01) of all patient encounters, and d-dimer use preceding CTPA increased from 36.6% to 56.3% (p < 0.01). For both primary measures, SPC charts showed statistically significant special cause variation compared with the pre-intervention data. There was no significant change in the rate of positive CTPA studies (9.3% vs. 10.4%, p = 0.14) or 72-hour ED returns (3.0% vs. 3.1%).

### Clinical policy: Critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting with suspected pulmonary embolism [^11184ggF]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

This clinical policy focuses on critical issues in the evaluation and management of patients with signs or symptoms of pulmonary embolism (PE). A MEDLINE search for clinical trials published from January 1995 through April 2001 was conducted using the keywords "pulmonary embolus" with limits of "clinical investigations" and "clinical policies". Subcommittee members and expert peer reviewers also supplied articles with direct bearing on the policy.

The policy addresses two major areas of interest and controversy:

- **Diagnostic**: Utility of D-dimer, ventilation-perfusion scanning, and spiral computed tomography angiogram in the evaluation of PE.
- **Therapeutic**: Indications for fibrinolytic therapy.

Recommendations for patient management are provided for each of these topics based on strength of evidence (Level A, B, or C). Level A recommendations represent patient management principles that reflect a high degree of clinical certainty; Level B recommendations represent principles with moderate clinical certainty; and Level C recommendations signify other strategies based on preliminary, inconclusive, or conflicting evidence, or panel consensus. This guideline is intended for physicians working in emergency departments or chest pain evaluation units.

The European Respiratory Journal (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary embolism, specifically concerning D-dimer, the ESC 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining D-dimer testing, preferably with a highly sensitive assay, in outpatients or emergency department patients with low or intermediate clinical probability or if pulmonary embolism is unlikely.

### Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for the detection of pulmonary embolism (PE) among trauma patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113tcSXs]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has a sensitivity of 96–100% and a specificity of 89–98% in diagnosing probable pulmonary embolism (PE). CTPA offers several significant benefits that contribute to its general acceptance. The primary advantages of this procedure include its accessibility, minimal invasiveness, and rapid imaging time. The field of view of CTPA extends beyond the pulmonary arteries, allowing for visualization of various causes of shortness of breath and chest pain, such as musculoskeletal injuries, pneumonia, pericardial abnormalities, and vascular pathologies.

Moreover, if a CTPA is normal in patients with low or intermediate clinical likelihood, the diagnosis of PE can be excluded without further testing. However, excessive testing for PE represents a significant health issue, particularly at university hospitals. For instance, at one center, the application of the Revised Geneva Score could have avoided an estimated 9.84% of CTPA tests. While improvements in procedures and techniques can optimize diagnostic accuracy and reduce radiation exposure, the primary concern associated with CT scans is the potential risk of cancer due to ionizing radiation. This risk is particularly relevant for young female patients or those who frequently present with chest pain.

Nonetheless, Woo et al. highlighted a notable benefit-to-risk ratio of CTPA by considering the mean lifetime attributable risk of cancer death. Additionally, CTPA is conducted using intravenous contrast agents, which can lead to contrast-induced nephropathy, although this is less common than previously thought.
