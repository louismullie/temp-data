## Question

Causes of hippocampal attophy and its implications

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of hippocampal atrophy and its clinical implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the hippocampal anatomy and why it is vulnerable. Then, I should categorize etiologies across neurodegenerative, vascular, psychiatric, traumatic, metabolic, and developmental domains. Next, I will examine subfield-specific patterns and mechanisms. After that, I should appraise clinical implications for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Finally, I will consider modifiability and synthesize a practical clinical takeaway with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct and why the hippocampus matters. The hippocampus is a medial temporal lobe structure critical for episodic memory and is among the earliest regions to show measurable atrophy in several neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, which makes it a key biomarker and therapeutic target in neurology and psychiatry [^b91df4d7] [^748d33aa].

> I will now examine neurodegenerative causes, starting with Alzheimer's disease, where I need to be precise about sequence and specificity. Wait, let me verify the temporal pattern: tau-related neurofibrillary pathology begins in entorhinal cortex and CA1/subiculum, with amyloid accumulation preceding but not directly driving hippocampal atrophy; hippocampal volume loss accelerates in a sigmoidal fashion and correlates tightly with episodic memory decline, though atrophy itself is not specific to AD and can reflect mixed pathologies [^49879942] [^1eeb9b8a] [^c15acd9d]. Hold on, I should also note that APOE ε4 carriers exhibit faster hippocampal atrophy and worse memory trajectories, reinforcing a genetic susceptibility component [^d3619180] [^7975b902].

> Next, I should review vascular contributions, and I need to ensure I separate hippocampal sclerosis from ischemic atrophy. Hippocampal sclerosis, with severe CA1/subicular neuronal loss and gliosis, is common in older adults and linked to cognitive impairment independent of AD; it correlates with arteriolosclerosis rather than large-vessel disease, suggesting a small-vessel microvascular mechanism rather than macroinfarction [^047c44aa] [^ded796e4]. Let me consider white matter hyperintensities and deep/subcortical SVD: higher WMH burden, especially deep WMH progression, tracks with faster subiculum atrophy even in non-demented elders, indicating a direct vascular–hippocampal axis of injury [^fb13b8db]. I should double-check that mixed AD/SVD cohorts show independent contributions of amyloid and SVD to hippocampal morphology, which they do, supporting additive rather than purely synergistic models in many cases [^notfound] [^notfound].

> I will now examine psychiatric and stress-related etiologies. Chronic stress and glucocorticoid excess can damage hippocampal neurons, and smaller hippocampal volume is consistently observed in major depressive disorder, with meta-analytic evidence even in first-episode depression, supporting both neurotoxic and neurodevelopmental components [^013b460f] [^a260bcef]. But wait, what if smaller hippocampi precede illness? Twin data suggest smaller hippocampal volume confers vulnerability to trauma-related psychopathology, indicating a bidirectional relationship rather than a purely neurotoxic effect of stress exposure [^b849d4f4]. I should confirm that PTSD cohorts show smaller hippocampi and that stress-related mechanisms plausibly mediate this, which they do, though sleep and comorbidities may modulate the magnitude of effects [^24c38b3d].

> Let me consider traumatic brain injury next, and I need to check whether hippocampal atrophy is a consistent feature. Moderate-to-severe TBI frequently produces hippocampal atrophy detectable within months and persisting long term, contributing to memory deficits; even repetitive mild TBI in athletes shows measurable hippocampal volume reductions, supporting both focal and network-level injury mechanisms [^526f8d91] [^3cb5f40d]. Hold on, I should verify that anoxic injury similarly targets the hippocampus; indeed, CA1 is selectively vulnerable to hypoxia, aligning with observed memory sequelae after cardiac arrest or severe hypotension [^047c44aa].

> I should review metabolic and systemic contributors, and I need to ensure I distinguish direct from indirect effects. Type 2 diabetes and poor glycemic control are associated with hippocampal atrophy and worse memory, likely via vascular, inflammatory, and glucocorticoid pathways rather than a single direct toxic mechanism [^25a54979] [^389e3fda]. Obesity and related cardiometabolic risk factors also correlate with smaller hippocampal volumes and faster atrophy over time, reinforcing modifiable risk targets for brain health [^06e1bd5f] [^748d33aa]. Let me reconsider whether cardiac disease independently affects the hippocampus; meta-analytic data indicate smaller hippocampi in heart failure and atrial fibrillation cohorts, plausibly via hypoperfusion and microembolic or inflammatory mechanisms, though confounding remains possible [^7e8704fb] [^7e39e193].

> I will now examine developmental and perinatal causes, and I should confirm that these effects are long-lasting. Preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy are associated with reduced hippocampal volume detectable from infancy through adolescence, with corresponding memory and behavioral deficits, underscoring early-life programming of hippocampal structure and function [^b7fb5f4d]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought these effects might be transient, but longitudinal data suggest persistent structural differences and functional impacts into adolescence and beyond, supporting early neuroprotective strategies in at-risk neonates [^b7fb5f4d].

> Next, I should review subfield-specific patterns because they carry mechanistic and diagnostic clues. In AD, early atrophy localizes to presubiculum/subiculum and CA1, reflecting tau-mediated disconnection and synaptic loss, whereas whole-hippocampus measures can obscure these regional vulnerabilities [^6ae9796f] [^17f9ab4f]. In vascular cognitive impairment, the subiculum shows disproportionate atrophy and links to WMH burden, consistent with its susceptibility to hypoperfusion and microvascular insufficiency [^fb13b8db]. In temporal lobe epilepsy, hippocampal sclerosis manifests with CA1 and subicular neuronal loss and gliosis, often asymmetric and detectable by high-resolution MRI, which guides surgical candidacy and prognosis [^b4b77c3d]. Let me verify that MS shows a CA-predominant pattern early on; yes, CA1 and related subfields show the most consistent atrophy and correlate with memory impairment in early relapsing-remitting MS, supporting both demyelination and network disconnection models [^82b6e363] [^4561d38c].

> I should confirm the clinical implications for diagnosis and differential diagnosis. Hippocampal atrophy is sensitive but not specific for AD; it occurs in Lewy body disease, frontotemporal dementias, hippocampal sclerosis, and mixed pathologies, so relying on hippocampal volume alone risks misclassification without biomarker support [^d35c85bc] [^a9ca432d]. Hold on, I should verify guideline positions: EFNS guidance supports using MRI to assess medial temporal atrophy to support a clinical diagnosis of AD, but emphasizes integration with cognitive testing and, increasingly, amyloid/tau biomarkers to improve specificity [^f9b32993]. Visual rating scales are practical but less sensitive than automated volumetrics, which outperform visual reads for early detection and tracking progression, though they require quality control and standardized protocols [^b6ac6e22] [^418e173d].

> Next, I should review prognostic implications, and I need to ensure I cite longitudinal data. Faster rates of hippocampal atrophy predict progression from MCI to dementia, with hazard ratios around 1.6 per SD increase in atrophy rate in population-based cohorts, and atrophy often precedes overt clinical decline by years, supporting its use as a progression biomarker in prodromal AD [^b5ba6751]. In MCI, among amyloid-positive individuals, hippocampal atrophy predicts shorter time-to-progression better than amyloid burden, reinforcing that neurodegeneration, not amyloid alone, tracks with imminent clinical change [^cefe6928]. I should double-check that preserved hippocampal volume in MCI increases the likelihood of progression to Lewy body dementia rather than AD, which it does, highlighting competing risks and the need to interpret hippocampal size in clinical context [^70cdd0ec].

> I will now examine therapeutic and modifiability implications, and I need to be cautious not to overstate causality. Observational and interventional data suggest that physical exercise, cognitive engagement, and treatment of vascular risk factors can slow or modestly reverse age-related hippocampal atrophy, consistent with the dynamic plasticity of the hippocampus and the concept that modifiable risks shape brain aging trajectories [^748d33aa]. Let me verify pharmacologic signals: donepezil has been associated with slower hippocampal atrophy in AD cohorts, though this remains controversial and should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive proof of neuroprotection [^9deb38d5]. Stress reduction and glycemic control are reasonable, evidence-aligned strategies to mitigate hippocampal injury, particularly in prodromal stages or in metabolic disease, though randomized trials are limited [^e12ad727] [^389e3fda].

> But wait, what about measurement pitfalls that could mislead interpretation. I should confirm that automated longitudinal volumetry has nontrivial failure rates and that apparent "hippocampal growth" can reflect segmentation noise, scanner effects, or algorithmic variability; indeed, inter-algorithm concordance for annual change is poor, so results must be quality-controlled and interpreted within-platform and across-timepoints [^e4a8c91b]. Hold on, I should verify that subfield segmentation adds value but also demands rigorous QC; recent guidance emphasizes standardized pipelines and explicit reporting of QC steps to ensure valid inferences about regional vulnerabilities [^418e173d].

> Let me synthesize a practical clinical takeaway, and I should ensure it aligns with the evidence hierarchy. Hippocampal atrophy is a multifactorial, dynamic marker of neurodegeneration that reflects tau, vascular, psychiatric, traumatic, metabolic, and developmental processes; it is most useful when integrated with cognitive phenotyping and, when available, amyloid/tau biomarkers to refine etiologic specificity and prognostication [^d35c85bc] [^a9ca432d]. Clinically, I need to check for modifiable drivers such as vascular risk, obesity/diabetes, sleep apnea, depression, and TBI, and address them because they may slow atrophy and delay cognitive decline, even if they do not reverse established disease [^748d33aa] [^389e3fda]. In memory clinic workflows, quantitative hippocampal volumetrics can support early detection and staging, but I should confirm asymmetry, subfield patterns, and longitudinal change rather than rely on a single cross-sectional volume, and I must communicate uncertainty about etiology when biomarkers are unavailable [^b6ac6e22] [^e4a8c91b].

Hippocampal atrophy arises from **multifactorial causes** — neurodegenerative (Alzheimer's, tauopathies), vascular (small vessel disease, hypoperfusion), psychiatric (chronic stress, depression, PTSD), metabolic (diabetes, obesity), traumatic (TBI, hypoxia), and genetic (APOE ε4, BDNF variants) [^748d33aa] [^b91df4d7] [^047c44aa] [^013b460f] [^389e3fda] [^3cb5f40d] [^d3619180] [^b450b7cb]. It is **not specific to Alzheimer's disease** and is also seen in vascular dementia, Lewy body disease, depression, PTSD, epilepsy, and normal aging [^d35c85bc] [^047c44aa] [^a260bcef] [^b849d4f4] [^b4b77c3d] [^4038fa13]. Clinically, hippocampal atrophy impairs episodic memory and predicts progression from MCI to dementia; it is a key biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring, but **must be interpreted in clinical context** due to limited specificity [^49879942] [^b5ba6751] [^f9b32993] [^a9ca432d].

## Clinical implications of hippocampal atrophy

Hippocampal atrophy has **major clinical consequences** across neurology and psychiatry:

- **Cognitive impairment**: Episodic memory deficits are the hallmark, with deficits in spatial navigation, executive function, and processing speed also reported [^49879942] [^ae7758f7].

- **Progression to dementia**: Hippocampal atrophy is a strong predictor of progression from MCI to Alzheimer's dementia and other dementias, with faster atrophy rates indicating higher risk [^b5ba6751] [^cefe6928].

- **Diagnostic utility**: MRI-based hippocampal volumetry supports early diagnosis and differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, though specificity is limited and must be integrated with clinical and biomarker data [^f9b32993] [^a9ca432d].

- **Prognostic marker**: Baseline hippocampal volume and atrophy rate inform prognosis, guide care planning, and stratify patients for clinical trials [^f6180eec] [^6ed3ac9f].

- **Therapeutic implications**: Modifiable factors (e.g. exercise, glycemic control, stress reduction) may slow atrophy and cognitive decline, and hippocampal volume is used to monitor treatment effects in research settings [^748d33aa] [^389e3fda].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Specificity**: Hippocampal atrophy is not specific to Alzheimer's disease and can reflect mixed pathologies, requiring careful clinical and biomarker integration [^d35c85bc] [^a9ca432d].

- **Measurement variability**: Automated volumetry has technical limitations; quality control and standardized protocols are essential for reliable results [^e4a8c91b] [^418e173d].

- **Individual variability**: Age, sex, genetics, and head size influence hippocampal volume, necessitating normative adjustments and longitudinal assessment [^4038fa13] [^4376747c].

---

Hippocampal atrophy is a **multifactorial marker** of neurodegeneration with broad clinical implications. It is most impactful when interpreted alongside clinical, cognitive, and biomarker data to guide diagnosis, prognosis, and management.

Dementia is one of the most formidable health care challenges we face today. Fortunately, there is new hope for patients and clinicians because we are on the verge of anti-β-amyloid (Aβ) therapies to slow disease progression in Alzheimer disease (AD). But these new therapies are far from curative, and many challenges remain related to confounding pathologic processes and mixed disease states. These challenges are only beginning to be addressed in regard to the use of antemortem biomarkers.

### Being overweight is associated with hippocampal atrophy: the PATH through life study [^06e1bd5f]. International Journal of Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically in the past two decades, with major implications for individual well-being, population health and the economy. Of particular concern is the risk obesity presents for brain health and its consequences in an ageing population. These associations and their time course are not well understood, particularly after middle age. The aim of this study was to investigate whether being overweight/obese or having an increasing body weight is associated with hippocampal atrophy in early old age.

Methods

Participants were 420 unimpaired (Mini-Mental State Examination > 26) individuals aged 60–64 years, living in the community and taking part in a large prospective study of ageing over an 8 year follow-up. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected at three assessments and the hippocampus was manually traced by expert neuroscientists. Multi-level analyses assessing the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and hippocampal atrophy over 8 years while controlling for important covariates were conducted.

Results

Analyses showed that BMI was negatively associated with left (coefficient: -10.65mm(3); s.e. 4.81; P = 0.027) and right (coefficient: -8.18mm(3); s.e. 4.91; P = 0.097) hippocampal volume at the first assessment. Over the follow-up period, those with a higher BMI experienced greater hippocampal atrophy and more so in the left (P = 0.001) than in the right (P = 0.058) hippocampus.

Conclusions

The findings from this study provide important evidence indicating that being overweight or obese is associated with poorer brain health. These results are consistent with those of previous animal and human studies and further stress the importance of reducing the rate of obesity through education, population health interventions and policy.

### Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice: time to incorporate biomarkers? [^a9ca432d]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Hippocampal dysfunction is associated with early clinical signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Due to the limited availability or invasiveness of current biomarkers, the AD diagnosis is usually based on cognitive assessment and structural brain imaging. The recent study by Lalive and colleagues examined the specificity of brain morphometry for the AD diagnosis in a memory clinic cohort with hippocampal-type amnestic syndrome. The results indicate that memory deficits and hippocampal atrophy are similar in AD and non-AD patients, highlighting their low diagnostic specificity. These findings challenge the traditional AD diagnosis and underscore the need for biomarkers to differentiate specific neuropathological entities.

### Are vascular factors linked to the development of hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease? [^c033cf6d]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2012). Low credibility.

The hipppocampus is a brain structure located deep in the temporal lobe and is notable for its susceptibility to neurotoxic stimuli. It plays a vital role in governing learning and memory. It has been shown to be damaged by variety of factors, e.g., hypoxia, hypoperfusion, hypoglycemia, stress, and seizures, and the list of such factors keeps growing with time. Recently, the role of vascular factors in Alzheimer's disease in causing significant hippocampal damage has started emerging. Vascular factors are known to cause cerebral microlesions and contribute to many more brain pathologies. Though evidence supporting their effects on causing regional brain atrophy is mixed, several studies are indicating that medial temporal lobe may be particularly vulnerable to the damage caused by cardiovascular risk factors. Considering the association between neurodegeneration and vascular factors, a more rigorous scientific evaluation of the correlation between these two has been suggested.

5 CONCLUSION

In conclusion, a fundamental clinical and preclinical question concerns how various pathophysiological brain changes, such as hippocampal atrophy, translate into cognitive impairment in different individuals. The present findings provide support for the hypothesis that carriage of vital genetic risk alleles increases the risk for cognitive impairment. 7 With the emerging trend of large‐scale databases and advances in machine learning, 49 we foresee that future studies will allow better characterization of brain‐behavior relations at the individual level that will constitute an important step toward precision medicine.

### Modifiable factors that alter the size of the hippocampus with ageing [^748d33aa]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

The hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypoxic brain injury, obstructive sleep apnoea, bipolar disorder, clinical depression and head trauma. Patients with these conditions often have smaller hippocampi and experience a greater degree of cognitive decline than individuals without these comorbidities. Moreover, hippocampal atrophy is an established indicator for conversion from the normal ageing process to developing mild cognitive impairment and dementia. As such, an important aim is to ascertain which modifiable factors can have a positive effect on the size of the hippocampus throughout life. Observational studies and preliminary clinical trials have raised the possibility that physical exercise, cognitive stimulation and treatment of general medical conditions can reverse age-related atrophy in the hippocampus, or even expand its size. An emerging concept — the dynamic polygon hypothesis — suggests that treatment of modifiable risk factors can increase the volume or prevent atrophy of the hippocampus. According to this hypothesis, a multidisciplinary approach, which involves strategies to both reduce neurotoxicity and increase neurogenesis, is likely to be successful in delaying the onset of cognitive impairment with ageing. Further research on the constellation of interventions that could be most effective is needed before recommendations can be made for implementing preventive and therapeutic strategies.

### Hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer disease: age matters [^4038fa13]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Hippocampal atrophy is a marker of Alzheimer disease (AD). It remains unclear whether this holds true for younger patients as well. Hippocampal volume was measured on MRI scans of 103 clinically diagnosed AD patients and 73 controls (aged 51 to 85 years). Aging and AD were independently associated with smaller hippocampal volume. Both young and old AD patients have hippocampal atrophy abnormal for age. Age-dependent criteria for hippocampal atrophy, suggestive of AD, are needed.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Alzheimer's disease, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, EFNS 2010 guidelines recommend to consider CT and MRI to exclude treatable causes of dementia. Consider multislice CT and coronal MRI to assess hippocampal atrophy to support a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

Hippocampal atrophy and sclerosis

Neuroimaging studies have shown that medial temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy are associated with VaD and SVD, albeit not to the same extent as in AD. Pathological evidence shows that ischaemic VaD and SVD are also associated with hippocampal changes and atrophy remote to ischaemic injury. Hippocampal neurones in the Sommer's sector are highly vulnerable to disturbances in the cerebral circulation or hypoxia caused by systemic vascular disease. The focal loss of CA1 neurons in ischemic VaD has been related to lower hippocampal volume and memory score, but the degree of loss appears less in VaD than in AD. However, selective hippocampal neuronal shrinkage is also an important substrate for VaD. This is also evident in delayed dementia after stroke in the absence of any neurodegenerative pathology. Thus, there is a clear vascular basis for hippocampal neurodegeneration and concurs with the neuroimaging observations of hippocampal atrophy even in population-based incident VaD. The simplest mechanistic explanation for the atrophy is that the neuronal or dendritic arbour results in subsequent loss in connectivity, which contributes to brain structural and functional changes. This is consistent with the finding that soluble synaptophysin was decreased in VaD as well as AD.

Hippocampal sclerosis is a likely a major contributing factor in the hippocampal atrophy and occurs in approximately 10% of individuals over the age of 85 years and slightly higher in VaD. It is characterised by severe cell loss with the CA fields in the presence or absence of microinfarction and gliosis that is not explained by AD. TAR DNA protein 43 immunohistochemistry can be used to demonstrate that hippocampal sclerosis, regardless of accompanying pathologies (e.g. AD or vascular), is consistent with an underlying neurodegenerative pathogenetic mechanism. Any focal loss or patterns of hippocampal sclerosis can be graded and recorded together with any microinfarctions. Sometimes, the patchy neuron loss and gliosis in some brains with AD pathology may be difficult or impossible to distinguish from anoxic–ischemic change. The aetiology of hippocampal sclerosis is defined in association with a neurodegenerative process, a pathologic condition presumed to arise from hypoxic/ischemic mechanisms. Hippocampal sclerosis pathology can be associated with different underlying causes, but a large study found no evidence for associations between hippocampal sclerosis and lacunar infarcts, large infarcts, Circle of Willis atherosclerosis or CAA. However, there was a correlation between hippocampal sclerosis and arteriolosclerosis in multiple brain regions outside of the hippocampus including the frontal cortex (Brodmann area 9). This is ascribed to a pathogenetic change in aged human brain arterioles that impacts multiple brain areas and contributes to hippocampal sclerosis of ageing.

### Stress and depression: possible links to neuron death in the hippocampus [^013b460f]. Bipolar Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

Recent intriguing reports have shown an association between major depression and selective and persistent loss of hippocampal volume, prompting considerable speculation as to its underlying causes. In this paper we focus on the hypothesis that overt hippocampal neuron death could cause this loss and review current knowledge about how hippocampal neurons die during insults. We discuss (a) the trafficking of glutamate and calcium during insults; (b) oxygen radical generation and programmed cell death occurring during insults; (c) neuronal defenses against insults; (d) the role of energy availability in modulating the extent of neuron loss following such insults. The subtypes of depression associated with hippocampal atrophy typically involve significant hypersecretion of glucocorticoids, the adrenal steroids secreted during stress. These steroids have a variety of adverse affects, direct and indirect, in the hippocampus. Thus glucocorticoids may play a contributing role toward neuron death. We further discuss how glucocorticoids cause or exacerbate cellular changes associated with hippocampal neuron loss in the context of the events listed above.

### Isolating pathogenic mechanisms embedded within the hippocampal circuit through regional vulnerability [^745fff6e]. Neuron (2014). Low credibility.

Some of the most common and devastating disorders of the brain target the hippocampal formation. The hippocampal formation is a complex circuit of interconnected regions, and it is assumed that clues into the causes of these disorders are embedded within the circuit. Neuroimaging tools have been optimized to interrogate the malfunctioning hippocampal circuit, and by applying these tools to patients in the earliest stages of disease and to animal models, patterns of regional vulnerability have been established for Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and cognitive aging. More recently, studies have begun deciphering the cellular and molecular reasons underlying regional dysfunction. Collectively, this information clarifies the pathophysiology of these disorders and informs on therapeutic strategies.

### A pathophysiological framework of hippocampal dysfunction in ageing and disease [^b91df4d7]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2011). Medium credibility.

The hippocampal formation has been implicated in a growing number of disorders, from Alzheimer's disease and cognitive ageing to schizophrenia and depression. How can the hippocampal formation, a complex circuit that spans the temporal lobes, be involved in a range of such phenotypically diverse and mechanistically distinct disorders? Recent neuroimaging findings indicate that these disorders differentially target distinct subregions of the hippocampal circuit. In addition, some disorders are associated with hippocampal hypometabolism, whereas others show evidence of hypermetabolism. Interpreted in the context of the functional and molecular organization of the hippocampal circuit, these observations give rise to a unified pathophysiological framework of hippocampal dysfunction.

### Neuropathological diagnosis of vascular cognitive impairment and vascular dementia with implications for Alzheimer's disease [^78f35600]. Acta Neuropathologica (2016). Low credibility.

Vascular dementia (VaD) is recognised as a neurocognitive disorder, which is explained by numerous vascular causes in the general absence of other pathologies. The heterogeneity of cerebrovascular disease makes it challenging to elucidate the neuropathological substrates and mechanisms of VaD as well as vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Consensus and accurate diagnosis of VaD relies on wide-ranging clinical, neuropsychometric and neuroimaging measures with subsequent pathological confirmation. Pathological diagnosis of suspected clinical VaD requires adequate postmortem brain sampling and rigorous assessment methods to identify important substrates. Factors that define the subtypes of VaD include the nature and extent of vascular pathologies, degree of involvement of extra and intracranial vessels and the anatomical location of tissue changes. Atherosclerotic and cardioembolic diseases appear the most common substrates of vascular brain injury or infarction. Small vessel disease characterised by arteriolosclerosis and lacunar infarcts also causes cortical and subcortical microinfarcts, which appear to be the most robust substrates of cognitive impairment. Diffuse WM changes with loss of myelin and axonal abnormalities are common to almost all subtypes of VaD. Medial temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy accompanied by variable hippocampal sclerosis are also features of VaD as they are of Alzheimer's disease. Recent observations suggest that there is a vascular basis for neuronal atrophy in both the temporal and frontal lobes in VaD that is entirely independent of any Alzheimer pathology. Further knowledge on specific neuronal and dendro-synaptic changes in key regions resulting in executive dysfunction and other cognitive deficits, which define VCI and VaD, needs to be gathered. Hereditary arteriopathies such as cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy or CADASIL have provided insights into the mechanisms of dementia associated with cerebral small vessel disease. Greater understanding of the neurochemical and molecular investigations is needed to better define microvascular disease and vascular substrates of dementia. The investigation of relevant animal models would be valuable in exploring the pathogenesis as well as prevention of the vascular causes of cognitive impairment.

### A generalizable data-driven model of atrophy heterogeneity and progression in memory clinic settings [^6ed3ac9f]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications of atrophy heterogeneity in the absence of manifest cognitive impairment

In the present study, limbic-predominant but not hippocampal-sparing atrophy was associated with declining PACC-5 scores over 240 weeks. Meanwhile, those without significant atrophy exhibited practice effects. In both atrophy subtypes, increasing SuStaIn stage predicted steeper decline of PACC-5 scores, highlighting that not only atrophy subtype but also atrophy stage are predictive of the cognitive trajectories of patients.

When including only older adults without manifest cognitive impairment, we did not observe an absolute decline of PACC-5 scores over time in both atrophy subtypes. Instead, limbic-predominant, but not hippocampal-sparing atrophy was related to a diminished practice effect; a phenomenon that has been suggested to be an early cognitive correlate of preclinical AD. Our finding of faster cognitive decline with increasing SuStaIn stage in the hippocampal-sparing but not the limbic-predominant atrophy subtype might be attributable to the low variance of atrophy stage in these unimpaired individuals. At the same time, we show that limbic-predominant atrophy, especially with increasing atrophy stage, predicted an increased risk of progression to MCI, highlighting the clinical meaningfulness of atrophy subtype and stage before manifest cognitive impairment.

### Imaging hippocampal function across the human life span: is memory decline normal or not? [^e46c5bf8]. Annals of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Memory function commonly declines in later life. Whether memory decline represents a disease process or whether it is part of normal aging remains unknown. Here we answer this question by assessing the function of multiple subregions that make up the hippocampal circuit across the human life span. A newly developed MRI approach — designed to detect functional changes in individual hippocampal subregions — was used to assess the hippocampal circuit in 70 subjects between 20 and 88 years of age. Using strict parametric criteria, analysis revealed that function in two hippocampal subregions — the subiculum and the dentate gyrus — decline normally with age. In contrast, function in the entorhinal cortex declines pathologically. Single-subject analysis revealed that hippocampal dysfunction, found in 60% of elders was selectively correlated with memory decline. These results show that memory decline is caused by different mechanisms and suggests how memory decline should be approached clinically.

### A systems biology approach for hypothesizing the effect of genetic variants on neuroimaging features in Alzheimer's disease [^73eae653]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Neuroimaging markers provide quantitative insight into brain structure and function in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, where we lack mechanistic insights to explain pathophysiology. These mechanisms are often mediated by genes and genetic variations and are often studied through the lens of genome-wide association studies. Linking these two disparate layers (i.e., imaging and genetic variation) through causal relationships between biological entities involved in the disease's etiology would pave the way to large-scale mechanistic reasoning and interpretation.

Objective

We explore how genetic variants may lead to functional alterations of intermediate molecular traits, which can further impact neuroimaging hallmarks over a series of biological processes across multiple scales.

Methods

We present an approach in which knowledge pertaining to single nucleotide polymorphisms and imaging readouts is extracted from the literature, encoded in Biological Expression Language, and used in a novel workflow to assist in the functional interpretation of SNPs in a clinical context.

Results

We demonstrate our approach in a case scenario which proposes KANSL1 as a candidate gene that accounts for the clinically reported correlation between the incidence of the genetic variants and hippocampal atrophy. We find that the workflow prioritizes multiple mechanisms reported in the literature through which KANSL1 may have an impact on hippocampal atrophy such as through the dysregulation of cell proliferation, synaptic plasticity, and metabolic processes.

Conclusion

We have presented an approach that enables pinpointing relevant genetic variants as well as investigating their functional role in biological processes spanning across several, diverse biological scales.

### Understanding trauma-induced hippocampal subfield volume changes in the context of age and health. response to malhi et al [^cefcbb09]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

It is important to integrate findings converging from different perspectives to better contextualize hippocampal subfield changes induced by childhood trauma (CT). Here we integrate Malhi's et al. model on this issue. Understanding the complex neurobiological mechanisms underpinning CT could address the multifaceted nature of resilience to traumatic life experiences that may cause different effects in health and disease.

### Atrophy of presubiculum and subiculum is the earliest hippocampal anatomical marker of Alzheimer's disease [^6ae9796f]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2015). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

Neuropathological changes in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) typically affect the hippocampal formation very early. Therefore, neuroradiological indexes of hippocampal atrophy, and, consistent with the well-known role of the hippocampus in human declarative memory, episodic memory deficits, are among the most powerful diagnostic indexes of AD from the very early phases, corresponding to the clinical condition of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

The hippocampus is not, however, a unitary anatomical formation. Several subfields have been identified, which can be differentiated on both histological grounds, and according to their functional role in memory encoding and retrieval. There is no consensus about which subfields become atrophic earliest in the disease course or which neuropathological change is primarily implicated in volume reduction. According to some authors, neuronal loss is the main cause of atrophy. However, the three studies that provided neuronal counts in the hippocampal subfields of patients with AD report discrepant data. West et al.found the most striking AD-related neuronal loss at the level of the CA1 subfield, whereas Simic et al.reported a reduced number of neurons in the subiculum and dentate gyrus of AD patients but not in other subfields. On the other side, neuronal loss might not be the only or even the main reason for regional volume reduction of the hippocampus in AD. Indeed, Rössler et al.found a very weak correlation between the observed volume reduction and neuronal loss in the overall hippocampus of AD patients, and Mizutani and Kasahara, found that hippocampal atrophy in AD was mainly caused by degeneration of the stratum lacunosum-radiatum, which contains the perforant pathway that originates in the entorhinal cortex, rather than neuronal loss in the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus.

The aims of this cross-sectional study were to delineate the in vivo progression of atrophy in the main subfields of the hippocampus in patients diagnosed with either MCI or AD, and to determine whether atrophy in one or more specific hippocampal subfields best predict severity of episodic memory impairment.

### Subcortical gray matter volumes and 5-year dementia risk in individuals with subjective cognitive decline or mild cognitive impairment: a multi-cohort analysis [^f6180eec]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Dementia is one of the leading causes of disability and dependency worldwide, with 55 million people living with dementia globally. Diagnosis primarily relies on clinical symptoms but is often supported by neuroimaging to differentiate from non‐degenerative causes of cognitive impairment and characterize disease etiology. For example, atrophy of the medial temporal lobe and the hippocampus are commonly observed with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and widely acknowledged as an important marker of AD pathology in clinical diagnosis. Applied to prognosis for people with subjective cognitive decline (SCD)or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), such markers could tailor follow‐up strategies and care planning, as well as inclusion in trials of disease‐modifying therapy. Yet, the significance of imaging measures for determining prognosis is uncertain, depending on reliable assessment methods and sufficient discriminatory value that is unlikely achieved by any single imaging marker on its own. The increasing application of volumetric brain assessment in clinical practice offers new possibilities for improving prognostic information to patients. In particular, volumetric assessment allows for the assessment of subcortical gray matter structures that cannot be measured through visual rating scales, taking risk assessment beyond the hippocampus alone.

Prior neuroimaging studies have suggested that various subcortical brain structures play a key role in dementia pathophysiology. These gray matter structures, which are not part of the neocortex, include the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, globus pallidum, putamen, and thalamus. They are highly connected to each other and cortical gray matter and involved in a wide range of functions, including cognition, emotion, autonomic control, and language, all of which are often affected in individuals with dementia. Despite their functional relevance, few longitudinal studies have assessed the prognostic value of subcortical brain structure volumes in dementia risk beyond the hippocampus. Evidence from these studies is inconsistent, which could be attributable to differences in studied populations, disease stage, follow‐up, and brain imaging. Moreover, the role of subcortical brain structures may differ between AD and other causes of dementia, depending on the underlying dementia etiology. Therefore, larger studies covering a wide range of the neurodegenerative disease spectrum are needed to determine the role of early neurodegenerative changes within subcortical gray matter structures in risk assessment for different causes of dementia.

In this study, we aimed to determine the prognostic value of several subcortical gray matter volumes for progression to dementia in individuals with SCD or MCI. Specifically, we assessed volumes of the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, globus pallidum, putamen, and thalamus in two clinic‐based cohorts and one population‐based cohort from the United States and Europe.

### Distinct spatial contributions of amyloid pathology and cerebral small vessel disease to hippocampal morphology [^93482a3e]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) are the most common causes of dementia. Mixed pathologies co‐occur in the vast majority of patients and increase the risk of dementia. AD is characterized by the deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tau tangles, and neurodegeneration.SVD refers to neuropathological processes affecting small penetrating vessels, commonly visualized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as white matter hyperintensities (WMH), enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), lacunes, and microbleeds. Interactions between both disease processes in clinical populations highlight the need for a better understanding of the relative contributions of AD and SVD to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in individual patients.

An important point of convergence for both AD and SVD is hippocampal atrophy, a key substrate for cognitive impairment in dementia, and an important biomarker for clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic trials for AD. Hippocampal degeneration has been associated with both AD and SVD, however, studies assessing the dynamic interplay between these pathologies on hippocampal structure are scarce and their interactive effects on hippocampal morphology remain poorly understood. Specifically, it remains unresolved whether SVD pathology influences hippocampal atrophy independently, through AD‐related pathways, or both. The relationship between WMH and hippocampal volume in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients is inconclusive, showing associations in some studies that relied on clinically defined MCI, or AD, but rarely evaluated in the presence of Aβ or tau biomarkers. Additionally, little is known about the effect of regional SVD on hippocampal structure, which has not yet been investigated in the context of AD‐related biomarkers. Converging evidence supports a link between the spatial distribution of WMH and distinct pathophysiological mechanisms in AD, with anterior WMH mostly linked to deficits in regional perfusion, and posterior WMH more specifically associated with AD, highlighting the utility of a regionalized approach to reveal how SVD and AD pathologies may coexist and interact. Taken together, further understanding the pattern of hippocampal atrophy in mixed dementia with biomarker‐based tools has strong potential to disentangle the independent and/or synergistic contributions of AD pathology and vascular injury to downstream hippocampal degeneration and cognitive decline, thereby improving our understanding of the clinical impact and effective therapeutic strategies for mixed dementia.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) mechanisms and brain imaging correlates — perfusion changes and structural brain differences are described. Hippocampal atrophy in AF patients may be mediated by altered cerebral perfusion due to irregular R-R intervals, abnormal or rapid heart rate, and reduced blood pressure caused by AF. Patients with AF had lower total brain volume compared with those without AF, independent of cerebral infarction, and AF was associated with a decrease in total cerebral blood flow and brain perfusion in an unselected elderly cohort; these results may, at least in part, explain the association of AF with reduced relative brain volume and cognitive impairment.

### Clinical and neuropathological characteristics of hippocampal sclerosis: a community-based study… [^ded796e4]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Recently, several studies have suggested that hippocampal sclerosis, a pathologically diagnosed entity in which there is severe neuronal loss and gliosis in the CA-1 and subiculum region of the hippocampus, may also be an important cause of non-AD dementias. 1–6 While some of these studies have found that up to 17% of individuals with dementia have HS, others have suggested that HS may be a rare cause of dementia. All subjects gave informed consent according to guidelines approved by the human subjects review committee at the University of Washington and Group Health Cooperative. Previous reports of an association between antemortem hypoxia or hypotension and isolated neuronal loss in the hippocampal CA-1 region have suggested a pathophysiologic connection between HS and vascular disease. 35, 36 In more recent case series, it has been unclear if there is an increased frequency of vascular risk factors in HS.

1–5 Although a clinical history of stroke and the presence of white matter changes on neuroimaging were increased in our HS group, neuropathologic evidence for stroke was not more abundant in the HS cases. Corey-Bloom et al2 found evidence of pathologic change in the frontal cortex and have suggested that extension of the HS pathologic process beyond the medial temporal lobe may account for the development of cortical dysfunction on neuropsychologic testing. These findings in HS suggest a progressive process with increasing involvement of medial temporal lobe structures and extension to other cortical regions with the development of other broader clinical symptoms. The pathogenesis of HS remains unclear. One hypothesis suggests that HS is related to vascular disease. However, the inconsistent association of vascular risk factors with HS suggests that alternative processes should be considered.

The progressive clinical and pathologic picture observed in our HS cases suggests a possible neurodegenerative process. Two recent studies have suggested that HS has similarities to frontotemporal dementia, 1, 3 in particular, the subtype originally described as "dementia lacking distinctive histopathology. "43 However, as pointed out by other authors, the late age of onset for most HS cases would argue against this latter hypothesis. The etiology of and risk factors for this disorder remain speculative, although both vascular and neurodegenerative processes are hypothesized to play a role. Pathologic study of HS should include additional examination of regions outside of the medial temporal lobe to better understand the full extent of the pathologic process. Further pathophysiologic investigation of this important cause of dementia in elderly persons is needed.

### Neuropathological diagnosis of vascular cognitive impairment and vascular dementia with implications for Alzheimer's disease [^00cd380d]. Acta Neuropathologica (2016). Low credibility.

Summary

Defining the neuropathological substrates of VaD relies on uniformity in sampling and careful pathological examination. VaD resulting from severe VCI or vascular cognitive disorder or from delayed impairment after stroke appears to result from the accumulation of several lesions including cerebral atrophy. While robust neuropathological criteria for VaD are still being developed, multiple microinfarcts, small infarcts or lacunes in the subcortical structures rather than macroinfarction or large vessel disease appear most robustly related to cognitive impairment. Diffuse WM changes involving periventricular and deeper regions are frequent in VaD. Concomitant hippocampal pathology including sclerosis and Alzheimer pathology compound disease progression. Further definitions of the neuropathological correlates of VaD and investigation of genetic models would be valuable for exploring the pathogenesis as well as management of VaD through preventative and treatment strategies.

### Hippocampal structures among Japanese adolescents before and after the COVID-19 pandemic… [^bc611f87]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Hence, we speculated that environmental complexity associated with hippocampal structural changes may remain stable. Contrastingly, stress reduction in adolescents in the pn-TTC, stemming from various factors such as increased time with family members and diminished pressure from examinations and peers, may be the primary cause of hippocampal changes. The current study demonstrated that the first SoE declared for the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a volumetric increase of the whole hippocampus during adolescent development. Increased subfield volumes in the GC-ML-DG, CA4, and HATA and increased hippocampal microstructural integration were also observed; however, these findings are less robust due to the potential influence of the multiple comparison problem.

Nevertheless, all findings collectively demonstrate that a major life event may impact the development of hippocampal structure during middle adolescence, at least at the whole hippocampus level, further suggesting the plasticity and vulnerability of the adolescent hippocampus. Many studies have shown that patients with PTSD who had been exposed to inherently stressful traumatic events always had a smaller hippocampal volume compared with healthy controls. 29, 30 Furthermore, higher levels of perceived stress were associated with a decreased adult or adolescent hippocampal volume. 31, 32 Hence, stressful experiences accompanying the COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with hippocampal volume atrophy. Since the alterations in the hippocampal structures were based on the log transformation for MRI collection dates after the SoE, the association of SoE with the hippocampal structures might be transient.

Prior animal studies suggested the effects of stress on hippocampal dendritic structures are largely reversible, such as dendritic branching patterns taking 25 days to return to prestress levels after cessation of chronic stress for adolescents. 9, 35 Furthermore, the strength and duration of stress are highly associated with hippocampal structural changes. 36 Since MRI acquisition restarted from July 31, 2020, we could not collect data from numerous participants in a short period of time. The continued low stress level during the SoE and few intermittent MRI scans after recovery of data collection, as well as the reversibility of the hippocampus, allowed us to hypothesize that the association of SoE with hippocampal structures should follow an exponential decay function. Additionally, as expected, binary and linear functions could not capture subtle changes in hippocampal structures.

Therefore, our findings suggest that the reversibility of the hippocampal plasticity may allow us to continue to delineate the longitudinal normative development of the hippocampus.

### Longitudinal neuroanatomical and cognitive progression of posterior cortical atrophy [^b46c74a1]. Brain (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Considerable heterogeneity is evident among individuals with Alzheimer's disease both clinically (e.g. amnesic, visual, dysexecutive/behavioural and aphasic presentations of Alzheimer's disease) and pathologically (e.g. hippocampal sparing and limbic-predominant Alzheimer's disease subtypes accounting for 25% of cases). This heterogeneity provides an important opportunity to explore the factors that promote or inhibit disease progression, both spatially and temporally. One recent example is the discovery of structural variations in amyloid-β fibrils between individuals with rapidly and slowly progressing forms of Alzheimer's disease. In this context, longitudinal quantitative tracking of variations in regional tissue damage in large cohorts of patients with different phenotypic expressions of a disease can reveal the temporal profiles of disease evolution and permit testing of the hypothesis that differentially distributed molecular lesions predict particular patterns of disease progression.

### Cerebral atrophy in mild cognitive impairment: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^7bde236c]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis is mainly based on cognitive assessment, reliable estimates of structural changes in specific brain regions, that could be contrasted against normal brain aging and inform diagnosis, are lacking. This study aimed to systematically review the literature reporting on MCI-related brain changes.

Methods

The MEDLINE database was searched for studies investigating longitudinal structural changes in MCI. Studies with compatible data were included in the meta-analyses. A qualitative review was conducted for studies excluded from meta-analyses.

Results

The analyses revealed a 2.2-fold higher volume loss in the hippocampus, 1.8-fold in the whole brain, and 1.5-fold in the entorhinal cortex in MCI participants.

Discussion

Although the medial temporal lobe is likely to be more vulnerable to MCI pathology, atrophy in this brain area represents a relatively small proportion of whole brain loss, suggesting that future investigations are needed to identify the source of unaccounted volume loss in MCI.

### Reality is in the posterior hippocampus: who knew? [^517ab94d]. Epilepsy Currents (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite our new understanding of the importance of the posterior region of the hippocampus, etiologic explanations may still be elusive. However, at least we know now that even if the timing of the actual symptoms varies, the underlying problem is structural. The timing of psychotic symptomatology, for example, postictal, interictal, and so on, may be irrelevant. This in itself is a major paradigmatic change. The fact that psychotic symptom presence is more associated with a structural finding than with the timing of the seizure activity forces reexamination of how we define the reality of this comorbidity.

### The dynamics of cortical and hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer disease… [^49879942]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions Alzheimer disease–specific cortical thinning and hippocampal volume loss are consistent with a sigmoidal pattern, with an acceleration phase during the early stages of the disease. Clinical trials should carefully consider the nonlinear behavior of these AD biomarkers. Cognitive decline and the dementia stage of Alzheimer disease are the clinical manifestations of the cumulative burden of multiple neuropathologic insults. Postmortem studies1, 2 indicate that an evolution of neuropathologic insults can be observed during the initial stages of AD, with intracellular tau-associated neurofibrillary tangles first appearing in medial temporal and limbic isocortical regions and extracellular amyloid-β –associated plaques affecting heteromodal association cortices. Gray matter atrophy, resulting from the loss of neuronal, glial, and neuropil volume, is reflected as diminished cortical thickness in vulnerable regions15, 16 and decreased volume of the hippocampus.

17 Building on the findings of prior longitudinal clinical, cognitive, and imaging studies3, 7, 18–22 and a recent theoretical model of the Alzheimer's pathologic cascade, 23 we hypothesized that AD-specific cortical and hippocampal atrophy follows a sigmoidal pattern with initial acceleration followed by deceleration during the later stages of the disease. Moreover, our analyses suggest that AD-specific cortical thinning in CN individuals is mostly associated with β-amyloid and not tau. The recently demonstrated tight coupling between hippocampal atrophy and episodic memory impairment42 further suggests that significant volume loss in the hippocampus may be associated with clinical symptoms and therefore is unlikely to occur during a preclinical phase. That is, hippocampal atrophy may mark the transition to cognitive symptoms. Thickness in AD-vulnerable cortical ROIs and hippocampal volume are significantly reduced during aMCI and clinical AD.

Consistent with data from prior studies, 5–8, 18 rates of AD-specific cortical thinning and hippocampal volume loss also are significantly elevated and correlate with concurrent cognitive decline. Our longitudinal observation is in broad agreement with a recent cross-sectional characterization of the dynamics of AD biomarkers, 24 in which a sigmoidal pattern of hippocampal atrophy was demonstrated. Building on data from prior serial imaging studies, 7, 14, 18 our results demonstrate that AD-specific brain atrophy is characterized by early acceleration, possibly driven by cumulative insults, such as amyloid toxicity, tangle deposition, and neuronal and synaptic dysfunction, followed by late deceleration, constrained by the diminishing residual intact tissue.

### Clinical and imaging markers of cardiac function and brain health: a meta-analysis of community-based studies [^7e8704fb]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The hippocampus was also significantly smaller in participants with clinically overt heart failure in our study, despite comparable atrophy in white and GM. These findings align with a previous report, where the prevalence of hippocampal atrophy among patients with clinical heart failure was as high as 34.6%. In the same study, hippocampal atrophy was found to be an independent predictor of a poor prognosis following heart failure. The latter could reflect confounding by indication because some of the patients in that study were admitted for treatment of worsening heart failure. Findings from this study suggest that hippocampal atrophy may even occur at subclinical stages of cardiac dysfunction, indicating a potential vulnerability in affected individuals. Longitudinal studies remain necessary to determine whether these structural brain changes translate into cognitive decline over time. The observed effect sizes, while modest, point to important underlying pathways that may have long-term clinical implications.

### Quantitative neuroimaging software for clinical assessment of hippocampal volumes on MR imaging [^526f8d91]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Relevance of hippocampal volumetrics in AD is applicable not only to accurate and early diagnosis but also for preventive approaches due to increasing recognition of lifestyle factors in AD risk reduction. The hippocampus is an increasingly identified target of risk modification in AD. Lifestyle factors from obesity to physical activity and diet have been shown to influence hippocampal structure measured on quantitative MR imaging volumetrics. Such prevention strategies will be needed as the number of persons with AD is projected to increase from 5.1 million in 2015 to 13.8 million by 2050.

Hippocampal volumetrics can also provide additional important information in diagnosis and treatment of other disorders. Mild traumatic brain injury, for example, can present with hippocampal atrophy that can be detected with MR imaging in collegiate football players. Longitudinal assessment of hippocampal volume in a prospective study of 62 moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients secondary to trauma also showed abnormal low volumes evaluated on MR imaging at 3 and 12 months. Hippocampal volume loss is also related to combat service and post-traumatic stress disorder. Hippocampal volume has been suggested as a viable treatment biomarker in major depressive disorder. Additionally, hippocampal volume can aid in distinguishing bipolar from unipolar depression. Severity of hippocampal volume is also useful in assessment of psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, has a larger degree of volume loss on MRI quantified volumes, particularly in the presubiculum and subiculum compared to bipolar. Mesial temporal sclerosis, which is seen in 65% of persons with temporal lobe epilepsy, can present with hippocampal atrophy. Asymmetry of such hippocampal atrophy has been shown to distinguish temporal lobe epilepsy, the cause of 60% of all epilepsy cases, from controls with 94% accuracy. Hippocampal volumetric asymmetry may also be used to predict laterality of seizure activity in medial temporal lobe epilepsy. Imaging the hippocampus is therefore important for neurodegenerative and non-neurodegenerative diseases.

### Atrophy of presubiculum and subiculum is the earliest hippocampal anatomical marker of Alzheimer's disease [^17f9ab4f]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2015). Low credibility.

In conclusion, our data point to a nonhomogeneous pattern of atrophy in the hippocampus of AD patients, with prevalent involvement of the presubicular-subicular complex from the very early phases of the disease that is still evident in the most advanced phases. This finding is consistent with neuropathological observations in AD patients, and it is likely the macroscopic expression of the severe degeneration of fibers in the perforant pathway. An obvious clinical application of the presently reported data would be to evaluate the effectiveness of this pattern of regional hippocampal atrophy in predicting the conversion from MCI to fully developed clinical AD. To resolve this issue, further research is needed in larger groups of patients followed longitudinally for an adequate number of years.

Research in context

1 Systematic review: There is no consensus about which hippocampal subfields become atrophic earliest in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or which neuropathological change is primarily implicated in volume reduction.
2 Interpretation: Our data point to a prevalent atrophy of the presubicular-subicular complex from the early phases of AD. This could represent the morphological counterpart of the functional isolation of the hippocampus from both the afferent and efferent neural inputs that underlie the declarative memory loss in individuals with AD.
3 Future directions: An obvious clinical application of the presently reported data would be to evaluate the effectiveness of this pattern of regional hippocampal atrophy in predicting the conversion from MCI to fully developed clinical AD. To resolve this issue, further research is needed in larger groups of patients followed longitudinally for an adequate number of years.

### Longitudinal association between hippocampus atrophy and episodic-memory decline in non-demented ε 4 carriers [^7975b902]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the major genetic risk factor for late‐onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). 1, 2, 3 Studies show accelerated hippocampal 4 and episodic‐memory 5 decline in AD patients with the APOE ε4 allele. In a study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies, an association between memory recall scores and hippocampal volume was restricted to APOE ε4 carriers. 6 Such a change‐change relation provides evidence for correlated changes of hippocampus structure and memory in APOE ε4 carriers. The lack of an association in ε4 non‐carriers was suggested to be due to other factors being more relevant for the hippocampus‐memory relation in this group. This suggestion is in line with a model in which genetic variation influences how the AD pathological changes confer greater cognitive impairment in some individuals, that is, those with more risk alleles. 7 As such, this topic pertains to the fundamental clinical and preclinical question of how various pathophysiological brain changes translate into cognitive impairment in different individuals.

In non‐demented individuals, the support for a longitudinal hippocampus‐episodic memory change‐change relation is limited, 8, 9, 10, 11 but APOE ε4 has been associated with accelerated cognitive aging 12, 13, 14 and hippocampal atrophy. 15, 16 Thus a differential influence of APOE ε4 on brain‐cognition associations, reflecting greater phenotype‐relevant heterogeneity in non‐carriers, might characterize also cognitively normal older adults and preclinical dementia. However, no study to date has comprehensively assessed the longitudinal interrelationships among hippocampus atrophy, episodic‐memory decline, and APOE ε4 in healthy, non‐demented individuals.

Herein, we tested the hypothesis of a difference in longitudinal relations between hippocampal atrophy and linear episodic memory changes between non‐demented APOE ε4 carriers and non‐carriers.

### Regional hippocampal atrophy reflects memory impairment in patients with early relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis [^82b6e363]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Research work has shown that hippocampal subfields are atrophic to varying extents in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. However, studies examining the functional implications of subfield-specific hippocampal damage in early MS are limited. We aim to gain insights into the relationship between hippocampal atrophy and memory function by investigating the correlation between global and regional hippocampal atrophy and memory performance in early MS patients.

Methods

From the Italian Neuroimaging Network Initiative (INNI) dataset, we selected 3D-T1-weighted brain MRIs of 219 early relapsing remitting (RR)MS and 246 healthy controls (HC) to identify hippocampal atrophic areas. At the time of MRI, patients underwent Selective-Reminding-Test (SRT) and Spatial-Recall-Test (SPART) and were classified as mildly (MMI-MS: n.110) or severely (SMI-MS: n:109) memory impaired, according to recently proposed cognitive phenotypes.

Results

Early RRMS showed lower hippocampal volumes compared to HC (p < 0.001), while these did not differ between MMI-MS and SMI-MS. In MMI-MS, lower hippocampal volumes correlated with worse memory tests (r = 0.23–0.37, p ≤ 0.01). Atrophic voxels were diffuse in the hippocampus but more prevalent in cornu ammonis (CA, 79%) than in tail (21%). In MMI-MS, decreased subfield volumes correlated with decreases in memory, particularly in the right CA1 (SRT-recall: r = 0.38; SPART: r = 0.34, p < 0.01). No correlations were found in the SMI-MS group.

Conclusion

Hippocampal atrophy spreads from CA to tail from early disease stages. Subfield hippocampal atrophy is associated with memory impairment in MMI-MS, while this correlation is lost in SMI-MS. This plays in favor of a limited capacity for an adaptive functional reorganization of the hippocampi in MS patients.

### Your algorithm might think the hippocampus grows in Alzheimer's disease: caveats of longitudinal automated hippocampal volumetry [^e4a8c91b]. Human Brain Mapping (2017). Low credibility.

Hippocampal atrophy rate-measured using automated techniques applied to structural MRI scans-is considered a sensitive marker of disease progression in Alzheimer's disease, frequently used as an outcome measure in clinical trials. Using publicly accessible data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we examined 1-year hippocampal atrophy rates generated by each of five automated or semiautomated hippocampal segmentation algorithms in patients with Alzheimer's disease, subjects with mild cognitive impairment, or elderly controls. We analyzed MRI data from 398 and 62 subjects available at baseline and at 1 year at MRI field strengths of 1.5 T and 3 T, respectively. We observed a high rate of hippocampal segmentation failures across all algorithms and diagnostic categories, with only 50.8% of subjects at 1.5 T and 58.1% of subjects at 3 T passing stringent segmentation quality control. We also found that all algorithms identified several subjects (between 2.94% and 48.68%) across all diagnostic categories showing increases in hippocampal volume over 1 year. For any given algorithm, hippocampal "growth" could not entirely be explained by excluding patients with flawed hippocampal segmentations, scan-rescan variability, or MRI field strength. Furthermore, different algorithms did not uniformly identify the same subjects as hippocampal "growers", and showed very poor concordance in estimates of magnitude of hippocampal volume change over time (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.319 at 1.5 T and 0.149 at 3 T). This precluded a meaningful analysis of whether hippocampal "growth" represents a true biological phenomenon. Taken together, our findings suggest that longitudinal hippocampal volume change should be interpreted with considerable caution as a biomarker.

### Lack of correlation between hippocampal substructure atrophy and attention dysfunction in deficit schizophrenia [^fba732fa]. Schizophrenia (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclussion

To date, few studies have investigated the pattern of hippocampal atrophy at the subregional level in DS patients. We found that the cognitive function of the HC, NDS, DS groups showed a horizontal step-wise decline, accompanied by a subregional level of hippocampal atrophy. This subregion-level volume shrinkage was associated with poor performance on tests of cognitive function. Studying hippocampal subregional atrophy patterns has important implications for gaining a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of cognitive deficits in DS. An immediate clinical implication is the identification of subregional atrophy patterns in DS, thereby enabling clinicians to identify patients with first-episode schizophrenia who are at higher risk for cognitive impairment.

### Selective perforant-pathway atrophy in Huntington disease: MRI analysis of hippocampal subfields [^7345e976]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder, arising from an unstable trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin (Htt) gene. The typical diagnosis of HD is marked by the presence of choreiform movements in middle age, accompanied by an array of dysexecutive neurocognitive and behavioral symptoms. Although these clinical manifestations are commonly attributed to the frontostriatum, longitudinal studies have revealed widespread brain and cognitive changes that predate the motor onset, and that are not frontostriatally mediated. In particular, a significant body of work has implicated hippocampal involvement in HD.

Many facets of hippocampal dysfunction are commonly observed in early HD. Notably, successive studies both in human and mouse models have reported visuospatial memory deficit that is analogous and hippocampal‐mediated. This cognitive correlate presents as a promising measure for translating findings from animal models to human in HD as it is also associated with motor onset and disease progression. In contrast, whole hippocampal atrophy has not been identified consistently in the early stages of HD, but it is apparent and accelerated in the middle to late symptomatic stages. Given the discrepancy between the hippocampal impairment and structural involvement in early HD, hippocampal atrophy may be confined to certain subfields, and may not be apparent when measured as a whole.

Evidence from multiple sources overwhelmingly points to Aβ as the initiating molecular pathway in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Many in the field believe that mildly impaired subjects with biomarker evidence of brain Aβ amyloidosis can be presumed to have early Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, mildly impaired or demented individuals who have negative Aβ amyloid biomarker studies may be presumed to have non-Alzheimer's disease pathogenic substrates. Thus subjects with mild cognitive impairment who are amyloid positive can be treated as qualitatively different from those who are amyloid negative on conceptual grounds. Our intent in the amyloid positive subset analysis was to compare MRI and Aβ load in those subjects with mild cognitive impairment who probably have Alzheimer's disease as the dominant pathology. An obvious criticism of this analysis is that we have restricted the range of Aβ load values, thus handicapping Aβ measures relative to MRI. Hippocampal atrophy is not specific for Alzheimer's disease as it occurs in other degenerative conditions, however, we can assume that in a cognitively impaired subject with 'pure Alzheimer's disease pathology' the hippocampal atrophy observed is largely due to the Alzheimer's disease pathological process. By including the full range of hippocampal values in this subset analysis, we have simply included the full range of neurodegenerative atrophy due to the Alzheimer's disease pathological process.

### Smaller hippocampal volume predicts pathologic vulnerability to psychological trauma [^b849d4f4]. Nature Neuroscience (2002). Medium credibility.

In animals, exposure to severe stress can damage the hippocampus. Recent human studies show smaller hippocampal volume in individuals with the stress-related psychiatric condition posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Does this represent the neurotoxic effect of trauma, or is smaller hippocampal volume a pre-existing condition that renders the brain more vulnerable to the development of pathological stress responses? In monozygotic twins discordant for trauma exposure, we found evidence that smaller hippocampi indeed constitute a risk factor for the development of stress-related psychopathology. Disorder severity in PTSD patients who were exposed to trauma was negatively correlated with the hippocampal volume of both the patients and the patients' trauma-unexposed identical co-twin. Furthermore, severe PTSD twin pairs-both the trauma-exposed and unexposed members-had significantly smaller hippocampi than non-PTSD pairs.

### Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice: time to incorporate biomarkers? [^d35c85bc]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

The low diagnostic accuracy of standard diagnostic procedures may be due to challenges in interpreting memory impairment and hippocampal atrophy. While memory impairment is sensitive to AD pathology, its specificity is limited because profound episodic memory impairment is present in other dementias, such as behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD). To increase the specificity of cognitive assessment for the AD diagnosis, the ASHT, defined as low free recall that does not improve with cueing despite the controlled encoding, has been postulated. Although this pattern predicts progression to AD dementia in MCI patients and correlates with hippocampal volume, neither cross-sectional nor longitudinal studies have confirmed the superiority of the tests using controlled encoding and cued recall over standard memory tests. A similar problem of low specificity applies to hippocampal atrophy, which is an important feature of other dementias such as bvFTD, LBD, or semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia. It is worth noting that neuropathological studies have shown that medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy is associated with dementia, but is not specific to individual pathologies.

Emerging disease-modifying therapies for AD have increased the urgent need for its early and accurate diagnosis. Diagnosis is particularly challenging in neurodegenerative diseases where memory impairment and hippocampal atrophy are dominant features. Such a group of neurodegenerative diseases in which amyloid-β is absent (i.e. with negative amyloid PET imaging or normal CSF amyloid-β) is referred to as suspected non-Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology (SNAP), and common examples include primary age-related tauopathy (PART) and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE).

PART is characterized by neurofibrillary tangles that accumulate predominantly in the MTL in the absence of amyloid plaques. Clinically, PART presents with slowly progressive memory impairment, but slower psychomotor speed and executive dysfunction may be present. Importantly, PART typically presents as an MCI syndrome without progression to dementia because the distribution of pathological changes is limited to the MTL. PET imaging has been shown to be a useful diagnostic tool for PART, with a negative amyloid PET imaging indicating the absence of amyloid pathology, and a positive tau PET imaging indicating the presence of tau pathology confined to the MTL.

### Molecular mechanisms of traumatic brain injury: the missing link in management [^3cb5f40d]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Long term pathophysiology

Recent advances in the management of severe acute TBI has resulted in improved outcomes for patients who might previously have had poor outcomes. In particular the management of such patients in specialist units has had a significant impact, although the definitive factors contributing to improved outcomes remain elusive. In recent years there has been increasing interest in elucidating the long term problems experienced by patients following TBI. Further, there have been reports of people developing dementia-like symptoms following relatively minor head injuries (Brain injury with a GCS greater than 13 and without loss of consciousness, as well as an increased incidence of post traumatic stress disorders and depression. TBI causes a generalised atrophy of brain which is proportional to the severity of the injury. The mechanisms for this are yet to be fully determined. In rats it has been shown that there are multiple antibodies to the amyloid precursor protein and amyloid precursor protein-like proteins for up to six months, which predisposes them to degeneration of the striatum and corpus callosum. This degeneration then leads to progressive brain atrophy and calcifications. In moderate to severe TBI there is a high incidence of hippocampal atrophy which predisposes patients to cognitive decline. When anoxic brain damage was compared to TBI there was no overwhelming evidence of localised nerve damage. This supports the theory that the final mechanism for neurological injury is the same irrespective of the type of initial insult.

### Perinatal compromise affects development, form, and function of the hippocampus part one; clinical studies [^b7fb5f4d]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The clinical evidence presented within this review, focused on normal hippocampal development, followed by pregnancy and birth complications, clearly indicates that the hippocampus is highly susceptible to perinatal compromise. Premature birth FGR and HIE are common complications of pregnancy, and all have the potential to impact the gross structure and organisation of the hippocampus, with negative consequences for long-term function. The most frequent pathological observation in clinical studies of perinatal compromise and hippocampal development is a reduction in total hippocampal volume. Reduced hippocampal volume is seen across all perinatal complications outlined in the current review, as evidenced from the MRI undertaken from as early as term-equivalent age in infants born pretermthrough to adolescence. Current literature has established an association between suboptimal hippocampal structure and deficits in learning and memory. Moreover, damage to the hippocampus has profound and lasting impacts on behaviour and motor function and is associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. In Part 2 of this review, we focus on the extensive preclinical literature on this topic which gives insight into mechanisms underlying observed hippocampal deficits, and potential therapeutic targets designed to protect the hippocampus in the presence of pregnancy complications.

### Quantitative neuroimaging software for clinical assessment of hippocampal volumes on MR imaging [^b6ac6e22]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The hippocampus is a vital temporal lobe structure in memory and loses volume in multiple brain disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, and mesial temporal sclerosis from temporal lobe epilepsy. There are therefore multiple diseases in which clinicians could derive actionable information from hippocampal volume. Of the disorders listed above, AD has received the most attention with respect to potentially applying hippocampal volumes in clinical practice.

Currently for any person suspected having AD, the standard of care includes obtaining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. However, the main purpose of doing so is to exclude any other causes of cognitive impairment (e.g. tumor, large stroke) as opposed to directly assessing the patterns of atrophy for indications of AD. The hippocampus is one of the first structures affected by the neuropathology of AD that is visible with MR imaging and the extent of atrophy correlates strongly with general and domain specific tests of cognitive function. One pathology study found that visual assessments by two experienced neuroradiologists of the size of the hippocampus on MR imaging was insensitive for detecting early stage AD, with only 27% sensitivity. Thus, while visual assessments cannot detect early hippocampal pathology, such identification is possible with quantitative approaches. An Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study also showed that quantitative hippocampal volumetrics with FreeSurfer in 189 subjects (49 controls, 89 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 50 with AD) were superior to visual ratings both for identifying controls from persons with MCI and for tracking progression from MCI to AD over 3.2 years. Hippocampal volumetrics can therefore longitudinally assess progression in those at earlier stages of neurodegeneration.

### Rates of hippocampal atrophy and presence of post-mortem TDP-43 in patients with Alzheimer's disease: a longitudinal retrospective study [^f5a9ba50]. The Lancet: Neurology (2017). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by the presence of two abnormal proteins, beta-amyloid and tau. Hippocampal atrophy is one of the main features of Alzheimer's disease. Cross-sectional MRI-histological studies of Alzheimer's disease have found smaller hippocampal volumes to be associated with beta-amyloidand tau deposition. Over time, patients with Alzheimer's disease classically show increased rates of hippocampal atrophy. Not surprising therefore, is the belief that hippocampal atrophy is related to beta-amyloid and tau. Intriguingly, two longitudinal MRI-histological studies have assessed whether rates of hippocampal atrophy are associated with beta-amyloid and tau, and surprisingly, neither study found an association with either protein. Given that hippocampal atrophy is one of the key features of Alzheimer's disease, it is of dire importance to understand the basis of increased hippocampal atrophy rates.

### Coupling between hippocampal parenchymal fraction and cortical Grey matter atrophy at different stages of cognitive decline [^31c75c88]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

Hippocampal atrophy is a significant brain marker of pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hippocampal parenchymal fraction (HPF) was recently developed to better assess the hippocampal volumetric integrity, and it has been shown to be a sensitive measure of hippocampal atrophy in AD.

Objective:

To investigate the clinical relevance of hippocampal volumetric integrity as measured by the HPF and the coupling between the HPF and brain atrophy during AD progression.

Methods:

We included data from 143 cognitively normal (CN), 101 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 125 AD participants. We examined group differences in the HPF, associations between HPF and cognitive ability, and coupling between the HPF and cortical grey matter volume in the CN, MCI, and AD groups.

Results:

We observed progressive decreases in HPF from CN to MCI and from MCI to AD, and increases in the asymmetry of HPF, with the lowest asymmetry index (AI) in the CN group and the highest AI in the AD group. There was a significant association between HPF and cognitive ability across participants. The coupling between HPF and cortical regions was observed in bilateral hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, temporal, frontal, and occipital regions, thalamus, and amygdala in CN, MCI, and AD groups, with a greater involvement of temporal, occipital, frontal, and subcortical regions in MCI and AD patients, especially in AD patients.

Conclusion:

This study provides novel evidence for the neuroanatomical basis of cognitive decline and brain atrophy during AD progression, which may have important clinical implications for the prognosis of AD.

### Coupling between hippocampal parenchymal fraction and cortical Grey matter atrophy at different stages of cognitive decline [^1d934c5d]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disorder and recognized as the most prevalent cause of dementia. Cognitive decline in AD is found to be closely linked to brain atrophy in a variety of regions as revealed by studies using the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique, and among these regions, hippocampus, a brain structure in the medial temporal lobe, has been proposed as a core neuroimaging biomarker of AD. In the past two decades, numerous studies have shown significant grey matter atrophy of the hippocampus in patients with both mild cognitive impairments (MCI) and AD. Further, many studies have also reported a right-greater-than-left asymmetry of hippocampal volume in normal aging, MCI, and AD. Together, previous findings have suggested that atrophy and asymmetry of the hippocampus may be key features underlying the pathology of AD.

Though hippocampal volume is a direct and commonly used measurement of hippocampal atrophy, it per se may not be ideal for characterizing hippocampal degeneration in AD progression because the hippocampal volume is highly heterogeneous across subjects and strongly influenced by the individual's brain size. To overcome this issue, in recent years, a novel measure, i.e. hippocampal parenchymal fraction (HPF), was developed to better characterize the volumetric integrity of the hippocampus. Specifically, the HPF is an estimate of the fraction of brain parenchyma in a predefined adaptive hippocampal region of interest (ROI), which captures the relative volume and change between brain parenchyma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the ROI. Lower HPF values indicate lower hippocampal volumetric integrity, i.e. higher hippocampal atrophy. Unlike traditional measurements of hippocampal volume, the HPF is computed quickly (< 1 min per scan) and reliably (< 2% failure rate), and can be applied to raw MRI images without any preprocessing.

### Importance of the caspase cleavage site in amyloid-β protein precursor [^47a87b5d]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Reports from multiple laboratories have now been published analyzing the critical nature of the caspase cleavage site of amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) for cell death induction, synaptic loss, hippocampal atrophy, long-term potentiation, memory loss, neophobia, and other aspects of the Alzheimer's phenotype. Here we review the results and implications of these studies for the understanding of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology and the potential development of therapeutics that target this site in AβPP.

Conclusion

This study provides novel evidence for the neuroanatomical basis of cognitive decline and brain atrophy during AD progression, which may have important clinical implications for the prognosis of AD.

### Are hippocampal size differences in posttraumatic stress disorder mediated by sleep pathology? [^24c38b3d]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2014). Low credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with smaller volumes of the hippocampus, as has been demonstrated by meta-analyses. Proposed mechanistic relationships are reviewed briefly, including the hypothesis that sleep disturbances mediate the effects of PTSD on hippocampal volume. Evidence for this includes findings that insomnia and restricted sleep are associated with changes in hippocampal cell regulation and impairments in cognition. We present results of a new study of 187 subjects in whom neither PTSD nor poor sleep was associated with lower hippocampal volume. We outline a broad research agenda centered on the hypothesis that sleep changes mediate the relationship between PTSD and hippocampal volume.

### Rates of β-amyloid accumulation are independent of hippocampal neurodegeneration [^dfd9e239]. Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Data in the present study support 2 key aspects of this late-onset AD model. First, rates of Aβ accumulation were not influenced by hippocampal neurodegeneration at baseline. Thus, to the extent that hippocampal atrophy at baseline reflects tau-related neurodegeneration, our data support the concept that the rate of Aβ accumulation is biologically independent from tau-related neurodegeneration. Second, we found that AD-signature atrophy rates were elevated only in participants with evidence of both Aβ and hippocampal atrophy at baseline. We can assume that nearly all our subjects had some medial temporal tauopathy at baseline; therefore, to the extent that hippocampal atrophy reflects tau-related neurodegeneration, our data support the concept that Aβ pathophysiology accelerates tau-related neurodegeneration. Furthermore, our AD-signature meta-ROI included areas outside the medial temporal lobe, thus supporting the notion that Aβ may enhance spread of tau-related neurodegeneration from allocortex to association neocortex.

### Regional hippocampal atrophy reflects memory impairment in patients with early relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis [^2cf9fa0d]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this multicenter study, we found that hippocampal atrophy is a distinctive feature of the early stages of MS and might represent a reliable marker of memory dysfunction, particularly in patients with mild impairment. When we performed an analysis of hippocampal subfields to explore the different vulnerability of the hippocampal structures to MS-related pathogenic mechanisms, we found a relevant role of the CA adding to previous studies on the specific susceptibility of this region to damage and its subsequent impact on memory function.

We observed significant hippocampal atrophy in both the right and left hippocampi of MS patients when compared to HC, indicating widespread tissue damage in the hippocampus during the early stages of the disease. These findings align with recent MRI studies that have also reported a decrease in hippocampal volume not only at the initial demyelinating event but also over time, suggesting ongoing structural changes in the hippocampus throughout the course of the disease. Importantly, our study extends previous research by demonstrating that, despite the presence of similar hippocampal atrophy in patients with MMI-MS and SMI-MS during the early stages of the disease, only the MMI-MS subgroup exhibited a correlation between hippocampal volumes and memory performance. This might be due to other mechanisms that contribute to memory impairment from the earliest stages of the disease, which cannot be solely explained by reduced hippocampal volume. In line with this hypothesis, a recent study has identified different cognitive phenotypes in MS and found a selective and clinically meaningful hippocampal atrophy in the mildly impaired group, while a widespread brain atrophy and high lesion load was detected in severely impaired patients.

### Evidence of a relation between hippocampal volume, white matter hyperintensities, and cognition in subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment [^3ec21b5e]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study consolidates the notion that SCD represents a valid research target to better understand the preclinical phase of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. The notion of SCD complements the criteria that were established to characterize MCI by bringing an even earlier dimension to AD and similar age-related neurodegeneration. This may have important implications, as studying this population might contribute to identifying the processes that contribute to AD at a very early stage. This is critical because disease-modifying treatments should ideally be offered as early as possible. Thus, the SCD and MCI periods may be fundamental for drug development and implementation of very early secondary prevention approaches.

### Brain MRI correlates of cognitive dysfunction in type 2 diabetes: the needle recovered from the haystack? [^25a54979]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Nevertheless, the findings from Moran et al. do show that cognitive decrements in people with diabetes appear to be attributable to structural changes on MRI. These changes may very well contribute to the increased dementia risk in people with diabetes, but what is their etiology? In the current study cortical and hippocampal atrophy appeared to be the main determinants of diabetes-associated cognitive decrements. Should we therefore rule out vascular damage as a causative factor? Probably not. Atrophy has proven to be a very consistent MRI correlate of diabetes. Diabetes is also linked to vascular lesions like lacunes, but because these lesions are much less common, the a priori likelihood of these lesions to explain the diabetes-associated cognitive decrements is much smaller. The point is that current MRI markers may not fully capture the burden of vascular brain lesions. Sensitive markers of white matter disturbances, which will be at least partially caused by vascular damage, are also clearly linked to impaired cognition in type 2 diabetes. Moreover, autopsy studies point to vascular damage rather than Alzheimer-type pathology as a major source of the increased dementia risk in people with diabetes. So then what is the etiological significance of diabetes-associated brain atrophy? The point is that cerebral atrophy can be a feature of many conditions. The pathological changes that underlie atrophy are heterogeneous and do not necessarily reflect neuronal loss. Neuropathological correlates of loss of cortical gray matter volume on MRI, in the context of aging, vascular disease, and dementia, include subcortical vascular pathology, arteriosclerosis, and Alzheimer-type pathologies.

In conclusion, the atrophy observed by Moran et al. clearly reflects a fingerprint of diabetes in the brain. Their findings should initiate further research into underlying mechanisms.

### Accelerated hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease with apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele [^d3619180]. Annals of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Although apolipoprotein E epsilon4 is an established risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, its effect on the rate of progression of Alzheimer's disease remains unknown. The purpose of this longitudinal study was to elucidate whether the rate of hippocampal atrophy is a function of the apolipoprotein E genotypes and severity of disease. Fifty-five patients with probable Alzheimer's disease were the subjects. The annual rate of hippocampal atrophy was determined by using magnetic resonance imaging repeated at a 1-year interval. On a two-way analysis of variance, the effect of the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele on hippocampal atrophy was significant, but neither the effect of severity nor the interaction term was significant. In further analysis with one-way analysis of variance, the mean annual rate of hippocampal atrophy was significantly different between the groups of patients with (9.76 ± 4.27%) and without the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele (6.99 ± 4.24%). Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 dose was significantly correlated with the rate of hippocampal atrophy (rs = 0.277, Spearman rank correlation coefficient), suggesting a gene dose effect. The involvement of the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele in the progression of hippocampal atrophy has implications for therapeutic approaches in Alzheimer's disease and should be taken into consideration in longitudinal studies including clinical drug trials.

### Hippocampal atrophy in first episode depression: a meta-analysis of magnetic resonance imaging studies [^a260bcef]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Reduced hippocampal volume has been consistently observed in major depressive disorder. Hippocampal volume loss is particularly evident in patients with recurrent and chronic depression. However, the reports in first episode depression have been mixed.

Methods

We performed a random effects meta-analysis to establish whether hippocampal atrophy exists from disease onset. We included magnetic resonance imaging studies of hippocampal volume in patients with first episode major depressive disorder and matched healthy controls.

Results

A total of 7 studies met our inclusion and exclusion criteria, representing independent observations in a total sample of 191 patients and 282 healthy controls. The cumulative analysis revealed hippocampal volume loss in patients with first episode depression relative to controls in both the left (standardised mean difference, SMD = -0.41, 95% Confidence Interval: [-0.78;-0.03], z = -2.14, p = 0.0321) and right (SMD = -0.53[-0.98;-0.09], z = -2.38, p = 0.0173) hippocampi. The average volume reduction was -4.0% in the left and -4.5% in the right hippocampus.

Conclusions

Hippocampal volume loss in first episode depression is consistent with a neurodevelopmental model of depression, advocating hippocampal structure as a potential diagnostic neurobiomarker for depression.

### Late-life cognitive decline is associated with hippocampal volume, above and beyond its associations with traditional neuropathologic indices [^0f2565cb]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Reduced hippocampal volume is associated with late-life cognitive decline, but prior studies have not determined whether this association persists after accounting for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neuropathologies.

Methods

Participants were 531 deceased older adults from community-based cohort studies of aging who had undergone annual cognitive evaluations. At death, brain tissue underwent neuropathologic examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Linear mixed models examined whether hippocampal volume measured via MRI accounted for variation in decline rate of global cognition and five cognitive domains, above and beyond neuropathologic indices.

Results

Demographics and indices of AD, cerebrovascular disease, Lewy body disease, hippocampal sclerosis, TDP-43, and atherosclerosis accounted for 42.6% of the variation in global cognitive decline. Hippocampal volume accounted for an additional 5.4% of this variation and made similar contributions in four of the five cognitive domains.

Discussion

Hippocampal volume is associated with late-life cognitive decline, above and beyond contributions from common neuropathologic indices.

### Distinct hippocampal subfields atrophy in older people with vascular brain injuries [^fb13b8db]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Many neurological or psychiatric diseases affect the hippocampus during aging. The study of hippocampal regional vulnerability may provide important insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these processes; however, little is known about the specific impact of vascular brain damage on hippocampal subfields atrophy.

Methods

To analyze the effect of vascular injuries independently of other pathological conditions, we studied a population-based cohort of nondemented older adults, after the exclusion of people who were diagnosed with neurodegenerative diseases during the 14-year clinical follow-up period. Using an automated segmentation pipeline, 1.5T-magnetic resonance imaging at inclusion and 4 years later were assessed to measure both white matter hyperintensities and hippocampal subfields volume. Annualized rates of white matter hyperintensity progression and annualized rates of hippocampal subfields atrophy were then estimated in each participant.

Results

We included 249 participants in our analyses (58% women, mean age 71.8, median Mini-Mental State Evaluation 29). The volume of the subiculum at baseline was the only hippocampal subfield volume associated with total, deep/subcortical, and periventricular white matter hyperintensity volumes, independently of demographic variables and vascular risk factors (β = -0.17, P = 0.011; β = -0.25, P = 0.020 and β = -0.14, P = 0.029, respectively). In longitudinal measures, the annualized rate of subiculum atrophy was significantly higher in people with the highest rate of deep/subcortical white matter hyperintensity progression, independently of confounding factors (β = -0.32, P = 0.014).

Conclusions

These cross-sectional and longitudinal findings highlight the links between vascular brain injuries and a differential vulnerability of the subiculum within the hippocampal loop, unbiased of the effect of neurodegenerative diseases, and particularly when vascular injuries affect deep/subcortical structures.

### A 10-year follow-up of hippocampal volume on magnetic resonance imaging in early dementia and cognitive decline [^b5ba6751]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

Hippocampal atrophy is frequently observed on magnetic resonance images from patients with Alzheimer's disease and persons with mild cognitive impairment. Even in asymptomatic elderly, a small hippocampal volume on magnetic resonance imaging is a risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease. However, not everyone with a small hippocampus develops dementia. With the increased interest in the use of sequential magnetic resonance images as potential surrogate biomarkers of the disease process, it has also been shown that the rate of hippocampal atrophy is higher in persons with Alzheimer's disease compared to those with mild cognitive impairment and the healthy elderly. Whether a higher rate of hippocampal atrophy also predicts Alzheimer's disease or subtle cognitive decline in non-demented elderly is unknown. We examine these associations in a group of 518 elderly (age 60–90 years, 50% female), taken from the population-based Rotterdam Scan Study. A magnetic resonance imaging examination was performed at baseline in 1995–96 that was repeated in 1999–2000 (in 244 persons) and in 2006 (in 185 persons). Using automated segmentation procedures, we assessed hippocampal volumes on all magnetic resonance imaging scans. All persons were free of dementia at baseline and followed over time for cognitive decline and incident dementia. Persons had four repeated neuropsychological tests at the research centre over a 10-year period. We also continuously monitored the medical records of all 518 participants for incident dementia. During a total follow-up of 4360 person-years, (mean 8.4, range 0.1–11.3), 50 people developed incident dementia (36 had Alzheimer's disease). We found an increased risk to develop incident dementia per standard deviation faster rate of decline in hippocampal volume [left hippocampus 1.6 (95% confidence interval 1.2–2.3, right hippocampus 1.6 (95% confidence interval 1.2–2.1)]. Furthermore, decline in hippocampal volume predicted onset of clinical dementia when corrected for baseline hippocampal volume. In people who remained free of dementia during the whole follow-up period, we found that decline in hippocampal volume paralleled, and preceded, specific decline in delayed word recall. No associations were found in this sample between rate of hippocampal atrophy, Mini Mental State Examination and tests of executive function. Our results suggest that rate of hippocampal atrophy is an early marker of incipient memory decline and dementia, and could be of additional value when compared with a single hippocampal volume measurement as a surrogate biomarker of dementia.

### Resolution of cerebral inflammation following subarachnoid hemorrhage [^bda3b037]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

In the clinical setting, global brain atrophy or hippocampal volume loss is often observed in addition to long-lasting physical, neuropsychological, and cognitive deficits in patients who have survived SAH. It is therefore reasonable to ask whether chronic inflammatory processes may contribute to these long-lasting impairments or permanent lasting injuries. Regarding these facts, we conducted a long-term observation over 3 months after SAH insult and analyzed histological and molecular parameters in view of the phase called resolution of inflammation. Against this background, we aimed to characterize a potential resolution of cerebral inflammation induced in the well-established model of experimental SAH in mice. Moreover, we aimed to reveal any indications of chronicity accompanying tertiary brain damage driven by an incomplete resolution of inflammation within the affected tissue. Unresolved tertiary brain damage in this context is therefore an important approach to examine the progression and possible chronicity of the inflammatory state occurring after SAH.

### Longitudinal trajectory of amyloid-related hippocampal subfield atrophy in nondemented elderly [^aecaacf2]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hippocampal atrophy and abnormal β‐Amyloid (Aβ) are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD; Barnes et al. 2009; Jack Jr. et al. 2013). Evidence from animal models suggest that Aβ burden may affect hippocampal neurodegeneration via synaptic or neuronal dysfunctions (Busche et al. 2012; Busche & Konnerth, 2015; Masters, Cappai, Barnham, & Villemagne, 2006; Perez‐Cruz et al. 2011). Indeed, greater PET‐Aβ burden was associated with smaller volume cross‐sectionally (Chetelat et al. 2013; Hanseeuw, Dricot, Lhommel, Quenon, & Ivanoiu, 2016; Mormino et al. 2009) and faster volume decline longitudinally in the whole hippocampus (Villemagne et al. 2013) in nondemented elderly. Nevertheless, lack of association between PET‐Aβ and whole hippocampal atrophy was also found in cognitively normal elderly (Becker et al. 2011). Given Aβ‐associated hippocampal atrophy in nondemented elderly but not in patients with AD‐dementia (Chetelat et al. 2010), it may be implied that Aβ affects hippocampal degeneration more robustly in early disease stage while other pathologies contribute more in dementia stage. This is in line with the AD Pathological Cascade model (Jack Jr. et al. 2013) proposing that Aβ accumulation precedes hippocampal atrophy and both reach a plateau at dementia or earlier. Nonetheless, the longitudinal trajectory of Aβ‐associated hippocampal atrophy in predementia remains unclear.

### Regional hippocampal atrophy reflects memory impairment in patients with early relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis [^0de42031]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

An additional interpretation of our findings may lie in the different expression of compensatory mechanisms between the two groups, potentially attributed to variations in brain plasticity and widespread neuronal activation. This differential expression of compensatory mechanisms may account for the favorable clinical outcome observed in patients with MMI-MS. This hypothesis is supported by previous studies that have demonstrated compensatory mechanisms, such as increased structural and functional connectivity, in cognitively preserved MS patients during the early stages of the disease, particularly in those with mild structural abnormalities. These compensatory mechanisms appear to be most effective within the first two years of MS with an efficacy that diminishes as the disease progresses and finally reaches a plateau. Thus, it can be speculated that in patients with MMI-MS, even during these early stages, a compensatory functional reorganization of damaged hippocampal tissue may occur, mitigating the loss of hippocampal volume and temporarily preventing the onset of more severe memory impairment. Future studies assessing the relationship between structural and functional connectivity in MMI-MS and SMI-MS patients would further improve our understanding in this area and provide valuable insights into the compensatory processes occurring in the hippocampus. In addition, the reduced hippocampal volume loss in MMI-MS patients might also be associated with those with mild impairments effectively utilizing cognitive compensatory strategies, or potentially having received some form of intervention.

### Hippocampus co-atrophy pattern in dementia deviates from covariance patterns across the lifespan [^8e7356dc]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

The hippocampus is a plastic region and highly susceptible to ageing and dementia. Previous studies explicitly imposed a priori models of hippocampus when investigating ageing and dementia-specific atrophy but led to inconsistent results. Consequently, the basic question of whether macrostructural changes follow a cytoarchitectonic or functional organization across the adult lifespan and in age-related neurodegenerative disease remained open. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to identify the spatial pattern of hippocampus differentiation based on structural covariance with a data-driven approach across structural MRI data of large cohorts (n = 2594). We examined the pattern of structural covariance of hippocampus voxels in young, middle-aged, elderly, mild cognitive impairment and dementia disease samples by applying a clustering algorithm revealing differentiation in structural covariance within the hippocampus. In all the healthy and in the mild cognitive impaired participants, the hippocampus was robustly divided into anterior, lateral and medial subregions reminiscent of cytoarchitectonic division. In contrast, in dementia patients, the pattern of subdivision was closer to known functional differentiation into an anterior, body and tail subregions. These results not only contribute to a better understanding of co-plasticity and co-atrophy in the hippocampus across the lifespan and in dementia, but also provide robust data-driven spatial representations (i.e. maps) for structural studies.

### Disease stage-specific atrophy markers in Alzheimer's disease [^443b044d]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

Our study offers detailed insights into the dynamics of anatomically detailed atrophy markers within the MTL and parietal lobe across the AD continuum. We show that abnormalities on structural MRI do not necessarily appear imminent to cognitive impairment onset. Instead, accelerated volumetric decline in the entorhinal cortex, BA35, and the amygdala was observed already in preclinical AD. However, these markers appear less effective during symptomatic stages, when disease progression leads to more pronounced atrophy in hippocampal and parietal subregions. We demonstrate that atrophy–cognition associations are disease stage–specific and vary by the intended use of an atrophy marker. Crucially, these associations were highly heterogeneous even within broader brain regions and cognitive domains, such as among MTL subregions and episodic memory tests. These results indicate that achieving optimal use of structural MRI for atrophy assessment — whether in research, clinical practice, or intervention trials — requires markers that are tailored to context‐specific factors, including the intended use and the targeted disease stage.

### Mesiotemporal atrophy and hippocampal diffusivity distinguish amnestic from non-amnestic vascular cognitive impairment [^5b438503]. European Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is the second most common cause of acquired dementia and its prevalence doubles every 5.3 years 1. VCI is defined as the spectrum of cognitive impairment attributable to cerebrovascular causes, ranging from subtle deficits to dementia 2 and characterized by various clinical presentations, multiple imaging and heterogeneous pathologies 3. Four VCI subtypes including amnestic, amnestic plus other domains, non‐amnestic single domain, and non‐amnestic multiple domains are described 3. The current criteria are used for all forms of cognitive disorders associated with cerebrovascular disease including cardioembolic, atherosclerotic, ischemic, hemorrhagic or genetic, regardless of the pathogenesis 3. The criteria feature a range of vascular and cognitive pathologies rather than a validated diagnostic entity 4. Moreover, they do not categorically define standardized radiological evidence of cerebrovascular disease for VCI or its diverse clinical phenotypes.

### Amyloid burden in cognitively normal elderly is associated with preferential hippocampal subfield volume loss [^282fe15f]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

The earliest sites of brain atrophy in Alzheimer's disease are in the medial temporal lobe, following widespread cerebral cortical amyloid deposition. We assessed 74 cognitively normal participants with clinical measurements, amyloid-β-PET imaging, MRI, and a newly developed technique for MRI-based hippocampal subfield segmentation to determine the differential association of amyloid deposition and hippocampal subfield volume. Compared to amyloid-negative participants, amyloid-positive participants had significantly smaller hippocampal tail, presubiculum, subiculum, and total hippocampal gray matter volumes. We conclude that, prior to the development of cognitive impairment, atrophy in particular hippocampal subfields occurs preferentially with amyloid-β accumulation.

### Automated and interpretable detection of hippocampal sclerosis in temporal lobe epilepsy: AID-HS [^b4b77c3d]. Annals of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is the leading cause of drug‐resistant focal epilepsy in adults, and the third most common cause in children. It is amenable to surgical resection, with 76% of individuals achieving freedom from disabling seizures 1 year after surgery.HS is typically diagnosed using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and is characterized by atrophy (i.e. volume reduction) of the affected hippocampus on T1‐weighted MRI scans, alongside hippocampal T2/FLAIR hyperintensity. Additionally, the affected hippocampus exhibits morphological abnormalities, including increased curvature of the tailand a reduction in hippocampal dentations.

Despite its characteristic features, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities can be subtle, and HS accounts for approximately 10% of histopathologically‐confirmed focal epilepsy cases that were missed (i.e. MRI negative) by expert epilepsy neuroradiologists. Critically, individuals with "MRI‐negative" scans have significantly lower rates of postsurgical seizure freedom (45%) compared to those with identified lesions (72%–81%). Attempts to localize lesions involve additional investigations, such as invasive intracranial electroencephalography (EEG), delaying surgical resection, and placing additional burdens on patients and families. Developing imaging software to localize and characterize subtle cases of HS on presurgical MRI scans would aid early diagnosis, surgical planning and potentially improve postsurgical outcomes.

Previous work using machine‐learning has used neuroanatomical features to both distinguish patients with HS from healthy controls (i.e. detection) and lateralize the side of HS‐associated abnormalities (i.e. lateralization). However, these models have often been trained on small, single‐center datasets.or on cohorts comprised of exclusively adult patients. They are therefore unlikely to generalize well to other centers with different patient cohorts (in particular pediatric cohorts), MRI hardware, or scanning protocols. Finally, the models published to date have lacked open‐source code and, therefore, cannot be independently validated.

Developing automated tools that work for children and adults is challenging due to the ongoing maturation of the hippocampus during childhood – notably its increase in volume, folding, asymmetries, and myelination. Measuring asymmetries within individuals and comparing features against normative growth chartsare potential solutions to adjust for individual differences and to highlight abnormalities across development.

### Effects of glycaemic control on memory performance, hippocampal volumes and depressive symptomology [^389e3fda]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes and poor glycaemic control have been shown to negatively impact cognitive abilities, while also raising risk of both mood disorders and brain structural atrophy. Sites of atrophy include the hippocampus, which has been implicated in both memory performance and depression. The current study set out to better characterise the associations between poor glycaemic control, memory performance, and depression symptoms, and investigate whether loss of hippocampal volume could represent a neuropathological mechanism underlying these.

Methods

1331 participants (60.9% female, age range 18–88 (Mean = 44.02), 6.5% with likely diabetes) provided HbA1c data (as an index of glycaemic control), completed a word list learning task, and a validated depression scale. A subsample of 392 participants underwent structural MRI; hippocampal volumes were extracted using FreeSurfer.

Results

Partial correlation analyses (controlling for age, gender, and education) showed that, in the full sample, poorer glycaemic control was related to lower word list memory performance. In the MRI sub-sample, poorer glycaemic control was related to higher depressive symptoms, and lower hippocampal volumes. Total hippocampus volume partially mediated the association between HbA1c levels and depressive symptoms.

Conclusions

Results emphasise the impact of glycaemic control on memory, depression and hippocampal volume and suggest hippocampal volume loss could be a pathophysiological mechanism underlying the link between HbA1c and depression risk; inflammatory and stress-hormone related processes might have a role in this.

### Cognitive outcomes of deep brain stimulation depend on age and hippocampal connectivity in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease [^e126c1b1]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

4.3 Age, atrophy, and DBS

While our results and previous literature have implicated age as an important process influencing DBS cognitive outcomes, it is likely that age is just a proxy of the underlying true physiologic process. Our results suggest hippocampal volume may be a useful imaging‐based biomarker of this physiological process, as it fully mediated our observed interaction of age with subiculum connectivity on cognition. This result is consistent with prior work suggesting that hippocampal volume can change after DBS. Specifically, hippocampal volumes have been observed to increase in top‐responding older AD DBS patients, but decrease in younger PD STN DBS patients.

Of all brain regions, age‐related atrophy tends to be particularly prominent in the hippocampus. Within the hippocampus, the subiculum is most susceptible to age‐related atrophy, with its integrity being highly related to cognitive dysfunction in AD, PD, and even in older patients without a neurodegenerative diagnosis. However, this correlation between hippocampal volume and cognitive dysfunction is only robustly observed after age 65, the age at which hippocampal atrophy begins to rapidly accelerate. The mechanism of this acceleration of hippocampal atrophy at age 65 remains unclear. It may be related to an age‐dependent cascade of cellular dysfunction, neuronal hyperactivity, epileptiform discharges, and dendritic pruning, all of which combine to result in atrophy. In animal models, intervening on this cascade can normalize hippocampal hyperexcitability, restore hippocampal volume, and improve cognitive function.

### Hippocampal volume and volume asymmetry prospectively predict PTSD symptom emergence among Iraq-deployed soldiers [^e25e486b]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Hippocampal atrophy has been shown to mediate the link between stress and stress-related psychopathology (Gilbertson et al; Sapolsky,), whereas hippocampal growth has been shown to mediate the effects of successful treatment for PTSD (Levy-Gigi, Szabó, Kelemen, & Kéri,) and depression (Warner-Schmidt & Duman). Furthermore, a range of neurotrophic factors promotes hippocampal neurogenesis (Hurley et al; Warner-Schmidt & Duman,) and recent work suggests that visuo-spatial cognitive tasks (e.g. Tetris) may enhance treatment outcomes, in part due to hippocampal neurogenesis or increased synaptic plasticity (Butler et al.). Future work should test whether interventions targeting hippocampal growth can protect against PTSD emergence.

### Neuropathological diagnosis of vascular cognitive impairment and vascular dementia with implications for Alzheimer's disease [^4257adcc]. Acta Neuropathologica (2016). Low credibility.

Assessing the neuropathological substrates of VaD involves systematic assessment of parenchymal lesions, including microinfarcts and haemorrhages and the vascular abnormalities that may have caused them to relate to the progression of impairment. In addition, systemic factors (e.g. hypotension, hypoglycaemia) may cause brain or neuronal lesions in the absence of severe vascular disease and should be taken into account when attributing causes to VaD. As discussed above, parenchymal abnormalities of neurodegenerative type may be present that are not obviously associated with either vascular disease or systemic factors, i.e. Alzheimer type or hippocampal lesions.

### The hippocampus in multiple sclerosis [^4561d38c]. The Lancet: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Some of the clinical manifestations of multiple sclerosis, such as memory impairment and depression, are, at least partly, related to involvement of the hippocampus. Pathological studies have shown extensive demyelination, neuronal damage, and synaptic abnormalities in the hippocampus of patients with multiple sclerosis, and improvements in MRI technology have provided novel ways to assess hippocampal involvement in vivo. It is now accepted that clinical manifestations related to the hippocampus are due not only to focal hippocampal damage, but also to disconnection of the hippocampus from several brain networks. Evidence suggests anatomical and functional subspecialisation of the different hippocampal subfields, resulting in variability between regions in the extent to which damage and repair occur. The hippocampus also has important roles in plasticity and neurogenesis, both of which potentially contribute to functional preservation and restoration. These findings underline the importance of evaluation of the hippocampus not only to improve understanding of the clinical manifestations of multiple sclerosis, but also as a potential future target for treatment.

### The relationship between adult hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease [^1eeb9b8a]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

5 AD

AD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive accumulation and spread of protein aggregates throughout the brain, coupled with neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. These pathological changes contribute to progressive cognitive impairment such as learning and memory deficits that are typically observed in AD. The vast majority of AD cases have no clear singular (genetic) cause and are referred to as sporadic AD. However, a small subset of AD cases can be linked to a specific genetic defect (familial AD). A diagnostic criterion for AD is the presence of extracellular insoluble Aβ plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, which form upon aggregation of monomeric Aβ 40 or Aβ 42 and monomeric Tau, respectively. The spread of these aggregates occurs in an AD‐specific pattern, most commonly classified using Thal staging for Aβ (Thal stage I — V) and Braak staging for neurofibrillary tangles (Braak stage I‐VI). Notably, the spread of soluble Aβ through the brain correlates more closely with clinical symptoms of AD than the spread of Aβ plaques. The hippocampus is affected early in AD: neurofibrillary tangles first accumulate in the entorhinal cortex and spread to CA1, followed by the subiculum, remaining CA regions, and the DG. Atrophy in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus together with synaptic density decrease are early hallmarks of AD, correlating with a decline in cognitive function. Human AD in vivo magnetic resonance imaging studies have reported that the loss of functional connectivity occurs in all hippocampal subregions, whereas hippocampal neurodegeneration is mostly found in CA1. Protein depositions other than Aβ and Tau have also recently been discovered to be associated with AD, such as TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP‐43). Depositions of this protein in the hippocampus of AD patients are associated with higher rates of hippocampal atrophy in brains with moderate to advanced neurofibrillary tangle pathology, but not in brains with little to no neurofibrillary tangle pathology. The pathological features driven by AD‐associated protein aggregation are likely multifaceted and might not be uniform across AD patients and animal models, as will be discussed in detail in the following sections. Correspondingly, the presence of AD‐typical Aβ and Tau depositions has been reported in certain cognitively healthy aged individuals. Moreover, AD‐related gray matter atrophy is not uniform across AD patients and does not affect the hippocampus or cortex in all cases.

### Accelerating regional atrophy rates in the progression from normal aging to Alzheimer's disease [^774d5544]. European Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Previous studies report increased cerebral atrophy rates and ventricular enlargement in AD versus controls. Most cross-sectional MRI studies have focussed on atrophy of medial temporal lobe structures, commonly using volumetric measures. These studies have shown that hippocampal volumes at the time of clinical diagnosis are on average 18% lower when compared with controls. Whole-brain volumes are decreased in AD also, and tend to be around 5% lower — this volume loss cannot be accounted for by medial temporal lobe damage and implies widespread atrophy beyond this region. Voxel-based morphometry studies have shown using cross-sectional comparisons that in addition to atrophy of medial temporal lobe structures, temporal-parietal atrophy is prominent in AD. In MCI patients progressing to AD versus stable MCI patients atrophy of the temporal lobe, and to a lesser extent of the parietal and frontal lobe was shown. Longitudinal measures of atrophy, which allow changes within the individual to be assessed, have been shown to be more sensitive at detecting group differences than cross-sectional volumes, in part because they are less susceptible to intersubject variability. A number of studies described the pattern of longitudinal atrophy in relatively small groups of sporadic and familial AD patients. They found increased atrophy in the medial temporal lobe over time, but also more widespread throughout the brain, in the parietal and frontal lobe. Longitudinal studies report that hippocampal atrophy rates increase in MCI. We extend these findings, by providing rates of atrophy in six brain regions. Our study confirms that the medial temporal lobe is affected at an early stage of the disease. Additionally, we found the mean atrophy rate in the remainder of the temporal lobe to be increased at an early stage as well, before a clinical diagnosis could be made with certainty. Regional atrophy rates in the remainder of the cortex further accelerated in AD.

### Distinct spatial contributions of amyloid pathology and cerebral small vessel disease to hippocampal morphology [^3cbf1cee]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

A critical gap in our ability to interpret the interrelationships between AD and SVD pathologies remains the significant underrepresentation of the mixed dementia phenotype in clinical studies. Despite the high prevalence of mixed etiologies clinically, individuals with moderate–extensive co‐occurring vascular and Aβ burden — the population most likely to reveal interactive relationships between concomitant disease pathologies and most reflective of real‐world clinical populations — are often excluded from clinical studies. Previous study cohorts have been limited to investigation of either pure AD in the absence of significant vascular disease history, or pure vascular dementia without Aβ deposition or unknown Aβ status, potentially resulting in misdiagnosis between vascular and mixed dementia. In this study, we evaluate the interactive effects of overlapping AD and SVD in the Medical Imaging Trials Network of Canada Project C6 Project (MITNEC‐C6), a unique multicenter prospective observational study designed to specifically recruit cognitively impaired individuals with moderate–severe SVD in addition to Aβ positron emission tomography (PET) positivity (NCT02330510).

Other important gaps include the study of interactive effects on hippocampal structure using hippocampal volumetry tools not validated in patients with extensive atrophy and cerebrovascular lesions. This is particularly relevant as mixed dementia can involve a substantial degree of hippocampal volume loss, which is difficult to accurately segment. Additionally, reliable volumetric measurements enable more sensitive hippocampal shape analyses to further infer regional patterns of hippocampal atrophy and their potential connections to distinct pathological mechanisms.

To address these limitations, the objective of the present study was to gain deeper insight into the links between Aβ burden, WMH, and hippocampal degeneration, in a unique cohort of cognitively impaired adults with moderate–severe SVD with and without Aβ PET positivity, using a novel, state‐of‐the‐art hippocampal segmentation tool to analyze alterations of hippocampal structure. Specifically, we hypothesized that among individuals with mixed dementia, (1) Aβ and SVD pathology independently contribute to hippocampal atrophy and (2) the spatial distribution of WMH differentially influences the pattern of hippocampal atrophy.

### Hippocampal volume in patients with asthma: results from the Dallas heart study [^c6ead71d]. The Journal of Asthma (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is associated with an increased risk of mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Depression and oral corticosteroid use are associated with atrophy of the hippocampus and are common in asthma. However, minimal neuroimaging data are available in asthma patients.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1,287 adult participants from the Dallas Heart Study, an epidemiological sample of Dallas County residents. Study outcome variables were hippocampal volumes measured by FreeSurfer. ANOVA was used to examine a gender difference in hippocampal volumes. General Linear Models (GLM) were conducted to examine asthma diagnosis association with hippocampal volumes.

Results

The prevalence rate of asthma among our study sample was 10.8% with 9.6% in males and 11.7% in females. After controlling for demographic characteristics, participants with asthma had significantly smaller total, right, and left hippocampal volumes than those without asthma. The association of asthma with smaller hippocampal volume was significant among males but not among females.

Conclusion

Hippocampal volume in a large and diverse sample of adults was significantly smaller in people with asthma as compared to those without asthma. These findings suggest that asthma may be associated with structural brain differences. Thus, medical illnesses without obvious direct neurodegenerative or even vascular involvement can be associated with brain changes. Because the hippocampus is a brain region involved in memory formation, these findings may have implications for treatment adherence that could have important implications for asthma treatment. Study limitations are the reliance on a self-reported asthma diagnosis and lack of additional asthma clinical information.

### A (sub) field guide to quality control in hippocampal subfield segmentation on high-resolution T-weighted MRI [^418e173d]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

9 CONCLUSION

In the ever‐growing field of hippocampal subfields neuroimaging research, ensuring accurate measurement is vital to progress our understanding of brain structural and functional correlates, lifespan development, and neuropathology. QC is an essential part of ensuring valid results by promoting accurate hippocampal subfield segmentation and retaining all eligible data for analysis. In addition, recent advancements in neuroimaging have given investigators the unique opportunity to study hippocampal subfields with greater precision than ever before in pursuit of the ultimate goal of drawing robust scientific conclusions that meet a high standard of quality.

Using the literature and our findings from a survey of investigators with experience segmenting hippocampal subfields, we summarized the threats to segmentation accuracy, reviewed common methods for QC, and made recommendations for best practices and reporting of QC in publication. In the following section, we highlight broader impacts of ensuring quality data on neuroimaging and clinical research.

The importance of QC is underscored by goals related to investigating and validating structure–function relationships. The study of hippocampal subfields is a unique in vivo endeavor as a major focus is the ability to understand the nuanced roles of hippocampal function in human cognition and forward translation from animal models of development, aging, and disease. For example, determining the impact of normative and pathological aging on hippocampal structure and related memory abilities requires reliable measurements of both cognition and brain that allow accurate conclusions from hypothesis testing. Moreover, validity is critical in supporting the clinical translation of hippocampal subfields measurement to biomarkers of healthy development, neurodegenerative disease, and neurodevelopmental disorders. The requisite of interpreting hippocampal subfields as biomarkers is confidence that the measures used reflect the underlying tissue structure and its changes over the course of time.

### Temporal lobe rating scale: application to Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia [^cb8b1a9d]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Temporal lobe atrophy as assessed by MRI can be measured in several ways. Volumetric measurements are quantitative but very time consuming and require extensive training to perform, so are not easily transferable to clinical practice. Visual rating scales, by contrast, are quick and widely applicable. Although medial temporal lobe atrophy is well described in Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is uncertain how early these changes can be detected and whether they discriminate AD from other neurodegenerative diseases, most notably frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The objectives were (1) to develop a widely applicable temporal lobe rating scale, and (2) to characterise and quantify the patterns of temporal lobe atrophy in AD versus temporal and frontal variants of FTD.

Methods

The temporal lobe assessments were made using an established hippocampal rating scale extended to incorporate additional temporal regions. This was firstly validated with volumetric analysis and then applied to 30 probable AD, 30 FTD (consisting of 17 temporal variant (semantic dementia) and 13 frontal variant) and 18 control coronal MRI images.

Results

Bilateral hippocampal atrophy was found in 50% of the patients with AD. Contrary to expectations, patients with semantic dementia also had hippocampal atrophy, which for the left side exceeded that seen in AD; other regions (temporal pole, parahippocampal gyrus, and lateral temporal lobe), spared in AD, were severely atrophied in this group. The patients with frontal variant FTD occupied an intermediate position and were largely indistinguishable from AD.

Conclusions

Hippocampal atrophy is, therefore, not specific for AD. Semantic dementia can be distinguished from AD, by the presence of severe bilateral atrophy of the temporal pole, parahippocampal and lateral regions. These findings have implications for the differential diagnosis of dementias.

### Practice parameter: diagnosis of dementia (an evidence-based review). Report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^fa4732dd]. Neurology (2001). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of dementia — quantitative imaging for Alzheimer disease (AD) indicates that only one prospective Class I quantitative computed tomographic study using autopsy-confirmed diagnosis found that among 86 autopsied cases a medial temporal lobe width below the 5th percentile was 95% sensitive but only 40% specific for AD; across Class II CT or MRI studies of medial temporal atrophy, sensitivity ranged from 77 to 92% with specificities from 49 to 95%; automated MRI volumetrics were most reliable but are labor-intensive and not widely available; measurement of hippocampal atrophy by MRI may not be useful in clinical practice because of low precision; and combining medial temporal measures with functional neuroimaging or apolipoprotein E genotyping may improve diagnostic accuracy.

### A longitudinal study of hippocampal subfield volumes and hippocampal glutamate levels in antipsychotic-naïve first episode psychosis patients [^e5691eb8]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous studies have implicated hippocampal abnormalities in the neuropathology of psychosis spectrum disorders. Reduced hippocampal volume has been reported across all illness stages, and this atrophy has been hypothesized to be the result of glutamatergic excess. To test this hypothesis, we measured hippocampal subfield volumes and hippocampal glutamate levels in antipsychotic naïve first episode psychosis patients (FEP) and the progression of volume decline and changes in glutamate levels over a 16-week antipsychotic drug (APD) trial. We aimed to determine if subfield volumes at baseline were associated with glutamate levels, and if baseline glutamate levels were predictive of change in subfield volumes over time.

Methods

We enrolled ninety-three medication-naïve FEP participants and 80 matched healthy controls (HC). T1 and T2 weighted images and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data from a voxel prescribed in the left hippocampus were collected from participants at baseline and after 6 and 16 weeks of APD treatment. Hippocampal subfield volumes were assessed using FreeSurfer 7.1.1., while glutamate levels were quantified using jMRUI version 6.0. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models.

Results

We found regional subfield volume deficits in the CA1, and presubiculum in FEP at baseline, that further expanded to include the molecular and granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (GC/ML/DG) and CA4 by week 16. Baseline hippocampal glutamate levels in FEP were not significantly different than those of HC, and there was no effect of treatment on glutamate. Glutamate levels were not related to initial subfield volumes or volume changes over 16 weeks.

Conclusion

We report a progressive loss of hippocampal subfield volumes over a period of 16 weeks after initiation of treatment, suggestive of early progression in neuropathology. Our results do not suggest a role for glutamate as a driving factor. This study underscores the need to further research the mechanism(s) underlying this phenomenon as it has implications for early intervention to preserve cognitive decline in FEP participants.

### Earliest amyloid and tau deposition modulate the influence of limbic networks during closed-loop hippocampal downregulation [^5996947d]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

Across Alzheimer's disease patient studies and healthy memory studies, the hippocampus has been established to be the single brain region with the most important role. Hippocampal subfield CA1 in particular, appears to be a region that is integral to contextual episodic memory. CA1 presents atrophy linked to Alzheimer's disease pathology but no volume loss related to normal ageing. Here, we focus on hippocampal subfield CA1 because we reasoned that if preclinical alterations in brain function indeed occur prior to neurodegeneration as has been suggested, it is probable that they are most prominent in areas that later undergo atrophy due to Alzheimer's disease. Hippocampal hyperactivity appears to precede amyloid accumulation, which is accepted as the earliest sign of preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Hippocampal hyperactivity also appears to be more prominent in subjects at genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease. The lack of concurrent neurodegeneration or decline in cognitive performance implies: (i) that hippocampal hyperactivity is the result of compromised neural efficiency, as defined in the context of neural reserve; and (ii) a potential link between hippocampal hyperactivity and compromised hippocampal downregulation abilities. In this context, developing a standard framework for the investigation of the ability to downregulate hippocampal activation may bring us a step closer to detecting Alzheimer's disease-specific signs earlier along the pathophysiological continuum of Alzheimer's disease.

### The effect of plasma cortisol on hippocampal atrophy and clinical progression in mild cognitive impairment [^e12ad727]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

4.3 Plasma cortisol, hippocampal volume, and clinical progression

We did not detect statistical evidence for an effect of plasma cortisol on clinical progression to AD dementia. We first reproduced established findings, showing that a large hippocampus protects the brain significantly longer from clinical symptoms than a small hippocampus. A similar effect was not found for baseline plasma cortisol, and there was no significant interaction between hippocampal volume and plasma cortisol on clinical progression. In previous studies, higher plasma cortisol predicted clinical worsening in patients with AD, but not in non‐demented older adults. Higher cortisol levels measured in CSF have been associated with faster cognitive decline and clinical worsening across the AD continuumand in patients with amnestic MCIand mild dementia. The present lack of an effect of plasma cortisol on clinical progression is surprising. It appears that, in our sample, higher plasma cortisol is related to higher hippocampal atrophy in MCI patients, which in turn is a risk factor of accelerated disease progression. Another reason might be the limited sample size at follow‐up assessments, warranting further investigation. Overall, our study highlights the role of plasma cortisol as a potentially modifiable risk factor of hippocampal degeneration in prodromal AD.

To conclude, our results show an exacerbating influence of high circulating cortisol on hippocampal atrophy over time. Hippocampal atrophy in turn accelerates clinical progression to AD in patients with MCI. Our findings may point toward a protective effect of lower cortisol at the early disease stage. Future studies should assess, whether stress‐reducing lifestyle interventions could have a decelerating effect on hippocampal atrophy, which in turn may influence clinical progression to AD dementia. It is important to implement these targeted interventions as early as possible before neural damage becomes too severe.

### Amnesia and the hippocampus [^ae7758f7]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Long-term memory impairments have great medical significance and a considerable health and economic burden. Understanding their cognitive and neuroanatomical underpinnings is of crucial importance. Severe amnesia is usually observed following bilateral hippocampal pathology. This review addresses the precise role of the hippocampus and related medial temporal lobe structures in amnesia.

Recent Findings

Disagreements exist over whether, following selective hippocampal damage: retrograde amnesia for episodic memories is temporally limited or extensive and ungraded; anterograde amnesia involves both recollective and familiarity processes. It is accepted that material specific impairments follow unilateral medial temporal lobe damage, with verbal and nonverbal memory lateralized to left or right, respectively. Memory for unknown faces, however, may not depend on the hippocampus. Pharmacological studies in animals, with some extension to humans, highlight promising future therapeutic interventions targeting synaptic plasticity modulation.

Summary

Despite considerable progress, some issues remain unresolved. The available evidence favours the view, however, that the hippocampus, in conjunction with other cortical areas, is critical for the retrieval of remote episodic memories and for both recollection and familiarity anterograde memory processes. There are as yet no effective pharmacological treatments for medial temporal lobe amnesia, but various rehabilitative techniques may be useful.

### Does donepezil treatment slow the progression of hippocampal atrophy in patients with Alzheimer's disease? [^9deb38d5]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The only approved pharmacological approach for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease in Japan is the use of a cholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil hydrochloride. Recent in vivo and in vitro studies raise the possibility that cholinesterase inhibitors can slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether donepezil has a neuroprotective effect in Alzheimer's disease by using the rate of hippocampal atrophy as a surrogate marker of disease progression.

Method

In a prospective cohort study, 54 patients with Alzheimer's disease who received donepezil treatment and 93 control patients with Alzheimer's disease who never received anti-Alzheimer drugs underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) twice at a 1-year interval. The annual rate of hippocampal atrophy of each subject was determined by using an MRI-based volumetric technique. Background characteristics, age, sex, disease duration, education, MRI interval, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, and baseline Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale score were comparable between the treated and control groups.

Results

The mean annual rate of hippocampal volume loss among the treated patients (mean = 3.82%, SD = 2.84%) was significantly smaller than that among the control patients (mean = 5.04%, SD = 2.54%). Upon analysis of covariance, where those confounding variables (age, sex, disease duration, education, MRI interval, APOE genotype, and baseline Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale score) were entered into the model as covariates, the effect of donepezil treatment on hippocampal atrophy remained significant.

Conclusions

Donepezil treatment slows the progression of hippocampal atrophy, suggesting a neuroprotective effect of donepezil in Alzheimer's disease.

### Hippocampal volumes predict risk of dementia with lewy bodies in mild cognitive impairment [^70cdd0ec]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In patients with MCI, preservation of hippocampal volumes was associated with a higher risk of progression to probable DLB, competing with the risk of progression to AD dementia. Competing risk analysis assumes that a patient with MCI who progresses to dementia will progress to either probable DLB or AD. Therefore the subdistribution hazard ratios for a dementia outcome are estimated by using the other dementia outcome as a competing risk. Patients with MCI with preserved hippocampal volumes had a hazard risk of progression to probable DLB 5.8 times that of those with hippocampal atrophy, when accounting for competing risk of progression to AD dementia. Furthermore, preserved hippocampal volumes predicted the hazard risk of progression to probable DLB along with the diagnosis of MCI with impairments in nonamnestic cognitive domains with or without memory impairment.

Hippocampal atrophy is associated with a higher risk of progression to AD dementia in patients with MCI. Based on these observations, hippocampal atrophy is included in the research criteria to support the diagnosis of MCI due to AD. However, the underlying etiologies of MCI, broadly defined with impairments in amnestic or nonamnestic cognitive domains, are heterogeneous. Both vascular and Lewy body disease may contribute to the cognitive difficulties in patients with MCI. Furthermore, hippocampal volumes may be relatively preserved in patients with MCI, particularly in those with nonamnestic MCI.

In the current study, preserved hippocampal volumes predicted progression to DLB accounting for the competing risk for progression to AD dementia, even after considering nonamnestic MCI compared to amnestic MCI single-domain diagnosis. Impairment in nonamnestic cognitive domains, particularly in the attention and visual-spatial processing domains, increases the risk for probable DLB in MCI. While nonamnestic MCI is characterized by relative preservation of hippocampal volumes, hippocampal atrophy may be present in some patients with nonamnestic MCI. Furthermore, hippocampal atrophy is common in patients with multiple-domain amnestic MCI, and these patients are at risk for both probable DLB and AD dementia. Thus, the distinction of patients with MCI who will progress to DLB vs AD dementia may not be clear only by the MCI subtype. Data from the current study suggest that hippocampal volumes predict progression to probable DLB along with the MCI subtype.

### Brain β-amyloid measures and magnetic resonance imaging atrophy both predict time-to-progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease [^cefe6928]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

Biomarkers of brain Aβ amyloid deposition can be measured either by cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 or Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography imaging. Our objective was to evaluate the ability of Aβ load and neurodegenerative atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging to predict shorter time-to-progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's dementia and to characterize the effect of these biomarkers on the risk of progression as they become increasingly abnormal. A total of 218 subjects with mild cognitive impairment were identified from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The primary outcome was time-to-progression to Alzheimer's dementia. Hippocampal volumes were measured and adjusted for intracranial volume. We used a new method of pooling cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 and Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography measures to produce equivalent measures of brain Aβ load from either source and analysed the results using multiple imputation methods. We performed our analyses in two phases. First, we grouped our subjects into those who were 'amyloid positive' (n = 165, with the assumption that Alzheimer's pathology is dominant in this group) and those who were 'amyloid negative' (n = 53). In the second phase, we included all 218 subjects with mild cognitive impairment to evaluate the biomarkers in a sample that we assumed to contain a full spectrum of expected pathologies. In a Kaplan-Meier analysis, amyloid positive subjects with mild cognitive impairment were much more likely to progress to dementia within 2 years than amyloid negative subjects with mild cognitive impairment (50 versus 19%). Among amyloid positive subjects with mild cognitive impairment only, hippocampal atrophy predicted shorter time-to-progression (P < 0.001) while Aβ load did not (P = 0.44). In contrast, when all 218 subjects with mild cognitive impairment were combined (amyloid positive and negative), hippocampal atrophy and Aβ load predicted shorter time-to-progression with comparable power (hazard ratio for an inter-quartile difference of 2.6 for both); however, the risk profile was linear throughout the range of hippocampal atrophy values but reached a ceiling at higher values of brain Aβ load. Our results are consistent with a model of Alzheimer's disease in which Aβ deposition initiates the pathological cascade but is not the direct cause of cognitive impairment as evidenced by the fact that Aβ load severity is decoupled from risk of progression at high levels. In contrast, hippocampal atrophy indicates how far along the neurodegenerative path one is, and hence how close to progressing to dementia. Possible explanations for our finding that many subjects with mild cognitive impairment have intermediate levels of Aβ load include: (i) individual subjects may reach an Aβ load plateau at varying absolute levels; (ii) some subjects may be more biologically susceptible to Aβ than others; and (iii) subjects with mild cognitive impairment with intermediate levels of Aβ may represent individuals with Alzheimer's disease co-existent with other pathologies.

### Rates of β-amyloid accumulation are independent of hippocampal neurodegeneration [^c15acd9d]. Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

We present a way to characterize elderly CN individuals using Aβ and neurodegeneration biomarkers that is complementary to the NIA-AA preclinical staging criteria. Our major findings were that high rates of Aβ accumulation were found in those with abnormal Aβ at baseline and were not influenced by hippocampal neurodegeneration at baseline. In contrast, AD-signature atrophy rates increased with greater baseline neurodegenerative atrophy and were greatest when both Aβ and hippocampal neurodegeneration were present at baseline.

In relating our imaging findings to disease mechanisms, we assume that amyloid PET directly measures fibrillar Aβ deposits, which has been thoroughly documented through imaging-autopsy studies. We also assume that atrophy on MRI is a direct measure of neurodegeneration — i.e. loss of neurons or their processes. Multiple independent imaging-autopsy studies document that brain atrophy correlates well with both cell lossand tau pathology (both Braak stage and immunohistochemical measures of tau burden), but not with fibrillar Aβ deposits. However, hippocampal atrophy is not specific for AD. Non-AD pathologic processes common in the elderlyalso result in brain volume loss — for example, hippocampal sclerosis, ischemic cerebral vascular disease, perhaps TDP43, and medial temporal tauopathy without Aβ. Regarding medial temporal tauopathy, Braak and Braakfound that 97% of autopsied subjects in their 70s have neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stage I–II or greater. The median age in our study was 78, so we can safely assume that nearly all subjects in our study had some degree of NFT pathology at baseline. Moreover, aging in the absence of known pathologic processes may be associated with brain atrophy. In the absence of in vivo biomarkers of all of these etiologic processes, it is impossible to know in a given subject what proportion of hippocampal volume loss is tau-related vs due to other degenerative processes. Thus, we interpret hippocampal atrophy as a nonspecific measure that could reflect any of these age-related processes that lead to neurodegeneration, but must reflect tau-related (i.e. AD) neurodegeneration to varying degrees in all our subjects because of their age. Tau PET ligandswill be essential to understanding the relationships between etiologically nonspecific imaging measures of neurodegeneration such as MRI and FDG-PET and the different underlying neurodegenerative processes that are common in the elderly.

### Subcortical brain alterations in major depressive disorder: findings from the ENIgMA major depressive disorder working group [^d3815a8c]. Molecular Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Patterns of abnormal hippocampal development may predate adolescent depression onsetand smaller hippocampal volumes have been found to predict a protracted response to antidepressant treatment over weeks, and a more severe long-term illness course, so morphological hippocampal alterations may represent risk markers for depression, recurrence and chronicity. As we only observed hippocampal volume reduction in recurrent patients and no subcortical volume alterations in first episode patients, the current finding of smaller hippocampal volume in early onset depression may reflect a longer illness duration and/or greater number of episodes in patients with early onset MDD instead of a premorbid vulnerability factor. Nonetheless, as only about half (57%) of the early onset patients in our meta-analysis had a recurrent episode and as the percentage of recurrent episode patients did not moderate the result of smaller hippocampal volumes in early onset patients (post hoc test, P = 0.54), we conclude that early disease onset is (in part) independently associated with lower hippocampal volumes. Unfortunately, for many of the samples complete information on the exact number of episodes and duration of each episode was not available and simply calculating disease burden as current age minus age of onset is unsatisfactory, given the relapsing and remitting nature of MDD. Clearly, there is a continued need for longitudinal studies tracking hippocampal volume changes over the disease course, to further elucidate whether hippocampal abnormalities result from prolonged duration of chronic stress (that is, 'scarring'), represent a vulnerability factor for MDD, or both.

### Degree of hippocampal atrophy is not related to a history of febrile seizures in patients with proved hippocampal sclerosis [^622ee47c]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2000). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine the degree of hippocampal atrophy in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and proved hippocampal sclerosis to determine whether or not patients with febrile seizures have more severe hippocampal atrophy. To determine whether or not there is a relation between age of seizure onset, duration of temporal lobe epilepsy, or seizure frequency, and severity of hippocampal atrophy.

Methods

Hippocampal volumes were measured from volumetrically acquired MR images in 77 consecutive surgical patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (37 febrile seizures (FS)+, 40 FS-) with proved hippocampal sclerosis, and compared with 98 controls.

Results

Ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampal volumes were not significantly different between the FS+ and FS- groups. There was no difference in the age of onset of habitual seizures, duration of epilepsy, or age at the time of surgery, between these groups. No clinically significant correlations were found between hippocampal volumes and age of onset of first non-febrile seizure, duration of temporal lobe epilepsy, or complex partial and secondarily generalised seizure frequency, in patients with and without febrile seizures.

Conclusions

Although febrile seizures was associated with hippocampal sclerosis in 48% of patients in this surgical series, the degree of MRI determined hippocampal atrophy was not related to a history of such seizures. The results do not support the view that febrile seizures cause more severe hippocampal sclerosis and are consistent with the hypothesis that hippocampal sclerosis is a pre-existing abnormality.

### Three-dimensional patterns of hippocampal atrophy in mild cognitive impairment… [^d3e62a6b]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

The hippocampi of the patients with AD were significantly atrophic relative to those of the healthy controls. The MCI, multiple cognitive domain subtype, group did not differ from the controls, yet was significantly different from the MCI-A and the AD groups. The MCI-A patients had significant hippocampal atrophy compared with the controls, and did not differ significantly from the patients with AD. Conclusion These data add to the growing evidence that there are multiple forms of MCI, that they have distinct neuropathological correlates, and that MCI, multiple cognitive domain subtype, is not a more advanced form of the MCI-A subtype. The hippocampus and entorhinal cortex volumes are smaller than those of healthy individuals, appearing to be somewhere between those of patients with AD and those of healthy individuals, 7, 8 or as atrophic as those of patients with AD.

9, 10 Studies11-13 that use whole brain techniques find that in addition to the loss of volume in mesial temporal lobe structures, MCI patients have atrophy in the other heteromodal association areas. The 46 study patients underwent an extensive neuropsychiatric examination, 14, 16 and all patient records were reviewed at a multidisciplinary clinical consensus conference for assignment of a diagnosis. All patients with AD met the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke–Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable AD17; none of the patients with MCI had comorbid conditions that could in and of themselves cause cognitive dysfunction. Our analysis was aided by the fact that these cases were taken from a referral-based clinic.

In all cases, someone believed that there was a significant change in cognition and, consequently, the MCI patients studied herein are likely "closer" to conversion to clinical AD than they might be otherwise. Were we to study patients from a population study without such referral bias, we would be able to evaluate central nervous system structural changes before their clinical expression, and then the locus and extent of atrophy might differ from what was observed herein. These data provide further evidence for the existence of subtypes of MCI, and they are also consistent with the parsimonious explanation that MCI represents a mild form of AD that has yet to convert to the full expression of a dementia syndrome. The differences among the subtypes of MCI are a consequence of different patterns of atrophy, which express themselves as different patterns of neuropsychological dysfunction.

### Anatomical and functional correlates of human hippocampal volume asymmetry [^4376747c]. Psychiatry Research (2012). Low credibility.

Hemispheric asymmetry of the human hippocampus is well established, but poorly understood. We studied 110 healthy subjects with 3-Tesla MRI to explore the anatomical and functional correlates of the R > L volume asymmetry. We found that the asymmetry is limited to the anterior hippocampus (hemisphere×region interaction: F(1,109) = 42.6, p < .001). Anterior hippocampal volume was correlated strongly with the volumes of all four cortical lobes. In contrast, posterior hippocampal volume was correlated strongly only with occipital lobe volume, moderately with the parietal and temporal lobe volumes and not with the frontal lobe volume. The degree of R > L anterior hippocampal volume asymmetry predicted performance on a measure of basic cognitive abilities. This provides evidence for regional specificity and functional implications of the well-known hemispheric asymmetry of hippocampal volume. We suggest that the developmental profile, genetic mechanisms and functional implications of R > L anterior hippocampal volume asymmetry in the human brain deserve further study.

### Hippocampal circuit dysfunction in psychosis [^ee6dea30]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Alterations in hippocampal structure and function have also been associated with psychotic-like experiences in the general population (although see). Moreover, hippocampal dysfunction is shared across other neuropsychiatric disorders, which is perhaps unsurprising given the large overlap in genetic risk and symptoms. Due in part to this overlap, hippocampal circuit dysfunction specific to psychosis is often difficult to discriminate. Notwithstanding, there is some evidence that hippocampal alterations are most pronounced in schizophrenia, decreasing in severity along the psychiatric spectrum. The nature and specificity of hippocampal dysfunction in psychosis is thus still being parsed, and while beyond the scope of the present review, this overlap has broad transdiagnostic implications for the pathophysiology and putative treatment of other disorders.

### GSK3 β: a plausible mechanism of cognitive and hippocampal changes induced by erythropoietin treatment in mood disorders? [^e1c37fe6]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Identifying putative connections between GSK3β, erythropoietin, hippocampus, cognition and mood disorders

The hippocampus is an important brain region implicated in mood disorders. Specifically, changes in the neural circuitry of the hippocampus have been implicated in cognitive deficits in patients with mood disorders –, which may arise in part from the disruption of neuroplasticity. Disturbance in hippocampal neuroplasticity has been hypothesised to play an aetiological role in mood disorders and may result from chronic inflammatory processes and over-activation of stress responses –. This is consistent with evidence showing that stress-induced glucocorticoid production is associated with reduced hippocampal neurogenesis, hippocampal memory deficits and depression-like behaviour in animals –. Moreover, a recent meta-analysissupported an overall significant hippocampal volume reduction in patients with MDD relative to controls and several additional studies reported hippocampal subiculum shape abnormalities in patients with depression –.

### A data-driven model of biomarker changes in sporadic Alzheimer's disease [^1e2b4285]. Brain (2014). Low credibility.

Ordering of magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers

The ordering of MRI biomarkers from the EBM agrees with previous findings, with atrophy rates becoming abnormal before overall volume changes, and volume changes occurring in a distinct sequence, starting in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, progressing to other temporal lobe areas, the middle temporal gyrus and the fusiform gyrus, with resulting overall brain volume loss and ventricular expansion. Results in APOE+ subjects also support previous findings, suggesting earlier hippocampal and entorhinal volume loss, which occur before Mini-Mental State Examination reduction in the APOE+ population and after Mini-Mental State Examination in the whole population and amyloid+ population.

One perhaps surprising result of the MRI biomarker ordering is that the increasing whole brain atrophy rate event occurs before the hippocampal atrophy rate event both in the whole and amyloid-β+ population. In common with any data-driven model of biomarker changes, the EBM orders events based on when the corresponding measurements become discernibly different between cases and controls. This may not reflect the order of appearance of underlying pathology as the precision of the measurements may vary. Thus, this result might simply reflect the increased variability associated with measurement of hippocampal over whole-brain atrophy rates. Other possible factors are that the results are influenced by subjects who have a mixture of pathologies, where other processes occur alongside Alzheimer's disease that contribute to brain atrophy rate but not hippocampal atrophy rate, such as vascular disease, or other neurodegenerative diseases. Alternatively, excess whole brain atrophy may be a core feature of all patients with Alzheimer's disease, noting that some individuals with pathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease have relatively hippocampal sparing disease.

### Differential vulnerability of hippocampal subfields to amyloid and tau deposition in the lewy body diseases [^6fa0e3a9]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

In summary, the results of this study link volume loss of hippocampal output structures, and in particular the subiculum, to functional cognitive impairment and to amyloid and tau copathologies in LBD. Subiculum volume appears to play a pivotal mediating role in the cross-sectional relationship between cortical amyloid burden and functional cognition. By contrast, medial temporal tau deposition in LBD is identified as a driver of subiculum atrophy over time. Together, these findings provide a framework for future investigations of LBD exploring targeted interventions focused on AD copathologies for the prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment.

### Brain derived neurotrophic factor val66Met polymorphism, the five factor model of personality and hippocampal volume: implications for depressive illness [^b450b7cb]. Human Brain Mapping (2009). Low credibility.

Altered hippocampal volume, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism, and neuroticism have each been implicated in the etiology of psychiatric disorders, especially depression. However, the relationship between these variables is not well understood. Here, we determined the effects of the BDNF Val66met polymorphism on the five-factor personality dimensions (assessed using the NEO-FFI), trait depression (assessed with the DASS-21) in a cross-sectional cohort of 467 healthy volunteers. A large matched subset of this cohort was also assessed for grey matter volume of the hippocampus and contiguous temporal cortical regions using magnetic resonance imaging. In Met carriers, elevations in neuroticism and trait depression and stress were associated with lower mean hippocampal volume, but there were no such associations in Val homozygotes. Trait depression, in particular, was found to moderate the effects of BDNF genotypes on hippocampal volume. Met carriers with high trait depression showed a reduction in grey matter volume of the mean hippocampus compared with Val homozygotes. These findings suggest that even in otherwise healthy subjects, trait depression may contribute to the susceptibility of Met carriers to hippocampal grey matter loss.

### Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging in Alzheimer's disease patients at prodromal stage [^186d7e42]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

In the past few decades, it has been proposed that Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease, might be reliably diagnosed at earlier stages, i.e. in preclinical phases or at the point of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In particular, MCI with a high likelihood of progression to full-blown AD is a subtype of MCI (MCI-due-to-AD), supported by both neuropsychological and neuropathological evidence, and represents the highest risk factor for developing dementia over time.

A particularly promising approach in neurodegenerative research is based on the innovative use of acutely sensitive imaging techniques, i.e. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which can provide reliable diagnostic markers of early structural modifications. Indeed, atrophy within the hippocampus in MCI patients has been consistently reported as the best structural predictor of conversion to AD. However, hippocampal atrophy is associated with a wide range of other neurological pathologies, thus limiting its specificity for AD. While a number of studies have focused their analysis on the hippocampus, we suggest that amygdalar volume may be as useful as hippocampal volume for the diagnosis of early AD and could be, in addition, an independent marker of cognitive decline.
