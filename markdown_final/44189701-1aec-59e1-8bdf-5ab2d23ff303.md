## Question

Lateral heel pain cause

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of lateral heel pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the anatomic location and distinguishing lateral heel pain from plantar and posterior heel pain. Then, I should verify the most likely etiologies for lateral heel pain, including sinus tarsi syndrome, peroneal tendinopathy, sural nerve entrapment, and calcaneal stress fracture. Next, I will review key differentiators in history and examination, followed by the role of imaging. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized differential and outline initial management principles, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the anatomic frame. Lateral heel pain localizes to the outer aspect of the calcaneus and may extend into the lateral hindfoot or peroneal region; this differs from plantar medial pain typical of plantar fasciitis and posterior pain typical of Achilles pathology, so I need to keep those distinctions front and center to avoid anchoring bias toward plantar fasciitis, which is medial and plantar rather than lateral [^93a12573] [^c76b8d88].

> Now, I will examine the most likely cause: sinus tarsi syndrome. Wait, let me verify the classic features. Patients often report lateral midfoot or lateral heel pain with a feeling of instability, worsened by activity, uneven surfaces, or cutting maneuvers; the pain is typically lateral and can be reproduced with subtalar motion or direct palpation over the sinus tarsi, which fits the lateral heel localization we are considering [^93a12573].

> Next, I should review peroneal tendinopathy as a key lateral-sided cause. Hold on, I should verify the mechanics and exam clues. Peroneal tendon pain localizes laterally behind the malleolus and along the lateral calcaneal wall, often with swelling and tenderness, and symptoms are provoked by resisted eversion and by activity; hypertrophy of the peroneal tubercle can aggravate tendinopathy, and in children, Iselin's apophysitis at the base of the fifth metatarsal can mimic lateral heel pain, so I need to check the exact point of maximal tenderness and age context [^4aef7d74] [^2ec2ebfa] [^05cb6dec].

> I will now consider sural nerve entrapment, including the lateral calcaneal branch. Let me think about the sensory pattern and triggers. Patients may report burning, tingling, or numbness on the lateral heel and foot, with symptoms worsened by tight shoes or compression; ultrasound can identify a swollen sural nerve or a small lesion, and electrodiagnostics can support the diagnosis when uncertainty remains, so I should confirm sensory changes and shoe-related aggravation in the history [^e0babbcd] [^c9a5bbac].

> But wait, what if the pain is osseous rather than soft tissue or neural. Calcaneal stress fracture can present with lateral heel pain, particularly over the lateral wall of the calcaneus, and may be tender to medial-lateral compression of the calcaneus; early radiographs can be negative, so MRI or bone scan may be needed if suspicion is high, especially after a recent increase in load or change in surface [^948ed85b] [^a783e646].

> Let me reconsider other lateral contributors so I don't miss anything. Posterior ankle impingement from a malunited calcaneal fracture can cause lateral heel pain, though this is typically post-traumatic and associated with a posterior calcaneal spike; in children, a painful peroneal tubercle without overt tendinopathy has been described, reinforcing the need to tailor the differential by age and trauma history [^dae621c4] [^2ec2ebfa].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach. I need to ensure the history captures activity changes, shoe wear, instability, and neuropathic features; on exam, I should palpate the sinus tarsi, peroneal tendons, and lateral calcaneal wall, perform subtalar motion and resisted eversion, and screen for sensory deficits. If uncertainty persists or red flags arise, MRI best delineates sinus tarsi, peroneal tendons, and neural structures, while ultrasound can visualize peroneal tendons and sural nerve pathology dynamically, and radiographs can screen for stress fracture or bony prominences when indicated [^4640c38a] [^c9a5bbac] [^948ed85b].

> I should double-check the differential synthesis to avoid premature closure. Prioritized causes of lateral heel pain include sinus tarsi syndrome, peroneal tendinopathy, sural nerve entrapment, and calcaneal stress fracture, with consideration of posterior ankle impingement and pediatric variants such as Iselin's disease; plantar fasciitis remains in the broader differential but is typically medial and plantar rather than lateral, so I need to keep localization front and center [^93a12573] [^104265ae] [^05cb6dec].

> Finally, I need to outline initial management principles while acknowledging that specifics depend on the confirmed diagnosis. For suspected sinus tarsi syndrome, subtalar injection and targeted physical therapy are reasonable; for peroneal tendinopathy, activity modification, footwear changes, and peroneal strengthening are foundational; for sural neuropathy, shoe modification and decompression strategies are first-line; for stress fracture, protected weight bearing and immobilization are indicated until healing is confirmed; I should confirm that these align with guideline-based care and adjust based on imaging and response [^e0babbcd] [^a783e646].

Lateral heel pain most often arises from **sinus tarsi syndrome** (subtalar joint instability/inflammation) [^93a12573], **peroneal tendinopathy** (overuse or impingement) [^4aef7d74], or **sural nerve entrapment** (burning/numbness) [^e0babbcd]. Less common causes include calcaneal stress fracture [^948ed85b], lateral plantar nerve entrapment (Baxter's neuropathy) [^notfound], and Haglund's deformity with lateral impingement [^7dc7afea]. Diagnosis is guided by **location-specific tenderness**, provocation tests, and imaging (ultrasound or MRI) when needed [^4640c38a] [^43efc451]. Management is typically conservative (rest, orthotics, physical therapy, injections) [^df4c6164]; surgery is reserved for refractory cases [^3cb94b54].

## Diagnostic approach

- **History**: Onset, activity, trauma, shoe wear, neurologic symptoms [^e055fbe4].
- **Physical examination**: Palpation, subtalar motion, resisted eversion, Tinel's sign, sensory testing [^31084c2d].
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound or MRI for soft tissue; radiographs for bony pathology; bone scan/MRI for stress fracture [^4640c38a] [^43efc451] [^948ed85b].

---

## Management strategies

- **Conservative management**: Rest, activity modification, orthotics, physical therapy, NSAIDs, corticosteroid injections [^df4c6164] [^c4bdcd04].
- **Surgical management**: Reserved for refractory cases (e.g. sinus tarsi debridement, peroneal tendon repair, nerve release, Haglund excision) [^3cb94b54].

---

Lateral heel pain is most often due to **sinus tarsi syndrome**, **peroneal tendinopathy**, or **sural nerve entrapment**, with diagnosis based on targeted history, exam, and selective imaging; most cases resolve with conservative care, and surgery is reserved for persistent symptoms.

### Diagnosis of heel pain [^c76b8d88]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Heel pain is a common presenting symptom in ambulatory clinics. There are many causes, but a mechanical etiology is most common. Location of pain can be a guide to the proper diagnosis. The most common diagnosis is plantar fasciitis, a condition that leads to medial plantar heel pain, especially with the first weight-bearing steps in the morning and after long periods of rest. Other causes of plantar heel pain include calcaneal stress fracture (progressively worsening pain following an increase in activity level or change to a harder walking surface), nerve entrapment (pain accompanied by burning, tingling, or numbness), heel pad syndrome (deep, bruise-like pain in the middle of the heel), neuromas, and plantar warts. Achilles tendinopathy is a common condition that causes posterior heel pain. Other tendinopathies demonstrate pain localized to the insertion site of the affected tendon. Posterior heel pain can also be attributed to a Haglund deformity, a prominence of the calcaneus that may cause bursa inflammation between the calcaneus and Achilles tendon, or to Sever disease, a calcaneal apophysitis in children. Medial midfoot heel pain, particularly with continued weight bearing, may be due to tarsal tunnel syndrome, which is caused by compression of the posterior tibial nerve as it courses through the flexor retinaculum, medial calcaneus, posterior talus, and medial malleolus. Sinus tarsi syndrome occurs in the space between the calcaneus, talus, and talocalcaneonavicular and subtalar joints. The syndrome manifests as lateral midfoot heel pain. Differentiating among causes of heel pain can be accomplished through a patient history and physical examination, with appropriate imaging studies, if indicated.

### Abstract… [^a1d06ea7]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis causes throbbing medial plantar heel pain that is worse with the first few steps in the morning or after long periods of rest. The pain usually decreases after further ambulation, but can return throughout the day with continued weight bearing. Tenderness is noted on the medial calcaneal tuberosity and along the plantar fascia. NERVE ENTRAPMENT Heel pain that is accompanied by burning, tingling, or numbness may suggest a neuropathic etiology. These symptoms most commonly indicate nerve entrapment caused by overuse, trauma, or injury from previous surgery. Affected nerves leading to plantar heel pain are typically branches of the posterior tibial nerve, including the medial plantar nerve, the lateral plantar nerve, or the nerve to the abductor digiti minimi. Neuropathic heel pain is usually unilateral; therefore, underlying systemic illnesses should be ruled out in those with bilateral pain.

7, 11 Lumbar radiculopathy of L4-S2 must also be considered in the diagnosis of neuropathic heel pain. Initial treatment of heel pain caused by nerve entrapment includes rest, ice, anti-inflammatory or analgesic medications, relief of pressure at the site of pain, and stretching exercises. If conservative measures are ineffective after six to 12 months, surgical decompression should be considered. HEEL PAD SYNDROME Pain from heel pad syndrome is often erroneously attributed to plantar fasciitis. Patients with heel pad syndrome present with deep, bruise-like pain, usually in the middle of the heel, that can be reproduced with firm palpation. Walking barefoot or on hard surfaces exacerbates the pain. The syndrome is usually caused by inflammation, but damage to or atrophy of the heel pad can also elicit pain. Decreased heel pad elasticity with aging and increasing body weight can also contribute to the condition.

25 Compression of the posterior tibial nerve most commonly occurs as it courses through this tunnel, causing neuropathic pain and numbness in the posteromedial ankle and heel, which may extend into the distal sole and toes. 6 Patients often report worsening of pain with standing, walking, or running, and alleviation of pain with rest or loose-fitting footwear. 24 It can arise from repeated lateral ankle sprains or from repeated hyperpronation of the foot. 24 Initial treatment includes managing the underlying causes with orthotics or physical therapy, although anti-inflammatory or analgesic medications and corticosteroid injections may also be beneficial.

Plantar heel pain — presentation, contributing factors, and evaluation emphasize that the most common cause cited is biomechanical stress of the plantar fascia and its enthesis at the calcaneal tuberosity, with localized nerve entrapment also potentially contributory; patients usually present with pain at initiation of weight bearing that eases after minutes then returns with activity, and evaluation should include targeted history, exclusion of neurologic symptoms, and comprehensive lower-extremity examination including assessment of plantar fat pad quality and height.

### Heel pain: diagnosis and management [^93a12573]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of heel pain is extensive, but a mechanical etiology is the most common. The specific anatomic location of the pain can help guide diagnosis. The most common diagnosis is plantar fasciitis, which leads to medial plantar heel pain, especially with the first weight-bearing steps after rest. Other causes of plantar heel pain include calcaneal stress fractures (progressively worsening pain after an increase in activity or change to a harder walking surface), nerve entrapment or neuroma (pain accompanied by burning, tingling, or numbness), heel pad syndrome (deep, bruise-like pain in the middle of the heel), and plantar warts. Achilles tendinopathy is a common cause of posterior heel pain; other tendinopathies result in pain localized to the insertion site of the affected tendon. Posterior heel pain can also be attributed to Haglund deformity (a prominence of the calcaneus that may lead to retrocalcaneal bursa inflammation) or Sever disease (calcaneal apophysitis common in children and adolescents). Medial midfoot heel pain, particularly with prolonged weight bearing, may be due to tarsal tunnel syndrome, which is caused by compression of the posterior tibial nerve. Sinus tarsi syndrome manifests as lateral midfoot heel pain and a feeling of instability, particularly with increased activity or walking on uneven surfaces.

Injuries that target the bones of the midfoot are important causes of pain. The medial aspect of the midfoot has been extensively studied but the lateral plantar region has not received as much attention. The objective of this article is to review the differential diagnosis of lateral plantar pain, emphasizing on the common mechanisms of injury, and to identify characteristic imaging findings for these pathologic conditions.

### Plantar fasciitis and other causes of heel pain | AAFP… [^68f6de15]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Presenting Symptoms Patients usually describe pain in the heel on taking the first several steps in the morning, with the symptoms lessening as walking continues. They frequently relate that the pain is localized to an area that the examiner identifies as the medial calcaneal tubercle. The pain is usually insidious, with no history of acute trauma. Many patients state that they believe the condition to be the result of a stone bruise or a recent increase in daily activity. It is not unusual for a patient to endure the symptoms and try to relieve them with home remedies for many years before seeking medical treatment. It is well documented that plantar fasciotomy alone, without inferior calcaneal exostectomy, is an effective surgical approach to this condition.

Sciatica Heel pain secondary to sciatica is a result of pressure on the L5-S1 nerve root, which provides segmental innervation to the posterior thigh, and the gluteal, anterior, posterior and lateral leg muscles, as well as sensation to the heel. This nerve root is also responsible for the plantar response. The sciatic nerve innervates numerous muscles along its course, and patients may experience weakness in any or all of them. They may also report sharp pain radiating down the buttocks and the posterior aspect of the thigh and leg distally toward the heel. Specific conditions that may cause compression of the posterior tibial nerve include a soft tissue mass, callus from a previous fracture of the medial malleolus, inflammation of one of the tendons coursing through the tarsal canal and excessive pronation that increases tension on the posterior tibial tendon and the corresponding nerve.

Patients may describe heel pain with a tingling sensation around the plantar and medial aspect of the heel. Symptoms are often exacerbated by weight-bearing and ambulation but may persist at rest. Entrapment of the Lateral Plantar Nerve Entrapment of the first branch of the lateral plantar nerve, which provides innervation to the abductor digiti quinti muscle, has been said to cause plantar medial heel pain. The entrapment usually occurs between the abductor hallucis muscle and the quadratus plantae muscle, giving patients a burning sensation on the plantar aspect of the heel that is aggravated by daily activities and may even persist at rest. Palpation of this area may prove painful, with a tingling sensation. The same conservative modalities that are used to treat plantar fasciitis are effective in treating this condition.

Heel pain etiology — American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons clinical practice guideline: Heel pain, whether plantar or posterior, is predominantly a mechanical pathology, and the majority of heel pain has a mechanical etiology; however, diverse pathologies including neurologic, arthritic, traumatic, neoplastic, infectious, or vascular etiologies must be considered.

Other causes of heel pain (Pathway 4) — Although less common, benign and malignant tumors, infection (soft tissue and bone), and vascular compromise must be considered as etiologies of a patient's heel pain, and the potential morbidity of these conditions is substantial. Proper diagnostic testing along with consultation or referral to the appropriate specialist are paramount in these individuals. In adolescents, calcaneal apophysitis is probably the most frequent etiology of heel pain, and palliative treatment is successful in nearly all cases.

### The diagnosis and treatment of heel pain: a clinical practice guideline-revision 2010 [^31712368]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Medium credibility.

Neurologic heel pain — definition, nerve etiologies, and referral: "Neurologic heel pain is defined as pain in the heel as a result of an entrapment or irritation of one or more of the nerves that innervate this region", and "persistent symptoms may yield neurologic-related pathology". Patients "with a history of previous heel surgery or trauma should be highly suspect for neurologic heel pain". Nerves considered include "Posterior tibial (tarsal tunnel syndrome)", "Medial calcaneal (heel neuroma)", "Medial plantar", "Lateral plantar, including branch to abductor digiti minimi", and "Sural, including lateral calcaneal". Proximal processes also apply: heel pain or sensory loss "can also be attributable to more proximal nerve impingement syndromes", and back-to-foot radiation "must be evaluated for radiculopathy secondary to proximal nerve root pathology", with "double-crush syndrome, in which concomitant proximal and distal nerve entrapments may occur simultaneously". When suspected with sensory findings and radiating pain, the text notes "appropriate referral for diagnostic studies and/or assessment by a specialist".

Calcaneal fractures and stress fractures — clinical features and management are outlined as follows: intra-articular fractures involving the subtalar joint result in diffuse pain in the hindfoot that is poorly localized to the heel itself; diagnosis is made by a history of trauma, focal pain upon palpation, and radiographic confirmation of the fracture; treatment may be surgical, although many relatively minor fractures often may occur in older or high-risk individuals for whom nonsurgical management may be the most judicious course; stress fractures of the calcaneus occur as a consequence of repetitive load to the heel, with the most common site of stress fracture immediately posterior and inferior to the posterior facet of the subtalar joint; the physical findings include tenderness to the lateral wall of the calcaneus, swelling and warmth may be present, pain elicited with compression of the calcaneus is highly suspicious of a stress fracture, and frequently the onset of symptoms precedes the radiographic findings, and ancillary measures can assist in early diagnosis, including Technetium bone scans or MRI.

### Plantar and medial heel pain: diagnosis and management [^f4beb602]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Heel pain is commonly encountered in orthopaedic practice. Establishing an accurate diagnosis is critical, but it can be challenging due to the complex regional anatomy. Subacute and chronic plantar and medial heel pain are most frequently the result of repetitive microtrauma or compression of neurologic structures, such as plantar fasciitis, heel pad atrophy, Baxter nerve entrapment, calcaneal stress fracture, and tarsal tunnel syndrome. Most causes of inferior heel pain can be successfully managed nonsurgically. Surgical intervention is reserved for patients who do not respond to nonsurgical measures. Although corticosteroid injections have a role in the management of select diagnoses, they should be used with caution.

### Plantar fasciitis: evaluation and treatment [^2efeb95b]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of plantar heel pain. Its characteristic features are pain and tenderness, predominately on the medial aspect of the calcaneus near the sole of the heel. Considering a complete differential diagnosis of plantar heel pain is important; a comprehensive history and physical examination guide accurate diagnosis. Many nonsurgical treatment modalities have been used in managing the disorder, including rest, massage, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, night splints, heel cups/pads, custom and off-the-shelf orthoses, injections, casts, and physical therapy measures such as shock wave therapy. Most reported treatment outcomes rely on anecdotal experience or combinations of multiple modalities. Nevertheless, nonsurgical management of plantar fasciitis is successful in approximately 90% of patients. Surgical treatment is considered in only a small subset of patients with persistent, severe symptoms refractory to nonsurgical intervention for at least 6 to 12 months.

### Plantar heel pain and fasciitis [^656fba6f]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Plantar heel pain causes soreness or tenderness of the sole of the foot under the heel, which sometimes extends into the medial arch. The prevalence and prognosis are unclear, but the symptoms seem to resolve over time in most people.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for plantar heel pain? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to January 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 15 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: casted orthoses (custom-made insoles), corticosteroid injection (alone, or plus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), extracorporeal shock wave therapy, heel cups, heel pads (alone or with corticosteroid injection), lasers, local anaesthetic injection (alone or with corticosteroid injection), night splints plus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, stretching exercises, surgery, taping, and ultrasound.

Posterior heel pain (Pathway 3) — etiology, presentation, and imaging highlight Achilles insertional pathology and retrocalcaneal bursitis. The posterior heel is the second most common location of mechanically induced heel pain, and pathology in this area is categorized as (1) Achilles insertional tendinopathy or enthesopathy, and (2) Haglund's deformity with or without retrocalcaneal bursitis. Achilles enthesopathy most commonly presents with an insidious onset and frequently leads to chronic posterior heel pain and swelling. Pain is aggravated by increased activity (eg, walking, running) and increased pressure caused by the shoe's heel counter. A palpable prominence may be appreciated both medially and laterally to the insertion of the Achilles tendon. Other proximal pathologies of the Achilles tendon must be ruled out. Achilles-related tendinopathy and rupture have also been related to fluoroquinolone use. Radiographic findings commonly show insertional proliferative spurring and/or erosion or intra-tendinous calcifications.

### Osteochondrosis: common causes of pain in growing bones [^f55de5b7]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Osteochondrosis is a term used to describe a group of disorders that affect the growing skeleton. These disorders result from abnormal growth, injury, or overuse of the developing growth plate and surrounding ossification centers. The exact etiology of these disorders is unknown, but genetic causes, repetitive trauma, vascular abnormalities, mechanical factors, and hormonal imbalances may all play a role. Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease is a hip disorder that causes hip pain, an atraumatic limp, and knee pain. Osgood-Schlatter and Sinding-Larsen-Johannson diseases are common causes of anterior knee pain that is aggravated by jumping activities and kneeling. Sever disease causes heel pain that is exacerbated by activity and wearing cleats. It often mimics Achilles tendinitis and is treated with activity and shoe modifications, heel cups, and calf stretches. Freiberg disease and Köhler bone disease often cause foot pain and are disorders of the metatarsal head and navicular bone, respectively. Radiographs show sclerosis, flattening, and fragmentation of bone in both diseases. Elbow pain can be caused by medial epicondyle apophysitis or Panner disease. Medial epicondyle apophysitis is exacerbated by frequent throwing and is treated with throwing cessation and acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Panner disease is the most common cause of lateral-sided elbow pain in children younger than 10 years. It may or may not be associated with frequent throwing, and it resolves spontaneously. Scheuermann disease causes back pain and a humpback deformity from vertebral bone anterior wedging.

### MR imaging findings in heel pain [^4640c38a]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Heel pain is common and due to a variety of osseous and soft tissue disorders. Causes of heel pain can be classified by the anatomic structure in which they arise and include disorders of the (1) Achilles tendon, (2) plantar fascia, (3) calcaneus, (4) bursae, (5) nerves in the hindfoot, (6) and heel pad. Although careful history taking and physical examination are important, imaging plays a vital role in the diagnosis and management of heel pain. MR imaging is the best imaging test to assess pain in the heel. This review discusses the common causes of heel pain, focusing on MR imaging appearances.

### Diagnosing heel pain in adults [^7f6fa270]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Heel pain is a common condition in adults that may cause significant discomfort and disability. A variety of soft tissue, osseous, and systemic disorders can cause heel pain. Narrowing the differential diagnosis begins with a history and physical examination of the lower extremity to pinpoint the anatomic origin of the heel pain. The most common cause of heel pain in adults is plantar fasciitis. Patients with plantar fasciitis report increased heel pain with their first steps in the morning or when they stand up after prolonged sitting. Tenderness at the calcaneal tuberosity usually is apparent on examination and is increased with passive dorsiflexion of the toes. Tendonitis also may cause heel pain. Achilles tendonitis is associated with posterior heel pain. Bursae adjacent to the Achilles tendon insertion may become inflamed and cause pain. Calcaneal stress fractures are more likely to occur in athletes who participate in sports that require running and jumping. Patients with plantar heel pain accompanied by tingling, burning, or numbness may have tarsal tunnel syndrome. Heel pad atrophy may present with diffuse plantar heel pain, especially in patients who are older and obese. Less common causes of heel pain, which should be considered when symptoms are prolonged or unexplained, include osteomyelitis, bony abnormalities (such as calcaneal stress fracture), or tumor. Heel pain rarely is a presenting symptom in patients with systemic illnesses, but the latter may be a factor in persons with bilateral heel pain, pain in other joints, or known inflammatory arthritis conditions.

### Is radiographic evaluation necessary in children with a clinical diagnosis of calcaneal apophysitis (sever disease)? [^6073fdbe]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Calcaneal apophysitis (Sever disease) is most often diagnosed clinically, and radiographic evaluation is believed to be unnecessary by many physicians. To evaluate the need for radiographic evaluation in children with a clinical diagnosis of calcaneal apophysitis, we determined the frequency of abnormal radiographic findings in a group of patients with this clinical diagnosis.

Methods

Clinical records and radiographs of all children between the age of 4 and 17 years who presented with a chief complaint of heel pain were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with an insidious onset of heel pain were included; those with acute trauma and a diagnosis of Achilles tendinitis were excluded. Radiographs were reviewed by 3 orthopaedists (blinded to the clinical diagnosis) to determine if any radiographic abnormalities were present. Clinical records were reviewed in an attempt to determine what factors, if any, indicated a diagnosis other than calcaneal apophysitis.

Results

Review identified 98 patients (134 feet) with a mean age of 10.8 years who had a clinical diagnosis of calcaneal apophysitis. Positive radiographic findings (all on lateral radiographs) were identified in 5 patients (5 feet): 3 calcaneal unicameral bone cysts, 1 distal tibial nonossifying fibroma, and 2 calcaneal stress fractures (1 patient had both a calcaneal unicameral bone cysts and a stress fracture in the same foot). The rate of abnormal radiographic findings in the 96 patients was 5.1% (3.75% in the 133 feet).

Conclusions

The abnormal radiographic findings seen in 5.1% of children usually led to more aggressive treatment including close radiographic follow-up or immobilization. No common findings in the history or examination indicated patients who were more likely to have positive radiographs. Despite concern about exposure to ionizing radiation and the cost of medical imaging, routine lateral radiographs appear to be justified for screening of pediatric patients with heel pain. If a diagnosis of calcaneal apophysitis is made without obtaining radiographs, a lesion requiring more aggressive treatment could be missed.

### Inferior heel pain in soccer players: a retrospective study with a proposal for guidelines of treatment [^12bfa1bd]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the review of the literature, data show that heel pain is one of the most frequent reasons for medical examinations among players.

The purpose of this study was to examine the epidemiological difference of heel pain among soccer players and to propose specific therapeutic guidelines.

From our data, it appears that the inferior heel pain among soccer players is due to the local biomechanical stress, but there are also other causes; in the case of heel pain, from compression of the sural nerve and of abductor digiti minimi, there is an associated neurological cause.

The main nerves affected in heel pain are the posterior tibial (in tarsal tunnel syndrome), the medial calcaneal (heel neuroma), the medial plantar and the lateral plantar including the first branch to abductor digiti minimi, and the sural (including lateral calcaneal) nerves.

Nerves reported more commonly in plantar heel pain of neurological origin are the first branch of the lateral plantar nerve (Baxter's nerve)and the medial calcaneal nerve.

Among the possible causal factors of nerve compression, as indicated in the literature among the possible causative factors of the nervous compression that deserve differential diagnosis, obesity, venous insufficiency, trauma and lesions that occupy space (as tumours), but in soccer players is linked to a history of mechanical sciatica.

Nevertheless the major studies have focused on the plantar fasciitis and possible treatments. Many studies have been on intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors related to the development of this disease, such as body weight and body mass index (BMI), the plantar load, the biomechanical overload factors, and the exercise mode.

Referring to the 2010 clinical practice guidelines developed by the CPG Heel Pain Committee of the ACFAS, the initial patient evaluation in suspected plantar heel pain consists of a significant history of isolated plantar heel pain, weightbearing pain after periods of rest, morning pain, barefoot walking or use of inappropriate shoes. If there are associated significant findings such as pain on palpation of the inferior heel or plantar fascia, obesity/high BMI, pronated foot architecture, localised swelling or atrophy of infracalcaneal fat pad, radiographs may be helpful. The treatment options suggested by evidence-based medicine as regards plantar heel pain have been graded according to three steps (figure 8).

Posterior heel pain — Bursitis/Haglund's pathway outlines a parallel evaluation and stepwise care: Significant history includes acute or chronic posterior heel pain, pain aggravated by shoe pressure, morning pain, and symptoms relieved with barefoot or backless shoe. Significant findings include tenderness lateral to Achilles, posterior lateral subcutaneous bony prominence, and ± local inflammation/bursitis. Radiographs demonstrate posterior superior prominence to calcaneus — Haglund's deformity and soft tissue swelling — bursitis. Initial treatment options include patient-directed treatment options (open-back shoes, cryotherapy/topical analgesics) plus orthoses, accommodative padding, oral antiinflammatories, physical therapy, and weight loss. If improvement is unsatisfactory, immobilization with cast or CAM walker, continuation of initial treatment options, and consideration of injection of bursa are directed; continued lack of improvement leads to surgery with resection Haglund's/bursa or calcaneal osteotomy. Satisfactory improvement at any step directs to continue therapy until symptoms resolve, with a reminder to consider alternative etiologies (Pathway 4).

### Midfoot arthritis [^e15a1313]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2010). Low credibility.

Midfoot arthritis is a common cause of significant pain and disability. Although the medial tarsometatarsal (TMT) joints provide < 7 degrees of sagittal plane motion, the more mobile lateral fourth and fifth TMT joints provide balance and accommodation on uneven ground. These small constrained TMT joints also provide stability and translate the forward propulsion motion of the hindfoot and ankle joint to the forefoot metatarsophalangeal joints from heel rise to toe-off. Posttraumatic degeneration is the primary cause of midfoot arthritis, although primary degeneration and inflammatory conditions can also affect this area. The result is a painful midfoot that can no longer effectively transmit load from the hindfoot to the forefoot. Shoe modifications and orthotic inserts are the mainstay of nonsurgical management. Successful management of midfoot arthritis with orthoses is predicated on achieving adequate joint stabilization while still allowing function. Surgical intervention typically involves arthrodesis of the medial midfoot, although the best treatment of the more mobile lateral column is a subject of debate.

### Heel pain: diagnosis and management… [^104265ae]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

1 Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause, with a lifetime prevalence of 10% in the general population. 3, 4 The primary symptom is usually throbbing medial plantar heel pain that is worse with the first steps after rest. The pain often decreases after further ambulation, but can return with continued weight bearing. Palpation of the medial calcaneal tuberosity and along the plantar fascia typically causes sharp, stabbing pain. 1 Passive dorsiflexion of the foot and toes often elicits pain as well. 5 Diagnostic imaging is not required, but weight-bearing radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonography can help rule out other causes of heel pain. 3, 5 Heel spurs are present in approximately 50% of patients with plantar fasciitis, but they do not correlate well with symptoms and can also be found in persons without plantar fasciitis.

17, 18 Neuropathic plantar heel pain typically involves branches of the posterior tibial nerve, the lateral plantar nerve, or the nerve to the abductor digiti minimi. 1 Lumbar radiculopathy at the L4-S2 levels should also be considered regardless of the presence of associated low back pain. HEEL PAD SYNDROME Pain from heel pad syndrome is described as a deep, bruise-like pain, usually in the middle of the heel, and can be reproduced with firm palpation. Pain may be elicited by walking barefoot, on harder surfaces, or for prolonged periods. HAGLUND DEFORMITY A Haglund deformity is a prominence of the superior aspect of the posterior calcaneus. 17, 18 Compression of the posterior tibial nerve through the tarsal tunnel causes burning, tingling, shooting pain, or numbness in the posteromedial ankle and heel, and sometimes into the distal sole and toes. 17, 18, 33 It can also lead to cramping of the medial longitudinal arch.

33 This syndrome can be caused by trauma, space-occupying lesions, poor biomechanics, or systemic disease. 18, 33. 32, 34 Patients with sinus tarsi syndrome typically present with pain in the lateral calcaneus and ankle accompanied by a feeling of foot and ankle instability that is provoked by running, cutting and jumping, walking on uneven surfaces, or even stepping off a curb. 32, 34 Imaging may include MRI or radiography with stress views.

### The heel complex: anatomy, imaging, pathologic conditions, and treatment [^364bb16c]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

The differential diagnosis for heel pain is broad but primarily involves abnormalities of the Achilles tendon, calcaneus, and plantar fascia. Achilles tendon disorders include tendinosis, tendinitis, and partial or complete tears. Tendinosis refers to tendon degeneration, while tendinitis is inflammation after acute overload. Untreated tendinosis can progress to partial or complete tears. Tendon disorders can be accompanied by paratenonitis or inflammation of the loose sheath enclosing the tendon. Initial management involves rehabilitation and image-guided procedures. Operative management is reserved for tendon tears and includes direct repair, tendon transfer, and graft reconstruction. The calcaneus is the most commonly fractured tarsal bone. The majority of fractures are intra-articular; extra-articular fractures, stress or insufficiency fractures, medial process avulsion, and neuropathic avulsion can also occur. Posterosuperior calcaneal exostosis or Haglund deformity, retrocalcaneal bursitis, and insertional Achilles tendinosis form the characteristic triad of Haglund syndrome. It is initially managed with orthotics and physiotherapy. Operative management aims to correct osseous or soft-tissue derangements. The plantar fascia is a strong fibrous tissue that invests the sole of the foot and contributes to midfoot stability. Inflammation or plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of heel pain and can be related to overuse or mechanical causes. Acute rupture is less common but can occur in preexisting plantar fasciitis. Conservative treatment includes footwear modification, calf stretches, and percutaneous procedures. The main operative treatment is plantar fasciotomy. Plantar fibromatosis is a benign fibroblastic proliferation within the fascia that can be locally aggressive and is prone to recurrence. © RSNA, 2024 Test Your Knowledge questions for this article are available in the supplemental material.

### Epidemiology of posterior heel pain in the general population: cross-sectional findings from the clinical assessment study of the foot [^18aca0ea]. Arthritis Care & Research (2015). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Foot pain is a common symptom in the general population, particularly in older adults. The prevalence in adults ages ≥ 18 years ranges from 17–24% 1, 2, rising to as high as 42% in adults ages > 65 years 3. Three‐quarters of older adults with foot pain experience disabling pain affecting them on most days 4, and foot pain is also linked to problems with mobility and gait in this age group, with an increased risk of falling 5, 6.

Box 1
Significance & Innovations

Although the prevalence of foot pain has been well reported, the contribution of the posterior heel to this prevalence is less clear. Previous studies have reported pain by area of the foot 1, 2, but in these the heel is reported as a single region rather than by precise anatomic site. Pain in specific anatomic areas of the foot is often attributed clinically to specific conditions, and therefore observing pain at a specific site can give greater insights into the underlying pathology.

The etiology of posterior heel pain (HP) is largely related to disorders of the Achilles tendon and associated structures and varies by age and location. In children and adolescents, the most common cause is calcaneal apophysitis (Sever's disease) 7. In adults, midportion posterior HP is likely to represent Achilles tendinopathy, whereas insertional pain may occur due to Haglund's deformity, retrocalcaneal bursitis, or enthesitis 7, 8.

Previous studies have reported the incidence of specific posterior heel pathologies, but the population prevalence of posterior HP is unknown. De Jonge et al note an incidence rate of Achilles tendinopathy in Dutch general practice consulters of 1.85 per 1,000 9. Overuse, sporting injuries, obesity, and diabetes mellitus have previously been implicated in the pathogenesis of Achilles tendon disorders 10, 11, 12, 13. However, these associations have largely been reported from retrospective case reviews in specialist settings or small cohort studies in specific populations (for example, elite athletes) 10. Further information on the overall population prevalence and risk factors for developing posterior HP would inform health service provision and identify potential preventative and treatment strategies.

The aims of this study were therefore to estimate the population prevalence of posterior HP in either foot, bilateral posterior HP, and disabling posterior HP in community‐dwelling adults ages ≥ 50 years, and to examine factors that may be associated with posterior HP.

### The role of SPECT / CT of foot and ankle in the evaluation of heel pain [^953e1254]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Heel pain is a common symptom in foot and ankle disorders. Typical heel pain can be assessed according to the patient's history and the location of pain. In some atypical inconclusive cases, bone SPECT/CT is the upcoming imaging modality for the detection of causes of heel pain. We present the case of 57-year-old man with atypical heel pain, plantar and Achilles spurs. SPECT/CT images demonstrated increased bony activity in arthritis of midfoot, not plantar and Achilles spurs. It suggests potential role of SPECT/CT in the evaluation and management of heel pain by showing hidden pathology of foot and ankle.

### Imaging of plantar fascia disorders: findings on plain radiography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging [^43efc451]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Several pathologies involving structures other than the PF may mimic PF disease and should be included in the differential diagnosis. Achilles tendinopathy may present with symptoms that are similar to those of plantar fasciitis. This may be related to the close anatomic connection between the PF and the paratenon of the Achilles tendon. Thus, both the Achilles tendon and PF should be carefully evaluated using ultrasound or MRI. Further, if MRI reveals marked bone marrow oedema at the calcaneal origin of the PF in patients with plantar fasciitis, a concomitant enthesopathy of the Achilles tendon should be suspected. The presence of plantar calcaneal spurs should also be assessed. Spur genesis has traditionally been attributed to chronic traction of the PF and repetitive microtrauma, which in turn lead to periostitis and calcification. The role of vertical compression of the heel in spur formation has recently been hypothesised and related to older age, osteoarthritis and obesity. As stated above, calcaneal spurs are not specific for plantar fasciitis and are often identified in asymptomatic individuals; however, a strong association between spurs and chronic plantar heel pain has been demonstrated, specifically in cases of concurrent fat pad abnormalities. Finally, entrapment of the first branch of the lateral plantar nerve (Baxter's neuropathy), stress fractures of the calcaneus, vascular disease and heel fat pad atrophy and necrosis may present with nonspecific heel pain and represent all differential diagnoses of PF disease.

In conclusion, PF disorders are common causes of heel pain and disability in the general population. Imaging is often required to confirm diagnosis or reveal concomitant injuries. As an inexpensive, quick and dynamic imaging technique that also provides high-resolution depiction of the PF and comparison with the contralateral side, ultrasound should be considered the modality of first choice for assessing PF disorders. Several indirect findings of PF disorders can be detected on conventional radiographs and should be identified even in patients examined for other reasons. MRI can reliably delineate both the soft tissue and bone anatomy of the sole of the foot and enables correct diagnosis of PF disorders, but is expensive and should be regarded as a second-line imaging modality.

### Increasing consensus on terminology of achilles tendon-related disorders [^9cc85ce9]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Terminology in which Haglund eponyms such as Haglund's deformity, Haglund's syndrome and Haglund's disease are all dissimilar entities should be avoided, because there is a large variation in the presumed meaning of these eponymous terms. Haglund's syndrome was first defined as a common cause of posterior heel pain, characterized clinically by a painful soft tissue swelling at the level of the Achilles tendon insertion. Haglund's deformity was first described as a tender swelling in the region of the Achilles tendon with visible prominence of the postero-lateral aspect of the calcaneus. Haglund's disease, however, refers to osteochondrosis of the accessory navicular bone.

In systematic reviews, many eponymous diagnosis have to be converted to anatomical diagnostic groupings and at all studies are excluded based on aberrant or uninterpretable definitions of an eponym or pathology, which can lead to different research results which are often leading for the best scientific-based treatment in clinical practice.

The survey was sent to members of the Ankleplatform Study Group, which caused selection bias. Even though orthopaedic surgeons from over the whole world responded, these were specifically experienced in the field of foot and ankle pathology what could have led to an overestimation of the terms used compared by orthopaedic surgeons in general. Also, the presumed definitions of the terms used for Achilles tendon-related disorders were not assessed which could have provided insight into the misuse of terms. In the literature study, we included a selection of eight foot and ankle journals, which caused selection bias.

Uniform terminology provides the ability to communicate with an universal language in daily practice amongst clinicians and researchers and will lead to the best available scientific-based treatment in clinical practice.

### Childhood and adolescent sports-related overuse injuries [^ba427ac7]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Youth sports participation carries an inherent risk of injury, including overuse injuries. Little leaguer's shoulder, a stress fracture of the proximal humerus that presents as lateral shoulder pain, usually is self-limited. Little leaguer's elbow is a medial stress injury; treatment consists of complete rest from throwing for four to six weeks followed by rehabilitation and a gradual throwing program. Spondylolysis is a stress fracture of the pars interarticularis. Diagnostic modalities include plain film radiography, bone scan, computed tomography, single photon emission computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment usually is conservative. Spondylolisthesis is the forward or anterior displacement of one vertebral body over another and may be related to a history of spondylolysis. Diagnosis is made with plain film radiography and graded according to the amount of displacement. Osgood-Schlatter disease presents as anterior knee pain localized to the tibial tubercle. Diagnosis is made clinically, and most patients respond to conservative measures. Calcaneal apophysitis (or Sever's disease) is a common cause of heel pain in young athletes, presenting as pain in the posterior aspect of the calcaneus.

### Correlation of heel pain with body mass index and other characteristics of heel pain [^cce9be51]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

A prospective, descriptive study was performed at Oakwood Healthcare medical clinics to determine the body mass index (BMI) of patients with heel pain and of a control group of patients presenting for other reasons. A questionnaire was used to obtain information in each of the patient groups and to determine characteristics of patients with plantar fascial heel pain. Standard weightbearing lateral radiographs were taken to determine overall foot structure. The typical patient was female, had heel pain for just over 1 year, with a sedentary to moderate activity level. Although height was comparable, patients with heel pain had a higher BMI (30.4 ± 0.7) than those without heel pain (28.2 ± 0.7, p = .04). The BMI appears to play a greater role in heel pain than does foot structure, as the authors found no structural commonalities that would explain these patients' pain. Control patients also reported a higher level of activity. Fifty-one percent exercised three or more times per week for more than 20 minutes each time, while less than half that (25.4%) of heel pain patients did so. While half of the heel pain patients had been treated by other providers prior to visiting our clinic, fewer than 25% of these patients had been instructed to lose weight by a physician. The authors feel that a BMI of 25 (the target for decreased cardiovascular risk) represents a reasonable goal for weight loss that may reduce heel pain.

### Prevalence of painful peroneal tubercles in the pediatric population [^2ec2ebfa]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Pain isolated to the lateral aspect of the heel can be difficult to diagnose, particularly in the growing child. Peroneal tendinopathy or frank tears of the peroneal tendons secondary to an enlarged peroneal tubercle has been implicated as a potential source of pain in adults. Neither the prevalence of enlarged peroneal tubercles in the pediatric population nor the number of symptomatic tubercles in children has been elucidated. We conducted a review of children who presented to our institution with foot and/or ankle pain and who underwent 3-dimensional computed tomography. Initially, a radiographic review was undertaken of all computed tomography scans to determine the prevalence of peroneal tubercles in children. The peroneal tubercles were measured and then classified according to height. The children with tubercles 3 mm or greater in height (adult mean height) underwent a more detailed chart review to evaluate for the incidence of painful tubercles. During the study period, 2,689 children were seen for foot and ankle pain, and 367 underwent a computed tomography scan during their treatment course. Of these 367 patients, 57% had a measurable peroneal tubercle, and 162 (44%) met the criteria for chart review. Only 3 adolescents (1.9%) were found to have clinical symptoms and ultimately underwent surgical excision with successful relief of symptoms. Peroneal tubercle hypertrophy appears to exist in the pediatric population; however, in contrast to adults with associated peroneal tendinopathy and tears, the children in our series had isolated painful tubercles without significant tendinopathy. The clinical examination is important in the diagnosis, and treatment by excision appears to be successful. Although a relatively rare etiology of pain, it is important that treating physicians keep this pathologic process in the differential diagnosis, because conservative management might not reduce the pain in these children.

### Ultrasound-guided injection of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid versus corticosteroid in management of plantar fasciitis: a 24-week randomized clinical trial [^c6ae8508]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Plantar fasciitis (PF) is the leading cause of heel pain in adults. Nearly 1 million patients visit physicians for the diagnosis and management of PF symptoms each year. The prevalence of heel pain in public is 4–7% and about 80% of this is caused by PF. It is more prevalent among women versus men, in those aged 45–64 years versus those aged 18–44 years, and in the obese versus those with a body mass index (BMI) of less than 25 kg/m2.PF can cause significant morbidity and activity limitations in the affected patients. Nonsurgical treatment options include rest, ice application, stretching, exercise, proper footwear, arch supports, orthotics, night splints, extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT), anti-inflammatory agents, and various injections including corticosteroid (CS), platelet-rich plasma (PRP), prolotherapy, autologous whole blood, botulinum toxinor ozone.

CSs are the most common injection modality for PF. Based on a Cochrane review, CS injections have temporary effects for near 24 weeks. Some adverse effects associated with CS injection are plantar fascia rupture, fat pad atrophy, lateral plantar nerve injury, and calcaneal osteomyelitis.

Hyaluronic acid (HA) injection has been used for many musculoskeletal disorders including osteoarthritis of the knee, persistent shoulder pain, osteoarthritis of the temporomandibular joint, knee pain in rheumatoid arthritis patients, and soft tissue and periarticular conditions such as lateral epicondylitis and patellar tendinopathy. Recently, Kumai and colleagues reported that a single injection of HA is clinically effective for the treatment of PF.

The plantar fascia is a thick aponeurosis with its origin at the medial calcaneal tubercle. The arch of the foot is supported by this fascia. Excessive running or standing for prolonged periods of time may cause an increased amount of tension along the plantar fascia which in turn makes changes in the aponeurosis that can be either acute or chronic. More recently, the term plantar fasciosis has been used instead of PF to show that the inflammation is not the main cause of the pain. Histopathologic investigation showed fibrous tissue has more disorganization rather than inflammation in PF, this finding is more likely to what happened in degenerative tendinosis.

### A case of lateral calcaneal neuropathy: lateral heel pain [^e0babbcd]. Muscle & Nerve (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although isolated injury of the sural nerve is frequently reported, entrapment involving the lateral calcaneal branch of the sural nerve (LCSN) is very rare.

Methods

We report the case of a 29-year-old man with lateral calcaneal neuropathy of the sural nerve without any history of trauma. The diagnosis was based on clinical, electrophysiologic, and radiologic studies, including ultrasonography (US) and MRI.

Results

US revealed a spindle-shaped swelling in the posterior part of the sural nerve around the lateral malleolus. MRI showed a small lesion in the sural nerve close to the lesser saphenous vein around the level of the lateral malleolus. Two months after conservative management, the numbness and tingling in the lateral calcaneal region improved.

Conclusions

Entrapment of the LCSN can arise from tight shoes. US is useful for evaluating the cutaneous nerve lesions that may be too small to detect by MRI. Muscle Nerve 54: 801–804, 2016.

### Treatment of progressive first metatarsophalangeal hallux valgus deformity: a biomechanically based muscle-strengthening approach [^77c6d838]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hallux valgus:

- **Definition**: Hallux valgus is a common foot deformity characterized by a lateral deviation of the hallux and a corresponding medial deviation of the first metatarsal, leading to a bony protrusion at the base of the toe.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of hallux valgus is multifactorial, with genetic factors playing a significant role. Biomechanical factors, including the collapse of the arch and the vertical orientation of the first metatarsal axis, also contribute to the development of the deformity. Additionally, wearing shoes that are too short or have high heels can contribute to the condition.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hallux valgus is estimated at 23% in adults aged 18–65 years and 35.7% in elderly aged > 65 years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for hallux valgus progression include age, female gender, and family history. Wearing tight, narrow shoes, or high heels can contribute to the development of hallux valgus. Additionally, certain occupations requiring prolonged standing or walking and forefoot disorders, such as metatarsalgia and lesser toe deformities, can also influence the development of hallux valgus.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, hallux valgus presents with pain, swelling, and a visible deformity at the base of the big toe. The condition can also cause difficulty in wearing certain types of footwear, including high-heeled and narrow shoes. Hallux valgus is a chronic, progressive, and degenerative condition. Over time, the angle of deformity increases, and symptoms may worsen. In the late stages, the hallux may become painful and lose its functional utility, leading to impaired gait.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of hallux valgus varies. Without intervention, symptoms may worsen and complications, such as osteoarthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint, may arise. However, surgical intervention can correct the deformity and alleviate symptoms, with high rates of patients returning to both comfortable and heeled shoes post-surgery.

### A case of bilateral baxter's neuropathy secondary to plantar fasciitis [^8ebcea40]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Heel pain is 1 of the most common presentations to the foot surgeon, and its causes are multifactorial. Baxter's neuropathy is caused by an impingement of the inferior calcaneal nerve and has been reported to be responsible for up to 20% of heel pain. The diagnostic imaging features are striking, with inflammation or atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle. Multiple studies have found that the prevalence of this finding is much greater than initially thought. However, it is more unusual to find bilateral and symmetrical features. The possible causes of this condition lie along the course of the inferior calcaneal nerve. Management is focused on treating the underlying condition, with conservative therapy and steroid injection as the mainstay. Refractory cases may require surgical release. We present the case of a 56-year-old female presenting with bilateral foot pain. Imaging reveals symmetrical abductor digiti minimi atrophy associated with bilateral plantar fasciitis. These appearances are well demonstrated on both magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound.

### Comparative effectiveness of treatment options for plantar heel pain: a systematic review with network meta-analysis [^e779b0ad]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of current treatment options for plantar heel pain (PHP).

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA).

Data Sources

Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, PEDro, Cochrane Database, Web of Science and WHO Clinical Trials Platform were searched from their inception until January 2018.

Study Selection

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with PHP investigating common treatments (ie, corticosteroid injection, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, therapeutic exercise, orthoses and/or extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT)) compared with each other or a no treatment, placebo/sham control.

Data Extraction and Analysis

Data were extracted and checked for accuracy and completeness by pairs of reviewers. Primary outcomes were pain and function. Comparative treatment effects were analysed by random effects NMA in the short term, medium term and long term. Relative ranking of treatments was assessed by surface under the cumulative ranking probabilities (0–100 scale).

Results

Thirty-one RCTs (total n = 2450patients) were included. There was no evidence of inconsistency detected between direct and indirect treatment comparisons in the networks, but sparse data led to frequently wide CIs. Available evidence does not suggest that any of the commonly used treatments for the management of PHP are better than any other, although corticosteroid injections, alone or in combination with exercise, and ESWT were ranked most likely to be effective for the management of short-term, medium-term and long-term pain or function; placebo/sham/control appeared least likely to be effective; and exercise appeared to only be beneficial for long-term pain or function.

Conclusions

Current evidence is equivocal regarding which treatment is the most effective for the management of PHP. Given limited understanding of long-term effects, there is need for large, methodologically robust multicentre RCTs investigating and directly comparing commonly used treatments for the management of PHP.

### The diagnosis and treatment of heel pain: a clinical practice guideline-revision 2010 [^11b96abf]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Medium credibility.

Neurologic heel pain — diagnostics and surgical management are described: Diagnostic studies may include electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction velocity (NCV) test, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and pressure specific sensory device (PSSD) test. Most cases of neurologic heel pain are unilateral; however, bilateral cases of entrapment neuropathy causing symptoms have been reported, and in suspected neurologic heel pain, especially in bilateral presentations, an underlying systemic disease must be ruled out. In some instances, a combination of pathologies may occur and surgical management will require intervention at both the area of nerve entrapment and the plantar fascia; EBM conclusions are as follows: intervention at both the area of nerve entrapment and the plantar fascia [Grade B recommendation].

Criteria for selecting studies

Type of studies

Published RCTs evaluating the efficacy or effectiveness of any intervention for PHP were considered for inclusion. No language restrictions were imposed. All other designs including quasi-experimental studies, letters to the editor, opinion pieces, editorials and conference abstracts were considered ineligible.

Characteristics of participants

An RCT was included if the participants were clinically diagnosed with PHP with explicit reference to pain on the underside of the heel that was most noticeable on weight-bearing after periods of rest but also worse following prolonged weight bearing. All participants were over the age of 16 years and had experienced symptoms of any duration. RCTs were excluded if participants' PHP was related to fractures, tumours or infections or confounded by other conditions that might be rheumatological, neural, vascular or dermatological in origin.

Types of interventions

Any RCT that investigated the effectiveness or efficacy of an intervention compared with another intervention, placebo, sham or wait and see was included, provided there was a follow-up of at least 2 weeks.

Outcome measures

Studies that reported at least one of the three outcome measures — patient-reported pain, first step pain or foot-related function — were included. Where multiple methods of quantifying the same outcome were reported, the author's main prespecified outcome metric was accepted, or that of the metric with the lower level of effect. This was done to avoid making recommendations based on type 1 error with the rationale that an intervention which results in a meaningful effect size for a given outcome should be consistent irrespective of the measure used.

Short term was defined as 1 week to 3 months, medium term as > 3 and up to 6 months and long term as > 6 months. Where multiple follow-ups within a time window were reported, the outcome at the latest time point within short and medium term, and closest to 1 year for long term was selected.

### WITHDRAWN. interventions for treating plantar heel pain [^575eb15b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Ten percent of people may experience pain under the heel (plantar heel pain) at some time. Injections, insoles, heel pads, strapping and surgery have been common forms of treatment offered. The absolute and relative effectiveness of these interventions are poorly understood.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to identify and evaluate the evidence for effectiveness of treatments for plantar heel pain.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group specialised register (September 2002), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2002), EMBASE (1988 to September 2002) and reference lists of articles and dissertations. Four podiatry journals were handsearched to 1998. We contacted all UK schools of podiatry to identify dissertations on the management of heel pain, and investigators in the field to identify unpublished data or research in progress. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of interventions for plantar heel pain in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently evaluated randomised controlled trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed trial quality. Additional information was obtained by direct contact with investigators. No poolable data were identified. Where measures of variance were available we have calculated the weighted mean differences based on visual analogue scale (VAS) scores.

Main Results

Nineteen randomised trials involving 1626 participants were included. Trial quality was generally poor, and pooling of data was not conducted. All trials measured heel pain as the primary outcome. Seven trials evaluated interventions against placebo/dummy or no treatment. There was limited evidence for the effectiveness of topical corticosteroid administered by iontophoresis, i.e. using an electric current, in reducing pain. There was some evidence for the effectiveness of injected corticosteroid providing temporary relief of pain. There was conflicting evidence for the effectiveness of low energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy in reducing night pain, resting pain and pressure pain in the short term (6 and 12 weeks) and therefore its effectiveness remains equivocal. In individuals with chronic pain (longer than six months), there was limited evidence for the effectiveness of dorsiflexion night splints in reducing pain. There was no evidence to support the effectiveness of therapeutic ultrasound, low-intensity laser therapy, exposure to an electron generating device or insoles with magnetic foil. No randomised trials evaluating surgery, or radiotherapy against a randomly allocated control population were identified. There was limited evidence for the superiority of corticosteroid injections over orthotic devices.

Authors' Conclusions

Although there is limited evidence for the effectiveness of local corticosteroid therapy, the effectiveness of other frequently employed treatments in altering the clinical course of plantar heel pain has not been established in randomised controlled trials. At the moment there is limited evidence upon which to base clinical practice. Treatments that are used to reduce heel pain seem to bring only marginal gains over no treatment and control therapies such as stretching exercises. Steroid injections are a popular method of treating the condition but only seem to be useful in the short term and only to a small degree. Orthoses should be cautiously prescribed for those patients who stand for long periods; there is limited evidence that stretching exercises and heel pads are associated with better outcomes than custom made orthoses in people who stand for more than eight hours per day. Well designed and conducted randomised trials are required.

### Heel pain-plantar fasciitis: revision 2023 [^167d05d4]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Heel pain – plantar fasciitis clinical practice guidelines — procedures for assigning levels of evidence state that level of evidence is assigned based on the study design using the Levels of Evidence table (APPENDIX D), assuming high quality (eg, for intervention, randomized clinical trial starts at level I). Study quality is assessed using the critical appraisal tool, and the study is assigned 1 of 4 overall quality ratings based on the critical appraisal results, and level of evidence assignment is adjusted based on the overall quality rating. For high quality (high confidence in the estimate/results), study remains at assigned level of evidence (eg, if the randomized clinical trial is rated high quality, its final assignment is level I), and high quality should include the following: randomized clinical trial with greater than 80% follow-up, blinding, and appropriate randomization procedures, and cohort study includes greater than 80% follow-up; diagnostic study includes consistently applied reference standard and blinding; prevalence study is a cross-sectional study that uses a local and current random sample or censuses. For lower quality, acceptable quality results in downgrade 1 level, low quality results in downgrade 2 levels, and unacceptable quality has serious limitations — exclude from consideration in the guideline. Based on critical appraisal results.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of pediatric foot and ankle pain [^0cebf6ae]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Sesamoid pathology

The medial and lateral sesamoid bones act as pulleys for the flexor hallucis brevis tendons and help stabilize the first MTP joint. Sesamoid disease includes inflammation, fracture or sprain of bipartite sesamoid. Injury is usually seen in young athletes who repetitively push off the ball of their feet during activities such as jumping sports or ballet. Bipartite or multipartite sesamoids are present in 10 to 33% of feet. Children and adolescents usually complain of pain with forefoot weight bearing and may walk with weight on the lateral border of the foot to compensate. On exam there may be localized tenderness and swelling Treatment includes RICE, NSAIDS, modified activity, modified footwear (wide toe box, stiff sole, low heel), orthoses (cut-out), and physiotherapy.

Plantar fascitiis

Plantar fascitiis is not as common in children and adolescents as adults. The plantar fascia aponeurosis stretches from the calcaneal tuberosity and divides to attach near the plantar aspect of the proximal phalanges and the base of the fifth metatarsal. It provides dynamic arch support. Plantar fascitiis is caused by repetitive microtrauma. In skeletally immature patients it may be associated with calcaneal apophysitis (Sever's disease). Enthesitis and periosteal inflammation associated with JIA (enthesitis related arthritis (ERA) subtype) and seronegative spodyloarthropathies can mimic plantar fascitiis. (See section on inflammatory disorders) In children with inflammatory disease, enthesitis is usually associated with tarsitis or peripheral joint arthritis and symptoms are more prominent in the morning. Children with plantar fascitiis usually report plantar heel pain worse with activity in addition to pain in the morning. On examination, tenderness is usually localized to the medial calcaneal tubercle with the foot in dorsiflexion. Tarsal arthropathy is characteristic of ERA. Investigations are helpful if systemic rheumatic disease is suspected. Diagnostic imaging is not useful for plantar fascitiis but may show erosive enthesitis in ERA. Treatment includes RICE, NSAIDS, modified activity, medial arch supports, physiotherapy, massage, fascial and Achilles stretching and strengthening.

### Getting to the heel of the problem: plantar fascia lesions [^27a84830]. Clinical Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Heel pain is a frequent disabling symptom. Clinical diagnosis is often difficult with a large range of possible diagnoses. Lesions of the plantar fascia form an important group. We present a review describing the common lesions of the plantar fascia, including plantar fasciitis, plantar fascia rupture, plantar fibromatosis, and plantar xanthoma, and illustrate them with appropriate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound imaging. We also address foreign-body reactions, enthesopathy, and diabetic fascial disease.

### Lateral column symptomatology following plantar fascial release: a prospective study [^b2dc15ed]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis or heel spur syndrome usually resolves with conservative management, but for patients with continued pain, surgical intervention is often pursued. In some cases, plantar fasciitis is relieved, but pain in the lateral column area appears postoperatively. This lateral column pain may be debilitating for the patient and often overlooked by the foot and ankle surgeon. The goal of the study was to identify the maximum amount of plantar fascia that can be surgically released to treat recalcitrant heel pain effectively while preventing the development of lateral column symptoms. All patients undergoing plantar fasciotomy after failing conservative treatment were eligible to participate. Patients rated their pain with an 11-point (0–10) visual analog scale (VAS) and described its location prior to and at monthly intervals after their surgery. Surgeons recorded whether 25, 50, or 66% of the plantar fascia was released during surgery. Open procedures were performed 72% of the time, and endoscopically in 28% of the patients. Key outcome variables included degree of fascial release and foot structure. Patients (n = 47) with lateral column pain after surgery (n = 15 feet) had a mean ± S.E. of 60.6 ± 3.0% of their plantar fascia released while those without pain (n = 35 feet) had only 48.7 ± 1.9% of this fascia released during surgery (ANOVA, p = .019). Age, weight, body mass index, gender, smoking status, comorbidities, general health, surgical procedure, postoperative care, calcaneal inclination angle, and talar declination angle did not differ for these groups (p > .146). For this patient population, regardless of surgical technique (endoscopic or open release), lateral column symptoms were more likely to result when more than 50% of the plantar fascia was released. The report proposes that a maximum of 50% of the plantar fascia be released during surgery.

### Impact of plantar fasciitis on the quality of life of male and female patients according to the foot health status questionnaire [^ace74bde]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Plantar fasciitis (PF; also known as "plantar heel pain") is a common foot disorder in adults secondary to an inflammatory response caused by repetitive micro-trauma. PF is commonly observed by health care practitioners, and is a musculoskeletal disease. Typically, this pain is described as "burning", "aching" and, occasionally, "lancinating". PF may increase during the first steps after waking-up or a prolonged rest. Furthermore, this pain can be associated with tenderness at the medial calcaneal tuberosity and along the plantar fascia.

PF may affect > 1 million people worldwide per year. The exact prevalence of PF is not known. The lifetime prevalence may reach 10% of the general population worldwide. A local population study of 3206 participants in Australia showed that the prevalence of heel pain was 3.6%. Landorf reported that the prevalence and prognosis of PF are not clear, though the symptoms seem to resolve over time in most people. Approximately 11%–15% of all foot symptoms require long-term professional care and affect all age groups, sexes, and ethnicities, with a higher prevalence noted in females aged 40–60 years.

Terms such as "jogger's heel", "tennis heel" or "policeman's heel" have been used to describe PF. Indeed, the most common etiologies of heel pain are mechanical factors. Common causes of heel pain include heel spur, Sever's disease, heel bump, Achilles tendinopathy, heel neuritis, and heel bursitis. After the initial inflammatory response and repetitive micro-trauma of plantar aponeurosis, myxoid degeneration with PF fragmentation as well as vascular ectasia in bone marrow, are the most common histologic findings. Therefore, PF may be considered a degenerative fasciosis in the absence of inflammation.

Pain and tenderness are sometimes extended into the medial arch. Pain associated with this condition may cause substantial disability and poor health-related quality of life (QoL). Risk factors include obesity, occupations that necessitate prolonged standing, pes planus, limited ankle dorsiflexion, plantar heel spurs and running, sedentary or athletic occupations, excessive foot pronation, and excessive running.

### Nerve entrapment syndromes of the lower limb: a pictorial review [^c9a5bbac]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

A clinically important branch of the lateral plantar nerve is the first branch, the inferior calcaneal nerve, also known as Baxter's nerve (shown in Fig. 2 (a)). Entrapment of this nerve can occur at three sites: deep to or adjacent to the fascial edge of a hypertrophied abductor hallucis muscle in long-distance runners, at the medial edge of the quadratus plantae muscle where the nerve changes from a vertical to a horizontal course, and most commonly at the medial calcaneal tuberosity. Entrapment at the latter site can be related to spur formation and soft-tissue inflammatory changes of plantar fasciitis (Fig. 5). Patients typically present with heel pain. MRI findings include denervation oedema or fatty atrophy of the abductor digiti minimi muscle. Abductor hallucis muscle hypertrophy and plantar fasciitis may be found as potential sources of inferior calcaneal nerve entrapment. Ultrasound can be utilised to trace the nerve, to detect abductor digiti minimi atrophy and also to perform the ultrasonographic Tinel's sign.

### Custom insoles versus sham and GP-led usual care in patients with plantar heel pain: results of the STAP-study-a randomised controlled trial [^09a02575]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Plantar heel pain, also known as plantar fasciitis or fasciopathy, is a common cause of foot pain. Plantar heel pain accounts for an estimated 8% to 15% of all foot complaints requiring medical care in adults. Plantar heel pain typically affects highly physically active people, such as running athletes, but is also common in middle-aged (40 to 60 years) women with high body mass index (BMI). The incidence of plantar heel pain in Dutch general practice is approximately 3.8 per 1000 patient-years. The clinical course of plantar heel pain is considered favourable with remission after 12 to 24 months in 60% to 80% of patients. However, given the effect of the complaints on every day and sports activities, the burden on patients is high. There is a need for effective treatment options, that can speed up recovery and limit impact.

Plantar heel pain can be managed by a range of different treatments in clinical practice and orthoses, such as in-shoe foot insoles are commonly applied by clinicians. Two systematic reviews found conflicting evidence for the effectiveness of orthoses on pain in plantar heel pain. Whittaker et al found a small, but statistically significant, beneficial effect of insoles on heel pain at 7 to 12 weeks when compared with sham. In contrast, a more recent systematic review concluded that insoles are not superior to sham in reducing pain in individuals with plantar heel pain. Of the three trials comparing custom-made insoles to sham, none were performed in a primary care setting. Additionally, no study has compared orthoses to usual care, despite custom-made insoles being the most frequent applied interventions for plantar heel pain in general practice. The added effect of insoles to sham is unclear and to usual care is unknown, making it impossible to know if referral for custom-made insoles is an appropriate option for patients who consult general practice.

We conducted a randomised clinical trial with a pragmatic design that compared custom-made insoles with sham insoles, as well as general practice (GP)-led usual care. The hypothesis was that custom-made insoles would be better than sham insoles and GP-led usual care at 12 weeks follow-up in terms of pain at rest and during activity.

Investigations

Laboratory tests are almost never necessary in evaluating a patient with foot or ankle pain. CBC, ESR or CRP, blood and joint cultures should be done if infection is suspected. Arthritis is a clinical diagnosis; anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor and HLA-B27 are helpful in classification and treatment but not diagnosis. CBC, peripheral smear should be done if hematological malignancy is suspected.

### Injected corticosteroids for treating plantar heel pain in adults [^c4bdcd04]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Plantar heel pain, commonly resulting from plantar fasciitis, often results in significant morbidity. Treatment options include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), orthoses, physical therapy, physical agents (e.g. extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), laser) and invasive procedures including steroid injections.

Objectives

To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of injected corticosteroids for treating plantar heel pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, clinical trials registries and conference proceedings. Latest search: 27 March 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of corticosteroid injections in the treatment of plantar heel pain in adults were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcome measures. We used a fixed-effect model unless heterogeneity was significant, when a random-effects model was considered. We assessed the overall quality of evidence for individual outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included a total of 39 studies (36 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 3 quasi-RCTs) that involved a total of 2492 adults. Most studies were small (median = 59 participants). Participants' mean ages ranged from 34 years to 59 years. When reported, most participants had heel pain for several months. The trials were usually conducted in outpatient specialty clinics of tertiary care hospitals in 17 countries. Steroid injection was given with a local anaesthetic agent in 34 trials. Follow-up was from one month to over two years. With one exception, trials were assessed at high risk of bias in one or more domains, mostly relating to lack of blinding, including lack of confirmation of allocation concealment. With two exceptions, we rated the available evidence as very low quality, implying in each case that we are 'very uncertain about the estimate'. The 39 trials covered 18 comparisons, with six of the seven trials with three or four groups providing evidence towards two comparisons. Eight trials (724 participants) compared steroid injection versus placebo or no treatment. Steroid injection may lead to lower heel pain visual analogue scores (VAS) (0 to 100; higher scores = worse pain) in the short-term (< 1 month) (MD -6.38, 95% CI -11.13 to -1.64; 350 participants; 5 studies; I² = 65%; low quality evidence). Based on a minimal clinically significant difference (MCID) of 8 for average heel pain, the 95% CI includes a marginal clinical benefit. This potential benefit was diminished when data were restricted to three placebo-controlled trials. Steroid injection made no difference to average heel pain in the medium-term (1 to 6 months follow-up) (MD -3.47, 95% CI -8.43 to 1.48; 382 participants; 6 studies; I² = 40%; low quality evidence). There was very low quality evidence for no effect on function in the medium-term and for an absence of serious adverse events (219 participants, 4 studies). No studies reported on other adverse events, such as post-injection pain, and on return to previous activity. There was very low quality evidence for fewer treatment failures (defined variously as persistent heel pain at 8 weeks, steroid injection at 12 weeks, and unrelieved pain at 6 months) after steroid injection. The available evidence for other comparisons was rated as very low quality. We are therefore very uncertain of the estimates for the relative effects on people with heel pain of steroids compared with other interventions in:1. Tibial nerve block with anaesthetic (2 trials); orthoses (4 trials); oral NSAIDs (2 trials); and intensive physiotherapy (1 trial).2. Physical modalities: ESWT (5 trials); laser (2 trials); and radiation therapy (1 trial).3. Other invasive procedures: locally injectable NSAID (1 trial); platelet-rich plasma injections (5 trials); autologous blood injections (2 trials); botulinum toxin injections (2 trials); cryopreserved human amniotic membrane injection (1 trial); localised peppering with a needle (1 trial); dry needling (1 trial); and mini scalpel needle release (1 trial). We are also uncertain about the estimates from trials testing different techniques of local steroid injection: ultrasonography-guided versus palpation-guided (5 trials); and scintigraphy-guided versus palpation-guided (1 trial). An exploratory analysis involving pooling data from 21 trials reporting on adverse events revealed two ruptures of plantar fascia (reported in 1 trial) and three injection site infections (reported in 2 trials) in 699 participants allocated to steroid injection study arms. Five trials reported a total of 27 participants with less serious short-term adverse events in the 699 participants allocated steroid injection study arms. Reported treatments were analgesia, ice or both. Given the high risk of selective reporting for these outcomes and imprecision, this evidence was rated at very low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low quality evidence that local steroid injections compared with placebo or no treatment may slightly reduce heel pain up to one month but not subsequently. The available evidence for other outcomes of this comparison was very low quality. Where available, the evidence from comparisons of steroid injections with other interventions used to treat heel pain and of different methods of guiding the injection was also very low quality. Although serious adverse events relating to steroid injection were rare, these were under-reported and a higher risk cannot be ruled out. Further research should focus on establishing the effects (benefits and harms) of injected steroids compared with placebo in typical clinical settings, subsequent to a course of unsuccessful conservative therapy. Ideally, this should be preceded by research, including patient involvement, aimed to obtain consensus on the priority questions for treating plantar heel pain.

Lumbar nerve root involvement — diagnostic features by level are outlined as follows: For L3–4 (nerve root L4), pain involves low back; hip; anterolateral thigh and medial leg with anteromedial thigh and knee numbness, quadriceps atrophy, extension of quadriceps weakness, squat and rise screening finding, and knee jerk diminished reflex. For L4–5 (L5), pain involves above SI joint; hip; lateral thigh and leg; dorsum of foot with lateral leg and first 3 toes numbness, minor or nonspecific atrophy, dorsiflexion of great toe and foot weakness, heel walking screening finding, and none reliable reflexes. For L5–S1 (S1), pain involves above SI joint; posterolateral thigh and leg; heel with back of calf; lateral heel and foot; toe numbness, gastrocnemius and soleus atrophy, plantar flexion of great toe and foot weakness, walking on toes screening finding, and ankle jerk diminished reflex.

Clinical Relevance

Currently, there is no standardized ways of early assessing and treating patients with HPI. Lack of well-conducted clinical studies prevents the definition of a shared policy of clinical management and contributes to unjustified heterogeneity in clinical behaviors and patients outcomes.

In particular, clinical evidence is limited to few case series, largely insufficient to guide practice. On the contrary, a number of narrative reviews are available, showing different and sometimes conflicting opinions among experts coming from different specialties, professions, and countries.

### Endoscopic debridement for treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis: an Innovative technique and prospective study of 46 consecutive Patients [^dc01dc54]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Plantar fasciitis is one the most common pathologies treated by foot and ankle surgeons. When nonoperative therapy fails, surgical intervention might be warranted. Various surgical procedures are available for the treatment of recalcitrant plantar fasciitis. The most common surgical management typically consists of open versus endoscopic plantar fascia release. Comorbidities associated with the release of the plantar fascia have been documented, including lateral column overload and metatarsalgia. We present an innovative technique for this painful condition that is minimally invasive, allows visualization of the plantar fascia, and maintains the integrity of the fascia. Our hypothesis was that the use of endoscopic debridement of the plantar fascia with or without heel spur resection would provide a minimally invasive technique with acceptable patient outcomes.

Calcaneal stress fractures and plantar fascia rupture — In patients with heel pain, scans are highly sensitive for stress fractures of the calcaneus, and radiographic features include an area of linear sclerosis corresponding to the fracture site. Treatment is conservative and involves protection and immobilization of the involved foot, and progression to an acute fracture is uncommon. Soft tissue trauma (eg, acute plantar fascia rupture) also can cause heel pain even with negative radiographic and bone scan findings, and plantar fascia rupture has also been reported as a complication of heel corticosteroid injection.

### The diagnosis and treatment of heel pain: a clinical practice guideline-revision 2010 [^3cb94b54]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Medium credibility.

Heel pain surgical management — third tier care continues tier 1 and/or 2 programs with consideration of surgical management, and options may include plantar fasciotomy using recognized techniques or extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) as an alternative. Current practice favors a minimally invasive approach to plantar fasciotomy versus extensive open surgical exposures, and in most cases removal of the plantar heel spur does not seem to add to the success of the outcome. In some cases multiple etiologic factors including nerve entrapment may necessitate combining nerve release and plantar fasciotomy, and radiofrequency coblation of the plantar fascia as well as radiofrequency nerve ablation and cryoprobe have been advocated more recently as an alternative surgical approach to chronic heel pain.

General features of PF disorders

Plantar fasciitis (Figs. 2, 3, and 4) is the most common injury of the PF and is estimated to induce more than 1 million patients to seek treatment annually. Despite its name, plantar fasciitis has a degenerative rather than inflammatory nature and is related to overuse trauma leading to microtears; thus, the term "plantar fasciopathy" is often preferred. The proximal third of the central bundle of the PF is classically involved; however, distal plantar fasciitis has recently been recognised as a cause of recalcitrant heel pain. The aetiology of plantar fasciitis is multifactorial. Biomechanical risk factors include those causing repetitive stress on the PF, such as foot deformities, improper footwear, increased body mass index and activities that involve prolonged walking, running or standing. Among the medical conditions associated with plantar fasciitis, the most notable are seronegative spondyloarthropathies and rheumatoid arthritis. Plantar calcaneal spurs, also known as calcaneal enthesophytes, have been investigated in great detail as a possible cause of plantar fasciitis, but they are not specific and also occur in asymptomatic individuals. The diagnosis of plantar fasciitis generally relies on clinical history and physical examination. The main symptoms include pain and stiffness in the morning, or pain at the beginning of activity after rest. Physical examination reveals tenderness at the origin of the PF and impaired dorsiflexion of the ankle and extension of the toes. Although generally self-limiting, plantar fasciitis may result in physical inactivity and impact quality of life. Imaging can aid in the diagnosis, particularly in recalcitrant cases or may rule out other heel pathology.

### Lateral wedge insoles for medial knee osteoarthritis: 12 month randomised controlled trial [^68573c48]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that our non-significant results for symptoms could reflect a type II error. Pain was only measured at baseline and at 12 months of follow-up. Knowing that pain fluctuates in patients with osteoarthritis, we may have been able to detect a significant insole effect had we included more measurement time points throughout the 12 months to better estimate the average pain over the duration of the trial.

Comparison with previous studies

Our findings are in agreement with the limited number of other randomised controlled trials that have also failed to show the efficacy of lateral wedge insoles. One study found that customised lateral heel wedge insoles worn for two years were associated with a reduced intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, a secondary outcome, but did not alter pain, stiffness, function, or joint space narrowing on radiography. A crossover trial found no statistical or clinical effect of a lateral wedge insole worn for six weeks. Similarly, in the most recent study, a customised lateral wedge insole worn in standardised walking shoes had no greater effect on pain over 12 months than a neutral insole. Using the largest cohort of participants to date, our results concur with these clinical trials and extend their findings by providing novel data relating to the effects of lateral wedge insoles on structural features seen on magnetic resonance imaging.

### Changes in rearfoot alignment in chronic plantar heel pain [^efbf37f1]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Plantar heel pain is a common disabling condition in adults. Biomechanical factors are important in the development of plantar heel pain. Quantitative changes in rearfoot alignment in patients with plantar heel pain have not been previously investigated. From April 2016 to March 2017, 100 patients with plantar heel pain and 100 healthy individuals were recruited. The foot posture index was used for the measurement of foot alignment. The generalized joint hypermobility condition was assessed using the Beighton scale. The transverse plane talocalcaneal angle, calcaneocuboid angle, talonavicular uncovering angle, calcaneal inclination angle (CIA), talar declination angle, talar-first metatarsal angle, and sagittal talocalcaneal angle were measured on standard weightbearing anteroposterior and lateral foot radiographs. The body mass index was recorded electronically. The distribution of sex, age, weight, body mass index, side, foot posture index score, and Beighton scale were comparable between groups (p > .05). The mean calcaneocuboid angle (p = .009), talonavicular uncovering angle (p = .000), CIA (p = .000), talar declination angle (p = .039), and talar-first metatarsal angle (p = .000) were significantly higher in the plantar heel pain group. In conclusion, our study has demonstrated a relationship between chronic plantar heel pain and the CIA.

### Coexistence of plantar calcaneal spurs and plantar fascial thickening in individuals with plantar heel pain [^606e3d02]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To examine associations between plantar calcaneal spurs, plantar fascia thickening and plantar heel pain (PHP), and to determine whether tenderness on palpation of the heel differentiates between these presentations.

Methods

Adults aged ⩾50 years registered with four general practices were mailed a Health Survey. Responders reporting foot pain within the last 12 months underwent a detailed clinical assessment. PHP in the past month was documented using a foot manikin. Plantar calcaneal spurs were identified from weight-bearing lateral radiographs and plantar fascia thickening (defined as > 4 mm) from ultrasound. Tenderness on palpation of the plantar fascia insertion was documented. Associations between these factors and PHP were explored using generalized estimating equations.

Results

Clinical and radiographic data were available from 530 participants (296 women, mean [s.d.] age 64.9 [8.4] years), 117 (22.1%) of whom reported PHP. Plantar calcaneal spurs and plantar fascia thickening were identified in 281 (26.5%) and 501 (47.3%) feet, respectively, but frequently coexisted (n = 217, 20.4%). Isolated plantar calcaneal spurs were rare (n = 64, 6.0%). Participants with PHP were more likely to have a combination of these features compared with those without PHP (odds ratio 2.16, 95% CI 1.24, 3.77, P = 0.007). Tenderness on palpation of the heel was not associated with plantar calcaneal spurs or plantar fascia thickening, either in isolation or in combination, in those with PHP.

Conclusion

Plantar calcaneal spurs and plantar fascial thickening are associated with PHP, but frequently coexist. Tenderness on palpation of the heel does not appear to differentiate between clinical presentations of PHP.

A total of 11 765 studies were identified through electronic databases and clinical trial registries (figure 3). After removal of duplicates, 6839 titles were screened. A total of 6477 studies were subsequently excluded leaving 362 studies to be assessed for full-text retrieval and PEDro analysis. Following the quality analysis, 51 studies met the eligibility criteria and were available for analysis. In total, the review included 4351 participants.

The characteristics of the included studies, including the treatment arms, outcome measures and participant characteristics are detailed in online supplemental file 1. Most studies had a small sample size (median = 75, IQR = 62). The mean duration of symptoms was 13 months (range 0.8–68.3 months) and 49% were female participants. Pain was evaluated in all studies either by a VAS or numerical pain rating scale. Other outcome measures included the Foot Function Index (9 studies), Roles and Maudsley score (7 studies), plantar fascia thickness (6 studies), Foot Health Status Questionnaire (10 studies), the Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire (2 studies), Lower Extremity Functional Scale (3 studies), Foot Ankle Ability Measure (2 studies), Maryland Foot Score (1 study), Global Rating of Change (1 study), EQ-5D (study), 36-Item Short Form Survey (1 study) and the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (1 study). Finally, the mean length of follow-up was 20 weeks (range 2–104 weeks). Ninety-six per cent of studies evaluated outcomes in the short term, but only 27% in the medium term and 13% in the long term.

### Management of plantar heel pain: a best practice guide informed by a systematic review, expert clinical reasoning and patient values [^81b2b6c5]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The ESWT evidence has some limitations that affected synthesis of related trials. Continuous outcomes that evaluated overall pain, first step pain or function were often reported at baseline but were presented as the overall success rate with regard to heel pain at follow-up. For example, Gerdesmeyer et al and Gollwitzer et al presented first step pain, pain while doing activities and pain after application of a dolorimeter at baseline on a continuous scale. However, at follow-up they reported scores on a dichotomous scale by defining success as > 60% reduction in heel pain from baseline for at least two out of three measures that evaluated pain. While it might be desirable to label participant's outcome as either a 'success' or 'not a success' in response to an intervention, this approach has disadvantages. For example, participants that are close to but on opposite sides of the clinical cut-off point for success are labelled as being categorically different rather than being similar. Our synthesis was strengthened by the effect sizes being large, and the presence of enough adequately powered trials of high quality to determine efficacy. These guide practice where patients are not improving quickly enough or failing to respond to the core intervention (figure 1). High-quality effectiveness studies are warranted, particularly in people with PHP who are not responding to the core approach as the majority of published work has been efficacy studies, and cost-effectiveness has not been evaluated.

### Terminology for achilles tendon related disorders [^31216841]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Until 1982, inflammation of the retro-calcaneal bursa caused by impingement between the anterior aspect of the Achilles tendon and the posterior part of the calcaneus was named retrocalcaneal bursitis. In that year, Pavlov et al. first described the 'Haglund's syndrome', defined as a frequent cause of posterior heel pain, characterized by a painful soft tissue swelling at the level of the Achilles tendon insertion. Using a lateral heel radiograph, they described a prominent calcaneal bursal projection, retro-calcaneal bursitis, thickening of the Achilles tendon, and a convexity of the superficial soft tissues at the level of the Achilles tendon insertion, a 'pump bump'. This is the first publication in which the authors used the name 'Haglund'. Haglund's deformity was then described by Vega et al. as a tender swelling in the region of the Achilles tendon with visible prominence of the postero-lateral aspect of the calcaneus. In their opinion, the superficial Achilles bursa and/or the retrocalcaneal bursa reflected the enlarged prominence. Then, in 1990 and 1991 'analogies' for Haglund's deformity were described: Haglund's syndrome, achillobursitis, achillodynia, and retro-calcaneal bursitis were mentioned. In 1993, Haglund's disease was added to this list, although it was earlier described as being an osteochondrosis of the accessory navicular bone (or os tibiale externum).

Sella et al. thought that all these names were confusing, and proposed separate definitions for Haglund's disease, Haglund's syndrome, and Haglund's deformity. Haglund's disease was referred to as osteochondrosis of the accessory navicular; Haglund's deformity as a chronic, sometimes painful distortion of the postero-superior and lateral portion of the calcaneus; and the term Haglund's syndrome was used when symptoms were present with/without the deformity, and may involve the retro-calcaneal bursa as well as the Achilles tendon and the superficial Achilles bursa. This proposal was, however, not commonly adapted, and many publications kept using terms interchangeably.

7 FOOT AND ANKLE NEUROPATHIES

While there is sparse literature investigating the incidence of sports‐related neuropathies of the foot and ankle, the most frequently reported injuries involve running and dancing. Aside from the interdigital nerves, for which there are no established EDx protocols, the inferior calcaneal nerve (ICN), medial plantar nerve (MPN), and tibial nerve are most frequently affected.,

7.1 Inferior calcaneal nerve

The ICN, commonly referred to as "Baxter's nerve" is a mixed sensorimotor nerve that provides sensory fibers to the long plantar ligament and calcaneal periosteum, and motor innervation to the abductor digiti quinti (ADQ) and variably the flexor digitorum brevis. The ICN is commonly the first branch of the lateral plantar nerve as depicted in Figure 5, though there is significant anatomic variability. Many potential entrapment sites have been described, including between the abductor hallucis (AH) and quadratus plantae, between the calcaneus and flexor digitorum brevis, at the plantar aspect of the long plantar ligament, or due to abnormal compressive lesions, such as venous varicosities, calcaneal spurs, and plantar fascia tears.,

FIGURE 5
Depiction of tarsal tunnel common tibial nerve branching anatomy. The tunnel contains the tibialis posterior tendon, flexor digitorum longus tendon, flexor hallucis longus tendon, and tibial neurovascular bundle. Image reproduced with permission from Kumar et al.

ICN entrapment presents clinically with neuropathic pain in the medial plantar foot. This is frequently misdiagnosed as plantar fasciitis. Approximately 50% of cases are precipitated by sports and 25% of patients have severe pain in the morning, thought to be secondary to venous engorgement. In the largest case series of ICN entrapment, the average age was 38% and 88% of patients were men. On examination, the point of maximal tenderness is over the medial heel, superior to the plantar fascia origin. Plantar fascia origin tenderness is common, but less severe. In severe cases, lateral foot atrophy and fifth‐digit abduction weakness can be seen.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of pediatric foot and ankle pain [^05cb6dec]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Apophysitis

Apophysitis refers to inflammation at the tendon attachment. It is common during rapid growth due to physeal stress and may also be present with JIA. Sever's disease (calcaneal apophysitis) is a traction apophysitis of the os calcis at the insertion of the Achilles tendon. It usually affects children aged 7 to 14. Children usually present with pain that increases with running and jumping activities. On examination, there may be swelling and tenderness over the posterior heel at the insertion of the Achilles tendon, pain with medial and lateral squeeze test of the calcaneal apophysis, weakness of dorsiflexion and contracture of the Achilles tendon. Radiographs appear normal with normally irregular apophysis. Management includes RICE, NSAIDS, activity modification, Achilles stretching, strengthening of the ankle dorsiflexors, physiotherapy and insertion of heel lift or heel cup in footwear.

Iselin's disease refers to traction apophysitis of the tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal. The apophysis is within the peroneus brevis tendon insertion site. The secondary centre of ossification usually fuses by age 11 years in girls and 14 in boys. Pain with activity, tenderness over the base of the fifth metatarsal, and pain with resisted eversion are common. Radiographs differentiate Iselin's disease from avulsion fracture as the apophysis is parallel to the long axis of the fifth metatarsal and fractures are usually transverse. Fractures at the metaphyseal-diaphyseal junction (Jones fracture) are significant injuries which require non-weight bearing immobilization and orthopedic referral. Technetium bone scan may help confirm apophysitis. Management includes RICE, modified activity, immobilization and physiotherapy.

### Musculoskeletal examination in young athletes and non-athletes: the Finnish health promoting sports club (FHPSC) study [^316d0183]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of adolescent back pain increases with age, and low back and pelvic pain have been found to be a common type of overuse injury in young athletes. Patients with reduced control of active movements may form an important subgroup in patients with non-specific low back painand maintaining good lumbar spine position can also help reduce and prevent low back pain. We found that < 40% of adolescents were able to perform the deep squat while maintaining good lumbar spine control and heels on the floor, and there was no difference between athletes and non-athletes. In a previous study comparing college-aged athletes and non-athletes, the female athletes scored higher in the deep squat test compared with non-athletes, whereas no difference was observed in men.

From the one-leg stance position, the lateral shift of the pelvis relative to the trunk can be measured with moderate reliability in adults. In our study, we found that non-athlete girls more frequently had poor lateral control of the pelvis than athletes, and that there was no difference between athletes and non-athletes in asymmetric lateral control of the pelvis. Furthermore, nearly one-fifth of the adolescents in both groups had a side difference on ≥ 2 cm or lateral shift ≥ 13 cm on both sides indicating asymmetric or poor lateral control of the pelvis.

Although a number of markers in musculoskeletal screening tests are associated with an increased risk of sports injury, there is yet no final evidence to support screening of athletes' injury risk. In sports injury prevention studies, one challenge is to find the cut point at which athletes are determined to be at a higher risk. An important goal of the PHE is to evaluate risk factors for developing acute and overuse injuries and musculoskeletal pain and to address those before the onset of problems. Importantly, risk factors also include later maturity, higher BMI and previous injury.

### Common painful foot and ankle conditions: a review [^e5b209cc]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Morton neuroma, plantar fasciitis, and Achilles tendinopathy are foot and ankle conditions that are associated with pain and disability, but they can respond to nonoperative treatment.

Observations

Morton neuroma, consisting of interdigital neuronal thickening and fibrosis, is characterized by burning pain in the ball of the foot and numbness or burning pain that may radiate to the affected toes (commonly the third and fourth toes). First-line nonoperative therapy consists of reducing activities that cause pain, orthotics, and interdigital corticosteroid injection; however, approximately 30% of patients may not respond to conservative treatment. Plantar fasciitis accounts for more than 1 million patient visits per year in the US and typically presents with plantar heel pain. Fifteen years after diagnosis, approximately 44% of patients continue to have pain. First-line nonoperative therapy includes stretching of the plantar fascia and foot orthotics, followed by extracorporeal shockwave therapy, corticosteroid injection, or platelet-rich plasma injection. Midportion Achilles tendinopathy presents with pain approximately 2 to 6 cm proximal to the Achilles insertion on the heel. The primary nonoperative treatment involves eccentric strengthening exercises, but extracorporeal shockwave therapy may be used.

Conclusions and Relevance

Morton neuroma, plantar fasciitis, and Achilles tendinopathy are painful foot and ankle conditions. First-line therapies are activity restriction, orthotics, and corticosteroid injection for Morton neuroma; stretching and foot orthotics for plantar fasciitis; and eccentric strengthening exercises for Achilles tendinopathy.
