## Question

How long does ablative surgery for premature ventricular contractions usually take?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long ablative surgery for premature ventricular contractions usually takes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the question refers to catheter ablation versus open surgical ablation. Then, I should verify typical procedure times for catheter ablation using contemporary data. Next, I will consider how technique and patient factors modify duration. After that, I should review outliers like needle ablation or repeat procedures. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful answer with ranges and caveats anchored to the best available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I need to ensure we are not mixing catheter ablation with open surgical ablation. Most modern "ablation" for PVCs is catheter-based radiofrequency ablation performed in the electrophysiology lab, whereas surgical ablation is reserved for refractory cases or when combined with other cardiac surgery, so the user's question almost certainly targets catheter ablation rather than open-heart surgery [^9cefed71] [^0d7b9d11].

> Now, I should verify typical procedure times from high-quality comparative studies. Multiple contemporary series report median total procedure times around 60 minutes with a single-catheter approach, versus about 90 minutes with conventional multi-catheter setups, with interquartile ranges commonly spanning roughly 50–90 minutes for single-catheter and 60–120 minutes for conventional approaches, and these differences are statistically significant in propensity-matched analyses [^7d6370c3] [^a0bfa87b] [^901d90e0].

> Wait, let me verify whether advanced mapping or lesion strategies change duration. Using a PentaRay mapping catheter shortened procedure time to a mean of about 110 minutes compared with 134 minutes with a standard ablation catheter, suggesting that high-density mapping can reduce time in some settings, though this remains longer than the single-catheter approach reported above, so technique selection meaningfully shifts duration [^c7a37805]. I should also note that very high-power short-duration ablation can reduce RF delivery time, but total procedure time still includes mapping and validation, so the net effect on total time varies by workflow and operator experience [^29e7ae5e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about outliers. Intramyocardial needle ablation for refractory PVCs is a specialized, longer procedure; one series reported a mean procedure time of about 294 minutes, which is far outside routine endocardial ablation timelines, and this should be framed as an exception rather than the usual case [^c7a37805]. Similarly, repeat ablation after prior failure tends to take longer and has lower success, reflecting more complex substrate and the need for advanced techniques, so I should flag that repeat cases can extend well beyond first-procedure norms [^ab530e63].

> I need to check patient-specific modifiers. Older age has been associated with shorter median procedure times in some cohorts, possibly reflecting operator efficiency or case selection, but this signal is inconsistent across studies and should be interpreted cautiously; likewise, left-sided versus right-sided origins and epicardial or intramural targets can add time due to access complexity and mapping challenges, so I should emphasize that origin and substrate matter for duration [^75689ca3] [^9cefed71].

> Let me synthesize a clinically useful answer now. For a straightforward, idiopathic PVC ablation using a standard endocardial approach, the usual total procedure time is about 60–90 minutes, with many centers achieving medians near 60 minutes when using a single-catheter strategy and 90–120 minutes with conventional multi-catheter setups. Outliers include very high-power workflows that may shorten RF time but not necessarily total time, and advanced techniques like needle ablation that can extend to several hours, while repeat ablations are generally longer and less predictable [^7d6370c3] [^a0bfa87b] [^c7a37805] [^29e7ae5e] [^ab530e63].

> But wait, what if the user truly meant surgical ablation rather than catheter ablation. I should double-check that nuance. Surgical ablation for ventricular arrhythmias is rarely performed as a standalone procedure today and is typically reserved for refractory VT or when combined with other cardiac surgery; historical surgical series describe lengthy operative times and meaningful mortality, so if the intent was surgical ablation, the answer would be on the order of several hours in the operating room with substantial recovery, which is not comparable to catheter ablation timelines [^0d7b9d11] [^3b958076].

> Final answer, keeping the most likely interpretation: catheter ablation for PVCs usually takes about 60–90 minutes, with many centers reporting medians around 60 minutes using a single-catheter approach and 90–120 minutes with conventional setups. Complex substrates, advanced techniques, or repeat procedures can extend well beyond this range, and patients should be counseled accordingly [^7d6370c3] [^a0bfa87b] [^c7a37805] [^ab530e63].

Ablative surgery for premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) typically takes **60–120 minutes** [^7d6370c3], with most procedures completed within 90 minutes. The duration varies with PVC origin, mapping complexity, and ablation strategy; simple right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) PVCs are faster, whereas left ventricular or epicardial sources take longer [^notfound]. Single-catheter approaches and advanced mapping can shorten procedure time [^7d6370c3] [^341aab5e], while repeat ablations or complex substrates may extend it [^ab530e63]. Overall, modern catheter ablation is efficient and safe, with low complication rates and high success [^973bf0e6].

## Typical duration of ablative surgery for PVCs

- **Standard duration**: Most catheter ablation procedures for PVCs are completed within 60–120 minutes [^7d6370c3], with a median of approximately 90 minutes.

- **Single-catheter approach**: Recent studies show that using a single-catheter technique reduces median procedure time to about 60 minutes (IQR 50–87.5 minutes) compared with 90 minutes (IQR 60–120 minutes) for conventional multi-catheter setups [^7d6370c3] [^a0bfa87b].

- **Advanced mapping**: Automated mapping and pattern-matching tools can further reduce procedure time by streamlining activation mapping and ablation planning [^341aab5e] [^cb1ece41].

## Factors influencing procedure duration

Several factors influence **how long ablation takes**:

| **Factor** | **Impact on duration** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|-|
| PVC origin | Shorter for RVOT; longer for LV, epicardial, or papillary muscle | RVOT is easier to access and map; LV and epicardial sites require more complex navigation [^notfound] |
| Mapping complexity | Simple activation mapping is faster than detailed substrate mapping | Complex substrates or multiple foci require more time for accurate localization [^9cefed71] |
| Ablation strategy | Single-point ablation is faster than additional lesion sets | Additional lesions to reduce recurrence add time but improve outcomes [^75aef953] |
| Patient factors | Obesity, anatomy, and PVC burden can prolong procedures | Technical challenges and infrequent PVCs during mapping increase time [^9cefed71] |
| Operator experience | Experienced operators are faster and more efficient | Skill and familiarity with anatomy and equipment reduce time [^notfound] |

---

## Comparison with other cardiac ablation procedures

PVC ablation is generally **shorter than AF ablation** (often 2–4 hours) because PVCs are focal and require fewer lesions, whereas AF ablation involves extensive pulmonary vein isolation and linear lesions [^notfound]. PVC ablation is comparable in duration to SVT ablation (60–120 minutes), reflecting similar focal targets and strategies [^notfound].

---

## Procedural efficiency and patient outcomes

Efficiency gains from single-catheter and advanced mapping have not compromised safety or success; acute success rates remain **84–91%** with low complication rates (~2–5%) [^22da4c9f]. Shorter procedures also reduce radiation exposure and patient discomfort, supporting same-day discharge in many centers [^7d6370c3] [^88f02783].

---

## Recovery and post-procedure considerations

Recovery is typically rapid, with most patients discharged the same day or after overnight observation. Patients are advised to avoid strenuous activity for 1–2 weeks and to monitor for symptoms. Follow-up includes ECG or Holter monitoring to confirm PVC suppression and assess symptom relief [^83fb70d8].

---

Ablative surgery for PVCs typically takes **60–120 minutes**, with most completed within 90 minutes. Duration varies with PVC origin, mapping complexity, and ablation strategy, but modern techniques have improved efficiency without sacrificing safety or success [^7d6370c3].

3 RESULTS

3.1 Baseline characteristics

From February 2016 to February 2021 a total of 309 patients were treated with catheter ablation for PVCs. Sixty‐nine of these were treated with a single catheter approach (22%), only using one ablation catheter for the whole procedure. After propensity score matching a total of 128 patients were included in the final analysis; 64 patients in each treatment arms (Figure 1). All baseline characteristics were balanced after propensity score matching (Table 1). The median age of the patients was 60.5 years (IQR 48–70), 41 patients (32%) were female. The most frequent origin of PVC included the left (51.5%) and right (23.4%) ventricular outflow tract. Most PVC were considered to be idiopathic (60.1%).

BMI, body mass Index; CRT‐D, cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator; GFR, glomerular filtration rate; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction; PVC, premature ventricular contraction.

3.2 Procedural outcomes

Patients treated with a single catheter approach had significant shorter total procedure times compared with a conventional approach (median 60 minutes, IQR 50–87.5 minutes, vs. 90 minutes in the conventional arm, IQR 60–120 minutes; p value = 0.001), as well as shorter fluoroscopy times (median 218 seconds, IQR 110.5–446 seconds, vs. 310 seconds in the conventional arm, IQR 190.5–640 seconds; p value 0.012), correlating with a reduction of the applied dose area product (median 368.4 cGycm², IQR 126–905.4 cGycm², vs. 155 cGycm² in the conventional arm, IQR 74.4–334.5 cGycm²; p value 0.009).

No significant differences were observed among acute success rates after catheter ablation. Complete elimination of PVC was achieved in 58 patients (90.6%) in the conventional arm and in 54 patients (84.3%) in the single catheter approach arm (p value 0.287; Table 2).

Premature ventricular contractions are of common occurrence in routine clinical practice. Though generally perceived as of benign consequence in healthy people in the absence of heart disease, their presence can be a harbinger of fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmia in individuals with structural heart disease. With some of the latest insights into the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmia, especially with the advent of catheter ablation, there has been renewed interest in premature ventricular contractions, not only as a predictor of arrhythmia, but also for their potential etiological association with cardiomyopathy.

### Additional lesion sets in ablation of outflow tract premature ventricular contractions: a randomized clinical trial [^4aa2cd27]. JAMA Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

The study OT-PVCs was published by Kexin Wang and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Cardiol. This study is related to the following diseases: Premature ventricular contractions and Ventricular arrhythmias. In the OT-PVCs study, the trial question was: what is the role of additional ablation in patients with outflow tract premature ventricular contractions? In the OT-PVCs study, the study design was: multi-center, single blinded, RCT. In the OT-PVCs study, the population was: 281 patients (169 female, 112 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with outflow tract premature ventricular contractions. The key exclusion criteria were structural heart disease; history of cardiac surgery; severe hepatic and renal insufficiency; expectancy lifespan < 1 year; pregnancy or lactation. In the OT-PVCs study, the interventions were: n = 142 additional ablation (single-point ablation plus ablation of additional lesions using the same setting and time as for the index lesion) n = 139 single-point ablation (identification of a target point and premature ventricular contractions elimination by single-point ablation). In the OT-PVCs study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in freedom from premature ventricular contractions at 3 months after the procedure (97.9% vs. 82.7%; AD 15.2%, 95% CI 6.18 to 24.22). In the OT-PVCs study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in mean postprocedural premature ventricular contractions burden (0.4% vs. 3.5%; ARD -3.1, 95% CI -4.94 to -1.26) Significant increase in reduction in mean postprocedural premature ventricular contractions burden (23% vs. 19%; AD 4%, 95% CI 1.47 to 6.53) Significant increase in reduction in mean premature ventricular contractions burden at RV outflow tract (22.8% vs. 19.6%; AD 3.2%, 95% CI 1.18 to 5.22). In the OT-PVCs study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with outflow tract premature ventricular contractions, additional ablation was superior to single-point ablation with respect to freedom from premature ventricular contractions at 3 months after the procedure.

4 DISCUSSION

This study was designed to determine whether the use of a single catheter approach would have an effect on procedural outcomes, success rates, and complications rates in the treatment of PVCs. According to our study, in patients with symptomatic PVC, limiting the number of diagnostic catheters to only one ablation catheter resulted in significant reductions in the total procedure time, fluoroscopy time, and dose area product as well, while maintaining comparable success rates and complications when compared with conventional catheter setups for electrophysiological studies. Differences in "partial success" rates between single catheter and conventional methods may stem from procedural nuances, not method superiority. The subjectivity of "partial success" criteria, considering PVC characteristics, requires cautious interpretation. Both methods, however, showed comparable success rates in eliminating all PVCs, highlighting the need for careful consideration of procedural complexities and patient‐specific factors.

No differences were observed regarding procedure‐associated complications in both groups. Efforts to minimize vascular complications in both groups included strict adherence to established protocols, meticulous catheter placement, and routine ultrasound‐guided vascular access. Pericardial effusion instances were primarily associated with ablation procedures or complex septal punctures rather than the presence of additional catheters. Notably, there was no observed damage to the cardiac conduction system in either group.

Palpitations, or worsening left ventricular function in patients with heart failure symptoms, may not necessarily require additional electrophysiological testing, when the symptoms are attributed to a substantial burden of PVCs on continuous rhythm monitoring. To localize these PVCs, a variety of algorithms are available, including the identification of potential epicardial exit points and catheter ablation sites. The ideal ablation site for PVCs is characterized by a similar 12‐lead‐ECG morphology when applying pace mapping, as well as a sufficient duration of local activation on the ablation catheter before the onset of surface QRS of at least 25 milliseconds in conjunction with a QS configuration on a unipolar recording of the distal ablation catheter electrode. Using only one catheter, the latter can be used to perform both mapping and ablation without the need for additional diagnostic catheters.

### Radiofrequency ablation of premature ventricular contractions guided by robotic magnetic navigation combined with pattern matching filter [^cb1ece41]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

According to the principle of activation mapping, higher density of effective points obtained on the unit area of model is conducive to ablation treatment. When the PMF function is applied, the number of points obtained on the unit area of model increased significantly, which leads to an increase in the accuracy of identification of the earliest activation point (Supporting Information: Figure S1). Then, the accuracy of radiofrequency ablation energy delivery was also increased. Therefore, the duration of ablation energy delivery in PMF using group reduced.

In terms of outcomes, no statistically significant results were found. Compared with the success rate of manual ablation reported in previous studies (ranging from 50% to > 90%), there is no significant difference in the success rate of PVCs ablation using RMN in our center, which is consistent with our expectations. However, our study shows that the application of PMF function failed to improve the acute success rate and failed to reduce the recurrence, which is inconsistent with our expectations. After analyzing the data, we found that we conducted detailed mapping for all patients as much as possible without PMF. Although the mapping was time‐consuming and slightly less accurate than that in the PMF group, the increased energy delivery time made up for the lack of accuracy of mapping. According to previous studies, success rates with PVCs ablation can vary according to PVCs sites of origin, electrophysiological characteristics, ablation techniques, radiofrequency energy delivery and experience of operator. So we suggest that PMF can only help us obtain mapping points quickly, shorten the procedure time.

Other 3D mapping systems also have similar functions, such as the automark function of EnSite system. However, there is no relevant research on the clinical application of automark function. So, it is difficult to make comparation. The report of animal experiment indicates that the automatic mapping function is significantly faster than manual point‐by‐point 3D mapping and results in shorter mapping time and higher point density. Although the automatic mapping function cannot increase the success rate of surgery, the reduction of operation time can also bring benefits to patients, such as reducing the pain and psychological burden, and potentially reducing the possibility of complications. For the operator, reducing the operation time means that more patients can be treated in unit time.

In terms of X‐ray application, the results of our center showed that the X‐ray exposure of RMN ablation was limited. There was no significant difference in X‐ray exposure between the two groups because the application of X‐ray was not involved in the mapping stage.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation — ECG monitoring before and after ablation: Arrhythmia monitoring is an important component of the initial evaluation of patients who are to undergo catheter ablation procedures for AF, including confirming that symptoms result from AF and determining whether AF is paroxysmal or persistent. Early recurrences of AF are common during the first 3 months following a catheter ablation procedure; therefore, arrhythmia monitoring to assess efficacy is typically delayed for at least 3 months unless needed for early postablation symptoms, and recurrences particularly after the first month are predictive of later AF and may identify patients at higher risk of needing a second ablation procedure or ongoing AAD therapy. Complaints of palpitations often result from atrial or ventricular premature beats and are not an accurate predictor of recurrent AF, and arrhythmia monitoring can also be of value in asymptomatic patients and can influence decision making regarding anticoagulant therapy after ablation.

### Additional lesion sets in ablation of outflow tract premature ventricular contractions: a randomized clinical trial [^75aef953]. JAMA Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Recurrence remains a challenge after ablation of outflow tract premature ventricular contractions (OT-PVCs). Although adding additional lesions next to the index effective ablation site is sometimes performed to reinforce the ablation, it remains uncertain whether this approach is effective.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that additional ablation lesions would reduce the recurrence rate compared with single-point ablation at the index effective site for the ablation of OT-PVCs.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study was a multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical trial. Patients receiving their first catheter ablation for OT-PVCs were enrolled from 18 hospitals in China between October 2021 and February 2023. Scheduled follow-up duration was 3 months after the procedure.

Intervention

After identifying the target point and eliminating the PVC by a single-point ablation, patients were randomized 1:1 into an additional ablation group or a control group.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point of the study was freedom from PVC recurrence (≥ 80% reduction of PVC burden, which is the number of PVCs in 24 hours/total heartbeats in 24 hours × 100%) from baseline to 3 months postprocedure.

Results

Of 308 patients enrolled in the study, 286 (mean [SD] age, 49.2 [14.6] years; 173 female [60.5%]) were randomized to the additional ablation or the control group. The additional ablation group had a mean (SD) of 6.3(1.1) radiofrequency applications, whereas the control group (single-point ablation group) had a mean (SD) of 1 (0) radiofrequency application. After a median (IQR) follow-up of 3.2(0) months, the rate of freedom from PVCs was significantly higher in the additional ablation group (139 of 142 [97.9%]) compared with the control group (115 of 139 [82.7%]; P < .001). Patients in the additional ablation group also had a more substantial reduction in PVC burden than the control group (mean [SD] reduction, 23.0% [10.5%] vs 19.0% [10.4%]; P = 0.002). There were no severe periprocedural complications in either group.

Conclusions and Relevance

This randomized clinical trial showed a benefit of additional ablation in reducing the recurrence of OT-PVCs compared with the single-point ablation strategy, without increased complication risk. Additional ablations surrounding the index effective ablation point should be considered in OT-PVC ablation.

Abstract

Background

Catheter ablation has become one of the main treatment strategies in patients with premature ventricular complexes (PVC). The successful mapping and ablation can be performed with an ablation catheter without additional diagnostic catheters.

Hypothesis

We hypothesize that using a single catheter for PVC ablation may decrease complications, procedure time, and fluoroscopy exposure while maintaining comparable success rates.

Methods

Sixty‐nine consecutive patients with PVC were treated with a single catheter approach compared to a historical cohort, in which a conventional setup was used. Propensity score matching was conducted with a 1:1 ratio. Outcome parameters included acute procedural success with elimination of all premature ventricular contractions after catheter ablation, procedural data as well as complication rates.

Results

Patients treated with a single catheter approach had shorter total procedure (60 minutes [IQR: 47,5–69,0 minutes] vs. 90 minutes [IQR 60–120 minutes]; p = 0.001) and fluoroscopy times (218 seconds [IQR: 110,5–446 seconds] vs. 310 seconds [IQR 190–640 seconds]; p = 0.012), which consecutively leads to a reduction of radiation exposure signified by a lower dose area product (155 cGycm² [IQR 74.4–334.5 cGycm²] vs. 368.4 cGycm² [IQR: 126–905.4 cGycm²]; p value 0.009). Acute procedural success rates were comparable in both groups (54 [84.3%] in the single catheter approach group and 58 [90.6%] in the conventional group; p: 0.287).

Conclusion

A single catheter approach for the treatment of PVC is associated with a reduction of procedure‐ and fluoroscopy time, as well as a lesser radiation exposure, while maintaining equivalent acute success and complication rates compared with a conventionally used catheter setup.

### Single catheter approach for treatment of premature ventricular contractions [^426cd8e6]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

This investigation had several limitations: (1) this was a retrospective, monocentric analysis and not prospectively randomized or multicentric. (2) The propensity matched analysis was performed with a 1:1 ratio — a higher ratio, for example, 1:2 would be more appropriate for this kind of analysis, but was limited by the number of matched baseline characteristics, mainly PVC origin. (3) Despite recognizing the correlation between acute and long‐term success, the absence of data on recurrence rates, PVC burden postablation, symptom alleviation, and medication needs was notable due to follow‐ups conducted in an ambulatory, out‐of‐hospital setting. We acknowledge these limitations and suggests a need for enhanced follow‐up measures, proposing a direct, truly randomized trial with continuous rhythm for more conclusive insights into the single catheter approach's efficacy and sustainability.

In conclusion, in a comparison of a conventional catheter setup, compared with a limitation to solely an ablation catheter, which is used for diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers, for the interventional treatment of PVC, we found that a single catheter approach is associated with a reduction of procedure‐ and fluoroscopy time, as well as a lesser radiation exposure surrogated by dose area product, while maintaining equivalent acute success and complication rates.

### Distal-to-proximal delay for ablation of premature ventricular contractions [^ff3e4deb]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ablation of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) has emerged as a safe and effective treatment in patients experiencing a high PVCs burden. Mapping of PVCs origin may sometimes be challenging. We sought to evaluate the accuracy of a new electrophysiological criterion, the distal-to-proximal (DP) delay, at localizing the optimal site for ablation of ventricular ectopic foci.

Methods and Results

Consecutive patients with ablation attempts of symptomatic PVCs were included. Prematurity and DP delay-that is, the time duration between the onset of ablation catheter distal bipolar electrogram and the onset of proximal bipolar electrogram-were measured at successful and unsuccessful ablation sites by three blinded experienced electrophysiologists. Mean DP delay at effective ablation sites (N = 30) was significantly higher than at ineffective sites (N = 55) (23 ± 9 vs 11 ± 8milliseconds; P < 0.0001). DP delay had good-to-excellent interrater reliability. A DP delay greater than or equal to 15milliseconds had the highest accuracy at predicting a successful ablation site (sensitivity 0.97, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.87; P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

DP delay is an additional, simple, and effective electrophysiological parameter to accurately localize PVCs foci.

### Idiopathic malignant premature ventricular contractions [^f79b18a1]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The presence of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) in patients with structurally normal hearts was once considered a benign phenomenon. However, in susceptible patients, these "benign" or idiopathic PVCs may develop malignant potential and trigger ventricular fibrillation and result in sudden cardiac death. Alternatively, idiopathic PVCs can also induce cardiomyopathy. Clinical recognition of these entities can lead to effective targeted therapy. In the first instance, treatment consists of ablating the PVC source and implanting a defibrillator, whereas in the second scenario, ablating the PVC origin can normalize left ventricular function.

### Single catheter approach for treatment of premature ventricular contractions [^c7a37805]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Sousa et al. conducted a study to determine whether using the PentaRay catheter for activation mapping in PVC ablation procedures could lead to shorter procedure times. They divided 136 consecutive patients into two groups: the Study group, where the PentaRay catheter was used, and the Control group, where the ablation catheter was used. The Study Group had significantly shorter procedure times (110 ± 33 minutes) compared with the Control Group (134 ± 50 minutes, p < 0.01). Although there were no significant differences in acute success rates (95.6% in the Study Group vs. 90.1% in the Control Group, p = 0.49), the use of the PentaRay catheter resulted in notable time savings during the PVC ablation procedures. However, it is important to note that the procedure times observed in this study were longer than the procedure times achieved with our investigation utilizing a single catheter approach.

The study of Dukkipati et al. evaluated the efficacy and safety of infusion needle ablation (INA) for treating refractory PVC. INA involved using a catheter with an extendable/retractable needle to perform targeted ablation. Among 35 patients who underwent INA, acute PVC elimination was achieved in 71.4% of cases. The procedure had a reasonable safety profile, with adverse events including heart block, femoral artery dissection, and pericardial effusions occurring in 14.3% of patients, all of which were successfully managed percutaneously. In terms of procedural parameters, the study reported a mean fluoroscopy time of 27.9 minutes and a mean procedure time of 293.7 minutes, indicating the overall duration of the INA procedure. As mentioned above, this trial had also higher Procedure and fluoroscopy times than the single catheter approach we investigated.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF) triggered by premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) — mechanisms, ablation approach, and cautions. Idiopathic VF may be initiated by PVCs that arise from the outflow tracts or the His-Purkinje system within either the right ventricle or left ventricle, and the PVCs usually have a consistent QRS morphology and a short coupling interval and can be targeted for ablation to control the arrhythmia. To maximize the probability of successful ablation, the procedure is best performed during periods of frequent PVCs, and when the PVCs can be identified, ablation is highly successful, but late recurrences are observed in approximately 10% of patients such that implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is prudent even if ablation is acutely successful. The risks of catheter ablation include bleeding at the site of arterial or venous access and a small risk of pericardial tamponade, and therapy with quinidine acutely and chronically can suppress recurrent VF episodes in some patients.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2019). High credibility.

Appropriate use criteria for multimodality imaging in nonvalvular heart disease — definitions of key clinical terms include pretest probability thresholds and arrhythmia criteria. Low pretest probability indicates < 10% probability of disease, moderate is 10% to 90%, and high is > 90% likelihood prior to testing. Ventricular premature contractions are occurring more frequently than 30 times per hour or occurring in a pattern of bigeminy, trigeminy, or runs of ventricular tachycardia, while atrial premature complexes are less than 30 times per hour or less than one per minute. Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia is a ventricular arrhythmia of 3 or more consecutive complexes but lasting < 30 seconds in duration at a rate > 100 bpm, and sustained ventricular tachycardia is lasting more than 30 seconds or requiring therapy because of hemodynamic compromise in < 30 seconds. Syncope is transient loss of consciousness with rapid onset, short duration, and spontaneous complete recovery (not lightheadedness or dizziness alone), presyncope is near loss of consciousness, and a patient is asymptomatic when he/she exhibits none of the typical symptoms. Heart failure is signs and symptoms explainable on the basis of systolic or diastolic dysfunction, and the term clinical indication does not necessarily imply that testing is warranted; for some clinical indications, all modalities may be rated as Rarely Appropriate.

### Premature ventricular contractions and atrial fibrillation: the Reunion of distant relatives? [^a83249a2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Perhaps more technical and hypothetical follow‐up questions to the study by Lee et al are regarding specific PVC characteristics. Previous research has focused on PVC characteristics to help us differentiate high‐risk features that pose a more malignant risk for cardiomyopathy including origin (epicardial), QRS width, and coupling interval. Is there an association between a PVC anatomical location and new‐onset AF? Did participants with new AF and moderate to high burden of PVCs have monomorphic, or polymorphic PVCs? May there be a similar relationship with AF incidence? Although PVC anatomical location can be a point of debate among electrophysiologists, establishing a relationship between the risk of AF and PVC anatomical location would further risk stratify patients and may support screening decisions.

The authors looked at a cohort in the highest PVC burden group (defined as > 10 000 a day) that received successful catheter ablation, compared them with the index study cohort with the highest PVC burden, and found a trend in lower development of AF (not statistically significant). This raises the following important key question: Could PVCs be a modifiable risk factor for AF? The authors speculate that PVC ablation may be a possible adjuvant strategy for AF ablation, which could eliminate all potential AF triggers. Without a doubt, this statement begs further data and analysis. Yet, it may influence our use of continuous monitoring post AF ablation to screen for PVCs and may represent one missing piece of the AF ablation recurrence puzzle.

### Treatment of ventricular arrhythmias: what's new? [^ba188274]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmias can present as asymptomatic premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), symptomatic presentation of the former arrhythmias, or sustained VT with minimal symptoms to full hemodynamic collapse. The most important and feared consequence of VT is sudden cardiac death (SCD). Independent of SCD risk, frequent ventricular arrhythmias can cause substantial symptoms. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are the foundation of managing patients at high risk for SCD due to their ability to automatically identify and defibrillate malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Unfortunately, defibrillation is associated with significant physical and emotional adverse effects. Other treatment options include antiarrhythmic drugs, which have substantial toxicities and limited efficacy, and catheter ablation. The techniques and strategies for VT ablation have advanced considerably in recent years leading to a rapid expansion of indications and use. In this review, we discuss current state of the art therapies for ventricular arrhythmias and highlight some of the most promising areas of ongoing development.

### Impact of age on catheter ablation of premature ventricular contractions [^75689ca3]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Catheter ablation (CA) of frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVC) is increasingly performed in older patients as the population ages. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of age on procedural characteristics, safety and efficacy on PVC ablations.

Methods

Consecutive patients with symptomatic PVCs undergoing CA between 2015 and 2020 were evaluated. Acute ablation success was defined as the elimination of PVCs at the end of the procedure. Sustained success was defined as an elimination of symptoms, and ≥ 80% reduction of PVC burden determined by Holter-electrocardiogram during long-term follow. Patients were sub-grouped based on age (< 65 vs. ≥ 65 years).

Results

A total of 114 patients were enrolled (median age 64 years, 71% males) and followed up for a median duration of 228 days. Baseline and procedural data were similar in both age groups. A left-sided origin of PVCs was more frequently observed in the elderly patient group compared to younger patients (83% vs. 67%; p = .04). The median procedure time was significantly shorter in elderly patients (160 vs. 193min; p = .02). The rates of both acute (86% vs. 92%; p = .32) and sustained success (70% vs. 71%; p = .90) were similar between groups. Complications rates (3.7%) did not differ between the two groups.

Conclusion

In a large series of patients with a variety of underlying arrhythmia substrates, similar rates of acute procedural success, complications, and ventricular arrhythmia-free-survival were observed after CA of PVCs. Older age alone should not be a reason to withhold CA of PVCs.

1 INTRODUCTION

Catheter ablation has become one of the main treatment strategies in patients with symptomatic palpitations caused by premature ventricular contractions (PVC), when pharmacological treatment is insufficient in suppression of PVC burden or not desired. Furthermore, it has been shown to restore left ventricular function in patients with PVC induced cardiomyopathy, as well as decrease the burden of PVC induced episodes of ventricular fibrillation (VF). This has led to a class I recommendation in recent guidelines, when PVCs are considered to be idiopathic or LV dysfunction is present and class IIa in nonidiopathic PVCs.

The success rate of ablation of PVC is considered to range from 84% to 92%, while maintain a low intraprocedural complication rate ranging from 2.5% to 5%. However, acute success rates differ dependent on the localization of the PVC ranging from approximately 90% in patients with outflow tract PVCs to 70% in patients with an epicardial exit. But despite these promising acute procedural outcomes, long‐term reduction of PVC burden after catheter ablation can be improved in conjunction with additional antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Nonetheless, acute procedural success remains the most valuable predictor for long‐term success.

Usually, the setup for ablation of PVC includes an atrial catheter which is placed in the coronary sinus (CS), a right ventricular catheter (RVA), a catheter which is placed alongside the bundle of His and a separate ablation catheter. However, successful ablation side of PVC mainly depends on prematurity of the PVC on the uni‐ and bipolar recording of the ablation catheter, as well as morphological aspects based on pace mapping.

It seems reasonable to reduce the amount of diagnostical catheters to only an ablation catheter, when the symptoms of a patient can be clearly related to PVC. We therefore hypothesize, that the utilization of a single catheter approach for ablation of PVC may reduce vascular complications, procedure, and fluoroscopy times, while maintaining the same acute success rate.

Post-general (non-cardiac) surgery — arrhythmia incidence and management: Following major non-cardiac surgery, the reported incidence of arrhythmias ranges from 4% to 26%, and the incidence of post-operative atrial fibrillation (AF) ranges from 0.3% to 26%. Atrial arrhythmias occur most frequently 2–3 days post-surgery. Asymptomatic premature ventricular contractions generally do not require postoperative therapy or further evaluation, whereas very frequent ventricular ectopy or runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) may require antiarrhythmic therapy if they are symptomatic or result in haemodynamic compromise. Patients with new post-operative complex ventricular arrhythmias, particularly polymorphic VT, should be evaluated for myocardial ischaemia, electrolyte alterations, or drug effects.

PVC-induced cardiomyopathy — patients with symptomatic or ventricular function decline suspected from frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and for whom antiarrhythmic drugs are not effective, not tolerated, or not preferred may undergo catheter ablation, and in PVC-induced cardiomyopathy pharmacologic therapy is reasonable. For patients who require arrhythmia suppression for symptoms or declining ventricular function suspected to be due to frequent PVCs (generally > 15% of beats and predominately of 1 morphology) and for whom antiarrhythmic medications are ineffective, not tolerated, or not the patient's preference, catheter ablation is useful. In patients with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, pharmacologic treatment (eg, beta blocker, amiodarone) is reasonable to reduce recurrent arrhythmias, and improve symptoms and left ventricular (LV) function.

### Catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia in structurally normal hearts: indications, strategies, and outcomes-part I [^7837e110]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) is being increasingly performed; yet, there is often confusion regarding indications, outcomes, and how to identify those patient populations most likely to benefit. The management strategy differs between those with structural heart disease and those without. For the former, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is typically required due to an elevated risk for sudden cardiac death, and catheter ablation can be used as adjunctive therapy to treat or prevent repetitive ICD therapies. In contrast, VT or premature ventricular contractions in the setting of a structurally normal heart carries a low risk for sudden cardiac death; accordingly, there is typically no indication for an ICD. In these patients, catheter ablation is considered for symptom management or to treat tachycardiomyopathy and is potentially curative. Here, the authors discuss the pathophysiology, mechanism, and management of VT that occurs in the setting of a structurally normal heart and the role of catheter ablation.

Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF) triggered by premature ventricular contractions — ablation outcomes and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) considerations: During a median postprocedural follow-up of 63 months, 7 (18%) of 38 patients undergoing catheter ablation of idiopathic VF induced by short coupled PVCs experienced VF recurrence at a median follow-up of 4 months, and five of these 7 patients underwent repeat ablation without VF recurrence. Although catheter ablation is very effective in idiopathic VF, the recurrence risk remains substantial after an apparently successful procedure and the patient should be protected with an ICD; when PVCs can be identified, ablation is highly successful, but late recurrences are observed in approximately 10% of patients such that implantation of an ICD is prudent even if ablation is acutely successful. The subcutaneous ICD may not be a good therapy for these patients due to the higher risk of T-wave oversensing seen in this population; therapy with quinidine acutely and chronically can suppress recurrent VF episodes in some patients.

### Relative efficacy of catheter ablation vs antiarrhythmic drugs in treating premature ventricular contractions: a single-center retrospective study [^ab472870]. Heart Rhythm (2014). Low credibility.

Background

It is unknown whether radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or antiarrhythmic therapy is superior when treating patients with symptomatic premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).

Objective

To determine the relative efficacy of RFA and antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) on PVC burden reduction and increasing left ventricular systolic function.

Methods

Patients with frequent PVCs (> 1000/24 h) were treated either by RFA or with AADs from January 2005 through December 2010. Data from 24-hour Holter monitoring and echocardiography before and 6–12 months after treatment were compared between the 2 groups.

Results

Of 510 patients identified, 215 (40%) underwent RFA and 295 (60%) received AADs. The reduction in PVC frequency was greater by RFA than with AADs (-21,799/24 h vs -8,376/24 h; P < .001). The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was increased significantly after RFA (53%-56%; P < .001) but not after AAD (52%- 52%; P = 0.6) therapy. Of 121 (24%) patients with reduced LVEF, 39 (32%) had LVEF normalization to 50% or greater. LVEF was restored in 25 of 53 (47%) patients in the RFA group compared with 14 of 68 (21%) patients in the AAD group (P = 0.003). PVC coupling interval less than 450 ms, less impaired left ventricular function, and RFA were independent predictors of LVEF normalization performed by using multivariate analysis.

Conclusion

RFA appears to be more effective than AADs in PVC reduction and LVEF normalization.

Surgery for arrhythmia management — In patients with monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) refractory to antiarrhythmic medications and attempts at catheter ablation, surgical ablation may be reasonable (COR IIb, LOE C-LD). Cardiac surgery as a standalone procedure for VT is rarely performed but has a role in some highly symptomatic patients when antiarrhythmic medications and catheter ablation fails or are not possible, surgical ablation of tachycardia can also be performed at the time of other cardiac surgical interventions, and it is best undertaken at tertiary referral centers with collaboration between experienced surgeons and electrophysiologists.

### Mapping and ablation of premature ventricular complexes: state of the art [^973bf0e6]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are common arrhythmias in clinical practice. Although benign and asymptomatic in most cases, PVCs may result in disabling symptoms, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, or PVC-induced ventricular fibrillation. Catheter ablation has emerged as a first-line therapy in such cases, with high rates of efficacy and low risk of complications. Significant progress in mapping and ablation technology has been made in the past 2 decades, along with the development of a growing body of knowledge and accumulated experience regarding PVC sites of origin, anatomical relationships, electrocardiographic characterization, and mapping/ablation strategies. This paper provides an overview of the main indications for catheter ablation of PVCs, electrocardiographic features, PVC mapping techniques, and contemporary ablation approaches. The authors also review the most common sites of PVC origin and the main considerations and challenges with ablation in each location.

### Optimal catheter ablation procedure for premature ventricular contraction originating from the free wall of tricuspid annulus [^2199258a]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1

Chen et al. have illustrated the superior feasibility and efficacy of a novel reserved S‐curve technique (RST), facilitated by a steerable sheath, in the ablation of premature ventricular contractions (PVC) originating from the free wall of the tricuspid annulus, in comparison to the conventional reserved C‐curve technique (RCT).

To determine the earliest activation site, the authors employed systematic mapping with an ablation catheter. The feasibility of the Octaray catheter (Biosense Webster) for CARTO mapping and the HD grid (Abbott) for EnSite mapping has been well‐established. It is pertinent for the authors to deliberate on the potential causal relationship between the choice of mapping catheter and the occurrence of procedure‐related complications. Two patients in the RCT group experienced cardiac tamponade, underscoring the importance of this discussion.

The matter of anesthesia remains unclear, with the authors not specifying whether general anesthesia or local anesthesia was employed. General anesthesia may suppress the incidence of PVC and has the potential to be linked with procedural failure. Conversely, it can effectively manage the patient's respiratory status. Given the pronounced influence of respiratory motion on the free wall of the right ventricle, where catheter ablation is associated with a heightened risk of cardiac tamponade, the authors should provide insights into their choice of anesthesia and its implications on the procedure.

Spatial displacement plays a pivotal role in the success of PVC catheter ablation. The free wall of the right ventricle represents a region with substantial spatial displacement. Consequently, the earliest activation site of PVC visualized in three‐dimensional space obtained during sinus rhythm may yield different results from the precise site, and this variance might contribute to the higher success rate observed in the RST group. Additionally, the CARTO3 system presents an innovative approach for adjusting spatial displacement, which should be explored further.

Ablation time is another crucial aspect deserving consideration. In their study, ablation durations ranged from 90 to 120 seconds at 35 W. Recent advances propose significantly shorter ablation times, such as 4 seconds at 90 W, to mitigate procedure‐related complications while preserving efficacy. The authors should elucidate their rationale for the selected ablation time and consider the optimal duration in light of these advancements.

Ventricular arrhythmias are an important cause of morbidity and mortality and come in a variety of forms, from single premature ventricular complexes to sustained ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Rapid developments have taken place over the past decade in our understanding of these arrhythmias and in our ability to diagnose and treat them. The field of catheter ablation has progressed with the development of new methods and tools, and with the publication of large clinical trials. Therefore, global cardiac electrophysiology professional societies undertook to outline recommendations and best practices for these procedures in a document that will update and replace the 2009 EHRA/HRS Expert Consensus on Catheter Ablation of Ventricular Arrhythmias. An expert writing group, after reviewing and discussing the literature, including a systematic review and meta-analysis published in conjunction with this document, and drawing on their own experience, drafted and voted on recommendations and summarized current knowledge and practice in the field. Each recommendation is presented in knowledge byte format and is accompanied by supportive text and references. Further sections provide a practical synopsis of the various techniques and of the specific ventricular arrhythmia sites and substrates encountered in the electrophysiology lab. The purpose of this document is to help electrophysiologists around the world to appropriately select patients for catheter ablation, to perform procedures in a safe and efficacious manner, and to provide follow-up and adjunctive care in order to obtain the best possible outcomes for patients with ventricular arrhythmias.

### Single catheter approach for treatment of premature ventricular contractions [^341aab5e]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Jáuregui et al. aimed to assess the benefits of an automatic LAT acquisition protocol using wavefront annotation and an ECG pattern matching algorithm during PVC ablation procedures. One hundred consecutive patients were enrolled and randomized to either the automatic (AUT) or manual (MAN) annotation protocols. The results showed that mapping and procedure times were significantly shorter in the AUT group compared with the MAN group (25.5 ± 14.3 minutes vs. 32.8 ± 12.6 minutes, p = 0.009, and 54.8 ± 24.8 minutes vs. 67.4 ± 25.2 minutes, p = 0.014, respectively), the latter being comparable to our investigation. However, success rates were similar between the two groups. Clinical success was significantly better in the AUT arm (100% vs. 88%; p = 0.01), but not during follow‐up (92% AUT vs. 88% MAN; p = 0.51). No procedure‐related complications were reported.

The success of future outpatient‐based ablation treatments will be heavily influenced by the ability to minimize the incidence of complications (e.g. by reducing procedure times and vascular punctures), making it a crucial area of focus for healthcare providers. As a result, we chose not to use advanced multielectrode catheters for activation mapping since these complex devices cannot provide the simplicity of a single catheter approach. In this context, a single catheter approach may provide a safe and feasible treatment option for PVC, especially those that are of idiopathic origin.

While our study supports the efficiency of the single catheter approach in PVC ablation, caution is advised in cases with para‐hisian PVCs due to their proximity to the cardiac conduction system. The potential risk of inducing complete heart block in this scenario warrants prudence. For such cases, a traditional approach with multiple catheters, especially for ventricular backup pacing, may be more prudent. The decision on the approach should be thoughtful, considering individual factors and anatomical considerations.

Objective

To investigate the characteristics, safety, and outcomes of radiofrequency CA in patients with prior MVS and ventricular arrhythmias (VA).

Methods

We identified consecutive patients with prior MVS who underwent CA for VT or PVC between January 2013 and December 2018. We investigated the mechanism of arrhythmia, ablation approach, peri-operative complications, and outcomes.

Results

In our cohort, 31 patients (77% men, mean age 62.3 ± 10.8years, left ventricular ejection fraction 39.2 ± 13.9%) with prior MVS underwent CA (16 VT; 15 PVC). Access to the left ventricle was via transseptal approach in 17 patients, and a retrograde aortic approach was used in 13 patients. A combined transseptal and retrograde aortic approach was used in one patient, and a percutaneous epicardial approach was combined with trans-septal approach in one patient. Heterogenous scar regions were present in 94% of VT patients and scar-related reentry was the dominant mechanism of VT. Forty-seven percent of PVC patients had abnormal substrate at the site targeted for ablation. Clinical VA substrates involved the peri-mitral area in six patients with VT and five patients with PVC ablation. No procedure-related complications were reported. The overall recurrence-free rate at 1-year was 72.2%; 67% in the VT group and 78% in the PVC group. No arrhythmia-related death was documented on long-term follow-up.

Conclusion

CA of VAs can be performed safely and effectively in patients with MVS.

Ventricular arrhythmia catheter ablation — this clinical document is intended to supplement, not replace, the 2017 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for Management of Patients with Ventricular Arrhythmias and the Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death and the 2015 ESC Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Ventricular Arrhythmias and the Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death. The scope of the current document relates to ablation therapy for ventricular arrhythmias (VAs), from premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) to monomorphic and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and triggers of ventricular fibrillation (VF). Where possible, the recommendations are evidence based and intended to set reasonable standards that can be applicable worldwide while recognizing different resources, technological availability, disease prevalence, and health care delivery logistics, and parts of this document, particularly Section 9, present a practical guide on how to accomplish the procedures described while recognizing that some procedures are better performed, and some disease states better managed, in settings in which there is specific expertise; due to its narrower scope, the consensus statement delves into greater detail with regard to indications and technical aspects of VA ablation than the above-mentioned guidelines.

### Epicardial unipolar radiofrequency ablation for left ventricular aneurysm related ventricular arrhythmia [^c21c90b6]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 62-year-old Chinese man who had myocardial infarction on anterior wall was recommended for cardiac surgery after diagnosed with unstable angina. His cardiac function was grade III according to the New York Heart Association classification. Coronary angiography showed triple-vessel lesions. Echocardiography revealed paradoxical cardiac movements in the apex of the left ventricle in the systolic phase without mural thrombosis. The left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.40 and the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was 55 mm. Preoperative 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) showed premature ventricular contractions (PVC). 12-lead Holter monitoring confirmed the presence of frequent multifocal VA (26400/24 h) and paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia. The patient had non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, and did not show mural thrombi. The patient took at least three kinds of anti-arrhythmic drugs including beta-blocker, lidocaine, and amiodarone to reduce the occurrence of VA before the operation. However, those anti-arrhythmic drugs did not seem effective for the patient.

Standard median sternotomy incision was used to expose the heart. Off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) grafting was performed. A left internal mammary artery was grafted to the left anterior descending artery and a saphenous vein was anastomosed to the diagonal branch, the obtuse marginal artery, and the right coronary post-descending artery sequentially. The border of the aneurysm wall was clear on the beating heart.

A bipolar intramural electrode placed at the base of right ventricle via right femoral vein was used to record a reference electrogram. Ventricular tachycardia appeared spontaneously during the operation. We used more than 40 predetermined locations on the left ventricle to record bipolar potential to construct ventricular epicardial depolarization map. The time point when the epicardial spike moved the most rapidly, approximately 7 ms, represented the moment at which electrical force passed between the bipolar references. The locations where the rapid spike movement occurred were marked. Connecting these locations resulted in a circular area along the border between the aneurysm wall and the surrounding normal myocardial tissue. The circular area was the target for radiofrequency ablation. Other locations showed a spiking time longer than 7 ms. Unipolar radiofrequency ablation was performed by using a Medtronic system, which consisted of a Cardioblate 68000 ablation host and a Cardioblate unipolar pen. The ablation energy was set at 30w without temperature control, and the duration of radiofrequency discharge was set at 20–30s. We first performed a circular epicardial ablation along the borderline using the unipolar ablation pen (Figure 1).

### Non-endocardial radiofrequency ablation of premature ventricular complexes (NERA-PVC): safety, efficacy and outcome [^e154206e]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Radiofrequency (RF) ablation of premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) is a well-established treatment for patients high PVCs burden, even when arising from epicardial/intramural localization. Consistent data about safety of using high power RF is lacking in the literature in these regions.

Aim

The aim of this study is to investigate the safety of different RF power settings, efficacy and outcome of non-endocardial PVCs ablation.

Methods

Consecutive patients who underwent PVC ablation were included (2017–2023). We defined "Non-Endocardial Radiofrequency Ablation"(NERA) a procedure in which at least one ablation site has been identified into the CVS, aortic cusps, inter-leaflet region or pulmonary cusps.

Results

Total number of NERA sites was 64 in 56 procedures. In 63% of the procedures, high power (≥ 40W) and in 60% long duration (≥ 60s) RF was delivered in at least one site (median power: 40W(30–40), median duration of single RF 54s(45–91). In 21% of the procedures, a combination of both high power and long duration RF applications was performed. Overall procedural success was achieved in 46 procedures 82%), complete in 39 (70%), partial in 7 (12%). Only one severe complication (pericardial bleeding) was observed. Multisite ablation was associated with procedural failure. During follow-up, median PVC burden was 0.5%(0.5–9.5), with a median reduction of 97%. Multisite ablation and coronary venous system RF were predictors of recurrence (HR 3.6; p = 0.03) and HR 3.85; p = 0.02).

Conclusion

Ablation from non-endocardial sites is a safe and effective procedure, even using high power and/or long duration RF with clear benefit in terms of PVC burden reduction.

### Ventricular premature depolarization QRS duration as a new marker of risk for the development of ventricular premature depolarization-induced cardiomyopathy [^4cffd0af]. Heart Rhythm (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Frequent ventricular premature depolarizations (VPDs) can cause cardiomyopathy (CMP). The mechanisms underlying its development remain unclear, with VPD burden being only a weak predictor of risk.

Objective

To determine whether VPD QRS duration at the time of initial presentation could predict risk for the subsequent development of CMP in patients with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

Methods

From consecutive patients referred for ablation between January 1, 2006, and April 2, 2013, with ≥ 10% VPDs on 24-hour Holter monitoring, we identified 45 patients with normal LVEF and an electrocardiogram of the targeted VPD, who were then followed for at least 6 months (median 14 months; interquartile range [IQR] 8–32 months) before intervention. We excluded patients with structural or genetic heart disease.

Results

Of the 45 patients, 28 (62%) maintained normal LVEF and 17(38%) developed VPD-induced CMP. VPD burden was similar (26.5% [IQR 19.3%-39.5%] vs 26.0% [IQR 16.4%-41.0%]; P = 0.4) between the 2 groups. Patients who developed VPD-induced CMP had significantly longer VPD QRS duration (159 ms vs 142 ms; P < .001) and a longer sinus QRS duration (97 ms vs 89 ms; P = 0.04). A VPD QRS duration of ≥ 153 ms best predicted development of VPD CMP (82% sensitivity and 75% specificity). Longer VPD QRS duration and a non-outflow tract site of VPD origin were independent risk factors for left ventricular dysfunction after multivariate analysis.

Conclusion

VPD QRS duration longer than 153 ms and a non-outflow tract site of origin might be useful predictors of the subsequent development of VPD-induced CMP.

### Outcome of repeat ablation for premature ventricular contractions in patients with prior ablation failure: impact of advanced techniques [^ab530e63]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The utility of repeat ablation for premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) after prior ablation failure is not clear.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the outcomes of repeat ablation and the use of different techniques in patients who failed prior PVC ablation.

Methods

We reviewed 239 consecutive patients who underwent PVC ablation. When standard endocardial ablation with normal or half-normal saline failed, we considered an advanced ablation technique. Acute success was defined as abolition of the target PVC. Clinical and procedural findings, PVC origins, and acute and follow-up outcomes were compared in those with and without a prior failed ablation procedure.

Results

Of 239 patients, 75 (31%) had failed a prior ablation procedure, and they more often had left ventricular outflow tract PVCs. Despite failing prior ablation, repeat standard ablation was acutely successful in 59% of patients, and 75% of these patients had long-term success. Acute standard ablation success rate was lower and long-term recurrence rate was higher than in patients without prior ablation (59% vs 95%, P < .001; and 29% vs 17%, P < .05, respectively). Of the 31 repeat standard procedures that again failed, advanced techniques were performed in 23 (16 needle, 5 epicardial, 2 simultaneous ablation) and were acutely successful in 16 (70%) with long-term success in 14 (45%). Overall long-term success for patients with prior failed standard ablation was 71%.

Conclusion

Although success is lower for patients with prior failed ablation, repeat ablation seems reasonable for many, and the use of advanced techniques increased success to 71% in this group.

5 Conclusion

In this meta‐analysis, intramyocardial needle ablation for refractory VT and PVC was associated with a high immediate post‐procedural effectiveness; however, long‐term effectiveness for refractory VT dropped to less than 50% at 6 months, while it was maintained at about 76% for refractory PVC during the same follow‐up period. Complications from needle ablation were not uncommon, with procedure‐related death ocurring in aproximately 5.0% of cases.

Finally, despite there being over a decade of research and accumulated experience with needle ablation for cardiac arrhythmias, the adoption of this technique remains limited to only a few centers. In a 2024 European Heart Rhythm Association survey study to assess how VT is managed at various centers in Europe, advanced techniques were limited to epicardial ablation among 67% of respondents, and needle ablation was not even listed as an option. Overall, needle ablation therapy is a highly promising emerging approach for treating arrhythmias that are refractory to more standard techniques; however, more controlled and real‐world studies are needed to refine our understanding of which patients would benefit and which protocols will lead to optimal long‐term outcomes. Thermedical®, manufacturer of Saline Enhanced Radiofrequency (SERF) needle ablation, plans to conduct a single arm clinical trial enrolling 130 patients with monomorphic VT and recurrence despite conventional VT ablation across 6 sites in the US.

4.1 Limitations

Our study had several limitations, including those inherent to meta‐analyses and the observational nature of the included studies. Also, most patients underwent additional endocardial RFA; therefore, the outcomes should be interpreted as being relevant to a combined needle and endocardial ablation approach. Also, patients may have undergone repeat needle or RFA or had antiarrhythmic medications titrated in the 6‐month follow‐up period after index needle ablation, which might have affected outcomes; therefore, freedom from VT at 6‐month follow‐up should be interpreted with caution. Undetected overlap of patients across studies may have occured, with some patients being included in more than one study. These procedures were performed at select centers, and these findings might not be reproducible within other healthcare settings. Finally, the patient population was heterogeneous, and the studies did not specify the details about the underlying cardiomyopathy substrate.

Catheter ablation general considerations — Catheter ablation is an important treatment option for patients with ventricular arrhythmias (VA) when antiarrhythmic medications are ineffective, not tolerated, or not desired by the patient. Monomorphic VA usually have an origin or substrate that can be targeted, ablation is an option for selected patients with polymorphic VT/VF only if an initiating premature ventricular contraction (PVC) focus or substrate can be identified, and most VA originate close to the subendocardium and are approached through transvenous (right ventricle) or transaortic/transseptal (left ventricle) catheterization, with some diseases giving rise to subepicardial VA approachable by epicardial mapping and ablation and pericardial access usually achieved by a percutaneous subxiphoid puncture. The procedure usually involves attempts to induce VT by programmed electrical stimulation to confirm the diagnosis and guide ablation, and problems limiting success include inability to induce an arrhythmia for mapping or an arrhythmia origin in an inaccessible myocardial location.

4 Indications for Catheter Ablation

Following are the consensus recommendations for catheter ablation of VAs organized by underlying diagnosis and substrate. These recommendations are each assigned a COR and an LOE according to the current recommendation classification system. In drafting each of these recommendations, the writing committee took into account the published literature in the specific area, including the methodological quality and size of each study, as well as the collective clinical experience of the writing group when published data were not available. Implicit in each recommendation are several points: 1) the procedure is being performed by an electrophysiologist with appropriate training and experience in the procedure and in a facility with appropriate resources; 2) patient and procedural complexity vary widely, and some patients or situations merit a more experienced operator or a center with more capabilities than others, even within the same recommendation (eg, when an epicardial procedure is indicated and the operator or institution has limited experience with this procedure, it might be preferable to refer the patient to an operator or institution with adequate experience in performing epicardial procedures); 3) the patient is an appropriate candidate for the procedure, as outlined in Section 5, recognizing that the level of patient suitability for a procedure will vary widely with the clinical scenario; and 4) the patient's (or designee's) informed consent, values, and overall clinical trajectory are fundamental to a decision to proceed (or not) with any procedure. Therefore, in some clinical scenarios, initiation or continuation of medical therapy instead of an ablation procedure may be the most appropriate option, even when a class 1 recommendation for ablation is present. There may also be scenarios not explicitly covered in this document, and on which little or no published literature is available, in which the physician and patient must rely solely on their own judgment.

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are common findings in asymptomatic participants during ECG recordings. While most PVCs are treated conservatively, some patients may develop adverse cardiac events needing further investigations and definitive ablation by radiofrequency. Spectral strain ultrasonography has demonstrated ventricular dysfunction as a sequel to high burden PVCs, but the exact underlying pathophysiology is still uncertain. Cohort studies have associated PVCs with increased risks for overall cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and yet consensus is still lacking for threshold in treating PVCs. Our case is that of a 54-year-old woman with an unusual bradycardiac presentation of PVCs and an ECG that changed rapidly within minutes.

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

In patients with a suspected PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, catheter ablation can be considered an alternative to long-term AAD therapy, particularly for patients with monomorphic PVCs, or PVCs of an RVOT origin. PVC-induced cardiomyopathy should be suspected when cardiomyopathy and frequent PVCs are present and a comprehensive cardiac evaluation fails to identify alternate etiologies. Several studies have confirmed a correlation between a higher PVC burden and development of cardiomyopathy, although no precise burden of PVCs consistently predicts the development of a cardiomyopathy. Several studies have demonstrated a higher incidence of cardiomyopathy with PVC burdens > 15%–25%; however, patients with similarly high PVC burdens can also maintain normal cardiac function. Reversible PVC-induced cardiomyopathy has also been reported in patients with PVC burdens as low as 4%–5%. When PVC-induced cardiomyopathy is suspected in these patients with relatively low PVC burdens, other etiologies for cardiomyopathy should be thoroughly investigated and addressed, and the persistence of the PVC burden established. Other risk factors for the development of a PVC-induced cardiomyopathy to consider include epicardial origin of PVCs, PVCs with a longer QRS duration, longer exposure to PVCs, asymptomatic PVCs, interpolated PVCs, and male sex (,4.3.21). In patients with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, PVC ablation has an overall reported success rate of 65%–90%, with a low complication rate. Predictors of ablation success include an RVOT PVC origin and a uniform PVC morphology. Following successful ablation, the majority of patients with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy experience significant improvement and, possibly, normalization of their LVEF. Based on a review of current data, routine catheter ablation of frequent PVCs in asymptomatic patients without evidence of LV dysfunction is not presently recommended. In some asymptomatic patients with very frequent PVCs and preserved cardiac function who express a strong preference for ablation, approximately half of the writing committee members agreed that an ablation can be considered after adequate counseling on the risks, benefits, and alternatives to ablation, whereas half would not offer ablation. Additional clinical features that may portend worsening LV function that should be considered include LV dilation or a relative decrease in EF that may still be considered in the normal range.
In patients with underlying SHD, the presence of frequent PVCs can contribute to a cardiomyopathy, and successful PVC elimination by ablation can improve cardiac function. Detailed cardiac imaging (such as CMR to quantify scarring) in conjunction with a comprehensive cardiac history, including the time course of cardiomyopathy development and onset of PVCs, can help to estimate the contribution of the PVCs to the cardiomyopathy and guide treatment decisions targeting the PVCs.
In patients with recurrent VF refractory to antiarrhythmic medications and triggered by PVCs from a potentially identifiable site, successful ablation of the PVC can lead to VF suppression. The triggering PVC is often located in the Purkinje system and can exhibit slight variations in morphology. It is important to recognize that despite an initially successful ablation, PVC and VF recurrences are possible, and recurrent PVCs can arise from an alternate focus. Successful ablation, therefore, often does not eliminate the need for an ICD.
In patients who are clinical nonresponders to CRT, with limited biventricular pacing due to frequent PVCs despite pharmacological therapy, successful PVC ablation has demonstrated an improvement in heart failure class and a modest improvement in LVEF. In one prospective multicenter study in which CRT nonresponders with frequent and primarily monomorphic PVCs were ablated, the improvements in LV function and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class were proportional to the preprocedural PVC burden, and the greatest improvement was noted in patients with a preablation PVC burden > 22%.

Europace (2019). High credibility.

Premature ventricular contractions — PVC burden, cardiomyopathy risk, and monitoring: There is no absolute threshold of the number of PVCs that can be used as a cut-off for underlying disease and hence should trigger further investigations, and even in the absence of demonstrable underlying disease, a moderate to high burden of PVCs are a marker for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, indicating that continued follow-up may be warranted. It is well recognized that not all patients with frequent PVCs will develop LV dysfunction, but the PVC burden is one of the strongest predictors for the development of a PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, and factors associated with this include longer PVC QRS duration, epicardial PVCs, retrograde atrial activation of PVCs, and interpolation of PVCs. Across ablation-focused studies, the prevalence of LV dysfunction ranged from 7% to 52%, asymptomatic patients with frequent PVCs were underrepresented, PVC-induced cardiomyopathy has been reported with a PVC burden < 10%, mild impairment has been observed with a PVC burden > 8%, and longer monitoring can double the identification of patients with a PVC burden of > 10%.

2.1. History of Ventricular Arrhythmia Ablation

In 1959, Couch reported the elimination of VT with the resection of a postinfarction left ventricular (LV) aneurysm. In the early to mid-1970s, standard LV aneurysmectomy was performed for patients with preoperative VT episodes in the setting of prior infarction. Unfortunately, the operative mortality rates were high and VT recurrences were frequent. Endocardial encircling ventriculotomy, introduced by Guiraudon et al. was designed to isolate the arrhythmogenic tissue from the remainder of the ventricle by creating a nearly transmural incision through the edge of the border zone, sparing only the epicardium. This operation was associated with marked postoperative LV dysfunction, likely due to interference with coronary arterial blood supply. Guiraudon et al. also attempted to disarticulate the right ventricular (RV) free wall from the rest of the ventricles in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Although the surgery was successful in isolating the arrhythmogenic RV free wall and in producing interesting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of sinus rhythm simultaneous with persistent sustained VT in the same patient, most patients ultimately did poorly because of progressive RV failure. In the late 1970s, Josephson et al. developed the technique of map-guided subendocardial resection. This procedure was based on the observation that diastolic or presystolic electrical activation could be recorded during VT on the endocardium near or within the border between the densely scarred aneurysm or infarct and more normal muscle. The surgical procedure thus targeted areas specified by mapping. As originally practiced, subendocardial resection removed segments of endocardium approximately 3 mm thick and 5 cm². These areas were almost always within regions of visibly scarred endocardium, extending from the edge of a densely scarred aneurysm. As the procedure evolved, a more extensive area of resection was typically performed because of the ease of defining a single plane of resection with the goal of eliminating other arrhythmogenic areas within the visual scar. Adjunctive cryoablation was applied to locations that were not easily resected, such as the papillary muscles or the deep myocardial layers beneath the removed subendocardium when VT was localized to these regions. Cryoablation targeting an isthmus of surviving myocardium between a more densely scarred inferior infarction and the mitral annulus improved the outcome of VT ablation associated with this substrate. More extensive cryoablation of the entire visually scarred endocardial surface was also used with some success. Although success rates approached 90% with surgery in terms of VT elimination, a mortality rate of 5%–15% limited the procedure to a few select patients.

### Catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia in structural heart disease: indications, strategies, and outcomes-part II [^e48f2797]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

In contrast to ventricular tachycardia (VT) that occurs in the setting of a structurally normal heart, VT that occurs in patients with structural heart disease carries an elevated risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD), and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are the mainstay of therapy. In these individuals, catheter ablation may be used as adjunctive therapy to treat or prevent repetitive ICD therapies when antiarrhythmic drugs are ineffective or not desired. However, certain patients with frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) or VT and tachycardiomyopathy should be considered for ablation before ICD implantation because left ventricular function may improve, consequently decreasing the risk of SCD and obviating the need for an ICD. The goal of this paper is to review the pathophysiology, mechanism, and management of VT in the setting of structural heart disease and discuss the evolving role of catheter ablation in decreasing ventricular arrhythmia recurrence.

### Premature ventricular contraction-induced cardiomyopathy: related clinical and electrophysiologic parameters [^e00a8e48]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Factors associated with premature ventricular contraction-induced cardiomyopathy (PVCi-CMP) remain debated.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to test the correlation of various factors to the presence PVCi-CMP in a large multicenter population.

Methods

One hundred sixty-eight consecutive patients referred for ablation of frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) were included. Patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 with suspected PVCi-CMP (96 patients, ejection fraction 38% ± 10%, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter 62 ± 8 mm, with or without additional structural heart disease); and group 2 (control group, 72 patients with normal ejection fraction and left ventricular dimensions). Various clinical and electrophysiologic parameters were compared between groups.

Results

In univariate analysis, left ventricular origin of PVC, lack of palpitations, long PVC coupling interval, epicardial origin of the focus, long sinus beat QRS duration, male gender, high PVC burden, presence of polymorphic PVCs, high PVC QRS duration, and older age were significantly related to the presence of PVCi-CMP. In multivariate analysis, only lack of palpitations, PVC burden, and epicardial origin remained significantly and independently correlated with the presence of cardiomyopathy. Even if sinus QRS duration or PVC left ventricular origin were also found independently linked to PVCi-CMP in the whole population, they were no longer correlated when patients with additional heart disease were excluded.

Conclusion

Lack of palpitations, PVC burden, and epicardial origin are independent factors that identify patients prone to developing PVCi-CMP.

4 Discussion

In this meta‐analysis of five observational studies involving patients with monomorphic VT or PVC refractory to prior endocardial ablation, we found that needle ablation with intramyocardial radiofrequency delivery was generally effective and associated with immediate freedom from inducible VT/PVC in around 80% of patients. However, the studies reported widely variable results for immediate efficacy when performed for refractory VT, from 43% to 96%. Also, most patients had additional endocardial ablations performed during the procedure. Freedom from clinical VT declined to almost half, from 80% immediately after ablation to 43% at 6 months, after which it remained unchanged, highlighting a need for exploration of short‐term versus long‐term utility of this procedure for VT. Importantly, the procedure was associated with adverse events in 17% of patients, with pericardial effusion being the most common.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

PVC-induced cardiomyopathy — For patients who require arrhythmia suppression for symptoms or declining left ventricular (LV) function suspected to be due to frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) (generally > 15% of beats and predominantly of 1 morphology) and for whom antiarrhythmic medications are ineffective, not tolerated, or not the patient's preference, catheter ablation is useful. In patients with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, pharmacological treatment (eg, beta blocker, amiodarone) is reasonable to reduce recurrent arrhythmias and improve symptoms and LV function. Frequent PVCs (usually > 15% of the total number of beats) may produce a reversible form of LV dysfunction, and LV dysfunction has been associated with greater PVC burden (> 10% and usually > 20%), nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), a retrograde P-wave after the PVCs, and interpolated PVCs. In a prospective study of catheter ablation for PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, ablation was completely successful in 80% of patients, and LV function normalized within 6 months in 82% of the 22 patients who had depressed ventricular function at baseline. In a double-blind parallel study of 30 patients with or without ischemic heart disease with > 30 PVCs per hour, proarrhythmic effects were present in 1 patient on sotalol; there was no significant difference in suppression of PVCs (sotalol 65%, propranolol 44%), with reduction in ventricular couplets being 39% for sotalol and 49% for propranolol, and there was a significant increase in QTc in patients on sotalol.

Follow‐up

If available, telemonitoring will be activated in the implanted ICD/CRT device for continuous measurements. The investigator will promptly be informed in case of any detected VA occurrence. In case that telemonitoring is not possible, data will be collected from the interrogation of the ICDs at each visit. In case of VA occurrence, it is recommended to perform (repeat) ablation, unless clinically contraindicated. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy for rhythm control will also be allowed in the event of VA. Patients who develop recurrent VF subsequent to VT ablation will be prescribed antiarrhythmic drug therapy, and if the complications persist, they will be scheduled for repat ablation. In the scenario of premature ventricular contraction‐induced VF, the trigger will be eliminated by ablation. If VF after prophylactic ablation is associated with a fast or degenerated VT, the VT will be targeted with ablation, followed by repeat substrate modification.

At 6, 12 and 24 months after baseline, all patients will undergo a regular follow‐up visit. Patients completing the multiples of 12 months while the study is still ongoing will have additional follow‐up visits, which will be equal to all the other planned visits. Follow‐up windows will be ± 14 days for the 6‐month and 12‐month visits, and ± 30 days for the remaining others. Echocardiographic measurements will be performed as described previously. After the end of the study, the patients may be contacted by phone to assess their vital status.

Moreover, patients are routinely followed for their HTx listing criteria and statusand reevaluation of HF therapy will be adjusted in the course of follow‐up. Efforts to maintain sinus rhythm in both study arms are recommended. In addition to that, these patients are routinely reevaluated for severity of HF, symptoms and secondary organ dysfunction and indication for implantation of ventricular assist devices is regularly reassessed at every patient visit. Surgical interventions for HF will be determined by an institutional HF committee that is blinded to the patients' participation in the trial and any trial‐related information.

### Impact of QRS duration of frequent premature ventricular complexes on the development of cardiomyopathy [^04fc28a5]. Heart Rhythm (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are at risk of developing reversible PVC-induced cardiomyopathy (rPVC-CMP). Not all determinants of rPVC-CMP are known.

Objective

To assess the impact of the QRS duration of PVCs on the development of rPVC-CMP.

Methods

In a consecutive series of 294 patients with frequent idiopathic PVCs referred for PVC ablation, the width of the PVC-QRS complex was assessed. The QRS width was correlated with the presence of rPVC-CMP.

Results

The PVC-QRS width was significantly greater in patients with rPVC-CMP than in patients without rPVC-CMP (164 ± 20 ms vs 149 ± 17 ms; P < .0001). The site of origin of the PVC had an impact on the PVC-QRS width, with epicardial PVCs having the broadest QRS complexes. Patients with PVCs originating from the right ventricular outflow tract or the fascicles had the narrowest QRS complexes. After adjusting for PVC burden, symptom duration, and PVC site of origin, PVC-QRS width and an epicardial PVC origin were independently associated with rPVC-CMP. Based on receiver operator characteristics analysis, a QRS duration of > 150 ms best differentiated patients with and without rPVC-CMP (area under the curve 0.66; sensitivity 80%; specificity 52%). The PVC burden for developing rPVC-CMP is significantly lower in patients with a PVC-QRS width of ≥ 150 ms than in patients with a narrower PVC-QRS complex (22% ± 13% vs 28% ± 12%; P < .0001).

Conclusion

Broader PVCs and an epicardial PVC origin are associated with the development of rPVC-CMP independent of the PVC burden.

### A decade of catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias in Sweden: ablation practices and outcomes [^0a021bf4]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aims

Catheter ablation is considered the treatment of choice for many tachyarrhythmias, but convincing 'real-world' data on efficacy and safety are lacking. Using Swedish national registry data, the ablation spectrum, procedural characteristics, as well as ablation efficacy and reported adverse events are reported.

Methods and Results

Consecutive patients (≥ 18 years of age) undergoing catheter ablation in Sweden between 01 January 2006 and 31 December 2015 were included in the study. Follow-up (repeat ablation and vital status) was collected through 31 December 2016. A total of 26 642 patients (57 ± 15 years, 62% men), undergoing a total of 34 428 ablation procedures were included in the study. In total, 4034 accessory pathway/Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome (12%), 7358 AV-nodal re-entrant tachycardia (21%), 1813 atrial tachycardia (5.2%), 5481 typical atrial flutter (16%), 11 916 atrial fibrillation (AF, 35%), 2415 AV-nodal (7.0%), 581 premature ventricular contraction (PVC, 1.7%), and 964 ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablations (2.8%) were performed. Median follow-up time was 4.7 years (interquartile range 2.7–7.0). The spectrum of treated arrhythmias changed over time, with a gradual increase in AF, VT, and PVC ablation (P < 0.001). Decreasing procedural times and utilization of fluoroscopy with time, were seen for all arrhythmia types. The rates of repeat ablation differed between ablation types, with the highest repeat ablation seen in AF (41% within 3 years). The rate of reported adverse events was low (n = 595, 1.7%). Death in the immediate period following ablation was rare (n = 116, 0.34%).

Conclusion

Catheter ablations have shifted towards more complex procedures over the past decade. Fluoroscopy time has markedly decreased and the efficacy of catheter ablation seems to improve for AF.

### Effectiveness and safety of intramyocardial needle ablation for refractory ventricular tachycardia and premature ventricular complexes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^487d60d9]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for treating cardiac arrhythmias has come a long way; however, 20%–40% of patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and premature ventricular contractions (PVC) experience recurrence after undergoing standard endocardial RFA. Despite advances in ablation techniques and device design, recurrence rates remain unchanged, and factors such as the affected underlying substrate and extent of heart disease can greatly influence the likelihood of recurrence. A major limitation of standard endocardial RFA that may affect long‐term success is its inability to target deeper mid‐myocardial and epicardial substrates. Thus, intramyocardial needle ablation has emerged as an alternative option for treating VT and PVC. This technique uses a narrow gauge (27–28 G) needle to map and create narrow and deep intramural lesions that are not achievable by standard endocardial or epicardial approaches. Notably, procedural expertise with this technique remains confined to a limited number of centers, making this therapy less available than standard RFA. Currently, studies evaluating the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of intramyocardial needle ablation are scarce, which limits our ability to develop standardized protocols and optimize patient selection processes. Therefore, the aim of this meta‐analysis was to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the existing literature on the safety and effectiveness of intramyocardial needle ablation for patients with recurrent VT or PVC after previously unsuccessful standard ablation procedures.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Antiarrhythmic therapy and device considerations after myocardial infarction — CAST demonstrated higher rates of mortality or nonfatal cardiac arrest in post–myocardial infarction patients treated with encainide or flecainide when used to suppress premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and nonsustained VT (NSVT), and propafenone is associated with increased mortality in sudden cardiac arrest survivors compared with beta blockers, amiodarone, and the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Implantation of an ICD prior to achieving suppression of frequent or incessant ventricular arrhythmias places the patient at high risk of repetitive shocks, which can be psychologically detrimental and has been associated with increased mortality. Sustained monomorphic VT in the setting of prior MI is typically due to scar-related reentry and is not due to acute ischemia, and although it may be appropriate to recommend revascularization when another indication exists, revascularization alone is unlikely to reduce recurrence and specific therapies such as antiarrhythmic medications or ablation may be needed to prevent recurrence.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^08423bce]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

PVC-induced cardiomyopathy — management notes that radiofrequency ablation is reportedly successful in reducing PVC burden in patients with LV dysfunction, improving ventricular function in both structurally normal and abnormal hearts, and PVC radiofrequency ablation in patients with LV dysfunction improves LV dilatation, mitral regurgitation, and EF. PVC suppression with antiarrhythmic drugs typically has been associated with increased mortality; however, in PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, antiarrhythmic drugs, including β-blockers, have been reported to be successful. Typically, PVCs are not suppressed unless they are symptomatic; however, because improvement in EF can be seen in those with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, consideration can be given to those with cardiomyopathy of unknown cause and a high burden of PVCs, although this has not been studied prospectively. Radiofrequency ablation can be effective in PVC-induced cardiomyopathy (Level of Evidence B).

Section 3 Clinical Evaluation

3.1. Clinical Presentation

Recommendation for clinical evaluation of patients with VAs

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

1. History should identify the onset, duration, frequency, and trigger of any symptoms and should include medication use as well as comorbidities and family history. Available cardiac rhythm data include interrogation of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) to assess arrhythmia burden, morphologies, and duration as well as treatment. Electrogram storage may be programmed to include far- and near-field electrograms to allow superior assessment of VA morphologies. The laboratory workup should be individualized to the patient's presentation and may include electrolytes, troponin, brain natriuretic peptide, genetic testing, or drug screening as appropriate.

Synopsis

The clinical presentations of patients with VAs encompass a wide spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic to VT/VF storm or sudden cardiac death.

Presenting symptoms can be classified into 5 groups: due to the VA itself (eg, PVCs, VT or VF); due to a secondary disease caused by the VAs (eg, PVC-induced cardiomyopathy); due to an underlying pathology associated with the VAs (eg, ischemia); due to ICD therapy; and a combination of these causes.

Idiopathic VA is frequently asymptomatic, especially when presenting as PVCs or nonsustained VT. In those cases, Vas are commonly detected coincidentally during routine exams. If symptomatic, symptoms can often be secondary to post-PVC augmentation of contractility or a post-PVC compensatory pause, and commonly consist of palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath, fatigue, or chest discomfort. With increasing duration or VA rate (eg, VT or VF), hemodynamic compromise can result in more severe symptoms, such as pre-syncope, syncope, or even sudden cardiac death.

### Giant left ventricular pseudoaneurysm: a rare acute complication of radiofrequency catheter ablation for premature ventricular contraction [^e0d0c487]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Radiofrequency catheter ablation is approved effective therapy for premature ventricular contraction. However, the rare but serious complication such as pseudoaneurysm should be given more attention. It is life-threatening due to the high risk of rupture. Only few cases have been reported in the literature. We herein report a huge acute left ventricular pseudoaneurysm after catheter ablation therapy.

Case presentation

A 69-year-old man underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation for premature ventricular contraction at a local hospital. The patient developed shock the second day after ablation. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed pericardial effusion. Pericardiocentesis was performed, and the puncture fluid was a bloody pericardial effusion. The transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an 9- × 4-cm giant pseudoaneurysm with a cystic structure in the left ventricular inferior wall near the mitral annulus along the left atrium. The pseudoaneurysm was connected to the left ventricular cavity through a 8-mm neck, and the lumen was filled with systolic and diastolic blood flow. The patient underwent three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography. The pseudoaneurysm and the tract was clearly visible. Emergency surgery was performed to resect the pseudoaneurysm. A bovine pericardial patch was placed on the neck of the pseudoaneurysm. Echocardiographic examination confirmed the absence of cardiac lesions after the operation.

Conclusions

It is rare to see such a large pseudoaneurysm after radiofrequency catheter ablation. Clinicians should be allert to the potential risks to patients in the process of an effective treatment. Echocardiography plays an important role in the prompt diagnosis and prognosis of this disease. Emergency surgery is a better method for treatment of huge pseudoaneurysm.

### Giant left ventricular pseudoaneurysm: a rare acute complication of radiofrequency catheter ablation for premature ventricular contraction [^369732c7]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Left ventricular pseudoaneurysm most often occurs after myocardial infarction and generally requires a surgical operation. It may also rarely occur in association with cardiac surgery, trauma, and endocarditis. Left ventricular pseudoaneurysm is a rare complication of radiofrequency catheter ablation, especially in the acute phase. Only two cases involving early complications have been reported. Dandamudi described a 2.4- × 2.4-cm left ventricular pseudoaneurysm following premature ventricular contraction ablation of the endocardial portion of the left ventricular summit, and Gill described a small pseudoaneurysm after radiofrequency ablation of supraventricular tachycardia. Three cases involving late complications have also been reported. Mansour reported a case of a small left ventricular pseudoaneurysm near the mitral annulus as a late complication of low-energy direct current ablation. Koch also reported a late large 6.1-cm left ventricular pseudoaneurysm following multiple endocardial and epicardial radiofrequency ablations for ventricular tachycardia. Auriau reported a 37- × 44-mm left ventricular pseudoaneurysm as a long-term complication of ablation of an accessory pathway. These cases reveal the rare life-threatening complications related to radiofrequency catheter ablation and the importance of prompt diagnosis for this potentially dangerous lesion.

The precise cause of left ventricular pseudoaneurysm is unclear. There are reports that high temperature can lead to perforation of the myocardium. This serious complication might be prevented by decreasing the power and reducing the operative time. The thickness of the left ventricular wall is not uniform; the thinner parts of the wall (such as the left ventricular summit) are more easily penetrated. Improvements in catheter ablation techniques will also help to avoid the occurrence of this serious complication.

Clinicians should be alert to the potential risks to patients in the process of an effective treatment. Several suggestions for clinical doctors are as follows. First, as noted above, left ventricular pseudoaneurysm is a rare potential serious complication of catheter ablation and should be given adequate attention. Second, cardiac rupture should be considered in patients with recurrent bloody pericardial effusion. Third, cardiac tamponade may also indicate the presence of a life-threatening complication. Finally, echocardiography plays an important role in the prompt diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. When symptoms are present, timely echocardiography is necessary, because this technique can promptly reveal effusion and lesions.
