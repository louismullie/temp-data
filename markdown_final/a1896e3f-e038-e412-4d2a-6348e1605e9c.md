## Question

Paronychia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about paronychia management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying acute versus chronic paronychia and the core pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, including when to suspect abscess, cellulitis, or special entities like retronychia. Next, I will review evidence-based treatment for acute disease, followed by chronic disease. After that, I need to consider special populations and drug-induced cases, including EGFR and MEK inhibitors. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight pitfalls, follow-up, and what would change my management if new evidence emerges.

> Let me first confirm the classification and pathophysiology, because treatment hinges on getting this right. Acute paronychia is typically a bacterial infection of the proximal or lateral nail folds, most often due to Staphylococcus aureus, triggered by trauma to the cuticle or nail fold that breaches the protective seal and allows inoculation, with rapid onset of pain, erythema, edema, and sometimes purulence, whereas chronic paronychia is a multifactorial inflammatory dermatitis driven by irritants and moisture with secondary Candida colonization rather than true infection, evolving over more than 6 weeks with boggy, swollen folds and loss of the cuticle [^a8f281e6] [^524d2665].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before jumping to treatment. For uncomplicated superficial infections, cultures rarely change management and are not routinely recommended, but I should consider ultrasound if I cannot clinically distinguish abscess from cellulitis or if the presentation is atypical, and I must keep a high index of suspicion for herpetic whitlow when vesicles are present, in which case incision would be contraindicated and antivirals considered [^14e4163a] [^1eb4e818] [^8c530b5b]. I should also remember retronychia, especially of the great toe, when there is chronic proximal paronychia with a thickened or doubled proximal plate; nail avulsion is curative in that scenario, so missing it leads to prolonged morbidity [^c5499cd8] [^4fdf727a].

> Now, for acute paronychia, I need to ensure I prioritize drainage when an abscess is present. If there is fluctuance, incision and drainage is the cornerstone; a simple longitudinal incision along the affected nail fold margin suffices in most cases, with more complex double-incision techniques reserved for extensive disease, and I should avoid extending incisions beyond the distal interphalangeal joint to prevent complications [^c6960d39] [^857fa284]. Hold on, I should verify the role of oral antibiotics; routine systemic antibiotics are not needed if adequate drainage is achieved and the patient is immunocompetent, though I will add oral therapy for immunocompromise, severe infection, spreading cellulitis, or systemic features, tailoring to local resistance patterns and likely pathogens such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus [^02011f0f] [^c6960d39]. I should also consider that a Best Evidence Topic review found no direct evidence that oral antibiotics outperform drainage alone, reinforcing a drainage-first approach in uncomplicated cases [^195c0c00].

> Let me consider supportive care and adjuncts for acute disease. Warm soaks several times daily with or without Burow's solution or dilute acetic acid can soften tissue and promote drainage, and adding a topical antibiotic with or without a topical corticosteroid can reduce inflammation and speed symptom resolution; I initially thought to avoid steroids if infection is suspected, but wait, I should double-check — AAFP suggests topical steroids can be added to topical antibiotics in acute paronychia to hasten resolution, which I will align with when inflammation is prominent and infection is being addressed [^c6960d39] [^2c191a65]. I need to ensure tetanus prophylaxis is updated when indicated and provide analgesia and splinting in the position of function to reduce pain and swelling [^93036cd9].

> For chronic paronychia, I should confirm that the strategy is anti-inflammatory and barrier-restoration rather than antimicrobial. The mainstay is potent topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors to suppress the inflammatory response, combined with rigorous irritant avoidance and moisture control; randomized data show topical steroids outperform systemic antifungals, and tacrolimus can be effective when steroids are contraindicated or not tolerated, so I should avoid reflex antifungal monotherapy [^9ea14d67] [^f545d856] [^aa299f39]. I need to ensure patient education on protective measures: rubber gloves with cotton liners for wet work, minimizing water exposure, avoiding cuticle trimming and aggressive manicuring, keeping nails short, and using emollients after washing; these steps materially reduce recurrence [^0cb651f8] [^304fec26].

> But wait, what if conservative therapy fails after several months. In recalcitrant chronic paronychia, surgical options such as en bloc excision of the proximal nail fold, with or without nail plate avulsion, or newer techniques like the square flap, can be considered; evidence suggests better outcomes when nail avulsion is combined with fold excision, though data are limited and technique selection should be individualized [^789140a0] [^2982e087]. I should confirm that surgery is reserved for cases failing appropriate medical therapy and that postoperative care emphasizes irritant avoidance to prevent recurrence [^c6960d39].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In children, mixed anaerobic and aerobic flora from oral habits are common, so I need to consider broader coverage if antibiotics are used and maintain a low threshold for drainage when purulence is present, while still avoiding unnecessary systemic therapy in mild cases [^e0b5d14f]. In patients with diabetes or immunocompromise, I should have a lower threshold for oral antibiotics and closer follow-up due to higher risks of progression and atypical pathogens [^c6960d39]. For drug-induced paronychia, particularly with EGFR or MEK inhibitors, I should treat as a sterile inflammatory process with topical steroids and calcineurin inhibitors, consider anti-inflammatory-dose tetracyclines for refractory inflammation, and reserve procedures like partial matricectomy or silver nitrate for persistent granulation tissue; importantly, antifungals are not routinely indicated unless there is proven superinfection [^a16d2973] [^f60b3663] [^e88353cf]. I should also remember that amivantamab has a high incidence of paronychia and that proactive dermatologic regimens can reduce severity, which may influence counseling and follow-up intensity [^0a0693b6] [^1bfd8400].

> I will now examine emerging and adjunctive therapies with a cautious lens. Topical beta-blockers such as timolol have shown promise for periungual pyogenic granuloma–like lesions complicating paronychia, particularly in oncology patients, with retrospective series suggesting meaningful response rates and favorable safety, though randomized trials are lacking and use remains off-label [^1d009e1e] [^f137ca4f]. Pulsed dye laser has early prospective data showing reductions in erythema, edema, and pain in drug-induced paronychia, but I should confirm that this remains adjunctive and not a replacement for anti-inflammatory and surgical strategies when indicated [^2da71de8]. For retronychia, nail avulsion is the definitive therapy and should be considered early to prevent chronicity and complications, which I should not overlook in persistent great-toe paronychia [^c5499cd8] [^4fdf727a].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check each step. First, distinguish acute from chronic by duration and phenotype. Second, in acute disease, assess for abscess and drain if present. Third, provide warm soaks and consider topical antibiotic with or without topical steroid for inflammation. Fourth, reserve oral antibiotics for immunocompromise, severe infection, or spreading cellulitis. Fifth, in chronic disease, initiate potent topical anti-inflammatory therapy with strict irritant avoidance and barrier restoration. Sixth, escalate to surgical options after 3–6 months of optimized medical therapy if unresolved. Seventh, tailor management for special populations and drug-induced cases, integrating oncology input when anticancer therapy is involved [^c6960d39] [^aa299f39] [^a16d2973].

> Hold on, I should verify key pitfalls and follow-up needs. Missing herpetic whitlow and incising vesicular lesions, overusing oral antibiotics without drainage in acute abscess, and defaulting to antifungals in chronic disease are common errors. I need to ensure patient education on moisture control, trauma avoidance, and early presentation if symptoms recur, and arrange follow-up within 1–2 weeks to assess response and adherence, adjusting therapy accordingly [^8c530b5b] [^c6960d39] [^0cb651f8]. If new high-quality randomized data emerge, particularly for drug-induced paronychia or the role of lasers and topical beta-blockers, I should be ready to integrate those findings and update practice accordingly.

Paronychia is an **inflammation of the nail folds** [^c6960d39], classified as acute or chronic based on duration and etiology. Acute paronychia is typically a **bacterial infection** (often Staphylococcus aureus) [^880f5281] following trauma to the nail fold, presenting with rapid-onset pain, erythema, swelling, and sometimes purulence [^c6960d39]; management centers on warm soaks, topical antibiotics, and incision and drainage if an abscess is present, with oral antibiotics reserved for severe or immunocompromised cases [^c6960d39] [^02011f0f]. Chronic paronychia is a **multifactorial inflammatory dermatitis** [^c6960d39] from repeated moisture or irritant exposure, often with Candida colonization; treatment focuses on irritant avoidance, topical corticosteroids, and calcineurin inhibitors, with antifungals only if Candida is confirmed [^aa299f39] [^f545d856]. Drug-induced paronychia (e.g. EGFR/MEK inhibitors) requires anti-inflammatory therapy and oncology coordination; surgery is reserved for refractory cases [^a16d2973] [^e88353cf]. Recurrence is common without behavioral change, so patient education on hand care and irritant avoidance is essential [^0cb651f8].

---

## Classification and etiology

Paronychia is classified as **acute or chronic** based on duration, pathophysiology, and causative factors:

| **Type** | **Duration** | **Etiology** | **Common pathogens** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Acute | < 6 weeks | Infection of the nail fold, often after trauma or minor injury | - Staphylococcus aureus <br/> - Streptococcus species <br/> - Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^880f5281] |
| Chronic | > 6 weeks | Inflammatory dermatitis from repeated moisture or irritant exposure; often colonized by Candida | - Candida albicans <br/> - Environmental irritants (water, detergents, chemicals) [^c6960d39] |

---

## Clinical presentation

### Acute paronychia

- **Onset**: Rapid (hours to days)
- **Symptoms**: Pain, erythema, swelling, tenderness of the nail fold
- **Signs**: Fluctuance indicates abscess; purulent discharge may be present
- **Complications**: Felon, osteomyelitis, or systemic infection if untreated [^notfound]

---

### Chronic paronychia

- **Onset**: Gradual (weeks to months)
- **Symptoms**: Swollen, erythematous, tender nail folds; nail plate changes (ridging, discoloration, thickening)
- **Signs**: Loss of cuticle, retraction of proximal nail fold, onycholysis
- **Complications**: Permanent nail dystrophy, secondary bacterial infection [^c6960d39]

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, based on history and examination. Consider the following:

- **Culture**: Only if atypical presentation, immunocompromise, or treatment failure [^notfound]
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound to detect occult abscess or cellulitis when uncertain [^1eb4e818]
- **Differential**: Felon, herpetic whitlow, onychomycosis, ingrown nail, retronychia [^c5499cd8]

---

## Management

### Acute paronychia

#### Conservative management

Conservative care includes **warm soaks** (warm water or Burow's solution) for 10–15 minutes, 3–4 times daily [^c6960d39], and topical antibiotics such as mupirocin or fusidic acid applied twice daily [^notfound]. Add a topical corticosteroid to reduce inflammation when needed [^2c191a65].

---

#### Surgical management

Incision and drainage is indicated for **fluctuant abscess** [^c6960d39]; techniques include a simple incision, double-incision, or partial nail removal [^857fa284]. Oral antibiotics are reserved for severe infection, immunocompromise, or spreading cellulitis, with choices guided by local resistance and severity [^c6960d39].

---

### Chronic paronychia

#### Conservative management

- **Irritant avoidance**: Gloves, minimize water exposure, gentle skin care [^0cb651f8]
- **Topical corticosteroids**: High-potency agents (e.g. betamethasone) applied twice daily [^9ea14d67]
- **Calcineurin inhibitors**: Tacrolimus or pimecrolimus for steroid-sparing or intolerance [^f545d856]
- **Antifungals**: Only if Candida confirmed; topical nystatin or clotrimazole [^notfound]

---

#### Surgical management

Surgery is reserved for **refractory cases** after 3–6 months of medical therapy. Options include en bloc excision of the proximal nail fold, with or without nail avulsion, or the square flap technique for recalcitrant disease [^789140a0] [^2982e087].

---

## Special considerations

### Drug-induced paronychia

Drug-induced paronychia is commonly associated with **EGFR inhibitors** (erlotinib, gefitinib, osimertinib) and MEK inhibitors (trametinib, selumetinib) [^5cc0cd91]. Management is anti-inflammatory with topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors; consider oral tetracyclines for inflammation. Coordinate with oncology for dose modification or interruption when severe [^a16d2973] [^40a88d49].

---

### Pediatric paronychia

Pediatric paronychia often reflects **habit-related trauma** (finger sucking, nail biting) and mixed flora including anaerobes; management is similar, with emphasis on behavior modification and parental education [^e0b5d14f].

---

## Prevention and patient education

Prevention focuses on **hand hygiene**, moisture control, and trauma avoidance:

- **Hand care**: Moisturize after washing, avoid harsh chemicals, use protective gloves [^0cb651f8]
- **Nail care**: Keep nails short, avoid cuticle trimming, no biting or picking [^0cb651f8]
- **Occupational**: Identify and modify exposures (water, detergents, chemicals) [^304fec26]

---

## Prognosis

Acute paronychia generally resolves within 7–10 days with appropriate care, whereas chronic paronychia may persist for months and recur without behavioral change; **recurrence is common** without adherence to irritant avoidance and hand care [^6fded87e] [^c6960d39].

---

Paronychia is a common nail-fold disorder with distinct acute and chronic forms; **accurate classification and targeted therapy** — anti-inflammatory for chronic and drainage with selective antibiotics for acute — are key, and patient education on irritant avoidance is essential to prevent recurrence.

### Acute and chronic paronychia [^780062f2]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Paronychia is one of the most common infections of the hand. Clinically, paronychia presents as an acute or a chronic condition. It is a localized, superficial infection or abscess of the paronychial tissues of the hands or, less commonly, the feet. Any disruption of the seal between the proximal nail fold and the nail plate can cause acute infections of the eponychial space by providing a portal of entry for bacteria. Treatment options for acute paronychias include warm-water soaks, oral antibiotic therapy and surgical drainage. In cases of chronic paronychia, it is important that the patient avoid possible irritants. Treatment options include the use of topical antifungal agents and steroids, and surgical intervention. Patients with chronic paronychias that are unresponsive to therapy should be checked for unusual causes, such as malignancy.

### Acute and chronic paronychia of the hand [^f4a43a3e]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Acute and chronic infections and inflammation adjacent to the fingernail, or paronychia, are common. Paronychia typically develops following a breakdown in the barrier between the nail plate and the adjacent nail fold and is often caused by bacterial or fungal pathogens; however, noninfectious etiologies, such as chemical irritants, excessive moisture, systemic conditions, and medications, can cause nail changes. Abscesses associated with acute infections may spontaneously decompress or may require drainage and local wound care along with a short course of appropriate antibiotics. Chronic infections have a multifactorial etiology and can lead to nail changes, including thickening, ridging, and discoloration. Large, prospective studies are needed to identify the best treatment regimen for acute and chronic paronychia.

### Acute and chronic paronychia [^524d2665]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Paronychia is an inflammation of the folds of tissue surrounding the nail of a toe or finger. Paronychia may be classified as either acute or chronic. The main factor associated with the development of acute paronychia is direct or indirect trauma to the cuticle or nail fold. This enables pathogens to inoculate the nail, resulting in infection. Treatment options for acute paronychia include warm compresses; topical antibiotics, with or without corticosteroids; oral antibiotics; or surgical incision and drainage for more severe cases. Chronic paronychia is a multifactorial inflammatory reaction of the proximal nail fold to irritants and allergens. The patient should avoid exposure to contact irritants; treatment of underlying inflammation and infection is recommended, using a combination of a broad-spectrum topical antifungal agent and a corticosteroid. Application of emollient lotions may be beneficial. Topical steroid creams are more effective than systemic antifungals in the treatment of chronic paronychia. In recalcitrant chronic paronychia, en bloc excision of the proximal nail fold is an option. Alternatively, an eponychial marsupialization, with or without nail removal, may be performed.

### Effective treatments for paronychia caused by oncology pharmacotherapy [^906a465c]. The Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Cutaneous adverse events are relatively common in patients being treated with molecular-targeted drugs. Paronychia is one of the cutaneous adverse events that influences the patient's quality of life because of pain, and it often affects anticancer treatments in severe cases. However, there are few effective treatments, especially for severe paronychia. Here, we present our experiences of treatment for paronychia due to oncology pharmacotherapy. Although we treated paronychia with various methods, only corticosteroid ointment and phenol chemical matricectomy significantly improved the paronychia. Dermatologists must perform appropriate and effective treatments for paronychia in order to enable patients to continue anticancer drug treatment without impairing their quality of life.

### Treatment of retronychia: a systematic review and suggested treatment algorithm [^4fdf727a]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Retronychia is an inflammatory disorder typical of the great toes characterized by arrested nail growth, ingrowth of the nail plate into the proximal nail fold and paronychia. There is no standardized treatment for retronychia, and its management should be weighed based on the severity stage, treatment modality, and clinical outcome. In this paper, a systematic review of the literature was performed to assess all published data regarding the treatment of retronychia. A total of 231 patients from 24 studies were included in the analysis. Conservative management was adopted in mild-intermediate forms, consisting of medical (topical or intralesional high-potency corticosteroids) and podiatric treatment (taping, clipping back the onycholytic plate, orthosis), leading to a global cure rate of 41.2%, with no reported side effects. Non-conservative management, that is, chemical or surgical avulsion of the nail plate, proved resolutive in 71.2% of cases. Surgical avulsion of the nail plate produced the highest cure rate (78.2%), but was burdened by 9.6% of long-term sequelae, mainly nail dystrophies. A decision-making algorithm was designed to give clinicians treatment indications based on the severity stage of retronychia, treatment invasiveness, and possible clinical outcomes.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of EGFR inhibitor-associated dermatologic toxicities [^e84f30b9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRI) produce various dermatologic side effects in the majority of patients, and guidelines are crucial for the prevention and treatment of these untoward events. The purpose of this panel was to develop evidence-based recommendations for EGFRI-associated dermatologic toxicities.

Methods

A multinational, interdisciplinary panel of experts in supportive care in cancer reviewed pertinent studies using established criteria in order to develop first-generation recommendations for EGFRI-associated dermatologic toxicities.

Results

Prophylactic and reactive recommendations for papulopustular (acneiform) rash, hair changes, radiation dermatitis, pruritus, mucositis, xerosis/fissures, and paronychia are presented, as well as general dermatologic recommendations when possible.

Conclusion

Prevention and management of EGFRI-related dermatologic toxicities is critical to maintain patients' health-related quality of life and dose intensity of antineoplastic regimens. More rigorous investigation of these toxicities is warranted to improve preventive and treatment strategies.

### Acute and chronic paronychia [^c6960d39]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Paronychia is inflammation of the fingers or toes in one or more of the three nail folds. Acute paronychia is caused by polymicrobial infections after the protective nail barrier has been breached. Treatment consists of warm soaks with or without Burow solution or 1% acetic acid. Topical antibiotics should be used with or without topical steroids when simple soaks do not relieve the inflammation. The presence of an abscess should be determined, which mandates drainage. There are a variety of options for drainage, ranging from instrumentation with a hypodermic needle to a wide incision with a scalpel. Oral antibiotics are usually not needed if adequate drainage is achieved unless the patient is immunocompromised or a severe infection is present. Therapy is based on the most likely pathogens and local resistance patterns. Chronic paronychia is characterized by symptoms of at least six weeks' duration and represents an irritant dermatitis to the breached nail barrier. Common irritants include acids, alkalis, and other chemicals used by housekeepers, dishwashers, bartenders, florists, bakers, and swimmers. Treatment is aimed at stopping the source of irritation while treating the inflammation with topical steroids or calcineurin inhibitors. More aggressive techniques may be required to restore the protective nail barrier. Treatment may take weeks to months. Patient education is paramount to reduce the recurrence of acute and chronic paronychia.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of EGFR inhibitor-associated dermatologic toxicities [^13102c61]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Medium credibility.

EGFR inhibitor-associated paronychia and periungual lesions — patients receiving epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors are at risk for nail changes that typically develop after two or more months of chemotherapy exposure, most commonly nail fold inflammation (paronychia) and periungual pyogenic granuloma-like lesions, with possible resultant onycholysis or onychodystrophy. Paronychia is characterized by tender, edematous, often purulent inflammation of the nail folds, affecting fingernails and toenails with the first digits most commonly affected; precedent trauma is not believed to be causative but rather an aggravating factor, and morbidity is high with significant pain, functional limitation, and impairment of activities of daily living; periungual pyogenic granulomata are characterized by friable vascular tissue overgrowths on lateral nail folds.

### Acute and chronic paronychia [^304fec26]. American Family Physician (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding patient education for paronychia, more specifically with respect to irritant avoidance, AAFP 2017 guidelines recommend to advise patients with paronychia to avoid irritants.

### Chronic paronychia treatment: square flap technique [^2982e087]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic paronychia is an inflammatory process of the periungual folds that lasts longer than 6 weeks. It manifests as hypertrophy of the proximal and lateral nailfolds, absence of cuticle, progressive retraction of the proximal nailfold, and onychodystrophy. Surgical treatment is recommended if there has been insufficient response to 6 months of appropriate medical therapies.

Objective

We describe a new surgical technique that removes the fibrotic tissue without complete excision of the proximal and lateral nailfold, minimizing nailfold retraction and recovery time.

Methods

We present a case series of 34 fingers (9 patients) treated with this new technique.

Results

All nailfolds healed well without complications. At the end of the follow-up, all fingers, apart from 2, were relieved of the preoperative symptoms. The length of the ungual plate was maintained in all patients, with no retraction of the nailfolds.

Limitations

Follow-up period of 6 months and small sample size are limitations of this study.

Conclusion

This surgical technique can provide an alternative treatment for chronic paronychia, with good prognosis during follow up-period and optimal cosmetic results.

### Tips to treat the 5 most common nail disorders: brittle nails, onycholysis, paronychia, psoriasis, onychomycosis [^a072efb6]. Dermatologic Clinics (2015). Low credibility.

Nail disorders are difficult to treat and often frustrating both for patients and clinicians. Because of the slow growth rate of the nail plate and the difficulty of getting the drug actives to penetrate the nail tissues, it is usually necessary to wait several months before seeing the results of treatments. This delay often leads to discontinuation of therapy by the patients. This article therefore helps clinicians to find the right treatment of the 5 most common nail disorders (brittle nails, onycholysis, paronychia, psoriasis, and onychomycosis) and provides practical tips that might improve patients' compliance.

### Surgical intervention for paronychia induced by targeted anticancer therapies [^e88353cf]. Dermatologic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Paronychia is a common toxicity associated with targeted anticancer therapies. Antibiotics and steroids are the standard treatments for severe paronychia, yet they are often inadequate, prolonging the patient's suffering and resulting in changes to effective cancer therapy.

Objective

This article describes the clinical course of drug-induced paronychia and attempts to identify circumstances under which nail surgery may be beneficial.

Materials and Methods

This is a retrospective case series from a single institution's electronic medical record for patients on paronychia-inducing anticancer therapies with nail disease visit diagnosis codes.

Results

The authors identified 36 nail procedures performed on 12 patients, all of whom were managed with conservative steroid and antibiotic therapy with varying degrees of improvement; however, no further improvement was seen after 90 days. Partial matricectomy, nail avulsion, debridement/clipping, and incision and drainage were performed with resolution rates of 100% (11/11), 38.5% (5/13), 12.5% (1/8), and 0% (0/4), respectively. The average time to surgical intervention was 196 days, and the average time to resolution was 268 days.

Conclusion

This series highlights the prolonged course of severe drug-induced paronychia and the importance of surgical intervention to reduce pain and impact on cancer treatment. Partial matricectomy should be considered for paronychia unresponsive to conservative therapy by 3 months.

### Can paronychia cause a remote necrotizing soft tissue infection? [^eb3bee97]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Remote necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) resulting from paronychia is very unusual but potentially lethal. We report a case of a 39-year-old woman affected by this unusual infection. The paronychia completely resolved in less than 2 weeks, however, a NSTI involved the right chest and flank and the left thigh. The patient required intensive care and multiple surgical debridements. This recent experience and literature data suggest that paronychia can cause a remote NSTI that can rapidly spread and become life-threatening. Broad spectrum antibiotics and aggressive surgical debridement are essential to a successful outcome.

### Acute and chronic paronychia [^1eb4e818]. American Family Physician (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for paronychia, more specifically with respect to ultrasound, AAFP 2017 guidelines recommend to consider ultrasound in patients with paronychia to determine the presence of an abscess or cellulitis when it is not clinically evident.

### Management of finger felons and paronychia: a narrative review [^857fa284]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Finger felons and paronychias are common presentations to the emergency department with significant morbidity and long-term pain if not managed appropriately.

Objective

This narrative review provides a focused summary of the management of finger felons and paronychias for emergency clinicians.

Discussion

Finger felons consist of the accumulation of pus in the pulp space of the digit, which can lead to digital compartment syndrome if not adequately drained. Paronychias are an infection involving the proximal or lateral nail folds. Early felons and paronychia may be managed with antibiotics alone, whereas more advanced infections require incision and drainage. The preferred approaches for a felon drainage are a longitudinal incision in the volar space if superficial or lateral space if deep, with careful attention not to extend past the distal interphalangeal joint space. Extension to a hockey stick or fish mouth incision may be indicated in select cases. For paronychia, a simple incision approach is preferred for simple paronychia with abscess, while single or double incision technique along the nail is preferred for more complex cases.

Conclusion

It is essential for emergency physicians to be familiar with the management of finger felons and paronychias. We review the different approaches to management, with the goal of providing a resource for those interested in expanding their knowledge of felon and paronychia management.

### Are topical β-blockers really effective "in real life" for targeted therapy-induced paronychia [^1d009e1e]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Paronychia and periungual pyogenic granuloma represent one of the most common and bothersome dermatologic toxicities observed with ErbB inhibitors. There is no standardized treatment, and management remains challenging. Moreover, conservative management with noninvasive treatment should be promoted for fragile patients in a metastatic setting. Over the last few years, the efficacy of topical blocking agents has been considered for managing cutaneous or mucosal pyogenic granulomas. Very recently, the use of topical propranolol or of timolol has been reported in several patients undergoing treatment with EGFR inhibitors and developing pyogenic granulomas of the nail. We performed a retrospective single-center review of patients with targeted therapy-related paronychia/periungual pyogenic granulomas who had been treated with topical timolol, either alone or in combination with other topical treatments. Nearly two thirds of patients showed at least a partial response after 1 month of therapy, and the use of a topical beta-blocker in our population was associated with a favorable safety profile. Finally, topical timolol may represent a promising treatment option for the management of cancer patients suffering from painful periungual lesions. Comparative clinical trials, however, are still needed.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of EGFR inhibitor-associated dermatologic toxicities [^f60b3663]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Medium credibility.

EGFR inhibitor–associated paronychia — incidence and management: There are "no approved treatments for EGFRI-associated nail changes". Paronychia "is a sterile process, but it has the potential to become superinfected". In a retrospective study, "A retrospective study of 152 patients treated with cetuximab revealed 27 instances of paronychia (incidence of 17.7%)". Microbiologic evaluation reported, "A total of 42 culture swabs were performed in which all grew some organisms", with "coagulase-negative gram-positive bacteria (nosocomial colonization) was 31%, which was higher than the rate of S. aureus infection (23%)". Management aims to "minimiz[e] periunqual trauma, decreasing periunqual inflammation, preventing superinfection, and eliminating excessive granulation tissue", including that "Wearing comfortable shoes, trimming nails but avoiding aggressive manicuring, and wearing gloves while cleaning (e.g., household, dishes) are recommended to minimize periunqual trauma". Adjuncts include "Biotin has been found effective for the treatment of brittle nails in the general population", and therapies such as "Topical corticosteroid and anti-inflammatory dose tetracycline to decrease periunqual inflammation and antimicrobial soaks (e.g., dilute bleach in water; dilute white vinegar in water) to prevent superinfection are recommended", with procedures where needed: "Additionally, electrocautery, silver nitrate, and nail avulsion also are recommended to eliminate excessive granulation tissue".

### Acute and chronic paronychia [^0cb651f8]. American Family Physician (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for paronychia, more specifically with respect to prevention of recurrent paronychia, AAFP 2017 guidelines recommend to advise the following measures to prevent recurrent paronychia:

- apply moisturizing lotion after hand washing

- avoid chronic prolonged exposure to contact irritants and moisture (including detergent and soap)

- avoid nail trauma, biting, picking, and manipulation, and finger sucking

- avoid trimming cuticles or using cuticle removers

- improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus

- keep affected areas clean and dry

- keep nails short

- provide adequate patient education

- use rubber gloves, preferably with inner cotton glove or cotton liners when exposed to moisture and/or irritants.

### Mitigation and management of adverse events associated with amivantamab therapy [^0a0693b6]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Paronychia

Paronychia, an inflammatory process involving the soft tissues around the nail, was reported by 37%-68% of patients treated with amivantamab across pivotal trials; most reports were mild to moderate in severity, with the rate of grade ≥ 3 events ranging from 1%-11%. Paronychia was reported in 22%-35% of patients in osimertinib trials but was not reported as a common AE in trials of gefitinib, erlotinib, or afatinib. In the authors' experience, outside of clinical trials, paronychia is seen more frequently in patients on prolonged rather than shorter courses of EGFR inhibitors.

As with rash, paronychia generally occurs within the first 4 months of amivantamab treatment and decreases over time. In the MARIPOSA study, 50% of patients had their first occurrence of paronychia during the initial 4 months of treatment compared with 12% during months 5–8 and 3% during months 9–12.

Although not commonly severe, paronychia may be associated with complications, such as infections and bleeding at the nail beds, and chronic paronychia can be painful and debilitating, even at lower grade manifestations. In severe cases, periungual pyogenic granulomas can form around the nails. Painful cracks and skin fissures of the hands and feet have also been described. Other nail changes associated with EGFR inhibitors include mild onycholysis, brittle nails, and slower nail growth. Notably, MET inhibitor-associated peripheral edema can make the management of paronychia even more challenging; based on the authors' experience, patients with edema are at high risk of secondary infections in the setting of a chronic skin source of bacteria at the nail.

Other EGFR-related AEs

Other EGFR therapies are associated with AEs that have not been reported with amivantamab monotherapy, such as anemia, aminotransferase elevations, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia with gefitinib, and prolonged QT interval with osimertinib. When amivantamab is combined with additional drugs in combination regimens, other AEs, as discussed in the following section, may occur.

Dermatologic toxicities related to cancer therapies have become even more common with the use of targeted treatments. A proactive approach is necessary to reduce the pain and suffering these patients experience. The oncologist should become comfortable in preventing and managing these complications to keep patients on optimal drugs and doses. At the NCCN 20th Annual Conference, Dr. Mario E. Lacouture advised clinicians on appropriate strategies to manage rash, paronychia, alopecia, and other dermatologic conditions frequently seen in patients with cancer.

### Consensus recommendations on management of selumetinib-associated adverse events in pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and plexiform neurofibromas [^40a88d49]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

5. For CTCAE grade 3 paronychia, if multiple nails are affected, patients should seek consultation for expert podiatry or surgical management and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of selumetinib.

A few of the experts noted that some dermatologists may not be in favor of podiatry or surgical management and that topical or oral treatment may be sufficient for grade 3 (severe) paronychia. Dose reduction or discontinuation may also be considered if all treatment measures have been exhausted, or if symptoms of systemic infection appear (eg, fever, reduced general condition). Before restarting selumetinib, the panel recommends waiting at least 2 weeks and until the paronychia has healed.

Note that the selumetinib SmPC makes no specific recommendations on timelines for restarting the drug and such recommendations are based on the expert opinion of the panel.

6. In the event of pus being present at the affected paronychia site, systemic antibiotics (tailored to the bacteria identified from a swab of the affected site) should be used in combination with a topical or systemic corticosteroid; corticosteroids should only be used as a standalone treatment once infection has been ruled out after collection of a sample from the affected site.

If the responsible bacteria cannot be identified, Staphylococcus can be targeted as it is the most likely to be involved. Systemic steroids are rarely used and there is a strong preference for topical steroids.

7. To prevent further episodes of paronychia, the treating physician should consider referral to a specialist (eg, podiatrist, podologist, dermatologist, pediatric surgeon).

Referral to a specialist should be considered both to treat and prevent paronychia; however, this may be unnecessary for mild manifestations. Such referrals could be more strongly considered for prevention of paronychia if a patient has experienced previous episodes.

### Adjunctive pulsed dye laser therapy for paronychia induced by anticancer agents [^2da71de8]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Paronychia is a common side effect of anticancer therapies, particularly epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRIs). Standard treatments often provide limited relief. Pulsed dye laser (PDL) therapy at 595nm, with vascular-targeting and anti-inflammatory effects, may serve as an effective adjunctive treatment.

Objective

To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of adjunctive 595-nm PDL therapy in the treatment of paronychia induced by anticancer drugs, particularly EGFRIs.

Materials and Methods

This prospective pre-post study included 70 digits with anticancer drug-induced paronychia, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade 1–2, from ten patients. After a 2-week run-in with standardized treatment, participants received 4 weekly sessions of 595-nm PDL therapy. Outcomes-assessed at baseline, each visit, and 2 weeks posttreatment-included erythema index (EI), modified Severity of Paronychia Assessment Tool (SPOT) score, pain, edema, Physician Global Assessment (PGA), patient satisfaction, and adverse events.

Results

PDL therapy significantly reduced the EI from 1.63 to 1.42 (p < 0.001) and edema from 1.67 to 1.45 (p < 0.001). Modified SPOT scores improved from 3.61 to 1.99 (p < 0.001), with early pain relief observed (4.40–1.25; p < 0.001). PGA improved by Week 3, and patient satisfaction increased from 0 to 100 by Week 5 (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

PDL adjuvant therapy significantly improves both clinical signs and patient-reported outcomes in anticancer drug-induced paronychia.

### Efficacy and safety of tacrolimus ointment 0.1% vs. betamethasone 17-valerate 0.1% in the treatment of chronic paronychia: an unblinded randomized study [^f545d856]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies have established the pivotal role of irritants and allergens in development of chronic paronychia and the significant improvement with corticosteroid therapy.

Objectives

The objective of this randomized, unblinded, comparative study was to compare the efficacy of tacrolimus ointment 0.1% vs. betamethasone 17-valerate 0.1% in the treatment of chronic paronychia.

Methods

Forty-five patients with chronic paronychia were randomized 1:1:1 to apply twice daily either betamethasone 17-valerate 0.1% or tacrolimus 0.1% ointment or emollient. Protective measures were counselled to all patients. Treatment duration was 3 weeks and patients were followed for an additional 6 weeks.

Results

Eight patients in the betamethasone group were considered as cured, two as improved and four as nonresponders at the end of the treatment period. Thirteen patients in the tacrolimus group were considered as cured and one as improved at the end of the treatment period. Nine patients in the emollient group were considered as stable and six failed to respond. Both betamethasone and tacrolimus groups presented statistically significantly greater cure or improvement rates when compared with the emollient group (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Tacrolimus ointment appears to be a more efficacious agent than betamethasone 17-valerate or placebo for the treatment of chronic paronychia.

### INDIVIDUAL ARTICLE: NECOM 5: algorithm for the treatment and supportive management of targeted therapy-related cutaneous adverse events [^5a678dc5]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The cancer burden in the Nordic European countries remains substantial, but new treatment approaches, such as targeted therapy, have increased the survival of cancer patients. During and following cancer treatment regimens, however, patients' quality of life may be severely affected by sequelae, including cutaneous adverse events (cAEs). Overall, practical clinical tools for the management of cAEs in cancer patients and survivors have been lacking.

Methods

The Nordic European Cutaneous Oncodermatology Management (NECOM) project addresses cAEs in cancer patients, aiming to identify specific challenges and develop practical algorithms for their management. NECOM 1 and 2 provided an overview of cAEs and general recommendations for prevention and appropriate skin care regimens. NECOM 3 and 4 explored cAEs related to radiation therapy and immunotherapy, respectively. This NECOM 5 develops a practical algorithm for preventing and treating targeted therapy-related cAEs (TTcAEs).

Results

The NECOM panel discussed the findings of a systematic review of cAEs associated with targeted cancer therapy. The panel reached a consensus on a practical algorithm for TTcAEs, considering the current evidence, expert opinion, and clinical settings in the Nordic countries. The algorithm included general prevention and skin care recommendations, followed by specific advice for addressing the most common TTcAEs (papulopustular eruption, pruritus, hand-foot skin reaction, and paronychia).

Conclusions

Targeted therapy-related cAEs may negatively affect cancer patients and survivors. The NECOM panel provides a practical algorithm for preventing and managing TTcAEs to improve cancer patient outcomes and quality of life. J Drugs Dermatol. 2025;24:3(Suppl 2):s3-10.

### En bloc excision of proximal nail fold for treatment of chronic paronychia [^789140a0]. Dermatologic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic paronychia is a very recalcitrant dermatosis, which is particularly prevalent in housewives. Medical treatment for this condition is unsatisfactory in a significant number of cases. Surgical approach forms an important part of management, however, this area has received little attention. Various surgical approaches have been tried in the past but a comparative analysis has not been attempted.

Objectives

The present study aims at assessing the efficacy of en bloc excision of proximal nail fold (PNF). Moreover, a comparative analysis has been undertaken to assess whether or not simultaneous nail plate avulsion improves the treatment outcome.

Methods

Thirty patients of chronic paronychia with nail plate irregularities were randomly divided into two treatment groups (15 patients each). After a detailed evaluation, en bloc excision of PNF with or without nail plate removal was performed. Postoperative measures were advised and the patients were kept under regular follow-up thereafter. Assessment of postoperative complications was also performed.

Results

Twelve patients in group I and 13 patients in group II completed the treatment protocol. Of these, 70% of patients were cured in group II (en bloc excision with nail avulsion) whereas only 41% were cured in group I (en bloc excision without nail avulsion).

Conclusion

En bloc excision of the PNF is a useful method in recalcitrant chronic paronychia. Simultaneous avulsion of the nail plate improves the surgical outcome. Strict avoidance of irritant exposure is necessary to ensure complete treatment and prevent recurrence.

### Definition of acute paronychia-NCI dictionary… [^6fded87e]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

acute paronychia. An infection of the soft tissue around a fingernail or toenail that begins suddenly and can get worse quickly. It is usually caused when bacteria enter through a break in the skin from a hangnail or ingrown toenail, by damage to the cuticle, or by an injury to the area where the nail and skin meet. Acute paronychia may also sometimes be caused by treatment with certain drugs used to treat cancer or immune system disorders. Signs and symptoms include pain, tenderness, warmth, redness, and swelling around the nail. Pus may form in the skin around or under the nail. When treated, acute paronychia usually heals within 10 days.

### INDIVIDUAL ARTICLE: USCOM IV algorithm for the prevention and management of targeted therapy-related cutaneous adverse events [^99e2c994]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Targeted therapy has improved clinical outcomes for various types of cancer. However, their use is associated with dermatologic adverse events that impact quality of life and consistent therapies.

Objectives

The US Cutaneous Oncodermatology Management (USCOM) multidisciplinary-guided algorithm for preventing and managing cutaneous targeted therapy-related adverse events provides practical recommendations for cancer patients and survivors.

Methods

The USCOM advisory board (panel) identified 6 commonly occurring cutaneous adverse events associated with targeted therapies. Practical recommendations for prevention and management were developed based on the results of a literature search, clinical expertise, and opinion.

Results

Acneiform rash, pruritus, xerosis, paronychia, hyperpigmentation, and hand-foot skin reaction were selected as common targeted therapy-related cutaneous adverse events. The panel provides practical steps for preventing and treating these cutaneous conditions.

Conclusions

The USCOM multidisciplinary-guided algorithm is for healthcare providers treating oncology patients receiving targeted therapies. Cutaneous targeted therapy-related adverse events necessitate prompt and accurate diagnosis and multidisciplinary management that includes a dermatologist and the oncologic team, limiting disruption of cancer treatment and optimizing quality of life and treatment outcomes.

### Abstract… [^880f5281]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Paronychia is an inflammatory reaction involving the folds of tissue surrounding a fingernail or toenail. The condition is the result of infection and may be classified as acute or chronic. This article discusses the etiology, predisposing factors, clinical manifestation, diagnosis, and treatment of acute and chronic paronychia. Acute Paronychia ETIOLOGY AND PREDISPOSING FACTORS The most common cause of acute paronychia is direct or indirect trauma to the cuticle or nail fold. Such trauma may be relatively minor, resulting from ordinary events, such as dishwashing, an injury from a splinter or thorn, onychophagia, biting or picking at a hangnail, finger sucking, an ingrown nail, manicure procedures, artificial nail application, or other nail manipulation. 3–5 Such trauma enables bacterial inoculation of the nail and subsequent infection.

The most common causative pathogen is Staphylococcus aureus, although Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas pyocyanea, and Proteus vulgaris can also cause paronychia. 3, 6, 7 In patients with exposure to oral flora, other anaerobic gram-negative bacteria may also be involved. 10 The condition is characterized by rapid onset of erythema, edema, and discomfort or tenderness of the proximal and lateral nail folds, 11 usually two to five days after the trauma. Patients with paronychia may initially present with only superficial infection and accumulation of purulent material under the nail fold, as indicated by drainage of pus when the nail fold is compressed 12, 13. DIAGNOSIS Diagnosis of chronic paronychia is based on physical examination of the nail folds and a history of continuous immersion of hands in water. Pus may form below the nail fold. 8 One or several fingernails are usually affected, typically the thumb and second or third fingers of the dominant hand.

13 The nail plate becomes thickened and discolored, with pronounced transverse ridges such as Beau's lines, and nail loss 8, 10, 13. Chronic paronychia generally has been present for at least six weeks at the time of diagnosis. 10, 12 The condition usually has a prolonged course with recurrent, self-limited episodes of acute exacerbation. 13.

### A study on the efficacy of ω toenail correction treating paronychia [^fcc67243]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

To study the clinical effects of Ω toenail correction in the treatment of paronychia. One hundred thirty-six cases of 130 patients during the period from August 2018 to August 2021 were treated with Ω toenail correction according to clinical stages, the clinical therapeutic effects of which were evaluated in terms of the operation time, the time to resume movement, treatment cycle, 1-y recurrence rate, and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores before and after treatment. The clinical efficacy was analyzed and compared of Ω toenail correction in treating paronychia of different clinical stages. It has been demonstrated that there was no significant difference in operation time, time to resume movement, treatment cycle and recurrence rate among different stages of paronychia, while there existed the significant difference (p < .05) in VAS score of resting-state pain before and after correction which stood at 6.43 ± 0.29 points with the after-treatment VAS scores at 1.10 ± 0.22. There is a statistical difference (p < .05) in VAS score of movement-evoked pain between before and after treatment. The VAS scores of movement-evoked pain stood at 7.55 ± 0.42, which is in contrast with the after-treatment VAS at 1.74 ± 0.93. It has been concluded that Ω toenail correction characterized by easy operation can relieve the pain immediately, which can achieve satisfactory clinical efficacy for treating paronychia of different stages.

### Consensus recommendations on management of selumetinib-associated adverse events in pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and plexiform neurofibromas [^e410c9dd]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Dermatologic Adverse Events

Dermatologic AEs potentially associated with selumetinib treatment include acneiform and maculopapular rash, pruritis (itchy skin), dry skin, paronychia, and eczematous rash; the most commonly reported are dry skin and acneiform rash. The psychological burden of these AEs can be high, with the potential to negatively impact treatment compliance if the patient's caregiver and physician decide to discontinue treatment. The burden of these AEs may also affect a patient's ability to perform daily activities, potentially leading to feelings of worry, frustration, and depression. Paronychia, defined as inflammation of the nail fold, has been indicated as a reason for treatment discontinuation or interruption and may be associated with pain and functional impairment; therefore, management must be considered. Eczematous rash causes inflammation and irritation of the skin, and studies have indicated that its severity is related to QoL. Acneiform rashes are characterized by erythematous papular and pustular lesions. Facial rashes are often a cause for discontinuation in adolescent patients, resulting from the social burden of this AE. Panel recommendations on the management of these and other dermatologic AEs are provided here.

Paronychia

To prevent paronychia, patients should try to prevent potential traumas to the hands and feet (eg, avoiding tight shoes) and be advised on nail management (eg, not cutting the nails too short, avoiding cutting close to the nail fold).

Other nail management tips include avoidance of biting or chewing nails, picking cuticles, scratching, manicuring, and finger sucking. Antiseptics may be used before cutting nails and the use of soap substitutes can be considered.

2. For all grades of paronychia, the affected nail should be softened with an antiseptic bath twice daily using recently opened antiseptic agents.

Nails should be soaked for 5–20 min once or twice daily in lukewarm or warm water. In the literature, softening of nails using antiseptic baths is noted as often being sufficient for the treatment of paronychia without pus. After soaking, nails should be rinsed and thoroughly dried. Such treatment can continue until recovery, but if no improvement is observed after 1 week, therapeutic escalation can be considered.

Bacterial and viral infections of the nail unit are very common as primary infections, especially bacterial paronychia and warts, but they can also be superinfections complicating other nail disorders. In many nail unit infections, the clinical presentation is nonspecific: in these cases, diagnostic tests are mandatory before treatment, to avoid spread of the infection and drug resistance. The most common forms of bacterial and viral infections that may affect the nail unit are herein described in detail, with diagnostic and treatment options provided.

### Consensus recommendations on management of selumetinib-associated adverse events in pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and plexiform neurofibromas [^471d7173]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Although it is important to have recommendations on all AEs that can occur during selumetinib treatment, the panel agreed that particular focus should be given to AEs that, in their experience, have the highest frequency and/or patient impact. When discussing the prioritization of AEs, the panel experts agreed that physicians are typically concerned about high-impact AEs that may lead to discontinuation, whereas patients are likely most concerned about dermatologic AEs, which can affect their appearance and have a social impact. Therefore, it is important to consider these different perspectives when determining an approach to managing and preventing AEs. In the first part of this panel discussion, the experts agreed on the relative frequency and impact of AEs potentially associated with selumetinib. From this, consensus statements and expert recommendations were provided for priority AEs.

Dermatologic AEs with MEK inhibitors are well documented, and the panel agreed that, because of their frequency and impact on patients, these should be prioritized for selumetinib. The frequency of specific dermatologic AEs was noted to vary by age group, with acneiform rash more commonly seen in adolescents than young children. Of all dermatologic AEs, paronychia was seen as the most challenging to address, with the panel noting that it should be managed aggressively and be a key focus for healthcare practitioners. To prevent dermatologic AEs such as rashes or paronychia, patients should use emollients, practice sun safety, and prevent potential traumas to the hands or feet, for example by avoiding tight shoes. The psychological burden of AEs was also highlighted because it is high in most patients, can be worsened if there are underlying psychological issues, and has the potential to affect treatment compliance, especially in certain age groups.

### Topical steroids versus systemic antifungals in the treatment of chronic paronychia: an open, randomized double-blind and double dummy study [^9ea14d67]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The involvement of Candida in the pathogenesis of chronic paronychia (CP) has never been proven, even though this condition is commonly considered a type of Candida onychomycosis.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of systemic antifungals (itraconazole or terbinafine) with a topical corticosteroid (methylprednisolone aceponate) in the treatment of patients with CP.

Methods

The study involved 45 adult patients with CP. Medication was given in a randomized, double-blind and double dummy manner over 3 weeks. Patients were then followed for 6 weeks. Clinical and mycologic evaluations were performed at baseline, and at weeks 3 and 9. The efficacy measures included clinical and photographic evaluation.

Results

Of 48 nails treated with methylprednisolone aceponate, 41 were improved or cured at the end of the follow-up period. The statistical analysis showed a significant difference between the number of nails improved or cured by methylprednisolone aceponate and that of nails improved or cured with terbinafine (30 out of 57) or itraconazole (29 out of 64). Presence of Candida was not strictly linked to disease activity, and Candida eradication was associated with clinical cure in only 2 of the 18 patients who carried Candida at the beginning of the study.

Conclusion

This study shows that topical steroids are more effective than systemic antifungals in the treatment of CP, and supports the view that CP is not a type of onychomycosis but a variety of hand dermatitis caused by environmental exposure.

### Erlotinib-related skin toxicities: treatment strategies in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer [^589ebaf0]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Skin toxicities are the most common side effects associated with the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor erlotinib, occurring in most patients receiving the drug. Clinical trials evaluating erlotinib for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer have reported a range of skin disorders, the most common being acneiform rash, xeroderma (dry skin), pruritus, and paronychia. Although in the majority of cases these effects are mild and transient, they can have a considerable impact on a patient's quality of life and, if particularly severe and persistent, may necessitate treatment interruption or cessation and compromise treatment outcome. This coupled with recent evidence to suggest a positive correlation between the incidence and severity of rash and clinical outcome among erlotinib-treated patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer highlights the importance of adequately managing epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor — related skin disorders. Clear treatment strategies are therefore necessary to ensure the prevention and optimal management of erlotinib-related skin toxicities thereby enabling patients to continue erlotinib treatment. In this review we present a practical approach for the treatment of erlotinib-related cutaneous side effects in Japanese patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer providing details of specific treatment interventions, according to symptom severity, for each of the common skin disorders. In addition, the importance of preventive skin care measures — namely maintaining cleanliness, moisturization, and protection from external stimuli — in preventing the development of serious skin disorders is discussed and guidelines for the practice of proper skin care are presented.

MASCC Skin Toxicity Study Group — methods and evidence grading: The Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) Skin Toxicity Study Group assembled an international, interdisciplinary group and formed topic review committees to develop guidelines for papulopustular (acneiform) rash, hair changes, radiation dermatitis, pruritus, mucositis, xerosis/fissures, and paronychia. Each review committee consisted of three members with a primary reviewer, and publications of the English-language literature as of November 2010 were included with each committee reviewing between 17 and 35 papers. Randomized clinical trials were considered the best source, recommendations incorporated Level of Evidence and Grade of Recommendation, and in the absence of experimental evidence, pertinent studies and case reports were presented with expert opinion; recommendations were developed based on panel consensus, with extrapolation from similar dermatologic conditions when available. Levels of evidence were defined as follows: Level I evidence is reserved for meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials or randomized trials with high power. Level II evidence includes randomized trials with lower power. Level III evidence includes nonrandomized trials, such as cohort or case-controlled series. Level IV evidence includes descriptive and case studies. Level V evidence includes case reports and clinical examples.

### A comparative study on the efficacy between omega toenail correction and winograd procedure for stage II-III paronychia [^d0ccf53d]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The objective of this study is to conduct a prospective trial comparing the therapeutic efficacy of Omega toenail correction and the Winograd procedure in treating stage II-III paronychia. From August 2018 to August 2023, ninety cases from eighty-three patients were randomly divided into two groups, one receiving Omega toenail correction (experimental group) and the other receiving the Winograd procedure (control group). The clinical therapeutic effects of both treatments were evaluated based on time to resume movement, treatment cycle, one-year recurrence rate, and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores before and after treatment. The clinical efficacy was compared between Omega toenail correction and Winograd procedure treating paronychia of stage Ⅱ-Ⅲ. It has been demonstrated that the time to resume movement in the experimental group is obviously shorter than that in the control group (P = 0.024), while the treatment cycle is longer (P = 0.009) with no significant difference (P = 0.734) in the aspect of one-year recurrence rate. However, the VAS after the correction in the experimental group is significantly lower than that in the control group (P = 0.019). It has been suggested that Omega toenail correction characterized by easy operation, sure efficacy and lower recurrence rate can be widely applied in clinic work.

Nail Changes

Counseling and education on the potential for nail changes are essential before initiation of treatment with FGFR inhibitors. Preventive strategies include avoidance of prolonged contact with water, repeated trauma, friction, and pressure on nails and nail beds. The use of protective gloves and limiting use of nail polish removers and nail hardeners is also helpful. Patients are also advised to avoid biting nails or cutting nails too short and to use topical emollients and loose‐fitting socks and footwear. Preventive correction of nail curvature may be considered.

Paronychia

Recommended treatments for grade 1 paronychia include topical povidone iodine 2%–10% applied twice daily [58] or daily nail soaking in 1:1 vinegar:water for 15 minutes a day. Patients with grade 2 or 3 paronychia should be treated with a 14‐day course of oral antibiotics in addition to daily nail soaking in 1:1 vinegar:water; bacterial cultures should be obtained to confirm sensitivity to antimicrobial agents. Dermatology consultation is recommended for grade ≥ 2 paronychia, given the potential chronicity of this event.

Onycholysis

Recommended management options for onycholysis consist of trimming the raised distal nails, clipping of the nails, and application of topical povidone iodine 2%–10% b.i.d. solution [58] around and under the nails. Oral antibiotics should be started if infection is suspected (bacterial cultures and sensitivities should be obtained prior to initiating antibiotics), and nail avulsion may be needed if the patient has painful hematoma or subungual abscess.

Alopecia

Preventive measures normally considered for patients undergoing traditional chemotherapy regimens, for example, scalp compression, scalp cooling, and medications, are not applicable to patients receiving FGFR inhibitors, and the health care provider's attention should be focused on early identification and management of symptoms.

Management of alopecia consists of prophylactic or reactive topical minoxidil 5% applied once daily to the scalp to encourage hair regrowth, and a high‐potency topical corticosteroid (e.g. fluocinonide 0.05% solution). In addition, hair camouflaging methods, which create the appearance of naturally thicker, fuller hair, may be considered. Alopecia typically reverses when treatment is discontinued.

### Retronychia a little-known cause of paronychia: a report of two cases in adolescent patients [^caeb894b]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Retronychia is a clinical condition resulting from embedding of the nail plate into the proximal nail fold. We report two adolescent girls, 14 and 16 years of age, with a history of chronic proximal paronychia of the great toe, one of them developing osteomyelitis. After failure of treatment with several systemic antibiotics, nail avulsion was performed, leading us to the diagnosis of retronychia and with rapid and complete resolution of symptoms in both cases. Delay in diagnosis of retronychia can lead to local complications and prolonged discomfort.

### Neonatal acute paronychia [^e0b5d14f]. Hand (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Paronychia is defined as infection afflicting the eponychial nail folds of the hand or foot. Such infections are rarely reported in the perinatal age group, and not previously described in a neonate younger than 2 weeks. Trauma resulting in inoculation of the nail fold is the most common predisposing factor to paronychia. Oral trauma in the pediatric population from finger sucking predisposes this population to a different set of bacterial pathogens than adults. Contamination can progress to infection and abscess formation within the nail fold with the most prevalent vector in adult infections being Staphylococcus aureus. Comparatively, mixed anaerobic and aerobic infections tend to afflict children with oral soothing habits.

Methods

This is a case report will present the rare occurrence of a paronychia in a neonate caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Results

The management and treatment strategies for paronychia in this atypical neonatal patient consisted of incision and drainage and antibiotic therapy.

Conclusion

Neonates with oral self-soothing behaviors may be more at risk for developing paronychia of mixed anaerobic and aerobic infections. Initial therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics amoxicillin/clavulanate or clindamycin is suggested. Incision and drainage in the perinatal setting coupled with antibiotics is curative.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of EGFR inhibitor-associated dermatologic toxicities [^392eb09e]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Medium credibility.

EGFR inhibitor–associated dermatologic toxicities — background and burden: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors (EGFRI) are used for treating lung, pancreatic, breast, head and neck, and colorectal cancers, and may be used as first-line through third-line treatments alone or in combination. Common dermatologic side effects include papulopustular (acneiform) rash, hair changes, radiation dermatitis enhancement, pruritus, mucositis, xerosis/fissures, and paronychia, with incidences ranging from 36% for mucositis to 80% for papulopustular (acneiform) rash. In cancer patients receiving systemic therapy, itchy skin or rash increase the number of visits to the outpatient clinic by 36% and 72%, respectively, underscoring the need to maximize supportive measures.

### Nail toxicity associated with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor therapy [^4247f189]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

As the use of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors becomes more widespread, increasing data are being collected regarding both efficacy and toxicity. Cutaneous toxicities are emerging not only as the most relevant class-related events, but also as potentially important markers of response to therapy. Although a follicular eruption is the most frequent cutaneous manifestation of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition, ingrown nails, paronychia, and xerosis and desquamation of the digits, all of which occur in a substantial number of patients, require attention from treating oncologists and dermatologists. These nail disorders are mostly mild to moderate in severity, but, if not properly managed, can result in significant pain and interfere with activities of daily living. Descriptions of the nail and periungual toxicities associated with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor therapy and prevention and treatment strategies are presented.

Grading systems for skin rash

Accurate grading of papulopustular rash associated with anti-EGFR therapy is essential to ensure timely and appropriate interventions. Currently, the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) is a widely used classification system in clinical trials. The most recent version (version 4.03) of this tool was published in June 2010. For example, severe skin rash (grade 3) is defined by papules and/or pustules covering ≥ 30% of the body surface area, limited self-care activities of daily living, or associated local superinfection (oral antibiotics indicated). Grade 2 skin rash is described to be "associated with psychosocial impact", but a validated tool to assess the degree of psychosocial impact is not part of the CTCAE. In addition, the CTCAE scale does not separately characterize the specific dermatologic toxicities observed with EGFR inhibitor therapy (xerosis, pruritus, paronychia, hair abnormalities, and mucositis).

In addition to the CTCAE, several alternative EGFR inhibitor- focused grading systems for dAEs have been proposed in recent years. Although several scaling systems exist, no studies have investigated how much these tools are actually used. In particular, it is not known how often current diagnosis of dAEs systematically includes assessment of restrictions in daily and social activities, emotional stress, and the need for dermatologic treatment.

Prevention and treatment strategies

Much of the literature about EGFR inhibitor-induced skin toxicities contains prevention and treatment recommendations. Based on the recommendations of the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer Skin Toxicity Study Group, clear guidelines for prevention and treatment have been developed, e.g. for skin rash (prevention: hydrocortisone, minocycline; treatment: alclometasone, fluocinonide, clindamycin, doxycycline, minocycline, isotretinoin), radiation-induced dermatitis, pruritus, oral complications, xerosis and fissures, and paronychia. The clinical practice guidelines are summarized in detail elsewhere. However, no studies have investigated how often patients with cancer treated with EGFR inhibitors actually receive a preventive treatment, the criteria used to determine whether patients receive a preventive treatment, and how much dermatologists are involved in treatment recommendations.

### Topical brimonidine for pyogenic granuloma after paronychia surgery [^80bbc31d]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pyogenic granuloma (PG) is a benign vascular proliferation occurring on the skin or subcutaneous tissue and arises at the sites of trauma, infection, foreign body reactions, or delayed wound healing. Paronychia often appears in the hallux, where periungual PG is unpredictable. The current treatment options for PG consist of excision, cryotherapy, laser, electrocautery, and topical or oral medical therapy. Here, we present a case of topical brimonidine tartrate eye drop application for PG on the toe after a paronychia surgery.

### Proximal nail fold swelling, pain, and granulation tissue [^c5499cd8]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 28-year-old man presented with a 4-month history of left great toe pain, swelling, erythema, and drainage. The patient was previously treated with a topical antifungal, oral antibiotics, and hot water soaks without improvement of symptoms. The patient's toe upon presentation is depicted in Fig 1 and after gentle washing in Fig 2. The patient's nail plate is depicted in Fig 3.

Question 1. What is the diagnosis?

A. Acute paronychia
B. Onychomycosis
C. Retronychia
D. Squamous cell carcinoma
E. Ingrown nail

Answers

A. Acute paronychia – Incorrect. Acute paronychia is caused by a disruption in the seal of the nail fold and nail plate allowing often polymicrobial infections to develop in the local periungual soft tissues.
B. Onychomycosis – Incorrect. While onychomycosis can cause proximal onycholysis, it typically does not cause periungual inflammation and drainage.
C. Retronychia – Correct. The diagnosis of retronychia is made clinically. Criteria for diagnosis are chronic inflammation of the proximal nail fold, granulation tissue protruding from under the proximal nail fold, and thickened often doubled proximal nail plate. Retronychia occurs when the nail plate separates completely from the matrix and a new plate grows under the old plate. This pushes the nail plate upwards and causes inflammation to the proximal nail fold.
D. Squamous cell carcinoma – Incorrect. Although the presentation of squamous cell carcinoma varies, it typically appears as a periungual friable, verrucous mass with associated nail dystrophy.
E. Ingrown nail – Incorrect. Ingrown nails occur along the medial or lateral border of the nail fold. This patient's symptoms occurred at the proximal nail fold.

### Topical brimonidine for pyogenic granuloma after paronychia surgery [^1188a877]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Brimonidine, a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, is widely used for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The topical application of brimonidine gel may reduce facial erythema by inducing cutaneous vasoconstriction of rosacea. Brimonidine, with the characteristics of rapid metabolism and systemic clearance, has no significant affects on the heart rate and blood pressure. However, some medicines, such as tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, may influence brimonidine's metabolism.

The etiology of paronychia mainly includes an ingrown toenail, trauma, and infection. Surgery is an effective method to treat paronychia, but complications such as PG cannot be avoided, especially if postoperative infection occurs. PG is a disorder of benign vascular proliferation, with rapidly growing erythematous nodules developing into pedunculated tumors that may be subject to erosion and bleeding. The exact pathogenic mechanism is not fully clear and has been associated with trauma, infection, foreign body reactions, pregnancy, immunosuppression, several drugs, and delayed wound healing. The current available treatment options include topical or systemic pharmacotherapies, silver nitrate, surgical intervention, semi-invasive therapies, laser, and others. In terms of topical pharmacotherapies, beta blockers, such as timolol or propranolol, toll-like receptor 7 agonists, such as imiquimod, and other medicines are available. Overall, the relapse rate of PG is about 4.56%; surgical excision among the surgical management options is the most effective method, with a lower recurrence rate (2.94%) compared with nonsurgical treatments (3.67%), including cryotherapy, laser, liquid nitrogen refrigeration, and topical pharmacotherapies.

### Clinical and cytologic features of antibiotic-resistant acute paronychia [^3d9847bc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute paronychia usually is treated as a bacterial infection, but antibiotic-resistant acute paronychia may be caused by other infectious and noninfectious problems.

Objective

We sought to describe the clinical, etiologic, cytologic, and therapeutic features of antibiotic-resistant acute paronychia.

Methods

A retrospective review of medical records and cytology was performed in 58 patients (age, 1 month-91 years; 36 children and adolescents [62%] and 22 adults [38%]) who had antibiotic-resistant acute paronychias.

Results

Causes of paronychia included bacteria (25 patients [43%]), viruses (21 patients [36%]), fungi (5 patients [9%]), drugs (3 patients [5%]), pemphigus vulgaris (3 patients [5%]), and trauma (1 patient [2%]). Diagnostic cytologic findings were noted in 54 patients (93%); no diagnostic cytologic findings were present with drug-induced (3 patients) or traumatic (1 patient) paronychia. The most common predisposing factors were the habits of finger- or thumb-sucking (14 patients [24%]) and nail-biting (11 patients [19%]). Complications included id reaction with erythema multiforme in 3 patients (5%).

Limitations

Limitations include retrospective study design from 1 treatment center.

Conclusion

Antibiotic-resistant acute paronychia may be infectious or noninfectious. Cytologic examination with Tzanck smear may be useful diagnostically and may prevent unnecessary use of antibiotics and surgical drainage.

### Hand infections [^eca5e16e]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Hand infections are very common and must be properly diagnosed and treated to minimize the potentially devastating functional complications. Acute hand infections include felon, paronychia, deep-space infections, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and necrotizing fasciitis. Chronic infections are usually caused by atypical mycobacteria and fungi. There are several conditions that mimic acute hand infections, and it is important to recognize them so that the appropriate treatment can be instilled. To prevent all these complications and poor outcome, prompt diagnosis and early institution of appropriate surgical management and antibiotic treatment are crucial.

### Nail toxicities induced by systemic anticancer treatments [^5cc0cd91]. The Lancet: Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Patients treated with systemic anticancer drugs often show changes to their nails, which are usually well tolerated and disappear on cessation of treatment. However, some nail toxicities can cause pain and functional impairment and thus substantially affect a patient's quality of life, especially if they are given taxanes or EGFR inhibitors. These nail toxicities can affect both the nail plate and bed, and might present as melanonychia, leukonychia, onycholysis, onychomadesis, Beau's lines, or onychorrhexis, as frequently noted with conventional chemotherapies. Additionally, the periungual area (perionychium) of the nail might be affected by paronychia or pyogenic granuloma, especially in patients treated with drugs targeting EGFR or MEK. We review the nail changes induced by conventional chemotherapies and those associated with the use of targeted anticancer drugs and discuss preventive or curative options.

### Mitigation and management of adverse events associated with amivantamab therapy [^264ae3c8]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Amivantamab is a fully human bispecific epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-directed and mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET) receptor-directed antibody. Intravenous amivantamab is approved and recommended by treatment guidelines as a first-line treatment (1L) in combination with lazertinib, as a second-line treatment (2L) in combination with chemotherapy in adults with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations, and as 2L monotherapy or 1L in combination with chemotherapy in adults with advanced or metastatic NSCLC with exon 20 insertion-mutations. Compared with previous therapies, novel treatments such as amivantamab may be associated with distinct and unique adverse reactions that potentially require optimized prevention and management techniques. Commonly reported adverse reactions associated with amivantamab treatment regimens include cutaneous reactions associated with EGFR inhibition, such as rash, paronychia, and pruritus; those associated with MET inhibition, such as peripheral edema and hypoalbuminemia; and general effects, such as infusion-related reactions. Recommendations are summarized from published guidelines and the authors' clinical experience for the prevention and management of adverse reactions associated with amivantamab. An understanding of the expected adverse events with amivantamab regimens, along with the range of prophylactic and management options available, may facilitate maintenance of ongoing treatment in patients deriving clinical benefit and improve patient quality of life on therapy.

### Acute and chronic paronychia… [^a8f281e6]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Paronychia is defined as inflammation of the fingers or toes in one or more of the three nail folds. The condition can be acute or chronic, with chronic paronychia being present for longer than six weeks. Although both result from loss of the normal nail-protective architecture, their etiologies are different, thus their treatments differ. Infections are responsible for acute cases, whereas irritants cause most chronic cases. Anatomy The relevant anatomy includes the nail bed, nail plate, and perionychium 1. The nail bed is composed of a germinal matrix, which can be seen as the lunula, the crescent-shaped white area at the most proximal portion of the nail. The germinal matrix is responsible for new nail growth. The more distal portion of the nail bed is made by the flesh-colored sterile matrix, which is responsible for strengthening the nail plate. The perionychium comprises the three nail folds and the nearby nail bed.

The proximal nail fold is unique compared with the two lateral folds. The nail plate itself arises from a mild depression in the proximal nail fold. The nail divides the proximal nail fold into two parts, the dorsal roof and the ventral floor, both of which contain germinal matrices. The eponychium, an outgrowth of the proximal nail fold, forms a watertight barrier between the nail plate and the skin, protecting the underlying skin from pathogens and irritants. 2 Acute Paronychia DIAGNOSIS Acute paronychia is the result of a disruption of the protective barrier of the nail folds. Once this barrier is breached, various pathogens can create inflammation and infection. Other diagnostic tools such as radiography or laboratory tests are needed only if the clinical presentation is atypical. The differential diagnosis of acute paronychia includes a felon, which is an infection in the finger pad or pulp.

1, 2 Although acute paronychia can lead to felons, they are differentiated by the site of the infection. TREATMENT Treatment of acute paronychia is based on the severity of inflammation and the presence of an abscess. If only mild inflammation is present and there is no overt cellulitis, treatment consists of warm soaks, topical antibiotics with or without topical steroids, or a combination of topical therapies. Warm soaks have been advocated to assist with spontaneous drainage.

### Topical brimonidine for pyogenic granuloma after paronychia surgery [^7b8be841]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 17-year-old boy presented with suppuration of the first toe of both feet and excruciating pain (Fig 1, A). We performed surgical treatment of a partial nail avulsion and lateral nail fold excision as the clinical manifestations were consistent with those of paronychia of the nail embedment (Fig 1, B); the lateral horns of the nail matrix were also excised.

Fig 1
Treatment of PG in the toe with topical brimonidine after a paronychia surgery. A, Initial stage of severe paronychia prior to the surgery. B, Photograph at the postoperative stage. C, Gradual formation of PG within 22 days after the surgery. D, Postmedical outcome after 15 days of the treatment with topical brimonidine. PG, Pyogenic granuloma.

On the 7th day after the surgery, the operation site of the first toe of the left foot developed pain and slight pyosis. The suture was removed on the 14th day as planned, but erythematous nodules and an erosive surface gradually appeared in the next following 8 days, consistent with the lesions of PG (Fig 1, C).

Due to the fear of pain during local anesthesia and post the surgery and risk of recurrence, he refused all invasive treatments. Considering the infected condition of this therefore we treated him using a conservative approach. He was treated with wet compression of 0.2% topical brimonidine tartrate eye drops twice daily after the lesion was disinfected with povidone iodine. After several days of the 0.2% topical brimonidine tartrate eye drop treatment, the pain was significantly relieved, with visible improvement. Fifteen days after the effective treatment, the skin lesions of PG improved (Fig 1, D), with no perceived side effects, such as drowsiness, hypotension, or bradycardia.

### Causes and management of acute oncological pain: a narrative review [^3f51347d]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment‐related pain: chemotherapy

Systemic anticancer treatment, namely chemotherapy, is classically associated with chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy, a chronic, cumulative sensory neuropathy which develops over the course of chemotherapy. Some chemotherapy drugs can be associated with more acute pain. Oxaliplatin, a platinum analogue used widely in gastrointestinal cancers, is associated with an unpleasant acute cold‐sensitive neuropathy affecting the hands, feet and oropharynx in 80–90% of patients. This can arise within hours of receiving oxaliplatin and may last up to 72 h. The underlying mechanism is thought to relate to oxaliplatin modulating the transcription of distinct ion channels that shape sensory neuronal cold responses. The presence of this phenomenon is a marker for the development of more severe longer‐term chemotherapy‐induced peripheral neuropathy.

Due to the rapid turnover of the cells of the nail matrix, toe and fingernails are particularly vulnerable to damage from chemotherapy. Certain nail toxicities may be acutely painful. Onycholysis, the separation of the nail plate from the nail bed, is associated with taxane‐based chemotherapy and, when haemorrhagic, can cause severe pain. Other painful nail toxicities include subungual haematomas and paronychia. Specialist dermatological input to assist with the management of patients presenting with painful nail toxicity is advised.

### Topical β-blockers in dermatologic therapy [^f137ca4f]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

An increasing use of beta‐blockers in dermatology has been described over the last 10 years, despite the fact that their use in diseases other than infantile hemangiomas is off‐label. This review discusses the emerging role of topical beta‐blockers in the treatment of infantile hemangioma, but also pyogenic granuloma, Kaposi sarcoma, wounds and nail paronychia. Data in literature demonstrate that topical beta‐blockers are a safe and valid therapeutic option in numerous cutaneous diseases. Side effects are mainly restricted to the application site. Further studies and randomized trials may contribute to reinforce the role of topical beta‐blockers in the dermatological armamentarium.

Nail Toxicities

Nail Toxicities of Targeted Therapies

Targeted therapies may cause damage to nail folds, with paronychia and periungual pyogenic granuloma distinct from chemotherapy-induced lesions (Fig. 4 a, b) that are mostly observed in the nail plate or the nail matrix. As some patients may receive both treatment types combined, clinicians must be fully informed of differences between chemotherapy and targeted therapy-associated nail toxicities. Paronychia and periungual granulomas are mostly reported in response to EGFRIs, with a 17.2% all-grade toxicity incidence, as well as MEKIs and mTOR inhibitors to a lesser extent. Typical lesions, which mostly affect toenails or thumbs, develop slowly after several weeks or months of treatment. Damage typically starts with the development of periungual inflammatory paronychia and can evolve into overgrowing of friable granulation tissue on lateral and/or proximal nail folds, mimicking ingrown nails. Although usually not severe, such lesions can still be very debilitating for the patient, especially when they persist for a long time. Therefore, aggressive strategies must be implemented to help patients cope with these adverse effects. The standard of care for pyogenic granuloma is surgery with partial removal of the nail plate and matrix and physical destruction of the granulation tissue and phenolization. In patients with multiple concomitant lesions, conservative treatment should be prioritized, with supportive oncodermatology while maintaining targeted therapy. In close collaboration with a podiatrist, nail curvature can be corrected if needed. Stretchable tape, liquid nitrogen, a combination of topical corticosteroids and antibiotics, antiseptic soaks, and silver nitrate can also be used. Topical timolol can also be helpful for periungual pyogenic granuloma.

### Guideline for care of patients with the diagnoses of craniosynostosis: working group on craniosynostosis [^820ba5ef]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Crouzon/Pfeiffer Syndrome

Before the discovery of the FGFR2 mutation that causes both Crouzon and Pfeiffer syndromes, the distinction between these 2 clinical diagnoses was based on the deformities of the extremities. In most patients of hand and foot deformities, the diagnosis was Pfeiffer syndrome. Because a number of identical FGFR2 mutations are reported in patients who were clinically diagnosed with either Crouzon or Pfeiffer syndrome, the distinction between these 2 syndromes seems to be of less relevance.

Cohen describes Pfeiffer syndrome, in which the deformities of the extremities consist of broad thumbs and halluces with radial or medial deformities, brachydactyly, and a varying degree of syndactyly. Progressive ankylosis of the elbows is possible.

Anderson describes mild radiologic deformities of the feet, such as deformities in shape, fusion or underdevelopment of the phalanges, metatarsalia, and tarsalia. Only 3 of the 18 patients had no deformities.

The FGFR1 P25R mutation shows characteristic hand and foot deformities with partial webbing of the fingers with broad thumbs and big toes, deviating toward medial, and characteristic syndactyly of the second web and sometimes of the third web. The patients of the reported 3 families had, however, minimal or no craniosynostosis. Some patients had ankylosis of the elbow.

Therapy: surgical corrections of the hands are necessary in only very few patients.

Conclusions

Considerations

Patients with (still) unoperated hands frequently show paronychia. Hardly anything about this condition, however, is reported in the medical literature. These infections cause a lot of discomfort for the patient and require intensive care. Early treatment of the complex syndactyly improves this situation. Therefore, either prevention or treatment of paronychia is an additional reason to commence with early treatment of the hand deformity.

Recommendations

The functions of the upper and lower extremities of Apert patients need to be monitored during time with physical examinations and radiography. Treatment of the hands should commence at the earliest age possible, especially for type 3, and preferably performed simultaneously for both hands by a pediatric surgeon.

Monitoring of the lower extremities is performed by a pediatric orthopedic surgeon/pediatric rehabilitation physician/pediatric plastic surgeon.

3. Infection should be managed with an antiseptic with or without a topical antibiotic, according to local practice.

The dosage and duration of treatment depend on the specific topical antibiotic used. In general, the use of a topical antibiotic 2–3 times daily is recommended, although this may depend on severity and tolerance. Topical antibiotics may only be used for mild infections and there is some disagreement on the use of occlusion with the topical antibiotic. If possible, the choice of topical antibiotic should be tailored to the bacteria identified from a swab of the affected site. A combined preparation of a steroid and topical antibiotic could be considered to manage the chronic inflammatory reaction seen with MEK inhibition. If there is evidence of a fungal infection, a topical antifungal could be used in combination with a topical antibiotic. When selecting a systemic antifungal, fluconazole (a strong cytochrome P450 2 C19 [CYP2C19]/moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) or itraconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) should be avoided due to their potential to increase the maximum plasma concentration of selumetinib.

4. For CTCAE grade 2 paronychia, patients should use a high-potency steroid (topical) once infection is ruled out after collection of a sample from the affected site. A systemic antibiotic is recommended in case of infection. If such management is not successful, dose reduction then discontinuation of selumetinib should be considered.

If just 1 finger or toe is involved, this may not warrant the use of systemic antibiotics, and treatment should be left to the physician's best practices and judgment. Occlusive bandages could be used alongside topical steroids; for this, fludroxycortide tape for chronic non-infected paronychia was recommended, as it provides the dual effect of topical steroid application and absorption and occlusion. The specific choice of antibiotic should be guided by swab results, if available.

Future preventive strategies

With the aim of preventing dermatologic AEs during amivantamab treatment, the phase 2 COCOON study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT06120140) is evaluating enhanced preventive dermatologic management in patients treated with first-line amivantamab and lazertinib. The COCOON dermatologic management regimen consists of oral doxycycline or minocycline for 12 weeks followed by topical clindamycin lotion on the scalp, chlorhexidine on the nails, and a ceramide-based moisturizer on the body and face. The first interim analysis showed that during the first 12 weeks of amivantamab plus lazertinib treatment, the incidence of grade 2 or higher dermatologic AEs was 38.6% in patients who were randomized to receive the COCOON prophylactic regimen compared with 76.5% in patients who received standard-of-care dermatologic management (OR, 0.19; 95% CI: 0.09–0.40; P < .0001). Substantial reductions in dermatologic AEs were observed on different body locations, including a 65% reduction in face/body dermatologic AEs (23% vs 62%), a 70% reduction in scalp AEs (9% vs 29%), and a 25% reduction in paronychia (16% vs 21%).

Acneiform Rash

13. For mild acneiform rashes, patients should use a topical antibiotic and/or low-potency topical corticosteroid.

Overall, topical antibiotics are typically the first choice of treatment. Topical corticosteroids are then added only if notable inflammation is present with no sign of infection. Swabs should be considered to guide therapy if appropriate.

14. For patients with severe acneiform rashes, physicians should consider using semisynthetic oral tetracyclines. If the patient is aged < 8 years, the use of topical antibiotics is preferred.

Oral antibiotics can be considered in more severe cases. Empirical treatment in line with acne management guidelines is recommended, unless bacterial swab sensitivities are available to guide treatment choice. Oral tetracyclines should be used for 2–6 weeks, as long as the patient is symptomatic. Minocycline is sometimes used; however, it is not recommended due to its associated AE profile. Systemic doxycycline treatment has been used to successfully treat a case of iatrogenic MEK1/2 inhibitor-induced acneiform rash following a slight worsening of the skin lesions after initial treatment with topical erythromycin cream and fusidic acid plus betamethasone cream. Resolution of a case of recalcitrant selumetinib-induced paronychia with doxycycline following treatment with various antibiotics, topical medications, and surgeries that were only deemed to be minimally effective, has also been reported for a 12-year-old patient with NF1. Therefore, doxycycline may be an acceptable therapeutic agent for patients aged ≥ 8 years with dermatologic AEs that have otherwise been difficult to treat.

Nail Changes.

When monitoring for paronychia or fissures, it is important to begin careful inspections of the hands and feet early during treatment and to continue these inspections at every clinic visit. If nail abnormalities are identified, the treatments described included antibacterial emollient applied regularly, corticosteroid ointments, or a white vinegar in water solution (1 part vinegar, 1 part water). Other suggested treatments for paronychia include the use of gentamycin ointment for 4 to 5 weeks, bathing the hands and/or feet in a diluted chloramine bath, and wearing loose-fitting shoes to avoid pressure to the nail beds. Preemptive daily treatment with corticosteroids was shown to reduce the incidence of paronychia in both the J-STEPP and STEPP studies.

Hair Abnormalities.

For the treatment of trichomegaly, the reported data suggest trimming eyelashes that are long or curled (usually by an ophthalmologist) and removing eyelashes that have misdirected growth (again, usually by an ophthalmologist). For other hair and scalp problems, emollients, such as those used for skin rash, and erythromycin ophthalmic ointments can be used. Patients who experience an acneiform eruption on the scalp can be treated with an oil bath and topical steroid therapy. If the eruption is infected, an oil bath, followed by treatment with oral antibiotics, has been recommended; topical antibiotics, such as neomycin and bacitracin, are not effective in the treatment of scalp infections. Hair stickiness can also be treated with an oil bath or using mild shampoos.

### Erosive pustular dermatosis-like eruption of the scalp secondary to amivantamab: a case series [^134615e1]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Amivantamab is a bispecific monoclonal antibody targeting EGFR and mesenchymal-epithelial transition approved in 2021 for treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non–small cell lung cancer. Although the cytostatic mechanism of action of targeted therapy is believed to cause fewer adverse events compared with traditional chemotherapy, they are associated with a wide range of cutaneous toxicities that can be debilitating and cause interruption or cessation of anticancer treatment.EGFR inhibitors are widely implicated in cutaneous toxicities because of the integral role of EGFR in cellular signaling pathways in the skin. Initial reports from the phase I study evaluating amivantamab in patients with non–small cell lung cancer identified rashes and paronychia as 2 of the most common treatment-related adverse effects. In > 50% of cases, an acneiform rash was reported mainly on the sebaceous areas in the scalp, face, and upper portion of the trunk. Nail changes, such as paronychia, are another highly reported adverse reaction, hypothesized to be due to EGFR inhibition on keratinocytes in the nail matrix.

### Amivantamab, the first epidermal growth factor receptor and mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor inhibitor, associated with penile and inguinal ulcers and paronychia [^a88e963c]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The EGFR protein is essential to maintain epidermal homeostasis. When its function is disrupted, it can adversely affect the skin. PRIDE complex refers to the classic cutaneous side effects observed with EGFR inhibitors, including papulopustular rash, paronychia, hair growth abnormalities, itching, and dryness. Amivantamab is the first EGFR and MET inhibitor target therapy for locally advanced or metastatic non–small cell lung cancer with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. In the CHRYSALIS phase 1 clinical trial, cutaneous lesions were the most common adverse reaction. Skin lesions were consistent with those seen with other EGFR inhibitors, including acneiform eruptions, paronychia, and stomatitis.

Conversely, the toxicity profile associated with MET inhibition is unrelated to the skin, including lower extremity edema, gastrointestinal distress, fatigue, and transaminitis, none of which were observed in our patient.

The abrupt onset of lesions and temporal resolution following drug initiation and withdrawal, and concomitant paronychia and dryness commonly observed with EGFR inhibitors, support the diagnosis of EGFR inhibitor cutaneous toxicity. The EGFR is present in basal epidermal keratinocytes, and studies have shown that inhibition of this receptor induces cell cycle growth arrest and terminal differentiation. Skin changes such as epidermal atrophy, hyperplasia, and abnormal differentiation observed in various skin diseases may be mediated through disruption of the EGFR signaling cascade. Histologic changes during therapy include thinning of the corneal layer and granular layer, vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer, and apoptotic keratinocytes. These molecular and histologic changes may result in skin necrosis and ulceration, as seen in our patient.

Although the patient did not exhibit all of the adverse events enclosed within the PRIDE complex, he experienced 3, including dry mouth, cracked lips, and paronychia. To our knowledge, a single case of skin ulcers appearing after initiating an EGFR inhibitor has been reported. The patient developed an ulcer on the palm of the hand 2 weeks after initiating therapy with gefitinib, another commonly used EGFR inhibitor for lung cancer. Therapy was interrupted for 2 weeks, and the patient was treated with topical steroids and antibiotics, with resolution of the ulcer. Our patient responded inadequately to topical steroids while on treatment with amivantamab. However, after discontinuing amivantamab, the lesions responded positively with re-epithelialization.

### Common acute hand infections [^93036cd9]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Hand infections can result in significant morbidity if not appropriately diagnosed and treated. Host factors, location, and circumstances of the infection are important guides to initial treatment strategies. Many hand infections improve with early splinting, elevation, appropriate antibiotics and, if an abscess is present, incision and drainage. Tetanus prophylaxis is indicated in patients who have at-risk infections. Paronychia, an infection of the epidermis bordering the nail, commonly is precipitated by localized trauma. Treatment consists of incision and drainage, warm-water soaks and, sometimes, oral antibiotics. A felon is an abscess of the distal pulp of the fingertip. An early felon may be amenable to elevation, oral antibiotics, and warm water or saline soaks. A more advanced felon requires incision and drainage. Herpetic whitlow is a painful infection caused by the herpes simplex virus. Early treatment with oral antiviral agents may hasten healing. Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis and clenched-fist injuries are more serious infections that often require surgical intervention. Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis is an acute synovial space infection involving a flexor tendon sheath. Treatment consists of parenteral antibiotics and sheath irrigation. A clenched-fist injury usually is the result of an altercation and often involves injury to the extensor tendon, joint capsule, and bone. Wound exploration, copious irrigation, and appropriate antibiotics can prevent undesired outcomes.

### Amivantamab, the first epidermal growth factor receptor and mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor inhibitor, associated with penile and inguinal ulcers and paronychia [^1fd84773]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

After a literature review, apart from clinical trials, a single case of amivantamab-induced adverse cutaneous reactions was found. A 53-year-old man developed facial, scalp, buttocks, and lower limb lesions after 3 weeks of treatment. Notably, the patient developed erosive erythema in the perianal region, erythematous papules on the scrotum, and paronychia-like changes, similar to our patient. Therapy was continued with lesions recurring following each infusion. However, lesions improved with kangfuxin liquid, compound polymyxin B ointment, and recombinant human epidermal growth factor gel.

The differential diagnosis of genital ulcers in an immunocompromised patient includes chancroid, syphilis, cytomegalovirus, Behçet disease, lymphogranuloma venereum, and herpes simplex virus. The absence of viral cytopathic changes on histology makes a viral infection less likely. However, given the unavailability of polymerase chain reaction results in our case, the possibility of herpes zoster virus cannot be entirely excluded. Negative infectious workup, nonspecific histologic findings, unresponsiveness to azithromycin, presence of paronychia, dryness, and temporal relationship with drug ingestion support the diagnosis of EGFR-inhibitor cutaneous toxicity. Among other differential diagnoses, the possibility of monkeypox in immunocompromised patients presenting with genital ulcers cannot be overlooked, which has resurged in the past year and a half.

Herein, we present a case of penile and inguinal ulcers and paronychia following amivantamab administration. Although rare, health care providers should be aware of genital ulcers as a potential cutaneous side effect associated with amivantamab and possibly other EGFR and MET targeting therapies and consider prompt interruption of therapy, if feasible.

Figure 2
Schema for management of skin toxicity associated with MEK inhibitors.

Evidence‐based approaches for treating dermatologic toxicities specifically in individuals treated with MEK inhibitors are lacking. The following recommendations are based on expert opinion for the treatment of comparable skin conditions unless otherwise specified and are outlined in Figure 2.

Management of dermatologic toxicities should include both preventive measures and symptomatic treatments 37. Education regarding preventive management should commence with the initiation of MEK therapy for all patients in order to maintain skin moisture and minimize the risk of infection. Daily baths (not showers) using mild cleansers and a high‐quality skin moisturizer applied over the entire body twice a day and within 5 minutes after taking a bath is recommended. Bleach baths 3–4 times per week may reduce the risk of infection and ameliorate inflammation and pruritus 38. For a bleach bath, one‐quarter to one‐half cup of bleach is added to a full bathtub, or 1 tsp per gallon, and the patient soaks for 5–10 minutes, followed by a rinse with water and application of an emollient diffusely on the skin. Hair should be washed daily, and a selenium‐based shampoo can be used for a dry or itchy scalp. Products with added fragrance such as soaps, laundry detergent, and scented creams should be avoided. Ultraviolet light can trigger acneiform rash and skin inflammation in patients on MEK inhibitors. All patients should be advised to practice good sun safety including the use of cover‐ups, such as a wide‐brimmed hat and lightweight clothing that covers the skin. Sunscreen that contains zinc oxide or titanium dioxide should also be applied every 2–3 hours when outdoors and applied to the face daily even when not planning to be outdoors.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Infusion-Related Reactions

Advise patients that RYBREVANT can cause infusion-related reactions (IRR), including anaphylaxis. Instruct patients to take glucocorticoids 48 hours prior to the first RYBREVANT infusion to reduce the risk of IRR [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. The majority of infusion-related reactions occurred with the first infusion. Advise patients to alert their healthcare provider immediately for any signs or symptoms of infusion-related reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis

Advise patients of the risks of interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis. Advise patients to immediately contact their healthcare provider for new or worsening respiratory symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Venous Thromboembolic Events with Concomitant Use with Lazertinib

When RYBREVANT is used in combination with lazertinib, advise patients of the risks of serious and life threatening venous thromboembolic (VTE) events, including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Advise patients that prophylactic anticoagulants are recommended to be used for the first four months of treatment. Advise patients to immediately contact their healthcare provider for signs and symptoms of venous thromboembolism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Dermatologic Adverse Reactions

Advise patients of the risk of dermatologic adverse reactions. Advise patients to apply alcohol-free (e.g., isopropanol-free, ethanol-free) emollient cream to reduce the risk of skin reactions. Consider prophylactic measures (e.g., use of oral antibiotics) to reduce the risk of dermatologic adverse reactions. Advise patients to limit direct sun exposure during and for 2 months after treatment, to use broad-spectrum UVA/UVB sunscreen, and to wear protective clothing during treatment with RYBREVANT [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Ocular Toxicity

Advise patients of the risk of ocular toxicity. Advise patients to contact their ophthalmologist if they develop eye symptoms and advise discontinuation of contact lenses until symptoms are evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Paronychia/Nail Toxicity

Advise patients of the risk of paronychia. Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider for signs or symptoms of paronychia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Chronic paronychia… [^d9cd72f1]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Paronychia is one of the most common infections of the hand. Paronychias are localized, superficial infections or abscesses of the perionychium. Paronychial infections develop when a disruption occurs between the seal of the proximal nail fold and the nail plate that allows a portal of entry for invading organisms. Noninfectious causes of paronychia include contact irritants and excessive moisture. Clinically, paronychia presents as an acute or chronic condition. People with occupations such as baker, bartender and dishwasher seem predisposed to developing chronic paronychia. Treatment may consist of warm-water soaks, antimicrobial therapy or surgical intervention. Acute Paronychia Acute paronychia most commonly results from nail biting, finger sucking, aggressive manicuring, a hang nail or penetrating trauma, with or without retained foreign body.
3.

Sculptured fingernail placement has also been shown to be associated with the development of paronychia. 4 The most common infecting organism is Staphylococcus aureus, followed by streptococci and pseudomonas organisms. Gram-negative organisms, herpes simplex virus, dermatophytes and yeasts have also been reported as causative agents. Children are prone to acute paronychia through direct inoculation of fingers with flora from the mouth secondary to finger sucking and nail biting. This scenario is similar to the acquisition of infectious organisms following human bites or clenched-fist injuries.
5. CLINICAL PRESENTATION Patients with acute paronychia may report localized pain and tenderness of the perionychium. Symptoms may arise spontaneously, or following trauma or manipulation of the nail bed. The perionychial area usually appears erythematous and inflamed, and the nail may appear discolored and even distorted.

If left untreated, a collection of pus may develop as an abscess around the perionychium. Fluctuance and local purulence at the nail margin may occur, and infection may extend beneath the nail margin to involve the nail bed. Such an accumulation of pus can produce elevation of the nail plate. TREATMENT Conservative treatment, such as warm-water soaks three to four times a day, may be effective early in the course if an abscess has not formed. CLINICAL PRESENTATION Chronic paronychia usually causes swollen, red, tender and boggy nail folds.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

The safety of ANZUPGO was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, multicenter, vehicle-controlled clinical trials (TRIAL 1 and TRIAL 2), in which 959 adults with moderate to severe CHE received ANZUPGO or vehicle cream topically twice daily for 16 weeks. A total of 638 subjects were treated with ANZUPGO [see Clinical Studies (14)].

In TRIAL 1 and TRIAL 2, adverse reactions that were reported in ≤ 1% of subjects in the ANZUPGO group were application site pain, paresthesia, pruritus, erythema, and bacterial skin infections including finger cellulitis, paronychia, other skin infections, leukopenia, and neutropenia.

In an open label extension trial (TRIAL 3), 801 subjects were treated for up to an additional 36 weeks after completing TRIAL 1 or TRIAL 2. A total of 198 subjects received continuous treatment with ANZUPGO for 52 weeks. Eczema herpeticum was observed in one subject and herpes zoster was observed in two subjects treated with ANZUPGO.

A. Oral biotin supplementation
B. Oral doxycycline
C. Oral itraconazole alone
D. Oral vitamin E with pulsed oral itraconazole
E. Topical 0.05% betamethasone dipropionate cream

Answers:
A. Oral biotin supplementation – Incorrect. Biotin supplementation is a part of the treatment for onychoschizia. One case of successful treatment of YNS using biotin has been documented, although this has not been replicated.
B. Oral doxycycline – Incorrect. Systemic antibiotics are used in the treatment of acute paronychia. However, the use of tetracyclines, such as doxycycline can rarely lead to photo-onycholysis, which can present with nail changes similar to YNS.
C. Oral itraconazole alone – Incorrect. Oral itraconazole monotherapy is the standard of treatment for nondermatophyte mold onychomycosis and is less effective than oral vitamin E and itraconazole combination therapy for the treatment of YNS.
D. Oral vitamin E with pulsed oral itraconazole – Correct. Used to great effect in this patient (Fig 3), oral vitamin E (1200–1600 U/d) with pulsed oral itraconazole (400 mg/d for 1 week per month) is found to have approximately a 50% response rate in patients with YNS.
E. Topical 0.05% betamethasone dipropionate cream – Incorrect. Topical high-potency steroids are the treatment of choice for chronic paronychia but not YNS.

In LUX-Lung 3, all patients were evaluated for LVEF at screening and every 9 weeks thereafter in the GILOTRIF-treated group and as needed in the pemetrexed/cisplatin group. More GILOTRIF-treated patients (2.2%; n = 5) experienced ventricular dysfunction (defined as diastolic dysfunction, left ventricular dysfunction, or ventricular dilation; all < Grade 3) compared to chemotherapy-treated patients (0.9%; n = 1).

Tables 1 and 2 summarize common adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities in LUX-Lung 3.

Other clinically important adverse reactions observed in patients treated with GILOTRIF but that occurred at a higher incidence in pemetrexed/cisplatin-treated patients and not listed elsewhere in section 6 include: decreased appetite (29% Grades 1–4, 4% Grade 3), nausea (25% Grades 1–4, 4% Grade 3), and vomiting (23% Grades 1–4, 4% Grade 3).

### Chronic paronychia in a hairdresser [^04cee3e7]. Occupational Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic paronychia is a common occupational disease. It is multifactorial and affects a number of different groups of workers. However, the condition is not described as affecting hairdressers although hairdressing is associated with a range of other occupation-related hand conditions. We report an unusual case of chronic paronychia in a female hairdresser which occurred as a consequence of a hair shaft penetrating beneath the nail fold. Personal hygiene with thorough removal of any hairs that have penetrated the epidermis and wearing clean gloves can prevent the condition. We suggest that clinicians should be aware of the types of occupation and mechanisms involved in patients developing chronic paronychia.

### Nail diseases related to nail cosmetics [^96aa9682]. Dermatologic Clinics (2006). Low credibility.

The use of nail care products and procedures to beautify and groom the nails is extremely common. Unfortunately, when improperly used, nail cosmetics can lead to nail diseases, such as paronychia, onycholysis, and brittle nails. Understanding the pathophysiology behind these conditions is an essential step toward better treatment and future prevention allowing patients to enjoy nail adornments while maintaining healthy nails.

### Acute hand infections [^8c530b5b]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute hand infections are often caused by puncture wounds and are generally classified into superficial or deep infections. Superficial infections occur in the skin and subcutaneous tissues, whereas deep infections can involve the tendon sheaths, adjacent anatomic compartments, deep fascial planes, bursae, joint spaces, and bones. Superficial hand infections are more common than deep infections and are typically managed with elevation, warm soaks, splinting in the position of function, analgesics, and empiric antibiotics when indicated. Paronychia, which can be acute or chronic, is an infection or inflammation of the nail fold. Treatment involves warm soaks, topical antibiotics, and abscess drainage, if indicated. A felon is an infection of the distal pulp of the finger. Treatment often involves surgical drainage and empiric oral antibiotics. Herpetic whitlow is caused by herpes simplex virus and typically resolves without intervention. Deep hand infections include pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis and clenched-fist bite wounds. Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis is a rapidly progressing bacterial infection of the flexor tendon sheaths in the hand, most commonly caused by a penetrating injury to the finger. Clenched-fist bite wounds result from direct contact of the fist on incisor teeth and are associated with polymicrobial infections. Empiric antibiotics and prompt surgical consultation are indicated to reduce long-term morbidity.
