## Question

strep possitive, vomiting, belly ache, 6 years old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage a 6-year-old with vomiting and abdominal pain who has a positive strep test, and how to avoid missing serious complications while treating appropriately. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the strep test truly reflects streptococcal pharyngitis and whether the abdominal symptoms fit a benign strep-associated etiology or a surgical emergency. Then, I should verify red flags that mandate urgent imaging and surgical consultation. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis, including mesenteric adenitis, appendicitis, primary peritonitis, and intussusception. After that, I need to outline a staged diagnostic and management plan, including fluids, antiemetics, analgesia, and antibiotics if strep is confirmed. Finally, I should confirm follow-up and safety-netting instructions to catch deterioration early.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the significance of the positive strep test. In children aged 5–15 years, streptococcal pharyngitis is common, and vomiting and abdominal pain can accompany strep even without prominent throat symptoms, so a positive rapid antigen test in this age group is clinically meaningful and supports treatment if symptoms are compatible with GAS pharyngitis [^112ACtFT] [^115fzMKu]. Wait, let me verify the testing strategy: if the rapid test is negative but suspicion remains high, a backup throat culture is recommended in children 3 years and older, whereas routine culture after a negative RADT is not advised in younger children due to low ARF risk, so I should ensure the diagnostic pathway matches age and pretest probability [^112ACtFT] [^117FtXKa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the abdominal pain being "just strep". I need to check for alarm features that push me toward urgent imaging and surgical evaluation: localized right lower quadrant pain with rebound or guarding, progressive severe pain, bilious vomiting, distension, hematochezia, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability; these features raise concern for appendicitis, intussusception, or streptococcal primary peritonitis and should not be attributed to mesenteric adenitis without further workup [^115VVxEK] [^11649sTQ] [^1131njrq]. I should double-check that persistent vomiting with dehydration or escalating pain despite initial therapy also warrants escalation rather than reassurance alone [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the differential and the key mimics. Mesenteric adenitis is a recognized strep-associated cause of abdominal pain and vomiting in children and can be seen on ultrasound, but I must not anchor on it and miss appendicitis or primary peritonitis, which can present similarly early on and deteriorate quickly [^1172LZaA]. But wait, what if this is streptococcal primary peritonitis? Case series show that GAS primary peritonitis can follow strep pharyngitis, present with diffuse abdominal pain and vomiting, and progress to peritonitis and shock; many children ultimately require surgery for source control, and early recognition changes outcomes [^115VVxEK] [^112NQD5N]. I should also keep intussusception on the radar in this age group, even though the peak is younger, because it can present with vomiting and intermittent pain and is time-sensitive for reduction [^114pTjmG] [^1131njrq].

> I will now examine the immediate bedside assessment I need. I should confirm vitals and perfusion, assess hydration status, and perform a careful abdominal exam for tenderness, guarding, rebound, masses, and bowel sounds, while documenting the oropharynx for erythema, exudates, and cervical nodes to correlate with the strep diagnosis; any ill appearance, hypotension, or persistent tachycardia should trigger urgent escalation [^notfound]. Let me reconsider: if the child is well-appearing, afebrile, with diffuse mild abdominal pain and non-bilious vomiting, a trial of conservative management may be reasonable, but I need to ensure close follow-up within 12–24 hours and explicit return precautions [^notfound].

> For initial management while I am still evaluating, I should prioritize supportive care. Oral rehydration with small, frequent sips is first-line if tolerated; if vomiting precludes intake, IV isotonic fluids are appropriate, and ondansetron can facilitate oral rehydration in children older than 4 years with acute gastroenteritis-like presentations, though I should confirm no contraindications and avoid overuse when dehydration is mild [^117S7csM]. I need to ensure analgesia with acetaminophen or ibuprofen and avoid opioids that obscure the exam; if pain localizes or escalates, I should escalate urgently rather than persist with analgesia alone [^notfound].

> Now, regarding antibiotics, I should confirm that the positive strep test justifies treatment for GAS pharyngitis. Penicillin or amoxicillin remain first-line agents. In penicillin-allergic patients, clindamycin or a first-generation cephalosporin (if not anaphylactic) are acceptable alternatives, and I should treat for the standard duration to eradicate carriage while aligning with local resistance patterns and patient factors [^115H7z7h] [^116JcF45] [^115d74AE]. Wait, I should verify dosing: typical amoxicillin dosing for school-aged children is 50 mg/kg/day divided twice daily, with a maximum of 500–875 mg per dose depending on severity and formulation, and I should adjust to 10 days total therapy to reduce complications and transmission risk [^115H7z7h].

> If any alarm features are present or the course is atypical, I need to escalate promptly. Abdominal ultrasound is a sensible first-line imaging to evaluate for mesenteric adenitis, appendicitis, or intussusception, recognizing operator dependence and the need to correlate with serial exams; if ultrasound is nondiagnostic and suspicion remains high, CT may be indicated, and surgical consultation should not be delayed in peritoneal signs or instability [^1172LZaA] [^1131njrq]. Hold on, I should verify that in suspected streptococcal primary peritonitis, early surgical involvement for source control and timely broad-spectrum antibiotics with GAS coverage are critical, with many centers favoring the addition of clindamycin for toxin suppression in severe disease, even though evidence is largely observational [^115VVxEK] [^112NQD5N].

> I should confirm disposition and safety-netting. If the child is well-appearing, hemodynamically stable, tolerating fluids, and has improving pain without peritoneal signs, outpatient management with close follow-up in 12–24 hours is reasonable. I must provide explicit return precautions for escalating pain, bilious vomiting, blood in stool, fever persistence beyond 48–72 hours, lethargy, or new rash, and ensure reliable follow-up [^notfound]. If there is any diagnostic uncertainty, dehydration, or evolving pain, observation or admission for IV fluids, serial exams, and expedited imaging is prudent to avoid missing an evolving surgical process [^notfound].

> Let me summarize the decision flow to ensure I have not missed anything. Confirm strep with appropriate testing and treat if criteria are met. Evaluate abdominal symptoms carefully for red flags. Manage supportively with fluids and analgesia. Escalate to imaging and surgical consultation if pain localizes, vomiting becomes bilious, or the child deteriorates. And arrange close follow-up with clear return precautions, recognizing that strep-associated mesenteric adenitis is common but appendicitis and streptococcal primary peritonitis are the can't-miss diagnoses in this scenario [^1172LZaA] [^115VVxEK] [^11649sTQ].

A 6-year-old with strep and vomiting/belly ache most often has **mesenteric adenitis** from strep-related lymph node inflammation, causing crampy pain and vomiting [^1172LZaA]. However, **appendicitis must be excluded** because strep can mimic or coexist with it, and missing it is dangerous [^113WvfJm]. Supportive care with **hydration, antipyretics, and antiemetics** is appropriate if the child is well-appearing and pain is mild [^117S7csM]; antibiotics for strep are indicated to reduce transmission and complications [^112ACtFT]. If pain localizes, worsens, or red flags appear (rebound, guarding, bilious vomiting, fever > 39°C, lethargy), obtain **urgent labs (CBC, CRP, electrolytes) and imaging (ultrasound)** and consult surgery to rule out appendicitis or other surgical causes [^notfound].

## Pathophysiology of abdominal pain and vomiting in streptococcal infections

Abdominal pain and vomiting in strep infections are typically due to **mesenteric adenitis**, in which strep-related lymphadenitis causes crampy pain and vomiting [^1172LZaA]. Less commonly, strep can trigger **pancreatitis** or **primary peritonitis**, which present with severe abdominal pain and systemic toxicity [^112NQD5N] [^115VVxEK].

---

## Differential diagnosis

While mesenteric adenitis is common, the following must be considered and excluded:

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Diagnostic approach** |
|-|-|-|
| Mesenteric adenitis | Crampy pain, vomiting, mild fever, non-localized tenderness | Clinical diagnosis, ultrasound may show enlarged mesenteric nodes [^1172LZaA] |
| Appendicitis | - Right lower quadrant pain <br/> - Rebound tenderness <br/> - Fever <br/> - Vomiting | - Clinical exam <br/> - Ultrasound <br/> - CT if needed [^notfound] |
| Primary peritonitis | - Severe diffuse pain <br/> - Fever <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Systemic toxicity | - Clinical exam <br/> - Labs (WBC, CRP) <br/> - Ultrasound <br/> - Surgical evaluation [^115VVxEK] |
| Pancreatitis | - Severe epigastric pain <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Fever | - Serum amylase/lipase <br/> - Abdominal ultrasound [^117Y27Ar] |
| Intussusception | - Intermittent colicky pain <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Palpable mass | - Ultrasound <br/> - Contrast enema if needed [^1131njrq] |

---

## Clinical evaluation

A thorough **clinical evaluation** should include:

- **Vital signs**: Fever, tachycardia, hypotension, respiratory distress.
- **Abdominal examination**: Localization, rebound, guarding, rigidity, palpable mass.
- **General appearance**: Lethargy, irritability, dehydration.

---

## Diagnostic tests

- **Rapid antigen detection test (RADT)**: Confirms strep pharyngitis [^112ACtFT].
- **Throat culture**: Gold standard if RADT is negative but suspicion remains [^114jnFcB].
- **Complete blood count (CBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP)**: Assess inflammation/infection severity.
- **Electrolytes**: Evaluate dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.
- **Abdominal ultrasound**: First-line to assess for mesenteric adenitis, appendicitis, or other intra-abdominal pathology [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

### Supportive care

Supportive care includes **hydration** — oral rehydration or IV fluids for moderate to severe dehydration — and **symptomatic relief** with acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever and pain, plus ondansetron for vomiting [^117S7csM].

---

### Antibiotic therapy

Antibiotic therapy should follow **first-line therapy** with penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days [^115H7z7h] [^116JcF45]. For **penicillin allergy**, use clindamycin, azithromycin, or a first-generation cephalosporin if not anaphylactic [^115d74AE].

---

### Indications for surgical consultation

Surgical consultation is indicated for **appendicitis** (localized right lower quadrant pain, rebound, or guarding) [^11649sTQ], **primary peritonitis** (severe diffuse pain with systemic toxicity) [^115VVxEK], or **worsening symptoms** despite appropriate antibiotic therapy.

---

## Potential complications if untreated or improperly managed

- **Rheumatic fever**: Autoimmune complication affecting heart, joints, skin, and brain [^115fzMKu].
- **Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis**: Kidney inflammation [^115fzMKu].
- **Sepsis**: Rare but life-threatening [^115bzeD1].
- **Appendiceal rupture**: If appendicitis is missed [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

With appropriate management, prognosis is **excellent** [^115VVxEK]. Most children recover fully within 7–10 days, though complications can occur if untreated or improperly managed.

---

## Parental guidance and home care

- **Hydration**: Encourage small, frequent sips of fluids [^notfound].
- **Diet**: Gradual return to normal diet as tolerated.
- **Medication adherence**: Complete antibiotic course [^115H7z7h].
- **Red flags**: Return if pain worsens, fever persists, vomiting becomes bilious, or child becomes lethargic [^117Ucmu1].

---

A 6-year-old with strep, vomiting, and belly ache most often has mesenteric adenitis, but **appendicitis and other serious causes must be excluded**. Supportive care and antibiotics are appropriate for mild cases, but **worsening pain, localized tenderness, or systemic signs require urgent evaluation and imaging** [^11649sTQ].

Case presentation

A five-year-old boy, previously healthy, presented with a two-day history of fever and experienced vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Although his fever was high, it was not associated with chills or rigors. Vomiting was frequent but not projectile, nor was the vomit bilious or mixed with blood. The diarrheal stool was watery in nature and mixed with mucus, but no blood was detected. The abdominal pain was severe and colicky in nature, located in the epigastric area with no radiation. The pain was relieved by passing stool, with no other pain-relieving factors, including pain medications. Further, the pain was aggravated by food intake. No abdominal distension, no history of drug ingestion and no recent travel.

A physical examination on admission revealed a highly febrile child with a fever reaching 40 °C, tachycardia and otherwise normal vital signs. He also showed signs that indicated moderate dehydration. His physical examination, including an abdominal examination was unremarkable.

Blood investigations revealed normal complete blood count, with normal renal function and electrolytes. Blood and urine cultures were also normal. He had low bicarbonate level of 14 mmol/L (Normal Range: 22–26 mmol/L) and the rapid antigen detection test was positive for Group A streptococcal (GAS) infection. Table 1.

The patient was admitted with the suspicion of GAS infection (tonsillitis), and his abdominal pain was attributed to mesenteric adenitis, which is usually associated with GAS infection. The patient was started on intravenous (IV) hydration and penicillin G sodium. Further, the patient did not have a sore throat at that stage, and his clinical examination did not reveal any sign of GAS tonsillitis.

### Chronic abdominal pain in children: a technical report of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^113MaZHZ]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic abdominal pain, defined as long-lasting intermittent or constant abdominal pain, is a common pediatric problem encountered by primary care physicians, medical subspecialists and surgical specialists. Chronic abdominal pain in children is usually functional-that is, without objective evidence of an underlying organic disorder. The Subcommittee on Chronic Abdominal Pain of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition has prepared this report based on a comprehensive, systematic review and rating of the medical literature. This report accompanies a clinical report based on the literature review and expert opinion. The subcommittee examined the diagnostic and therapeutic value of a medical and psychologic history, diagnostic tests, and pharmacological and behavioral therapy. The presence of alarm symptoms or signs (such as weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, persistent fever, chronic severe diarrhea and significant vomiting) is associated with a higher prevalence of organic disease. There was insufficient evidence to state that the nature of the abdominal pain or the presence of associated symptoms (such as anorexia, nausea, headache and joint pain) can discriminate between functional and organic disorders. Although children with chronic abdominal pain and their parents are more often anxious or depressed, the presence of anxiety, depression, behavior problems or recent negative life events does not distinguish between functional and organic abdominal pain. Most children who are brought to the primary care physician's office for chronic abdominal pain are unlikely to require diagnostic testing. Pediatric studies of therapeutic interventions were examined and found to be limited or inconclusive.

### Delayed presentation of a congenital duodenal web managed successfully with incision of web [^116yZVeB]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

One of the causes of congenital incomplete duodenal obstruction is the presence of congenital duodenal web with fenestration. This condition requires a high index of suspicion for an early and accurate diagnosis. We present an unusual presentation of duodenal web in a 6-year-old girl who presented with a 3-year history of cyclical and seasonal vomiting and abdominal pain. The diagnosis of congenital duodenal web with fenestration was made on contrast study and endoscopy and was treated surgically by incision of the web.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome [^117Ucmu1]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome — initial screening and alarm features — supported performing screening tests in all children with a cyclic vomiting pattern just before administration of intravenous fluids to include electrolytes (Na+, K+, Cl−, HCO3−), glucose, and upper gastrointestinal radiographs to exclude malrotation; an abdominal ultrasound to rule out transient hydronephrosis, preferably during a crisis, could also be considered in refractory cases. If a patient has hyponatremia or hypoglycemia, then further evaluation should be performed to exclude Addison disease and disorders of fatty acid oxidation. Suspicious symptoms and physical findings include bilious vomiting, abdominal tenderness and/or severe abdominal pain; attacks precipitated by intercurrent illness, fasting, and/or high protein meal; abnormalities on neurological examination including severe alteration of mental status, abnormal eye movements, papilledema, motor asymmetry, and/or gait abnormality (ataxia); and progressively worsening episodes or conversion to a continuous or chronic pattern.

### Group A streptococcal septicaemia presenting as an acute abdomen in a child [^115teRmm]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Case report

Miss AL, a six year old girl was seen in A&E with pyrexia, diarrhoea and vomiting, hip and shoulder pain pyrexia of two days duration. She had also complained of a sore throat and earache of four days duration. Her symptoms were felt to be consistent with a viral upper respiratory tract infection and gastroenteritis. No investigations were performed at this time and she was discharged with Diarolyte.

The patient returned four days later with persistent multi-joint pains; having now developed diffuse abdominal pain and distension and at this point a surgical opinion was sought.

The child was pyrexial and hypoxic, and clearly unwell. Ear, nose and throat examination was normal at this time as it had been one week previously. She had peritonitis localised to the right iliac fossa and an overlying cellulitis. Note was also made of an intermittent roving erythematous but non pruritic rash over her wrists and distal limbs.

The full blood count (white cell count 25.6, neutrophils 23.1 platelets 47) and C-reactive protein (248 mg/L) were consistent with fulminant sepsis.

Following an equivocal abdominal ultrasound scan the patient was taken to theatre.

Laparotomy revealed copious fibrin deposits and a congested caecum and appendix which were not felt to be due to acute appendicitis. appendicectomy was performed.

Despite aggressive fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefuroxime, metronidazole and gentamicin) the patient deteriorated rapidly, developing disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute renal failure. She was kept intubated and required admission to the paediatric intensive care unit for inotropic and ventilatory support for 48 hours post operatively. Blood cultures from admission and peritoneal swabs from laparotomy grew a fully sensitive group A streptococcus at 48 hours, after which her antibiotics were rationalised and she was commenced on clindamycin. Her condition improved and she was discharged from hospital after two weeks with no post infection sequelae to date.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^116T8M3k]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric HIV — HSR from ABC, with or without skin involvement and excluding SJS/TEN, has onset with first use within first 6 weeks of initiating ABC and with reintroduction within hours of initiating ABC, and presentation includes symptoms such as high fever, diffuse skin rash, malaise, nausea, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, pharyngitis, and respiratory symptoms (e.g., dyspnea). Estimated frequency is < 1% to 9% (varies by ethnicity). Risk factors include HLA-B✱5701, and HSR is very uncommon in people who are HLA-B✱5701 negative; the prevalence of HLA-B✱5701 is generally lower in people from Africa and East Asia. Prevention and monitoring directives are: Screen for HLA-B✱5701. ABC should not be prescribed if HLA-B✱5701 is present. The medical record should clearly indicate that ABC is contraindicated in these patients. When starting ABC, counsel patients and families about the signs and symptoms of HSR to ensure prompt reporting of reactions. Management guidance is: Discontinue all ARV drugs and investigate other causes of the symptoms (e.g., a concurrent viral illness). Provide symptomatic treatment. Most symptoms resolve within 48 hours after discontinuing ABC. Do not rechallenge with ABC even if the patient is HLA-B✱5701 negative.

### Group A streptococcal septicaemia presenting as an acute abdomen in a child [^115bzeD1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

Group A streptococcus is one of the most frequent pathogens in humans, a normal upper respiratory tract commensal in 5–15% of normal individuals, responsible for a broad spectrum of clinical entities, the most commonly occurring illnesses being streptococcal tonsillitis, scarlet fever and more rarely, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). First described at the end of the last century, STSS (Group A streptococcal infection associated with the early onset of shock and organ failure.) carries a significant morbidity and mortality (up to 70%), is more common in adults than children and is increasingly being reported in patients who have no predisposing factors. Over the last 15 years however, there has been a significant increase in the incidence and severity of infections caused by Group A Strep, including STSS seen in children, thought to be a response to more virulent and resistant strains of the bacteria evolving. It is more likely to mimic peritonitis than appendicitis, and is therefore an essential differential to be borne in mind when confronted with a peritonitic, rapidly deteriorating previously well child following an initial upper respiratory tract infection, which has failed to improve despite simple medical management.

There are very few case reports of children with Group Strep A. presenting as Appendicitis. We have come across only 3–4 case reports in English literature from 1965. Hence we would like to re-emphasis the need to keep this medical condition on our differential diagnosis while treating appendicitis.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition 2025 guidelines on the diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome in children [^112Lf8pE]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome in children — background and burden — is prevalent in 1.9%–2.3% of children, markedly affects quality of life and healthcare utilization with recurrent emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and school-related disability, and presents as stereotypical attacks of emesis that closely resemble migraine. There is insufficient knowledge of exact pathophysiology and lack of evidence-based treatment algorithms, leading to inconsistency and poor consensus among practitioners; therapies are typically empiric and/or targeted towards common comorbidities with substantial focus on pharmacological interventions. These guidelines were developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess certainty in evidence and formulate recommendations.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome [^116NEU5F]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

Upper endoscopy in cyclic vomiting syndrome — because endoscopic biopsy usually does not reveal an etiologic cause, the task force did not recommend a routine endoscopy unless patients present with chronic symptoms between episodes that are suggestive of a specific disorder or large amounts of hematemesis warrant endoscopic intervention. If histological evidence of mild to moderate esophagitis is found, then a standard 4- to 6-week course of acid suppression (eg, proton pump inhibitor) is warranted.

Abdominal pain is a challenging presentation in children. Examination findings and etiology vary greatly, spanning a vast spectrum from flatulence to frank peritonitis with septic shock. Here, we discuss a 10-year-old boy with 24 hours of progressively worsening lower abdominal pain, nausea, and subjective fevers. History and physical examination findings were consistent with appendicitis. However, physicians were surprised when the single-view abdominal radiograph showed an unanticipated, somewhat perplexing discovery.

Rationale for best practice statements — history taking for gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in COVID-19. In outpatients with new-onset diarrhea, ascertain information about high-risk contact exposure; obtain a detailed history of symptoms associated with COVID-19, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, or new loss of taste or smell; and obtain a thorough history for other GI symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. In outpatients with new-onset GI symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), monitor for symptoms associated with COVID-19, as GI symptoms may precede COVID-related symptoms by a few days, and in a high COVID-19 prevalence setting, COVID-19 testing should be considered. In hospitalized patients with suspected or known COVID-19, obtain a thorough history of GI symptoms (ie, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), including onset, characteristics, duration, and severity.

- Nausea and vomiting Subacute illness Respiratory disease caused by group A strep infection in children younger than 3 years of age rarely manifests as acute pharyngitis. Instead, these children usually have what is called "streptococcal fever" or "streptococcosis, " which involves mucopurulent rhinitis followed by:

- Anorexia
- Fever
- Irritability. Negative RADT Children older than 3 years: Healthcare providers should follow up a negative RADT with a throat culture. Have a mechanism in place to contact the family and initiate antibiotics if the back-up throat culture is positive. Giving antibiotics to children with confirmed group A strep pharyngitis can reduce their risk of developing acute rheumatic fever. All other ages: Throat culture after a negative RADT isn't routinely indicated. Acute rheumatic fever is very rare in these age groups.

Treatment Patients, regardless of age, who have a positive RADT or throat culture need antibiotics. Don't treat viral pharyngitis with antibiotics. Benefits of antibiotics Using a recommended antibiotic regimen to treat group A strep pharyngitis:

- Shortens the duration of symptoms
- Reduces the likelihood of transmission to close contacts
- Decreases the development of complications.

Results

Demographic features

A total of 2074 children suffered from HSP, younger than 17 years old, including 1217 (58.7%) boys and 857 (41.3%) girls from January 2015 to December 2019 (male: female = 1.4:1). The average age was 8.3 ± 3.0 years old and median age was 8 years old (95% CI 8.1–8.4). Interquartile range (IQR) for the onset age fell in the interval between 6 and 10 years old. The annual incidence of HSP was 9.5–10.3 per 100,000, which was calculated according to the demographic data from Anhui Health and Family Planning Commission. The monthly distribution of HSP children is presented in Fig. 1. The highest onset of HSP appeared in January, November or December throughout the observational period; on the contrary, the lowest onset of HSP appeared in July, August or September. In the present study, HSP occurred more commonly in spring and winter than in summer.

Clinical manifestations

The major clinical manifestations of HSP are shown in Table 1. Since cutaneous purpura is the necessary element in the diagnosis of HSP, all patients in the present study had skin lesions. Arthritis/arthralgia, the second most prevalent feature of HSP, occurred in 38.4% of patients, resulting in severe pain and even walking restriction. Abdominal pain was observed in 35.1% of patients who principally developed gastrointestinal bleeding, intussusceptions, appendicitis or ileus. Renal involvement secondary to HSP was diverse and manifested as proteinuria and/or hematuria. In the present study, 621 cases (29.9%) suffered from kidney injury; among them, 161 cases (7.8%) had proteinuria, 153 cases (7.4%) had hematuria and 307 cases (14.8%) had hematuria and proteinuria simultaneously. Besides, other clinical manifestations including cardiac damage (3.9%) and liver dysfunction (1.0%) were also found in the present study.

Recurrent abdominal pain remains one of the most common symptoms in pediatrics. We present the case of a 3-year-old girl who had recurrent episodes of abdominal pain requiring more than 13 visits to the emergency department. A diagnosis of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency was eventually made. Urea cycle disorders often present beyond the neonatal period with frequent vomiting episodes; however, recurrent abdominal pain as a presenting symptom is unusual. Unnecessary invasive investigations of recurrent abdominal pain in childhood can be avoided by considering inborn errors of metabolism earlier in the differential diagnosis.

### Clinical characteristics, outcomes, and interobserver agreement of point-of-care ultrasound detected mesenteric adenitis in nonsurgical pediatric abdominal pain: a retrospective cohort study [^1172LZaA]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

The radiology literature cites cutoff values for enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (> 4 mm to 2 cm), but these have been found in more than a quarter of asymptomatic children on CT or ultrasound imaging. We would note that our mesenteric lymph node measurements in symptomatic children overlap the lymph node measurements noted in asymptomatic children.

As part of the study time period in this retrospective cohort study included the COVID-19 pandemic, it is notable that a few patients in this cohort had acute COVID-19 infection (no criteria for Mulitsystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children [MIS-C]) as manifested by abdominal pain from mesenteric adenitis visualized on POCUS. Nearly a third to a half of the patients in the cohort complained of vomiting or diarrhea presumably from viral gastrointestinal infection in addition to abdominal pain from mesenteric adenitis. We also note mesenteric adenitis found on POCUS in cases of abdominal pain associated with pneumonia and streptococcal pharyngitis.

The study is limited by the small cohort and retrospective design as it is certain that not all patients with nonsurgical mesenteric adenitis were captured when POCUS faculty were not available to scan all children with abdominal pain. Our cohort size is likely too small to generate generalizable epidemiologic statistics regarding the diagnosis of mesenteric adenitis on POCUS relative to that of radiology ultrasound or CT scans or alternate diagnoses such as appendicitis or intussusception; however, we note that presence or absence of mesenteric adenitis was inconsistently reported on radiology imaging reports and with no report of localization of pain. In our limited retrospective cohort, we can report there were no surgical diagnoses missed within 4 weeks of follow-up. However, the danger of making the diagnosis of mesenteric adenitis is the potential diagnostic error of "satisfaction of search"and not excluding a surgical cause of abdominal pain. As emergency physicians become skilled at finding normal appendix or excluding intussusception on POCUS, the diagnosis of mesenteric adenitis can be made when mesenteric lymph nodes are visualized in an area of reported abdominal pain.

### Acute gastric volvulus in a six-year-old: a case report and review of the literature [^114yC1i8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

First described in the pediatric population in 1899 by Oltmann, pediatric gastric volvulus is a rare disease, but carries a high mortality rate. Due to vague signs and symptoms it can easily be mistaken for gastroenteritis or appendicitis, but unique radiographic findings can help illuminate the diagnosis. The pathophysiology of gastric volvulus is related to an abnormality in the attachment of at least one of the gastric ligaments, which can occur either primarily or secondarily. The abnormality in these ligaments allows the stomach to freely rotate, eventually causing an obstruction. We describe a unique case occurring in a 6-year-old with no pre-exiting medical conditions as well as the associated radiographic images.

Objectives

Our aim is to discuss the presentation and management of a potentially lethal intra-abdominal process that mimics far more benign disease entities and to highlight the pertinent radiographic findings.

Case Report

A previously healthy 6-year-old female presented to the emergency department in the middle of the night after sudden onset of vomiting and abdominal pain. On exam her heart rate was mildly elevated but all other vital signs were within normal limits. She was assessed with an abdominal x-ray and given ondansetron. After settling with her parents and having no further bouts of emesis she was sent home. She returned that afternoon febrile with increasing abdominal pain and emesis. Abdominal x-ray revealed a massively distended stomach and left diaphragmatic eventration. She underwent operative intervention and improved over the course of the following week.

Conclusion

Acute gastric volvulus presents a diagnostic challenge. In patients with vague abdominal complaints knowledge of the typical x-ray findings is essential in early identification and treatment.

Case presentation

A previously fit and well 10-year-old boy presented to the emergency department (ED) with a 48-hour history of colicky, central abdominal pain, one episode of loose stool, five episodes of vomiting and anorexia. He had not eaten out, travelled abroad or been around anyone else unwell over the preceding days, and there was no history of upper respiratory tract symptoms, rashes or fever. The boy had no significant medical or surgical history, and he did not take any regular medications. All vaccinations were up-to-date. He had no family history of note and was an only child. As he had a soft, non-tender abdomen, his symptoms were attributed to gastroenteritis. Inpatient treatment was not required as the boy appeared adequately hydrated with normal observations and was tolerating oral fluids. He was, therefore, discharged with the advice to stay well hydrated and to return if symptoms worsened. A stool sample had been requested, but the boy was unable to provide this in the ED. He reattended the following day with constant, right-sided, abdominal pain, and ongoing diarrhoea and vomiting. Examination revealed tenderness which had now localised to the right iliac fossa (RIF) and a temperature of 37.8°C.

### Group A Streptococcus primary peritonitis in children, New Zealand [^115VVxEK]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

As in previous reports, symptoms of children in our cohort were abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Several cases were initially diagnosed as viral gastroenteritis before deteriorating into peritonism and sepsis. Of the children in our cohort, 30% met STSS criteria, which is comparable with previous case reports that found an overall STSS incidence of 39%.

Although adult clinical practice guidelines advise nonoperative management, particularly in persons with underlying ascites, previous case reports found that most (83%) pediatric patients undergo surgery to rule out secondary peritonitis. This practice was also demonstrated in our series; 95% of patients underwent laparoscopy or laparotomy. Surgical management might aid source control, particularly in patients with STSS where reduction of bacterial load plays a major role. Operative management has also been hypothesized to decrease the duration of illness: a 2020 case report describes a child who was managed nonoperatively and in whom a multi-loculated abscess developed that required multiple drains and 61 days of antibiotics.

The median total duration of antibiotic treatment in our cohort was 21 days (range 14–42 days), which is 1 week longer than the median duration of 14 days (range 10–61) seen in previous case reports. The additional benefit of clindamycin or intravenous immunoglobulin in the management of GAS primary peritonitis remains unclear; however, those adjunct treatments might have a role in patients with STSS.

Observational case reports alone make it difficult to comment on the importance of operative management or the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for GAS primary peritonitis; however, despite substantial rates of severe illness in our series (10 cases [50%] required PICU admission), no deaths occurred, and only 1 patient required readmission to the hospital. Furthermore, no deaths have been reported in any pediatric case report of GAS primary peritonitis since the 1980s. As such, shorter durations of antibiotics may be reasonable for patients with less severe clinical manifestation, particularly when early surgical source control is achieved.

### A retrospective analysis of clinical characteristics and outcomes of pediatric fulminant myocarditis [^115Cv5oo]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our center, we found that AFM was more prevalent in females than in males among children, which is inconsistent with the results of two previous studies, but aligns with the results reported by Shanghai Children's Medical Center. Pediatric AFM can be non-specific, commonly presenting with symptoms such as vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, and chest tightness. Some children also present with syncope, poor appetite, coughing, dizziness, shortness of breath, headache, edema, pallor, discomfort in the precordial area, coma, drowsiness, sudden respiratory and cardiac arrest, diarrhea, and other symptoms. Additionally, AFM may simultaneously involve multiple systems, such as the digestive, nervous, and respiratory systems. Therefore, AFM may not be timely identified promptly in a significant portion of children, thus delaying the implementation of interventions. In our group, the most common symptoms were vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, chest tightness and poor consciousness. These can easily lead to wrong or missed diagnosis of AFM, necessitating vigilance on outpatient children with such symptoms.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — clinical features and burden include recurrent, discrete, self-limited episodes defined by symptom-based criteria and the absence of positive laboratory, radiographic, and endoscopic testing, with intense vomiting and early-morning onset described. A large case series found that although it affects only 5% to 15% of a child's lifetime, it results in 24 days of missed school and an annualized cost of care of $17,035. The vomiting is intense (median 6 times/ hour at peak), often bilious (83% in some series), and episodes often commence in the early morning (eg, 3–4 AM or upon awakening). CVS starts commonly in early childhood, and the vomiting symptoms may abate with the onset of classical migraine headaches during adolescence.

CASE PRESENTATION

Chief symptoms

A four‐year‐old female presented to our pediatric rheumatology clinic with the chief symptom of periodic fevers and abdominal pain.

History of the present illness

The patient's fevers began 4 months prior to presentation following a documented streptococcal pharyngeal infection, with a maximum temperature of 104°F. They occurred every 1–2 weeks and would then last a duration of 4–6 hours. Fevers were followed by severe abdominal pain that prevented eating. She did not have associated emesis, diarrhea, or constipation.

Medical, family, and social history

The past medical history of the patient included allergic rhinitis, characterized by rhinorrhea and congestion, which was treated with nasal spray. Otherwise, she was reported to have normal growth and development. There was no known family history of autoimmunity, including inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, psoriasis, or Raynaud's syndrome. Social history was noncontributory. There were no known relevant environmental exposures.

Review of systems

Review of systems was notable for lack of joint pain or swelling, digital clubbing, myalgia, limp, rash, fatigue, or headaches. The patient's parents denied that she had experienced respiratory symptoms, including shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, cough, or snoring. There was no history of recurrent respiratory infections.

Physical examination

The girl was a well‐appearing child without dysmorphic features. Vital signs were normal, though pulse oximetry was not obtained initially. There were no oral lesions, the oropharynx was clear, and tonsils were without exudate. Findings of ophthalmic examination were normal. Cardiac examination did not reveal murmur, rub, gallop, extra heart sounds, or arrhythmia. Lung examination demonstrated normal and symmetric air entry bilaterally. Her abdomen was soft, nontender to palpation, and without hepatosplenomegaly. Musculoskeletal examination was notable for redness overlying the distal interphalangeal joints and bilateral finger and toe clubbing (Figure 1). There was no evidence of synovitis or muscle tenderness or weakness. The patient had a normal gait without evidence of limp.

Recurrent, episodic vomiting in children — diagnostic approach emphasizes that a pattern fulfilling the revised historical criteria listed in Table 1 is likely (about 90%) to be ultimately diagnosed as idiopathic CVS, while clinicians must differentiate individuals with specific and serious underlying causes of vomiting (about 10%) for which prompt treatment may alter outcomes. The principles aim to identify those with a cyclic vomiting pattern between ages 2 and 18 years at the greatest risk for having an organic cause, acknowledging that children younger than 2 years may have CVS, serious underlying metabolic and surgical disorders are more frequent and more difficult to diagnose in that age range.

All patients undergoing ultrasound imaging for appendicitis in our emergency department during 2013 were reviewed (n = 1572). A total of 207 patients were identified who underwent both ultrasound for appendicitis and testing for strep pharyngitis. Demographic and outcomes data between rule out appendicitis patients who underwent strep testing and those who did not were compared.

Results

Strep testing was more common in younger patients (mean age = 8.26 vs 10.26 years P < .001) and evenly matched by gender (104 male, 103 female). Of the 207 patients tested for strep pharyngitis, 8 (3.9%) patients had appendicitis and 35 (16.9%) patients tested positive for strep pharyngitis. No cases of concurrent strep pharyngitis and appendicitis were identified. The negative appendectomy rate in the strep pharyngitis tested group was 38.5% (5/13), compared with 7.7% (23/296) (P = 0.003) in the nontested group. The appendicitis rate among the strep tested group was 3.8% (8/207) compared with 20% (273/1365) in the nontested group (P < .001).

Conclusions

Patients undergoing testing for strep pharyngitis were younger, had lower rates of appendicitis, and had a higher rate of negative appendectomy. A diagnosis of concurrent appendicitis and strep pharyngitis is rare. In cases of patients with sufficient symptoms to warrant testing for strep pharyngitis a diagnosis of appendicitis is less likely and surgical intervention leads to higher negative appendectomy rates.

### A 6-week-old boy with irritability and abdominal distension [^1177wWQB]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

A 6-week-old boy is brought to the hospital for fussiness and abdominal distension. He was febrile on presentation and was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. On subsequent examinations, he continued to demonstrate abdominal distension and tenderness to palpation. Ultrasonography of the abdomen was performed and revealed a heterogeneous liver mass. With further diagnostics, a diagnosis was made and treatment initiated, with the infant experiencing resolution of his symptoms. Our panel of experts first discuss the management of an infant with abdominal distension, then discuss the evaluation of a liver mass in an infant, including oncologic, vascular, and infectious etiologies.

Introduction: Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) is an autoinflammatory syndrome that causes regularly recurring fever episodes associated with symptoms depicted in the acronym. In addition, flares are often associated with abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting and myalgia/arthralgia. The onset of symptoms typically occurs before five years of age. A long diagnostic delay is common in PFAPA and the presentation of high fever in a small child may bring about an increased number of in-patient hospital stays before the diagnosis is made.

Objectives: To investigate the number of in-patient hospital stays for children with PFAPA before and after they are diagnosed with the condition. Further, to compare the frequency of in-patient stays between children with PFAPA and the general population in the youngest age group of 0–4 years.

### Chronic abdominal pain in children [^116rwwkK]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic abdominal pain, defined as long-lasting intermittent or constant abdominal pain, is a common pediatric problem encountered by primary care physicians, medical subspecialists, and surgical specialists. Chronic abdominal pain in children is usually functional, that is, without objective evidence of an underlying organic disorder. The Subcommittee on Chronic Abdominal Pain of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition has prepared this report based on a comprehensive, systematic review and rating of the medical literature. This report accompanies a clinical report based on the literature review and expert opinion. The subcommittee examined the diagnostic and therapeutic value of a medical and psychological history, diagnostic tests, and pharmacologic and behavioral therapy. The presence of alarm symptoms or signs (such as weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, persistent fever, chronic severe diarrhea, and significant vomiting) is associated with a higher prevalence of organic disease. There was insufficient evidence to state that the nature of the abdominal pain or the presence of associated symptoms (such as anorexia, nausea, headache, and joint pain) can discriminate between functional and organic disorders. Although children with chronic abdominal pain and their parents are more often anxious or depressed, the presence of anxiety, depression, behavior problems, or recent negative life events does not distinguish between functional and organic abdominal pain. Most children who are brought to the primary care physician's office for chronic abdominal pain are unlikely to require diagnostic testing. Pediatric studies of therapeutic interventions were examined and found to be limited or inconclusive.

### What is beyond Salmonella gastroenteritis? A case of acute pancreatitis complicating Salmonella infection in a child: a case report and literature review [^113tX9ky]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Salmonella infection presents itself in a wide variety of ways, ranging from mild self-limited illness to severe systemic disease with multiorgan involvement. Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a very rare complication that is associated with Salmonella infection, especially among the pediatric population.

Case Presentation

A five-year-old boy presented with a two-day fever and experienced vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The boy was admitted as a case of acute gastroenteritis, and Salmonella was found in his stool culture. The severity of his abdominal pain during his hospital stay indicated the possibility of AP. A clinical examination and blood workup were performed and showed significant elevation in amylase and lipase, which confirmed the diagnosis of AP.

Conclusion

Although abdominal pain is a common presentation of Salmonella infection, the possibility of AP must be considered when the pain is severe and the characteristics of the pain are suggestive of AP. Herein, we report a case of AP complicating Salmonella infection in an immunocompetent child.

### Burden and economic cost of group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^116tXqyz]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Our aim was to describe the morbidity, medical costs, and nonmedical costs associated with group A streptococcal pharyngitis in school-aged children.

Methods

Our study population included parents of children diagnosed as having group A streptococcal pharyngitis at 2 pediatric practice sites in the Boston, Massachusetts, metropolitan area. Telephone interviews were conducted with parents of eligible children, who were asked questions about health care utilization, medications, and time missed from work or school, for calculation of medical and nonmedical costs associated with illness.

Results

One hundred thirty-five parents completed interviews between October 2005 and January 2006. Older children were significantly more likely to present with headache, compared with those ≤ 5 years of age. No significant differences between older and younger children were found for rates of sore throat, fever, abdominal pain/nausea/vomiting, or rash. Children missed a mean of 1.9 days (range: 0–7 days) of school/day care, and 42% of parents missed a mean of 1.8 days of work. A second parent or caregiver also missed a mean of 1.5 days in 14% of families. The total societal cost per case of group A streptococcal pharyngitis was $205 (medical: $118; nonmedical: $87).

Conclusions

The societal cost of group A streptococcal pharyngitis is substantial, with almost one half being attributable to nonmedical costs. Through extrapolation from this experience, the total cost of group A streptococcal pharyngitis among children in the United States ranges from $224 to $539 million per year.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) prophylaxis in young children — cyproheptadine and pizotifen — notes that cyproheptadine has a moderate response rate and is the first choice for children 5 years old or younger; it is typically given on a bid or tid schedule, although some clinicians use a single nighttime dose to lessen daytime sedation, while increased weight may be an unacceptable side effect. Pizotifen was highly efficacious in a case series of 6 CVS subjects and a randomized trial in 16 abdominal migraine patients, but it is available only in Canada and the United Kingdom.

### Proceedings of the 29th European paediatric rheumatology congress [^112rdbVC]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

In the third pair of boys, the disease manifested when they were 5.9 years old. The first child experienced the initial symptoms at the age of 5, and the second child developed a similar presentation eight months later. Both children were born through IVF. A typical fever pattern emerged, occurring every 4–6 weeks and lasting for 5–6 days during each episode. Along with pharyngitis and cervical adenopathy, the boys also exhibited symptoms such as abdominal pain and vomiting. Genetic testing was performed for both children, revealing the presence of a VUS.

Longitudinal observation and appropriate treatment were provided based on the diagnoses.

Conclusion: While the association between IVF and autoinflammatory diseases, particularly in twins, remains limited and conflicting in current literature, this case series highlights the need for further research and collaboration to enhance understanding and optimize medical care for this specific patient population.

### More than just gastritis: an unusual presentation of strangulated transmesenteric hernia in a pediatric patient [^1165P8kM]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Internal hernias are a rare occurrence, reported in only 0.2–0.9% of the general population, and predominantly occur in adult patients as postsurgical complications. However, internal hernias can occur in pediatric patients, typically due to herniation of bowel through congenital mesenteric defects, and are associated with high rates of strangulation or volvulus (up to 30–40%) in this population. These can be especially difficult to detect due to nonspecific symptoms and rarity, but carry a steep mortality rate of 45% if treated and virtually 100% if missed. We present a case report that describes a 3 year old patient who presented to the emergency department with less than 12 h of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis and associated abdominal pain with preserved ability to tolerate oral intake. She ultimately went on to have ultrasound and then CT imaging that revealed a high grade bowel obstruction due to an internal hernia from a mesenteric defect for which she required emergent resection of 119 cm of necrotic bowel. Ultimately this case illustrates a fairly benign presentation of a rare etiology of pediatric vomiting and abdominal pain that if left undetected could prove fatal, and is therefore essential for the emergency clinician to consider on the differential for vomiting and nonspecific abdominal pain in the pediatric patient.

### Visual diagnosis: an 11-month-old with nausea, vomiting, and an abdominal mass [^1131njrq]. Pediatrics in Review (2013). Low credibility.

Children with intussusception can present with a wide variety of symptoms, including vomiting, fever, lethargy, and abdominal pain. The classic triad of abdominal pain, hematochezia, and palpable abdominal mass is seen in a few patients.• Early diagnosis of intussusception depends on a high level of clinical suspicion in any child with non specific abdominal findings followed by appropriate radiographic or ultrasonographic evaluation and confirmation with a contrast enema.• Abdominal radiography, although an appropriate component of the initial workup for gastrointestinal symptoms, lacks the sensitivity to reliably exclude the presence of intussusception.• Because ultrasonography is a safe, sensitive, and specific test for the diagnosis of intussusceptions, it should be performed early whenever there is clinical suspicion of intussusception.• Contrast enema is the gold standard for diagnosis and first-line treatment of intussusception. There is an increasing trend for pneumatic reduction of intussusception compared with hydrostatic reduction. Intravenous placement, fluid resuscitation, and notification of the pediatric surgeon should be completed before contrast enema.

Acute bacterial sinusitis in children — initial management by severity: Children with persistent sinusitis may be managed with either an antibiotic or an additional brief period of observation, allowing up to another 3 days to improve, whereas all children diagnosed with severe or worsening sinusitis should start antibiotic treatment. Observation is reasonable because some episodes of persistent sinusitis may improve on their own, and antibiotics can have adverse effects including vomiting, diarrhea, upset stomach, skin rash, allergic reactions, yeast infections, and development of resistant bacteria.

Results

Among the 402 children admitted with acute intussusception, 301 were males, and 101 were females. The average age was 2.4 ± 1.5 years, with the youngest being 2 months old and the oldest 9 years old. Fourteen (3.5%) children were 1–6 months old, 49 (12.2%) were 6–12 months old, 120 (29.8%) were 1–2 years old, 74 (18.4%) were 2–3 years old, 63 (15.7%) were 3–4 years old, 44 (10.9%) were 4–5 years old, and 38 (9.5%) were > 5 years old. The disease onset was most frequent in December (15.2%), but it occurred throughout the year without an obvious central tendency. Most patients did not show an obvious etiology for the disease, while 30 patients (7.5%) had a history of cold food intake, diarrhea, and upper respiratory infection before the onset of the disease. The average time from symptom onset to the initial hospital visit was 13.1 ± 11.0 h, with 277 cases (68.9%) < 12 h, 104 (25.9%) between 12 and 24 h, 18 (4.5%) between 24 and 48 h, and three (0.7%) > 48 h. Among the 402 children, 338 (84.1%) had paroxysmal abdominal pain (young infants presented as paroxysmal crying), and eight patients (2.0%) had a typical triad of intussusception (abdominal pain + bloody stools + abdominal mass). Vomiting occurred in 167 cases (41.5%), bloody stool in 24 (6.0%), and a palpable abdominal mass in 273 (67.9%). The average intussusception depth was 4.0 ± 1.4 cm, with the shortest being 1.1 cm, the longest being 9.0 cm, and the median being 3.9 cm (Table 1).

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^111kNSiX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Recurrent throat infection — watchful waiting policy attributes emphasize evidence quality, benefits and harms, exclusions, and policy level. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A, systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials that fail to show clinically important advantages of surgery over observation alone; Grade C, observational studies showing improvement with watchful waiting. Level of confidence in evidence: High. Benefits: Avoid unnecessary surgery with potential complications of vomiting, bleeding, pain, infection, or anesthesia problems. Risks, harms, costs: Waiting may result in delayed treatment in patients who have unusually frequent and severe recurrent throat infections; potential direct cost of managing future throat infections. Benefits-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments: Panel consensus that tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection should be limited to circumstances for which clinically important benefits are shown in randomized controlled trials; emphasis on avoiding harm related to surgery or anesthesia in a condition that may be largely self-limited. Intentional vagueness: None. Role of patient preferences: None. Exclusions include patients with > 1 peritonsillar abscess, personal or family history of rheumatic heart disease, Lemierre's syndrome, severe infections requiring hospitalization, or numerous repeat infections in a single household ("ping-pong spread"). Policy level: Strong recommendation. Differences of opinions: None.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, more specifically with respect to rapid antigen detection test, IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend to do not test for GAS pharyngitis in < 3 years old pediatric patients because acute rheumatic fever is rare in this age group and the incidence of streptococcal pharyngitis and the classic presentation of streptococcal pharyngitis are uncommon. Consider testing selected patients of this age group in the presence of risk factors, such as an older sibling with group A streptococcal infection.

GRACE-2 scope and purpose — intended population and setting specify an evidence-based, transparent approach for clinicians for the evaluation and management of adult patients with low-risk recurrent undifferentiated abdominal pain in the ED. The guideline is not intended for patients with unstable vital signs or significant history or physical examination findings suggesting acute abdominal pathology or other risk factors for severe abdominal disease, and it is also not intended for new, acute presentations with only short-term recurrence such as evolving appendicitis presenting on two or more occasions over a few days. The intended population includes adults with multiple similar presentations of abdominal signs and symptoms recurring over months or years, and GRACE-2 is designed for application in the United States in settings with access to advanced diagnostic imaging, laboratory testing, and specialty referral, noting that differences in international or rural U.S. settings may make recommendations less applicable.
