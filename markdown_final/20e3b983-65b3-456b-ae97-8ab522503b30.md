## Question

what is the treatment for meralgia parasthetica

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of meralgia paresthetica. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should verify first-line conservative measures and their evidence. Next, I will review pharmacologic options for neuropathic pain. After that, I need to examine interventional therapies, including injections and neuromodulation. Then, I should appraise surgical options and their comparative outcomes. Finally, I will consider special populations, follow-up, and synthesize a practical algorithm with caveats about evidence quality and patient-specific factors.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and exclude mimics, because treatment hinges on getting this right. Meralgia paresthetica classically presents with sensory symptoms confined to the anterolateral thigh distribution of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, without motor deficits, and symptoms are often provoked by standing, walking, or hip extension and relieved by sitting; a positive pelvic compression test can support the diagnosis, though I should double-check that this test's reported sensitivity and specificity come from a small series and should not be overinterpreted [^114f3n5Z] [^117RvjKm]. I need to ensure I exclude lumbar radiculopathy, femoral neuropathy, and hip pathology; if uncertainty remains, targeted neurophysiology or ultrasound can help, but routine electrodiagnostics are not mandatory and may be technically limited in obesity, so I should be selective and correlate with the bedside exam [^111DUzdU] [^116iaJ8z].

> Next, I should review first-line conservative management, because most patients improve without invasive procedures. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence here. The Cochrane review found no randomized trials and highlighted observational data showing spontaneous improvement in a substantial proportion, which means I must be cautious not to overstate certainty while still emphasizing low-risk measures that target compression and inflammation [^1151saGn]. Core steps include weight loss when relevant, avoiding tight belts or clothing, modifying activities that provoke symptoms, and physical therapy focused on core and hip mechanics; adjuncts like NSAIDs may help pain flares, and small studies suggest Kinesio taping can reduce symptom burden, though I should note these are low-level data and not definitive [^116iaJ8z] [^114janSr].

> I will now examine pharmacologic therapy for persistent neuropathic symptoms. Hold on, I should verify that evidence for gabapentinoids in MP specifically is limited; indeed, most high-quality data come from broader neuropathic pain populations, where gabapentin and pregabalin show modest benefit, and duloxetine or venlafaxine are reasonable alternatives per EAN/PNS guidance for painful neuropathies, so I can extrapolate cautiously while monitoring for sedation, dizziness, and edema with gabapentinoids and GI or blood pressure effects with SNRIs [^1121zJ45] [^116Dyqad]. But wait, what if first-line meds are not tolerated or ineffective? Topiramate has case-level pediatric and adult signals in MP and can be considered off-label when standard options fail, recognizing the very low evidence base and the need to balance cognitive side effects [^116CD8Yq].

> Let me consider interventional options next, starting with diagnostic and therapeutic nerve blocks. Ultrasound-guided lateral femoral cutaneous nerve injection with local anesthetic can both confirm the diagnosis when symptoms abate and provide short-term relief; adding corticosteroid is common, but I should double-check the randomized data, which in a small nerve stimulator–guided study showed no superiority of steroid over placebo at 12 weeks, suggesting that the local anesthetic may be the key component and that steroid benefit is uncertain in this context [^115MS3WJ]. Observational ultrasound series report high response rates, but without controls, so I need to counsel patients about variable durability and the possibility of recurrence, and consider repeating injections if relief wanes while we continue conservative measures [^111Tpbab] [^112iJMko].

> Now, I should review pulsed radiofrequency as a minimally invasive bridge for refractory cases. Retrospective series suggest meaningful pain reductions in a majority at 6 months, with low complication rates, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — these are uncontrolled data and patient selection and expectation bias can inflate response; still, given favorable safety, PRF is a reasonable next step before open surgery in carefully selected patients after a positive diagnostic block [^113SWceS] [^111XvVFp]. I need to ensure patients understand that durability varies and that repeat treatment may be necessary if pain returns [^113SWceS].

> Next, I should appraise surgical options and their comparative outcomes. Meta-analytic data suggest higher rates of complete pain relief after neurectomy compared with neurolysis, at the trade-off of permanent anterolateral thigh numbness, which many patients find acceptable when pain is severe. I should confirm that complication rates are broadly similar across interventions in pooled analyses, supporting safety when performed by experienced surgeons [^115peUte]. Wait, let me verify the anatomic rationale surgeons cite; histopathology of chronically compressed segments can show irreversible changes, which supports neurectomy in selected long-standing cases, though I must individualize decisions based on symptom duration, severity, and patient preferences regarding sensory deficit [^113jvQCn]. Technical variants like dynamic decompression or transposition may improve outcomes by addressing multiple compression points and nerve course mechanics, but again, most data are observational, so shared decision-making is essential [^116Z6RSJ] [^11542EHe].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and contexts. In pediatrics, conservative therapy and diagnostic blocks are first-line, with surgery reserved for persistent symptoms. A recent series suggests high rates of accessory nerves and recurrences when anatomy is incompletely addressed, so I should confirm meticulous exploration for variants if operating in adolescents [^11646RcR]. In patients with diabetes or obesity, I should emphasize metabolic optimization and weight management as disease-modifying steps, and in post-surgical or occupational cases, I must identify and remove the compressive source when feasible, including equipment or positioning changes, to reduce recurrence risk [^116iaJ8z] [^114UKcW7] [^111DUzdU].

> Next, I should review follow-up and expectations. Many patients improve spontaneously over months, so I need to avoid premature escalation. If symptoms persist beyond roughly 3–6 months despite optimized conservative care, I should reconsider the diagnosis, repeat a diagnostic block to reconfirm the pain generator, and then discuss interventional or surgical options with transparent counseling about benefits, risks, and the likelihood of residual numbness after neurectomy [^1151saGn] [^111DUzdU]. Hold on, I should verify that shared decision-making is emphasized in the absence of high-quality comparative trials; indeed, guidelines and reviews consistently call for individualized care given the limited RCT evidence base in MP [^1151saGn] [^111DUzdU].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm while keeping the evidence limitations in mind. Start with diagnosis confirmation and exclusion of mimics, implement conservative measures for 3–6 months, add neuropathic medications if pain persists, consider diagnostic/therapeutic ultrasound-guided LFCN injection and, if helpful but transient, PRF or repeat injection, and reserve surgery — neurolysis or neurectomy — for refractory, function-limiting cases after reconfirming the diagnosis and aligning on goals and trade-offs. Throughout, tailor choices to comorbidities, occupational exposures, and patient values, and adjust the plan based on response and anatomy [^113SWceS] [^1151saGn] [^115peUte].

Meralgia paresthetica treatment is **stepwise**: start with conservative measures (weight loss, loose clothing, activity modification, NSAIDs, and neuropathic agents) [^116iaJ8z] [^116Zo1at], then use **ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injections** if symptoms persist [^1132ZcwZ] [^112YSt4e]. If refractory, consider **surgical decompression or neurectomy** [^115peUte], with neurectomy offering higher rates of complete pain relief but at the cost of permanent numbness [^113jvQCn]. Most patients improve with conservative care; surgery is reserved for persistent cases after 3–6 months [^1151saGn] [^116Zo1at].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is **first-line** and effective for many patients [^114LyNVm]:

- **Weight loss**: Reduces abdominal pressure and nerve compression [^112xh1aP].
- **Activity modification**: Avoid prolonged standing, walking, or tight clothing/belts [^114UKcW7].
- **Pharmacologic therapy**: NSAIDs, gabapentin, pregabalin, or duloxetine for pain relief [^116Zo1at] [^116Dyqad].
- **Physical therapy**: Core strengthening and postural training to reduce nerve tension [^112xh1aP].

---

## Interventional procedures

If conservative measures fail, **interventional options** provide additional relief:

- **Ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection**: Effective for symptom relief; 85% success in some series [^111Tpbab] [^1124xffQ].
- **Pulsed radiofrequency ablation**: Offers sustained relief in refractory cases [^113SWceS] [^111XvVFp].
- **Peripheral nerve stimulation**: Minimally invasive option for persistent symptoms [^112YKaHW] [^1112Jv8c].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is reserved for **refractory cases** after 3–6 months of conservative care:

- **Nerve decompression (neurolysis)**: Removes compressive structures; 63% complete pain relief [^115peUte].
- **Neurectomy**: Transection of the LFCN; 85% complete pain relief but with permanent numbness [^115peUte] [^113jvQCn].
- **Transposition**: Mobilizes the nerve to reduce tension and recurrence [^11542EHe].

---

## Comparative effectiveness

| **Treatment modality** | **Effectiveness** | **Complications** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Conservative management | High | Minimal | First-line |
| Corticosteroid injection | Moderate | Minimal | Refractory cases |
| Pulsed radiofrequency | Moderate | Minimal | Refractory cases |
| Nerve decompression | High | Moderate | Refractory cases |
| Neurectomy | Very high | Permanent numbness | Refractory cases |

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing treatment choice

- **Obesity**: Weight loss is critical; surgery may be less effective if BMI remains high [^112xh1aP].
- **Occupation**: Modify activities or use protective gear to reduce compression [^114UKcW7].
- **Comorbidities**: Tailor pharmacologic therapy to comorbid conditions (e.g. diabetes, hypertension) [^notfound].
- **Patient preference**: Shared decision-making is essential, especially for surgery [^115peUte].

---

## Emerging treatments and research gaps

Emerging treatments include **peripheral nerve stimulation** and **novel neuromodulation techniques** [^112YKaHW] [^1112Jv8c]. Research gaps remain, including a **lack of high-quality RCTs** and the need for **long-term outcome data** [^1151saGn] [^1124xffQ].

---

Meralgia paresthetica treatment is **stepwise**: conservative measures first, then injections, and surgery for refractory cases. Most patients improve with conservative care; surgery is reserved for persistent symptoms after 3–6 months [^1151saGn] [^116Zo1at].

### Diagnosis and treatment of meralgia paresthetica between 2005 and 2018: a national cohort study [^113jvQCn]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Throughout the entire study period, surgical management of MP in Germany was conducted using neuropreservative techniques, such as decompression of the LFCN, rather than neurectomy procedures. In the ongoing discussion on which surgical strategy to choose, the most comprehensive meta-analysis had to rely on observational studies in the absence of randomized controlled data. Similar to our findings, it reports that neurolysis was more common than neurectomy. Regarding outcomes, complete pain relief was achieved more often after neurectomy (85%) than decompression surgery (63%). These results are supported by two Cochrane meta-analyses, who report slightly higher rates of postoperative benefit after neurectomy (94%) than after decompression surgery (88%). Surgeons preferring neurectomy over neurolysis frequently point to histopathological findings in the compressed nerve. These findings suggest focal demyelination, thickened perineurium, subperineurial edema, Renaut bodies, and regenerating clusters. One may argue that such morphological changes are irreversible and neurectomy may therefore represent a more effective surgical strategy in MP than neurolysis. Findings in animal models suggest a relationship between the duration of symptoms and reversibility of ischemic damage to the nerve induced by compression, yet clinical data on the reversibility of histopathological changes in nerve compression syndromes in humans is missing. In a recent observational study, hypesthesia in the innervation area of the LFCN after neurectomy was described as not "bothersome", as measured on a bothersomeness scale ranging from 0 to 6. However, a systematic analysis of the effect of anterolateral thigh hypesthesia based on the validated quality-of-life measures is still lacking. A recent description of a more extensive and dynamic decompression technique revealed excellent results in terms of improvement of pain and/or paresthesia (89%), complete restoration of sensory function (69%), and some sensory improvements (26%). Transposition is a technical variation, which was shown to improve outcomes of neurolysis of the LFCN.

### Interventional and multimodal pain rehabilitation in a child with meralgia paresthetica [^114otKSd]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Meralgia paresthetica is a chronic pain syndrome that is extremely rare in the pediatric population. It is manifested by hypesthesia or pain in the distribution of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) and is typically caused by entrapment as the nerve passes deep to the inguinal ligament. This sensory mononeuropathy is rare in children and diagnosis is typically delayed, often leading to prolonged functional impairment and unnecessary medical testing. A 9-year-old girl presented to the pain clinic with a 6-week history of right anterolateral thigh pain first noticed after a nontraumatic cheerleading practice. Comprehensive laboratory and radiographic evaluation by multiple prior specialists revealed no clear nociceptive source of pain. History and examination were consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic, compressive meralgia paresthetica. Conservative management including physical therapy was followed for 2 weeks with only mild improvement noted. To facilitate physical therapy, an ultrasound-guided LFCN block was performed which confirmed the diagnosis by providing complete analgesia. The patient reported overall 25% improvement from multimodal therapy at another 2 weeks. A second LFCN block was performed with complete resolution of symptoms and restoration of function. The patient remains pain-free and has returned to walking, running, and competitive sports. The primary goal of pediatric chronic pain management, regardless of pain etiology, is early restoration of function to avoid prolonged absence from school, sports, or other productive activities and limit the psychological burden of chronic disease.

### A novel approach to the diagnosis and management of meralgia paresthetica [^117RvjKm]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the results of conservative and surgical treatment of meralgia paresthetica (MP), with particular reference to the use of a simple clinical test for diagnosing this condition and the outcome of primary nerve decompression surgery.

Methods

Records of all patients with a diagnosis of MP were reviewed. Information was obtained about clinical presentation and risk factors, diagnostic evaluation, management, and outcome. Actuarial analysis was used to determine the intervention-free interval after surgical decompression.

Results

Between 2000 and 2005, MP was diagnosed in 45 patients. There were 27 men and 18 women, and the average age at presentation and duration of symptoms were 47 and 1.9 years, respectively. The pelvic compression test had a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 93.3% for this condition. Twenty-five patients were managed conservatively and 20 required operative intervention, which was bilateral in two patients. The average follow-up period was 25 months, and the actuarial 2- and 5-year intervention-free rates were 91 and 78%, respectively, with no specific risk factors for revision surgery.

Conclusion

The pelvic compression test is a sensitive and specific test for MP, helping to distinguish it from lumbosacral radicular pain. Most patients with this condition can be managed successfully with conservative measures, and those requiring surgery can be treated effectively with nerve decompression.

### Utility of ultrasound-guided surface electrode placement in lateral femoral cutaneous nerve conduction studies [^114KpCF8]. Muscle & Nerve (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Meralgia paresthetica is a common clinical complaint for which some patients ultimately undergo surgical treatment. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) has been difficult to reliably test electrophysiologically, likely due to anatomic variability and lack of responses in asymptomatic obese subjects.

Methods

We compared a novel ultrasound-guided antidromic sensory nerve conduction study (NCS) with a technique described previously in a population of normal subjects, of whom 50% had body mass indices within the obese range (> 27.5).

Results

Responses were obtained in at least 92% of subjects using either technique, and 92% of normal subjects had < 60% interside variability using the ultrasound-guided technique.

Conclusions

LFCN sensory nerve action potentials can be obtained in the vast majority of normal subjects, even in an obese population and can provide a useful sensory NCS for evaluation of mid-lumbar radiculopathy, plexopathy, or meralgia paresthetica.

### Meralgia paresthetica secondary to lipoma [^112kNEQr]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2010). Low credibility.

Meralgia paresthetica (MP) consists of pain or dysthesia in the lateral thigh caused by entrapment of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) underneath the inguinal ligament. The causes include iliac crest bone graft harvesting, seat belt injury associated with motor vehicle accident, diabetes mellitus, and trauma. The authors present the case of a 50-year-old woman who had a 1-year history of right-sided MP. The patient's history and the results of physical and radiological examinations were otherwise unremarkable except for the finding of a lipoma over the surface of the right sartorius muscle. Electrophysiological studies were interpreted as demonstrating peripheral neuropathy only. Conservative treatment, including heat or ice packing and local anesthetic and steroid injections, failed to control the patient's symptoms. Although sectioning or neurolysis of the LFCN appears to offer good-to-excellent results, the patient underwent excision of the lipoma. The symptoms resolved completely. To the best of the authors' knowledge this is the first case of MP associated with compression caused by a lipoma. The authors conclude that lipoma compression can cause MP, and in such cases, total excision of the lipoma may resolve the condition.

### Antiepileptic drugs for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia [^1121zJ45]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are antiepileptic drugs associated with reduced pain intensity in patients with neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia?

Bottom Line

In treating diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia compared with placebo, gabapentin and pregabalin are associated with a modest increase in the number of patients experiencing meaningful pain reduction. In treating fibromyalgia, compared with placebo, pregabalin alone is associated with a small increase in the number of patients experiencing meaningful pain reduction. There is insufficient evidence for other antiepileptics.

### Diagnosis and treatment of meralgia paresthetica between 2005 and 2018: a national cohort study [^114dperV]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of meralgia paresthetica (MP), which is caused by compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN), has been increasing over recent decades. Since guidelines and large-scale studies are lacking, there are substantial regional differences in diagnostics and management in MP care. Our study aims to report on current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies as well as time trends in clinical MP management in Germany. Patients hospitalized in Germany between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2018, with MP as their primary diagnosis were identified using the International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) code G57.1 and standardized operations and procedures codes (OPS). A total of 5828 patients with MP were included. The rate of imaging studies increased from 44% in 2005 to 79% in 2018 (p < 0.001) and that of non-imaging diagnostic studies from 70 to 93% (p < 0.001). Among non-imaging diagnostics, the rates of evoked potentials and neurography increased from 20%/16% in 2005 to 36%/23% in 2018 (p < 0.001, respectively). Rates of surgical procedures for MP decreased from 53 to 37% (p < 0.001), while rates of non-surgical procedures increased from 23 to 30% (p < 0.001). The most frequent surgical interventions were decompressive procedures at a mean annual rate of 29% (± 5) throughout the study period, compared to a mean annual rate of 5% (± 2) for nerve transection procedures. Between 2005 and 2018, in-hospital MP care in Germany underwent significant changes. The rates of imaging, evoked potentials, neurography, and non-surgical management increased. The decompression of the LFCN was substantially more frequent than that of the LFCN transection, yet both types of intervention showed a substantial decrease in in-hospital prevalence over time.

Trends in non-imaging diagnostics

Among patients hospitalized for MP, the rate of non-imaging diagnostic studies increased from 70% (n = 434) in 2005 to 93% (n = 678) in 2018 (p < 0.001) with an annual average of 69% (± 11) (Fig. 1). The average annual rate of electrophysiological studies throughout the study period was 57% (± 9) (electroencephalography: 4% (± 1), neurography: 18% (± 3), electromyography: 9% (± 2), and evoked potentials: 27% (± 6)). Between 2005 and 2018, rates of evoked potentials and neurography procedures increased from 20%/16% (n = 125/ n = 97) to 36%/23% (n = 261/ n = 166) (p < 0.001, respectively). Rates of electromyography decreased from 11 (n = 69) to 8% (n = 56) (p = 0.009). Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was first performed in 2013, at a rate of 1% (n = 5), increasing to 3% (n = 18) in 2018 (p < 0.001). The average annual prevalence of lumbar puncture in MP patients was 12% (± 1) without significant changes between 2005 (12%/ n = 72) and 2018 (14%/ n = 100) (p = 0.056) (Fig. 3).

### Relieving symptoms of meralgia paresthetica using kinesio taping: a pilot study [^114janSr]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effect of the novel Kinesio taping treatment approach on meralgia paresthetica (MP) symptoms.

Design

Repeated measurements, feasibility study of 1 intervention.

Setting

Referral private physical therapy clinic.

Participants

Men (n = 6) and women (n = 4) with clinically and electromyographically diagnosed MP.

Intervention

Application of Kinesio tape, twice a week for 4 weeks (8 treatment sessions in total).

Main Outcome Measures

Visual analog scale (VAS) of MP symptoms (pain/burning sensation/paresthesia), VAS global quality of life (QOL), and the longest and broadest parts of the symptom area were measured.

Results

All outcome measures significantly improved after 4 weeks of treatment. Mean VAS QOL ± SD decreased from 69.0 ± 23.4 to 35.3 ± 25.2 (t = 4.3; p = 0.002). Mean VAS of MP symptoms ± SD decreased from 60.5 ± 20.8 to 31.4 ± 26.6 (t = 5.9; P > .001). Length and width of affected area decreased from 25.5 ± 5.5 to 13.7 ± 6.7 (t = 5.1; P > .001) and 15.3 ± 2.1 to 7.4 ± 4.3 (t = 5.3; P > .001), respectively.

Conclusions

Kinesio taping can be used in the treatment of MP. Future randomized placebo-controlled trials should be designed with patients and assessors blind to the type of intervention.

### Diagnosis and treatment of meralgia paresthetica between 2005 and 2018: a national cohort study [^116Bx7UP]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first comprehensive analysis of trends in diagnostics and treatment of MP on a national level. The main results are, that diagnostic procedures, both imaging and non-imaging, became more prevalent between 2005 and 2018, while rates of surgical treatment decreased over time, with neuropreservative surgical techniques being performed substantially more frequently than techniques of nerve transection.

The fact that, in Germany, health care professionals increasingly rely on imaging, evoked potentials, and neurography in the diagnosis of MP is especially interesting, since the diagnosis of MP is based first and foremost on clinical examination. Increasing rates of MRI may, in parts, be due to increased incentive to exclude lumbar radiculopathy, given that delayed or false diagnoses comprise about 30% of litigation claims in neurosurgery. Growing rates of MRI in MP diagnostics may also be due to the more widespread availability of MRI and improvements in nerve visualization. This trend could lead to even higher rates of MRI in MP management in the future. The fact that rates of other diagnostics, such as LFCN conduction studies and somatosensory evoked potentials, have also increased over time, may reflect increasingly robust evidence on their merits in MP diagnostics. For example, a study from 2006 found that changes in ipsilateral somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) after stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve showed good sensitivity and specificity (85.7% and 82.4%, respectively; accuracy, 83.3%) for MP without the need for bilateral comparisons.

Regarding trends in MP management, we found that rates of surgical procedures decreased. At the same time, rates of non-surgical treatments and additional procedures focussing on psychosomatic components increased. Decreasing rates of surgical therapy in MP may be explained by improved medical treatment, such as anti-neuropathic pain medication, which may allow patients and therapists to forgo surgery. Another reason may be that a certain proportion of MP surgery may increasingly take place in an ambulatory setup. For example, in other nerve compression syndromes, such as cubital tunnel syndrome, a trend toward outpatient surgical management has been reported. To date, no data on shifts in the management of MP from in-hospital to outpatient environments exist. Therefore, it is unclear how many additional patients are operated on in the outpatient setting. However, even if we cannot assess potential changes in total numbers, we do not expect the proportions of types of surgery to change.

### Diagnosis and treatment of meralgia paresthetica between 2005 and 2018: a national cohort study [^116Fq39X]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Between 2005 and 2018, MP care in Germany underwent significant changes. Rates of imaging, evoked potentials, neurography, and non-surgical management increased, while rates of surgical management decreased. Nerve transections for surgical treatment of MP were substantially less frequent than decompressive techniques.

### Meralgia paraesthetica: ultrasound-guided injection at multiple levels with 12-month follow-up [^112iJMko]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of ultrasound (US)-guided injections around the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) at different levels in meralgia paraesthetica (MP) patients.

Methods

The study was approved by the university ethics committee and informed oral and written consent were obtained from all patients. Between June 2008 and August 2013, 20 patients with symptoms of MP, including nine men (mean age, 61.33 years) and 11 women (mean age 61.18 years), were treated with US-guided injection of steroids along the LFCN at three different levels in a mean of 2.25 sessions. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to measure symptoms before, immediately after and 12 months after treatment.

Results

Complete resolution of symptoms was documented in 15/20 patients (mean VAS decreased from 82 to 0), and partial resolution in the remaining five (mean VAS decreased from 92 to 42), which was confirmed at 12-month follow-up. By using the different levels of injection approach overall significantly better symptom relief was obtained (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

The outcome of US-guided injection along the LFCN can be further improved by injections at different levels (p < 0.05), which was confirmed at 12-month long-term follow-up.

Key Points

Meralgia paraesthetica is an entrapment neuropathy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. Ultrasound proved effective in diagnosis and in guiding injection therapy. Injection at the anterior superior iliac spine has been used previously. Multiple injections along the nerve course were used in this study. Long-term follow-up (12 months) confirmed the results.

Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) in the thigh, commonly referred to as meralgia paresthetica, may be due to obesity, tight clothing and other external factors. We report two cases of meralgia paresthetica due to compression of the LFCN by portable electronic or "smart" devices.

### Clinical indications for image-guided interventional procedures in the musculoskeletal system: a Delphi-based consensus paper from the European society of musculoskeletal radiology (ESSR)-part VII, nerves of the lower limb [^1119Y1x8]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Level of evidence: 4

Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100%

Ethanol neurolysis, cryoneurolysis, and pulsed radiofrequency ablation are described in the literature as treatment options in patients with intractable meralgia paresthetica or in patients after skin grafting from the lateral thigh. A recent retrospective review of six cases showed a substantial decrease in pain at 1 month (in some cases at 12 months) after US-guided radiofrequency ablation in patients with meralgia paresthetica resistant to conservative management. The evidence is limited due to papers reporting small case series or case reports. No matter the method of ablation used, the papers report prolonged pain relief at follow-up.
8 US-guided perineural injection of the first branch of the lateral plantar nerve (Baxter nerve) is a feasible procedure.

Level of evidence: 4.

Agree, n = 52; disagree, n = 1; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 98%

US-guided injection of the Baxter nerve was feasible in a cadaveric study and it could be considered for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. No evidence of vascular injury was reported with the posterior-to-anterior approach. During US-guided perineural injection of the Baxter nerve, the lateral plantar (82%), the medial calcaneal (17%), and the medial plantar nerves (8%) can be involved. This could make the procedure unspecific for diagnostic purposes.
9 US-guided infrapatellar nerve block is a feasible, quick, and safe procedure to be used for post-arthroscopy analgesia. US-guided infrapatellar nerve hydro-dissection followed by corticosteroid injection could be useful in patients with persistent medial knee pain after total knee arthroplasty.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 4th edition [^114K7xdp]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

This is the fourth edition of diagnostic and treatment guidelines for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS; aka reflex sympathetic dystrophy).

Methods

Expert practitioners in each discipline traditionally utilized in the treatment of CRPS systematically reviewed the available and relevant literature; due to the paucity of levels 1 and 2 studies, less rigorous, preliminary research reports were included. The literature review was supplemented with knowledge gained from extensive empirical clinical experience, particularly in areas where high-quality evidence to guide therapy is lacking.

Results

The research quality, clinical relevance, and "state of the art" of diagnostic criteria or treatment modalities are discussed, sometimes in considerable detail with an eye to the expert practitioner in each therapeutic area. Levels of evidence are mentioned when available, so that the practitioner can better assess and analyze the modality under discussion, and if desired, to personally consider the citations. Tables provide details on characteristics of studies in different subject domains described in the literature.

Conclusions

In the humanitarian spirit of making the most of all current thinking in the area, balanced by a careful case-by-case analysis of the risk/cost vs benefit analysis, the authors offer these "practical" guidelines.

### Diabetic mononeuropathies and diabetic amyotrophy [^114r3tMe]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Lower Limb Entrapment Neuropathies

Compression of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh below the inguinal ligament is the most common mononeuropathy in the lower limb. Compression of this nerve causes pain, numbness and parathesis in the antero-lateral thigh (meralgia paresthetica or Bernhardt-Roth syndrome). Surgical therapy is needed occasionally, but should and can be avoided by reducing or eliminating the cause of the pressure.

Involvement of the femoral nerve leads to pain, numbness and loss of sensation over the anterior thigh. Motor involvement leads to quadriceps weakness and wasting and unilateral loss of the patellar reflex. Therapy is again symptomatic with aggressive physical therapy to maintain and improve quadriceps strength.

Peroneal nerve compression at the head of the fibula not only causes pain, paresthesias and numbness over the dorsum of the foot but can in advanced cases lead to unilateral foot drop, which in turn may cause tripping and falls that may be associated with life-threatening injuries. On occasion the foot drop can be bilateral. Treatment for this "cross leg palsy" is again to remove pressure from the nerve and physical therapy to avoid decompression surgery.

Even more rarely compression of the posterior tibia nerve in the tarsal tunnel leads to pain, parasthesias and numbness of the plantar surface of the foot (tarsal tunnel syndrome).

Very Rare Mononeuropathies

Very rarely mononeuropathies involving the phrenic, long thoracic and obturator nerves may occur in patients with diabetes. The theoretical etiologies are external pressure on the nerve, infarction of the nerve or simply hyperglycemia.

### An algorithm approach to phantom limb pain [^115ZHuZv]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Anticonvulsants

Anticonvulsants are also frequently used in the treatment of neuropathic pain including PLP. Gabapentin has an inhibitory action on voltage-gated calcium channels via action on the alpha-2 G-subunit, resulting in inhibition of neurotransmitters and reduction in nerve excitability.

A few studies specifically evaluate gabapentin in the treatment of PLP. There have been several well-constructed, blinded trials by Bone, Nikolajsen, and Smith examining the utility of gabapentin. All noted studies failed to demonstrate a statistically significant treatment response to gabapentin. All three trials were, however, limited by small sample sizes and a Cochrane review combining the results of the studies by Bone and Smith found a statistically significant improvement in pain scores. Overall research appears to favor the use of gabapentin, but further research is needed. Other anticonvulsants including pregabalin, topiramate and zonisamide have been used, but there has been very little overall evidence to support their use in the treatment of PLP. The most commonly reported adverse effects include somnolence, dizziness, headache or nausea.

### Distal lesion of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve [^115mjSWQ]. Muscle & Nerve (2008). Low credibility.

We report three patients with a typical clinical picture of unilateral meralgia paresthetica in whom routine nerve conduction studies were normal. However, cortical somatosensory evoked potentials were absent after lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) stimulation on the affected side. After stimulation of the LFCN in the anterosuperior iliac spine (ASIS) region and recording the responses distal to conventional sites (20 cm from the ASIS), sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) were absent in the symptomatic leg, but present in the normal leg. We suggest that thigh paresthesias may be caused by a distal LFCN lesion. Eliciting this requires recording SNAPs distal to conventional sites.

### Meralgia paresthetica: nerve stimulator-guided injection with methylprednisolone / lidocaine, a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study [^115MS3WJ]. Muscle & Nerve (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Meralgia paresthetica is a mononeuropathy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. A common therapy is injection with corticosteroids. The goal of this study was to analyze the effect of injection with methylprednisolone/lidocaine vs placebo.

Methods

After randomization, 10 patients received a nerve stimulator-guided injection with methylprednisolone/lidocaine, and 10 patients received saline. The primary outcome measure was pain (visual analogue scale, VAS).

Results

In the placebo group, there was a significant pain reduction (baseline VAS, 6.8; VAS week 12, 4.3; p = 0.014). The VAS score in the methylprednisolone group did not show a significant reduction (baseline VAS, 7.4; VAS week 12, 4.8; p = 0.053). There was no significant difference in pain reduction between the groups.

Conclusions

We found no objective evidence for benefit from nerve stimulator-guided injection with corticosteroids in meralgia paresthetica, although this study is limited by a small sample size. Future placebo-controlled studies using ultrasound-guided injection are warranted.

### Diagnosis and treatment of meralgia paresthetica between 2005 and 2018: a national cohort study [^116EpAW1]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Increases in rates of complementary treatment modalities for chronic pain, such as treatment of psychosomatic components, as observed in our analysis in Germany, may reflect changes in chronic pain management toward more holistic approaches. Nevertheless, reports for their particular benefits in MP are lacking.

A major strength of our study is that it allows for a comprehensive nationwide assessment across all disciplines involved in in-hospital MP care. However, our study has certain limitations. The fact that only data from Germany were included may limit the generalizability of our findings to healthcare systems in other countries. Also, the data set used was depersonalized, and therefore, distinct per-person analyses were not possible. Also, we cannot exclude the possibility of multiple inclusions per person. As mentioned above, patients treated in the outpatient sector were not included in our analysis, potentially introducing a certain degree of selection bias. However, surgical MP treatment in Germany is only rarely conducted in ambulatory facilities, and outpatient data on MP are not collected in a centralized system, unlike in-hospital data, which are more reliable in the assessment of treatment trends.

### Transposition of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve [^11542EHe]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Meralgia paresthetica causes pain, burning, and loss of sensation in the anterolateral thigh. Surgical treatment traditionally involves neurolysis or neurectomy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN). After studying and publishing data on the anatomical feasibility of LFCN transposition, the author presents here the first case series of patients who underwent LFCN transposition.

Methods

Nineteen patients with meralgia paresthetica were treated in the Department of Neurological Surgery at University of Wisconsin between 2011 and 2016; 4 patients underwent simple decompression, 5 deep decompression, and 10 medial transposition. Data were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. No randomization was performed. The groups were compared in terms of pain scores (based on a numeric rating scale) and reoperation rates.

Results

The numeric rating scale scores dropped significantly in the deep-decompression (p = 0.148) and transposition (p < 0.0001) groups at both the 3- and 12-month follow-up. The reoperation rates were significantly lower in the deep-decompression and transposition groups (p = 0.0454) than in the medial transposition group.

Conclusions

Both deep decompression and transposition of the LFCN provide better results than simple decompression. Medial transposition confers the advantage of mobilizing the nerve away from the anterior superior iliac spine, giving it a straighter and more relaxed course in a softer muscle bed.

### Meralgia paraesthetica… [^115hdnPS]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In 1895 Bernhardt1 directed attention for the first time to a curious condition, marked by numbness, on the anterior and especially on the outer surface of one thigh, which became relatively painful only after prolonged exertion or on pressure on the abnormally sensitive regions. In the cases that he reported there was no history of bouts of pain which occurred spontaneously during rest. Shortly afterward Roth2 gave the disease its formidable title, "meralgia paraesthetica, " from the Greek words meros and algos. It is our purpose in this paper to review the present status of this disease and to analyze the clinical observations on a series of cases that have been studied under standard conditions for a moderately long time.

### Treatment for meralgia paraesthetica [^1151saGn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Meralgia paraesthetica is a clinical syndrome for which a number of treatments are in common use, including conservative measures, injection of corticosteroid with local anaesthetic and surgery. We aimed to examine the evidence for the relative efficacy of these interventions. This review was first published in 2008. Searches were updated in 2010 and 2012.

Objectives

To assess the relative efficacy of commonly used treatments for meralgia paraesthetica.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (1 October 2012), CENTRAL (2012, issue 9 in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2012) and CINAHL Plus (January 1937 to October 2012) for randomised controlled studies. Non-randomised studies were identified by searching MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2012) and EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2012). We also inspected the reference lists of these studies.

Selection Criteria

We were unable to identify any randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs. We therefore looked for high quality observational studies meeting the following criteria: (1) At least five cases of meralgia paraesthetica. (2) Follow-up of at least three months after intervention (if any). (3) At least 80% of cases followed up.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently extracted relevant data from each study meeting the selection criteria and transferred into a data extraction form.

Main Results

We found no RCTs or quasi-RCTs in the original review or updates in 20011 and 2012. Cure or improvement have been described in high quality observational studies: (1) A single study describes spontaneous improvement of meralgia paraesthetica in 20 (69%) of 29 cases. (2) Four studies evaluating the injection of corticosteroid and local anaesthetic found cure or improvement in 130 (83%) out of a combined total of 157 cases. (3) Surgical treatments have been found to be beneficial in 264 (88%) out of 300 cases treated with decompression (nine studies); and 45 (94%) out of 48 cases treated with neurectomy (three studies). (4) Ninety-nine (97%) out of 102 patients with iatrogenic meralgia paraesthetica recovered completely (three studies).

Authors' Conclusions

In the absence of any published RCTs or quasi-RCTs, the objective evidence base for treatment choices in meralgia paraesthetica is weak. High quality observational studies report comparable high improvement rates for meralgia paraesthetica following local injection of corticosteroid and surgical interventions (either nerve decompression or neurectomy). However, a similar outcome has been reported without any intervention in a single natural history study.

### Ultrasound-guided diagnosis and treatment of meralgia paresthetica [^112xh1aP]. Pain Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Meralgia paresthetica refers to the entrapment of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve at the level of the inguinal ligament. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve - a purely sensory nerve - arises from the L2 and L3 spinal nerve roots, travels downward lateral to the psoas muscle, and then crosses the iliacus muscle. Close to the anterior superior iliac spine, the nerve courses in contact with the lateral aspect of the inguinal ligament and eventually innervates the lateral thigh. The entrapment syndrome is usually idiopathic but can also ensue due to trauma/overuse, pelvic and retroperitoneal tumors, stretching of the nerve due to prolonged leg/trunk hyperextension, leg length discrepancies, prolonged standing, external compression by belts, weight gain, and tight clothing. The diagnosis of Meralgia paresthetica is usually clinical, i.e., based on the following symptoms: paresthesia, numbness, burning sensation, dysesthesia, and pain over the anterolateral aspects of the thigh. These complaints may be worsened by walking or prolonged standing and typically disappear after weight loss, abdominal muscle strengthening, or elimination of the underlying cause. Although there are several reports on the confirmatory role of electrodiagnostic studies in the diagnosis of Meralgia paresthetica, electromyographers would usually prefer/suggest not to perform nerve conduction studies in daily clinical practice. Herewith, due to its several advantages, ultrasound imaging has been proposed as an alternative diagnostic method in the recent literature. It not only confirms the entrapment morphologically, but also uncovers a likely underlying cause and provides immediate interventional guidance. The pertinent sonographic findings would be hypoechoic and swollen lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.

During the last 20 years there has been solid evidence of peripheral neuropathy caused by statins, with a risk of one in 10,000 patients treated for 1 year. Meralgia paresthetica is an entrapment neuropathy occasionally encountered by primary care physicians. To date there has been no report of entrapment neuropathy that could have been caused or aggravated by statins. This case report presents meralgia paresthetica aggravated by simvastatin use that disappeared after simvastatin cessation.

A 53-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis (PD) presented with a 3-month history of intermittent numbness and paraesthesia over the anterior aspect of the right thigh. The patient noticed the pain was worse on walking and related to dialysis sessions. An examination revealed no neurovascular abnormalities or abdominal masses. However, there was subjective paraesthesia in the distribution of the right lateral cutaneous nerve. Subsequent nerve conduction studies revealed the cause of the patient's symptoms.

### Occupational nerve injuries [^114UKcW7]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

4.2.2 Lateral femoral cutaneous neuropathy

Lateral femoral cutaneous neuropathy can arise from compression or friction at the nerve's exit from the pelvis, adjacent to the anterior superior iliac spine. It can present with the clinical syndrome of meralgia paresthetica: paresthesia or dysesthesia along the anterolateral thigh. This syndrome is frequently noted in those who wear tight pants, the obese or pregnant, or those who have lost weight. Accordingly, specific occupational cases are associated with direct nerve compression by equipment. It has been noted in police officers due to gun holsters or belts, soldiers due to body armor, and a lawn mower due to flexion at the waist while sitting with a tight belt. Pressure or trauma on the thigh appeared causative in reports of masons lifting bags of cement or catching them on the thigh and in a sidewalk salesman carrying a heavy sign on the proximal thigh. The reported cases were diagnosed clinically without electrodiagnostic confirmation, and symptoms generally resolved with modifications to activity and/or clothing, with additional conservative measures in some cases.,

There is weak data guiding the treatment of meralgia paresthetica of any cause. The majority appear to have a spontaneous recovery, but for those with persistent symptoms not responding to conservative measures, perineural injection and surgical decompression are effective in the majority of patients.

4.3 Special consideration: Neuralgic amyotrophy

A scientific understanding of neuralgic amyotrophy (NA), also known as Parsonage–Turner syndrome, is limited but rapidly evolving. Relevance to occupational nerve injury is twofold. First, occupational biomechanical factors are emerging as contributory to causation. Second, the classic clinical presentation can mimic other, more direct occupational injuries, and can confound the diagnosis, leading to suboptimal treatment planning and expectation management.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^116iaJ8z]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Meralgia Paresthetica (MP)

In meralgia paresthetica, the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) is compressed, which results in sensory abnormalities along the lateral and anterolateral thigh. Since there is no motor component to the nerve, MP does not cause weakness. MP has been associated with metabolic factors such as diabetes mellitus and alcoholism, in addition to mechanical factors such as obesity, tight-fitting clothing around the waist (e.g. uniforms, jeans, belts, etc.), and lumbopelvic or lower extremity surgery as a result of direct trauma or positioning during surgery.

Clinically, MP is less common and tends to present much differently than the other conditions discussed thus far. Patients with MP often complain of numbness, tingling, and/or itching, more so than pain, and this is reflected in the algorithm in Figure 1. Additionally, whereas patients with lumbar radicular pain usually have difficulty describing the exact region of sensory symptoms, patients with MP can often precisely trace the affected cutaneous distribution of the LFCN (see Figure 3B). On physical exam, MP may cause dysesthesias over the entire anterolateral thigh, but it does not cause frank tenderness over the GT like GTPS does. It is important to note that as the prevalence of obesity rises, MP can co-exist with the other conditions that cause lateral hip and thigh pain.

To confirm the diagnosis of MP, patients can be referred for a nerve conduction study, but this test is technically difficult, particularly in obese individuals. Ultrasound, when performed by an experienced ultrasonographer, and magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) can also be useful diagnostically by detecting morphologic changes to the LFCN in people with MP.

Conservative management of MP involves losing weight, loosening clothing around the waist, and avoiding positions such as excessive hip extension, which can compress the LFCN under the inguinal ligament or elsewhere along its course. Additionally, KinesioTaping can be considered. If conservative measures do not result in symptom relief, patients can be referred to an interventional pain specialist for possible LFCN diagnostic nerve block, neurolysis, and/or neurectomy [46].

Meralgia Paresthetica (Lateral Femoral Cutaneous Nerve)

Meralgia paresthetica is characterized by entrapment of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, originating from spinal levels L2–3 and often presenting with numbness, dysesthesia, and occasionally pain over the anterior thigh. Evidence is currently limited to case reports and one case series. One case report, demonstrated 100% pain reduction using a 60-day temporary stimulator (SPRINT) sustained at 12 months with discontinuation of gabapentin. Another case report, described 80% relief at 3 months with a temporary device (SPRINT). One final case series (n = 3), implanted a permanent peripheral nerve stimulator (Bioness Stimrouter) with an external generator and achieved 100% VAS improvement and 70% activity improvement. More extensive case series are necessary to assess long-term results for meralgia paresthetica PNS. (Level II-3, Grade B)

Lower Extremity (Sciatic, Femoral, Saphenous Nerves)

Peripheral nerve stimulation has been applied to the femoral, sciatic, and saphenous nerves for managing nociceptive and neuropathic postoperative and chronic lower extremity pain. Femoral nerve PNS and sciatic nerve PNS are effective in a sham-controlled RCT managing immediate postoperative pain using temporary lead placement for 14 days and were effective in reducing opioid requirements and pain(Level 1, Grade A evidence). Other studies have demonstrated the use of PNS in postoperative pain management, improving recovery times and reducing opioid requirements. Femoral nerve PNS is a desirable target nerve for managing postoperative knee pain, particularly post ACL reconstruction. Sciatic nerve stimulation has been used for postoperative pain after foot/ankle surgery. Unfortunately, knee and ankle pain can persist beyond the immediate postoperative period. Permanently implanted saphenous nerve stimulation has been used to treat persistent knee pain. Future studies will help better understand candidates for therapy and long-term success rates.

Trends in MP treatment

The rates of in-hospital surgical procedures for MP decreased from 53% (n = 332) in 2005 to 37% (n = 243) in 2018 (mean 48% ± 9, p < 0.001), while non-surgical procedures (spinal and local injections, physiotherapy, electrotherapy) increased from 23 (n = 144) to 30% (n = 215) (mean 26% ± 4, p < 0.001). Additional therapies, such as the treatment of psychosomatic and psychic components of MP, increased from 0 (n = 0) to 6% (n = 40), with a mean annual rate of 1.3% (± 2; p < 0.001) (Fig. 1). Throughout the entire study period, the most frequent surgical interventions were decompressive procedures, with an annual average rate of 29% (± 5), but a decrease over time from 32% (n = 202) in 2005 to 22% (n = 159) in 2018 (p < 0.001). Rates of nerve transection procedures at the LFCN ranged substantially lower, at an annual average of 5% (± 2), and also showed a decreasing trend from 8 (n = 52) to 3% (n = 19) (p < 0.001). Neuro-modulative procedures were first performed for MP in 2011 at a rate of 0.7% (n = 6), increasing to 1.8% (n = 13) in 2018 (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4).

### A review of nonsurgical neurolytic procedures for neuropathic pain [^111WaFgE]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Other successful cases of using ultrasound-guided alcohol neurolysis for pain management include neurolysis of the lateral femoral nerve for intractable meralgia paresthetica, a rare sensory entrapment mononeuropathy, and in combination with and without RFA for painful stump neuroma. In a retrospective case series of 6 patients with meralgia paresthetica, 3 mL of 50% alcohol in 0.25% bupivacaine was injected, and resulting pain relief lasted for up to 12 weeks. In the initial study of alcohol neurolysis of painful stump neuroma, 1.2 mL of anhydrous alcohol was injected into the nerves proximal to the neuroma, and when pain returned several months later, repeat neurolysis with 0.3 mL of anhydrous alcohol was performed. In the second study of painful stump neuroma, 10 mL of local anesthetic was administered around the nerve proximal to the neuroma prior to administering 2 to 5 mL of anhydrous alcohol solution into the neuroma body. In this study, 7 of 15 subjects (54%) achieved pain relief following one to three alcohol neurolysis treatments performed 2 weeks apart.

No clear correlation exists between the volume and concentration of alcohol used and associated adverse effects. Theoretically, injection of alcohol or phenol (discussed in the next section) could result in seizures, central nervous system depression, and cardiovascular collapse. Unlike phenol, a possible complication of alcohol injection is inebriation, potentially limiting its use in children and those with liver impairment. Compared to phenol injection, alcohol injection acts more slowly and is more irritating to adjacent tissue. However, most studies of alcohol neurolysis have demonstrated limited local site injection pain and sensory dysesthesias that are limited to a few weeks' duration and that respond well to oral antiepileptic or antidepressant medication.

### Conservative treatment versus ultrasound-guided injection in the management of meralgia paresthetica: a randomized controlled trial [^1132ZcwZ]. Pain Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Meralgia paresthetica (MP) is an entrapment mononeuropathy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN), in which conservative treatment options are not always sufficient.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasound (US)-guided LFCN injection in the management of MP by comparing with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy and sham TENS therapy.

Study Design

A prospective, randomized, sham-controlled study.

Setting

Health Sciences University Training and Research Hospital in Turkey.

Methods

Patients diagnosed with LFCN compression with clinical and electrophysiological findings were included in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to 3 groups: (1) US-guided injection group, (2) TENS group, and (3) sham TENS group. The blockage of the LFCN was performed for therapeutic MP management in group 1. Ten sessions of conventional TENS were administered to each patient 5 days per week for 2 weeks, for 20 minutes per daily session in group 2, and sham TENS was applied to group 3 with the same protocol. Visual Analog Scale (VAS), painDETECT questionnaire, Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test (SWMt), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and health-related quality of life (36-Item Short Form Health Survey [SF-36]) at onset (T1), 15 days after treatment (T2), and 1 month after treatment (T3) were used for evaluation. Patients and the investigator who evaluated the results were blinded to the treatment protocol during the study period.

Results

A total of 54 of the 62 patients (group 1 n = 17, group 2 n = 16, group 3 n = 21) completed the study, 3 patients from group 1, 4 patients from group 2, and 1 patient from group 3 dropped out during the follow-up period. The mean changes in painDETECT and SWMt scores showed a statistically significant difference between groups in favor of group 1 at T2 and T3 compared with T1 (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between groups in terms of VAS, SF-36, and PSQI scores (P > 0.05). In-group analysis of VAS scores showed a statistically significant decrease in T2 and T3 compared with T1 in group 1 (P < 0.05). In-group analysis of the VAS scores statistically significant decrease was shown in T2 compared with T1 in group 2 (P < 0.05). In-group analysis of painDETECT scores statistically significant decrease was shown in T2 and T3 compared with T1 in all groups (P < 0.05). In-group analysis of SWMt scores statistically significant decrease was shown in T2 and T3 compared with T1 in group 1 (P < 0.05). In-group analysis of SF-36 and PSQI scores, there was no statistically significant decrease in all groups (P > 0.05).

Limitations

The limitation of the study was a short follow-up period.

Conclusions

US-guided LFCN injection and TENS may be therapeutic options for MP treatment, however, for patients with neuropathic pain symptoms, US-guided LFCN injection may be a safe and alternative method to conservative treatment.

Key Words

Meralgia paresthetica, ultrasound-guided injection, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.

### Central and peripheral nervous system complications of COVID-19: a prospective tertiary center cohort with 3-month follow-up [^117KEEj1]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Neurological complications are common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, occur mainly in severely affected patients in the ICU and can often be attributed to critical illness. In cases in which neurological disease was likely directly associated with COVID-19, we did not find signs of viral invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into the CNS or PNS, but laboratory inflammatory changes suggested autoimmune-mediated para- and post-infectious mechanisms. In this consecutive sample of 61 COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary hospital, the most common CNS and PNS complications were encephalopathy and CIPM, respectively, while other specific neurological presentations included akinetic mutism, acute necrotizing encephalopathy, transverse myelitis (autoimmune-mediated, CNS), and meralgia paresthetica (treatment-related, PNS).

### Ultrasound-guided treatment of meralgia paresthetica (lateral femoral cutaneous neuropathy): technical description and results of treatment in 20 consecutive patients [^111Tpbab]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purposes of this study were to describe a technique for treatment of meralgia paresthetica (lateral femoral cutaneous neuropathy) using ultrasound guidance and to report the results of treatment.

Methods

Twenty consecutive patients (7 male and 13 female; age range, 23–66 years; mean, 39 years) with meralgia paresthetica confirmed by electromyography were treated with perineural injection of 1 mL of methylprednisolone acetate (40 mg/mL) and 8 mL of mepivacaine, 2%, under direct ultrasound guidance. Main outcome measures included the technical success of the procedure, visual analog scale score for the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (pain, burning sensation, and paresthesia), and visual analog scale global quality of life score.

Results

Technical success (successful nerve block at the distribution of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve) was achieved in all patients. Five patients felt slight sharp pain during needle insertion. The symptoms in 16 patients (80%) diminished progressively after the first week. The 4 remaining patients (20%) required a further perineural injection. The symptoms disappeared in all patients 2 months after injection (mean visual analog scale score ± SD for lateral femoral cutaneous neuropathy at baseline, 8.1 ± 2.1; at 2 months, 2.1 ± 0.5; t = 6.2; P < .001). The mean visual analog scale quality of life scored decreased from 6.9 ± 3.2 to 2.3 ± 2.5 (t = 5.3; P < .002).

Conclusions

Treatment of meralgia paresthetica with ultrasound-guided perineural injections resulted in substantial symptom relief in most patients 2 months after injection. Randomized placebo-controlled trials of this treatment should be considered in the future.

### Clinical efficacy of pulsed radiofrequency neuromodulation for intractable meralgia paresthetica [^113SWceS]. Pain Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Meralgia paresthetica (MP) is a neurologic disorder of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN), which is characterized by a localized area of paresthesia and numbness on the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. In most patients with MP, symptoms can be successfully managed with conservative treatment. However, in a small group of MP patients who are refractory to medical treatment, more aggressive low-risk treatment should be considered.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate clinical outcomes of pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) neuromodulation of the LFCN in MP patients refractory to conservative treatment.

Study Design

Retrospective evaluation.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 11 patients with medically intractable MP who underwent PRF neuromodulation of the LFCN. These patients with MP underwent a diagnostic LFCN block using 2.0% lidocaine. Temporary pain relief > 50% was considered to be a positive response to the diagnostic nerve block. Following a positive response to the diagnostic nerve block, patients underwent PRF neuromodulation at 42 degrees for 2 minutes. Patient pain was evaluated using a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS). In MP patients who received PRF, we statistically evaluated VAS scores and the presence of any complications for 6 or more months after the procedure.

Results

The mean initial patient VAS score was 6.4 ± 0.97 cm. This score was decreased to 0.91 ± 0.70 cm, 0.82 ± 0.75 cm, and 0.63 ± 0.90 cm at the one-, 3-, and 6- month follow-ups, respectively (P < 0.001). Sixty-three point six percent of patients achieved complete pain relief (pain-free) in the last follow-up, whereas 27.3% of patients achieved successful pain relief (= 50% reduction in pain as determined by the VAS score). Furthermore, we did not observe any complications after the procedure.

Conclusion

PRF neuromodulation of the LFCN provides immediate and long-lasting pain relief without complications. Therefore, PRF of the LCFN can be used as an alternative treatment in patients with MP who are refractory to conservative medical treatment.

### Meralgia paresthetica: diagnosis and management strategies [^113QqTpw]. Pain Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Meralgia paresthetica (MP), coined from the Greek words meros (thigh and algos), meaning pain, is a neurological disorder characterized by a localized area of paresthesia and numbness on the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. The incidence of MP is more common than often reported in the literature. The etiology of MP includes mechanical factors such as obesity, pregnancy, and other conditions associated with increased intrabdominal pressure, surgery of the spine, and pelvic osteotomy. A coherent history and pertinent physical examination is essential in making the diagnosis; however, red flags such as tumor and lumbar disk herniations must be recognized and appropriately treated. While the diagnosis of MP is essentially a clinical diagnosis, sensory nerve conduction velocity studies are a useful adjunctive diagnostic tool. The management of MP includes treating the underlying cause (if any) and conservative management. Surgery should only be adopted when all nonoperative therapies have failed to manage the condition in an effective manner.

### Peripheral nerve stimulation: a new treatment for meralgia paresthetica [^112YKaHW]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Meralgia paresthetica is a condition caused by entrapment of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve that leads to paresthesia along the anterolateral portion of the thigh. Because of advancements in neuromodulation, peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) has been considered a new treatment option for meralgia paresthetica. Newer PNS technology targets peripheral nerves directly yet in a minimally invasive manner. We report a case in which a PNS device provided more than 12 months of complete pain relief in a patient with meralgia paresthetica and helped the patient avoid a neurolysis procedure.

Case Presentation

A 57-year-old male presented to clinic with a 6-year history of "painful numbness [and] burning" along the right lateral thigh. He rated his pain as 8 out of 10, which decreased to a rating of 2 out of 10 with the use of gabapentin, but unwanted side effects motivated him to seek alternative treatment. On the basis of his history, physical exam, and imaging results, he was diagnosed with meralgia paresthetica. He was offered neurolysis; however, after seeing a pain specialist, he agreed to the implantation of a SPRINT peripheral nerve stimulator. After the implantation procedure, his pain reduced to 0 out of 10, and his quality of life improved, with better sleep and less somnolence. The device was removed after 60 days, as planned. He continued to have complete resolution of pain at 12 months after the date of device implantation.

Conclusion

With recent advancements, PNS can be used to treat meralgia paresthetica in an effective yet minimally invasive manner. As newer PNS technology becomes more familiar to physicians and pain specialists, it is likely to be used as a mainstay treatment for meralgia paresthetica.

### Diagnosis and treatment of meralgia paresthetica between 2005 and 2018: a national cohort study [^111DUzdU]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Meralgia paresthetica (MP) is the compression syndrome of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) resulting in numbness and/or painful dysesthesia of the anterolateral thigh. For a long time, it was considered a rare disease, but, beginning in the 1990s, a substantial increase in its prevalence has been observed, most likely due to growing rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM).

In the absence of high-quality clinical trial data on MP, guidelines are lacking. Care for MP is determined predominantly by surgeon preference and experience. Most therapists agree that the diagnosis of MP is based primarily on clinical examination and patient history. To rule out a lumbar radiculopathy as a differential diagnosis, a spinal MRI is recommended. Neurophysiologic work-up may include LFCN conduction studies or somatosensory evoked potentials.

Treatment options include local injections, open neurolysis or neurectomy, and various neuro-modulative approaches. If surgical therapy is necessary, a variety of techniques exist. Some groups prefer decompressive techniques with nerve preservation or even transposition while others recommend neurectomy of the LFCN. A recent meta-analysis found slightly superior pain relief and lower rates of revision procedures for neurectomy, compared to decompressive procedures.

Large-scale evidence on the choice of diagnostic and therapeutic modalities in MP is lacking. The assessment of current practice, potential variations, and time trends has never been performed. We designed a national study aiming to report current practice in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients hospitalized for MP in Germany and time trends between years 2005 and 2018.

### Meralgia paresthetica: what an anesthesiologist needs to know [^114LyNVm]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Meralgia paresthetica (MP) is an entrapment pain syndrome of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) of thigh. Diagnosis is principally made on clinical ground with pain and paresthesia of the anterolateral thigh. Electrophysiological test and nerve block play important roles when the diagnosis is uncertain. Clinicians should be aware of the various etiological factors that can be potentially modified or treated. Most of the patients respond to conservative management including nerve block. Surgical options should be considered in patients refractory to those treatment options. Anesthesiologists are commonly involved in the management of MP because of their expertise in pain management and performance of the LFCN block. Blockade of the LFCN with local anesthetics and steroid serves both the diagnostic and therapeutic role.

### Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve radiofrequency ablation for long-term control of refractory meralgia paresthetica [^112u3ZzB]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Meralgia paresthetica is a term used to describe a clinical pain syndrome related to the compression or irritation of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN). The LFCN is a pure sensory nerve that is susceptible to compression injury. The most common compression locations are: as it courses from the lumbosacral plexus, through the abdominal cavity, under the inguinal ligament, and into the subcutaneous tissue of the thigh.

Methods

This case series is a retrospective single-center review of six patients with medically intractable meralgia paresthetica who were treated with radiofrequency ablation. To be considered for radiofrequency ablation, the patient must have been unsuccessful with medical management alone for more than two months and have a clinical diagnosis of meralgia paresthetica. Temporary relief of pain of 50% or greater was considered a positive result. Average pain scores were measured pre- and postprocedure, along with one-, two-, three-, and six-month intervals postoperation.

Results

All patients demonstrated immediate relief in self-reported pain scores, averaging a 75.5% reduction in pain. At the one-, two-, three-, and six-month follow-ups, patients averaged a reduction of 60.0%, 58.0%, 51.4%, and 40.5%, respectively. Both the postop and one-month follow-up pain scores were lower, statistically significantly so (P < 0.05), whereas the two-, three-, and six-month follow-ups were not statistically different from pretreatment scores.

Conclusions

Although our study was small, radiofrequency ablation showed a clear reduction in average pain scores in a subset of patients who had failed standard medical therapy with a reduction in pain at one-month follow-up with relief of symptoms sometimes lasting longer than 12months.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^116BE912]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The Rationale for Functional Restoration

CRPS can be a very difficult condition to treat successfully. Not only is the syndrome bio-medically multifaceted, comprising both central and peripheral pathophysiology, but it also frequently contains psychosocial components that are additional pivotal diagnostic features (and thus, critical treatment targets). The array of possible patient presentations and the fact that the presentation often changes over time also complicate successful identification and treatment. To further add to the clinical challenges of managing CRPS, the epidemiology and natural history of CRPS are only superficially known; evidence concerning CRPS treatment has developed slowly due in large part to the early vagaries of diagnosis (see above); and, moreover, research data — when they are available — are sometimes challenging to interpret. Given these obstacles to diagnosis, treatment, and research, how is a specialist to embark on a path toward the successful treatment of such a complicated and partially understood condition? The only treatment methodology that can possibly successfully span these gaps in medical science is a systematic and orderly interdisciplinary approach. Interdisciplinary treatment is defined (here) as a dedicated, coherent, coordinated, specially trained group of relevant professionals that meet regularly to plan, coordinate care, and adapt to treatment eventualities. Less desirable (but more accessible) is multidisciplinary treatment (a single practitioner coordinates all the various specialties).

### Clinical indications for image-guided interventional procedures in the musculoskeletal system: a Delphi-based consensus paper from the European society of musculoskeletal radiology (ESSR)-part VII, nerves of the lower limb [^112YSt4e]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

In a randomized trial, Nielsen et al. showed that US-guided lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block is safe and easy to perform with high success of analgesia. Randomized controlled studies have shown improved postoperative experience in patients undergoing reconstructive surgery with lateral/anterolateral skin graft or as postoperative pain management in patients undergoing hip arthroplasty. However, in total hip arthroplasty, there is variability in anatomical placement of incision lines among different surgeons and it must be noted that there is limited analgesic effect if a posterior incision line is made. A randomized study on healthy volunteers showed that the blocked sensory area is significantly larger when lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block is performed with 16 mL ropivacaine 0.75% than when it is performed with 8 mL ropivacaine 0.75%. However, it does not result in greater coverage of the posterior or lateral incision lines used for total hip arthroplasty.
6 US-guided corticosteroid perineural injections of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve are an effective treatment option in the management of meralgia paresthetica.

Level of evidence: 4

Agree, n = 53; disagree, n = 0; abstain, n = 0. Agreement = 100%

Two studies, both presenting a case series of 20 patients, showed that US-guided corticosteroid perineural injection is a good treatment option in the management of meralgia paresthetica. Tagliafico et al. showed resolution of symptoms in all patients 2 months after injection; however, Klauser et al. showed complete resolution of symptoms in 75% of patients and partial resolution in 25% of patients at 12-month follow-up. In the study by Klauser et al. a subgroup of patients with meralgia paresthetica underwent multiple sessions of lateral femoral cutaneous nerve corticosteroid injections at different levels (at anterior superior iliac spine, distal inguinal ligament, or lower thigh). The study showed that corticosteroid injections at multiple levels along the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve lead to a significantly better outcome at 12-month follow-up.
7 Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve ablation may be effective in patients with intractable meralgia paresthetica and in patients after skin grafting from the lateral thigh, but further data is needed.

### An overview of the non-procedural treatment options for peripheral neuropathic pain [^117QeyC9]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Peripheral neuropathic pain is a common condition affecting a large portion of the population. Treatment choices are broad and diverse, giving clinicians a variety of options that can be tailored to the individual patient. While medications have the highest level of evidence for treatment, other options including therapy, modality, psychological, and lifestyle approaches should be considered as a part of the treatment algorithm. These approaches can often be used in tandem to hopefully provide the patient with a well‐rounded treatment plan for peripheral neuropathic pain.

Materials and methods

Study setting and data acquisition

In 2005, Germany had 82,437,995 inhabitants, compared to 83,019,213 in 2018. The German health system is mainly funded by the government. About one-third of all hospitals are run by private companies. Data on all patients hospitalized in Germany between 2005 and 2018 with International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) code G57.1, which represents the diagnosis of MP, were provided by the German Federal Statistical Office (GFSO) for every 2nd year as well as 2018 and were included in the analysis. Ethical approval for this study was granted by local authorities (EA 1/275/20). Inclusion criteria were the main diagnosis of MP represented by the ICD code G57.1. Patients hospitalized with MP as their main diagnosis in years 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2018 entered the final analysis. The ICD10 main diagnosis refers to the diagnosis that is the cause for hospitalization. Procedures are coded according to the German operations and procedures codes (OPS). An unlimited number of procedures can be assigned to a single patient. Different chapters describe the procedure type, such as chapter 1 — diagnostic procedures, chapter 3 — imaging methods, chapter 5 — surgical procedures, chapter 6 — specific drug applications, chapter 8 — nonsurgical therapeutic procedures, and chapter 9 — additional procedures. Outpatient data on MP were not included in the analysis as they are not available through the GFSO.

Statistical analysis

Rates for diagnostics and procedures were calculated relative to patients hospitalized for MP. The presence of systematic time trends was investigated with the prop.trend.test-function. No adjustment for multiple testing was done. Rates of events in patients with MP are expressed as annual averages in % of patients hospitalized for the main diagnosis of MP. All analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism Version 8, IBM SPSS Statistics version 27, and R Version 4.0.0.

### Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation offers partial relief in notalgia paresthetica patients with a relevant spinal pathology [^114hBuZu]. The Journal of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

There is yet no established mode of curative treatment for notalgia paresthetica (NP). We had previously shown a correlation of NP localization with relevant spinal changes which led us to speculate on the possible role of spinal nerve impingement in the pathogenesis of this entity. Based on these findings we aimed to investigate the possible effect of physical therapy in selected cases of NP. Fifteen NP patients with a relevant spinal pathology (four men and 11 women) were included in the study. The mean age was 52.80 ± 8.83 years (± SD; range, 39–73). NP duration was 8.9 ± 8.13 years (range, 1.5–30). All patients received 10 conventional transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) sessions in the symptomatic area of 20 min duration and high frequency (50–100 Hz). From an initial pruritus score of 10, the mean score by the end of first week was 7.67 ± 2.02 (range, 5–10) and by the end of second week it was 6.80 ± 2.73 (range, 4–11). The differences between the pretreatment and post-treatment scores were statistically significant. There was no correlation of therapeutic benefit with age or disease duration. We believe that the partial therapeutic benefit of TENS in NP patients is of importance and further research on the effects of various physical therapeutic modalities would be worthwhile.

### Physical medicine and rehabilitation role on notalgia paresthetica: case report and treatment review [^112qM5LR]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Notalgia paresthetica is a rarely reported T2-T6 sensory neuropathy whose etiology and treatment are not fully established. Although it is believed to be common in dermatological practice, it remains underrecognized, underdiagnosed, and therefore underreported. This case-report provides a physical medicine and rehabilitation perspective on notalgia paresthetica diagnosis and treatment. This article presents a case report of a 39-yr-old woman with pain, pruritus, and a hyperpigmented area in the right dorsal infra scapular region. The diagnosis of notalgia paresthetica was established. She was successfully treated with topical anesthetics, postural corrective exercises, scapular muscle strengthening, and pectoral muscle stretching. In this context, different treatment options were reviewed. A small set of pharmacological and nonpharmacological techniques were identified. Several of these modalities belong to the physical medicine and rehabilitation field of action.

### Meralgia paraesthetica… [^114f3n5Z]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

THE SYNDROME of burning, tingling, and numbness of the anterolateral thigh was described by Bernhardt1 in 1895. It was named meralgia paraesthetica the same year. Many causes for this syndrome involving the distribution of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve of the thigh have been suggested. It has been implied that it can be caused by intrapelvic disease, herpes zoster, and a congenitally tight foramen where the nerve passes through the inguinal ligament just medial to the anterior superior iliac portion of the spine. It has also been associated with osteoarthritis of the lumbar spine and herniated disk on the opposite side, the symptom secondary to muscle spasm. Most often, it is caused from various kinds of trauma secondary to mechanical causes. Mechanical causes were suggested by Stookey2 in 1928. He was impressed by the accentuation of the symptoms when patients stood or walked and the relief of symptoms Massey EW. Meralgia Paraesthetica: An Unusual Case. JAMA.

### The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve canal [^1144zjBe]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE Meralgia paresthetica causes dysesthesias and burning in the anterolateral thigh. Surgical treatment includes nerve transection or decompression. Finding the nerve in surgery is very challenging. The author conducted a cadaveric study to better understand the variations in the anatomy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN). METHODS Twenty embalmed cadavers were used for this study. The author studied the LFCN's relationship to different fascial planes, and the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS). RESULTS A complete fascial canal was found to surround the nerve completely in all specimens. The canal starts at the inguinal ligament proximally and follows the nerve beyond its terminal branches. The nerve could be anywhere from 6.5 cm medial to the ASIS to 6 cm lateral to the ASIS. In the latter case, the nerve may lodge in a groove in the iliac crest. Other anatomical variations found were the LFCN arising from the femoral nerve, and a duplicated nerve. A thick nerve was found in 1 case in which it was riding over the ASIS. CONCLUSIONS The variability in the course of the LFCN can create difficulty in surgical exposure. The newly defined LFCN canal renders exposure even more challenging. This calls for high-resolution pre- or intraoperative imaging for better localization of the nerve.

### Suprainguinal retroperitoneal approach for the successful surgical treatment of meralgia paresthetica [^114VaoNK]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

Object

Neurosurgical textbooks describe an infrainguinal approach as the standard or preferred option for the surgical treatment of meralgia paresthetica (MP), the most frequent entrapment neuropathy of the lower limb. However, inhomogeneous results led the authors to adopt a suprainguinal, retroperitoneal approach for decompression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. In this paper the authors' aim was to study the outcome of patients harboring MP treated via this different surgical approach.

Methods

The outcome of 55 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for MP via the suprainguinal retroperitoneal approach during a 15-year period was ascertained through postal questionnaires (in 47 patients) and follow-up visits (in 8 patients). The male to female ratio was 1:0.67, and the mean patient age was 50 ± 12.9 years. The mean follow-up was 3.2 ± 3.3 years. Seven of the patients underwent bilateral surgery.

Results

Intraoperatively the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve was consistently found in close anatomical relationship to the anterior superior iliac spine, although some variations regarding the diameter, number of branches, and underlying pathological entity were observed. Eighty-seven percent of patients showed improvement (21 patients) or complete remission (27 patients) of painful dysesthesia in the anterolateral thigh, and 13% (7 patients) remained unchanged. In addition 82% had improvement (31 patients) or complete remission (14 patients) of hypesthesia, leaving 18% with unchanged (9 patients) or worsened (1 patient) hypesthesia. In the patient-evaluated group 66% (31 of 47) were completely satisfied with the outcome, 23% (11 of 47) were partially satisfied, and 11% (5 of 47) were not satisfied with the outcome. Two cases each of recurrence, seroma, wound infection, and 1 case of hematoma requiring revision were encountered as complications.

Conclusions

The suprainguinal retroperitoneal approach is a viable first-choice option for the surgical relief of MP.

### Successful treatment of meralgia paresthetica with pulsed radiofrequency of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve [^111XvVFp]. Pain Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Meralgia paresthetica is a rarely encountered sensory mononeuropathy characterized by paresthesia, pain or sensory impairment along the distribution of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve caused by entrapment or compression of the nerve as it crosses the anterior superior iliac spine and runs beneath the inguinal ligament.

Objective

We describe the first reported use of pulsed radiofrequency neuromodulation to relieve the intractable pain associated with meralgia paresthetica.

Case Report

A 33-year-old morbidly obese female with a history of lower back pain and previous spinal fusion presented with sensory dysesthesias and paresthesias in the right anterolateral thigh, consistent with meralgia paresthetica. Temporary relief occurred with multiple lateral femoral cutaneous nerve and fascia lata blocks at 2 different institutions. The patient expressed dissatisfaction with her previous treatments and requested "any" therapeutic intervention that might lead to long-lasting pain relief. At this time, we located the anterior superior iliac spine and reproduced concordant dysesthesia. Pulsed radiofrequency was then undertaken at 42 degrees C for 120 seconds followed by dexamethasone and bupivicaine. The patient reported exceptional and prolonged pain relief at 6-month follow-up.

Limitations

Since this case report is not a prospective, randomized, controlled or blinded study, no conclusions may be drawn from the results attained on behalf of this single individual. Additional, larger group analyses studying this technique while eliminating bias from patient variables would be essential prior to assuming any validity to using pulsed radiofrequency techniques of neuromodulation for managing peripheral neuropathic pain processes.

Conclusion

The patient had experienced long-standing pain that was recalcitrant to conservative/pharmacologic therapy and multiple nerve blocks with local steroid instillations. A single treatment with pulsed radiofrequency resulted in complete and sustained cessation of pain. No side effects were evident. Pulsed radiofrequency of the LFCN may offer an effective, low risk treatment in patients with meralgia paresthetica who are refractory to conservative medical management or are unwilling or unfit to undergo surgery.

### Meralgia paresthetica: diagnosis and treatment [^116Zo1at]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2001). Low credibility.

Meralgia paresthetica is a symptom complex that includes numbness, paresthesias, and pain in the anterolateral thigh, which may result from either an entrapment neuropathy or a neuroma of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN). The condition can be differentiated from other neurologic disorders by the typical exacerbating factors and the characteristic distribution of symptoms. The disease process can be either spontaneous or iatrogenic. The spontaneous form is usually mechanical in origin. The LFCN is subject to compression throughout its entire course. Injuries most commonly occur as the nerve exits the pelvis. The regional anatomy of the LFCN is highly varied and may account for its susceptibility to local trauma. Relief of pain and paresthesias after injection of a local anesthetic agent is helpful in establishing the diagnosis. If no improvement is found, proximal LFCN irritation should be sought. Idiopathic meralgia paresthetica usually improves with nonoperative modalities, such as removal of compressive agents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and, if necessary, local corticosteroid injections. If intractable pain persists despite such measures, surgery can be considered, although whether neurolysis or transection is the procedure of choice is still controversial. Iatrogenic meralgia paresthetica has been found to occur after a number of orthopaedic procedures, such as anterior iliac-crest bone-graft harvesting and anterior pelvic procedures. Prone positioning for spine surgery has also been implicated. Variations in the anatomy of the LFCN about the anterior superior iliac spine may place the nerve at higher risk for damage. Although nonoperative management usually results in satisfactory results, efforts should be made to avoid injury at the time of surgery.

### Meralgia paresthetica in the pediatric population: a propos of 2 cases [^116CD8Yq]. Journal of Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Meralgia paresthetica is a mononeuropathy affecting the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve that is extremely rare in children. Two adolescent females, aged 11 and 13 years, presented due to tingling and pain on the side of the thigh of 2 to 3 weeks duration. The general examination revealed mild obesity; the neurological examination of both patients is normal except for pain, hypo- or hyperesthesia on the side of the quadriceps. An electromyogram was performed in the first case that reveals decreased conduction velocity of the affected lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. The younger child was treated successfully with diet and topiramate; the second patient's symptoms disappeared after initiating conservative measures. Meralgia paresthetica is probably underdiagnosed in the pediatric population. First-line treatment should be conservative, but topiramate may be useful for the treatment of meralgia paresthetica, although broader studies are needed to evaluate its true effectiveness in this pathological condition.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^116DmMVj]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Perhaps the most common local cause of lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults is GTPS. Gluteus medius weakness is often a significant contributor to the development of GTPS. As a result, hip abductor strengthening exercises should be the first-line treatment of this syndrome in conjunction with medication. While medications and modalities may provide temporary symptomatic relief, pain will likely recur if the underlying weakness is not addressed. Additionally, since GTPS and other lumbopelvic conditions often coexist, it is important to perform a thorough history and physical examination to evaluate for the possibility of multiple pain generators, as well.

Key Points

Lateral hip and/or thigh pain in the older adult with CLBP can be from a number of causes, with those most common being greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS), hip osteoarthritis, lumbar radiculopathy/radiculitis, and lumbar spinal stenosis. Meralgia paresthetica also should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Often lateral hip and/or thigh pain is multifactorial.
Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is a common cause of lateral hip pain and is usually due to weakness of the gluteus medius muscle. Hip abductor strengthening is the first-line treatment for GTPS.
True GT bursitis causing GTPS occurs in a minority of cases; therefore, corticosteroid injections should be used sparingly, and ideally only when there is imaging evidence of bursitis. Injection should always be accompanied by a hip abductor strengthening program.
In older adults with CLBP, iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) is less commonly described than GTPS. However, hip abductor strengthening is part of the first-line treatment for both GTPS and ITBS.
Lumbar radiculopathy (i.e. pain + weakness) requires aggressive evaluation and treatment to avoid progressive and permanent neurologic damage. Lumbar radiculitis (pain without weakness) can be evaluated and managed more conservatively.

### Prism adaptation treatment for upper-limb complex regional pain syndrome: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^111v8eFc]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

We conclude that there is no evidence that PA reduces pain and other symptoms more than sham treatment in long-standing CRPS. The benefits of PA reported in previous studies are likely due to the placebo effect, greater movement of the affected limb, regression to the mean, and/or natural recovery.

### Meralgia paresthetica as the presenting feature of chronic appendicitis [^113AQWfY]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2001). Low credibility.

Meralgia paresthetica is an entrapment syndrome of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh manifesting as paresthesia, pain, numbness, or sensory loss in the distribution of the nerve. A variety of causes have been described; however, the etiology often remains unknown. On the basis of our investigations with a patient with meralgia paresthetica, we determined that an inflammatory rather than mechanical effect on the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh may account for the pathogenesis; however, a certain conclusion about this issue can not be made.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^115kw5a3]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

This article is part of a series that addresses coexisting conditions and contributors to chronic low back pain (CLBP) with and without leg pain in older adults. We present a diagnostic and therapeutic evidence-based algorithm designed for primary care clinicians to approach lateral hip and thigh pain in older adults. This is followed by a case that illustrates the challenges of identifying the cause of lateral hip pain and/or thigh pain in older adults and highlights the importance of a proper diagnosis to initiate appropriate management. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) and iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) are two local causes of lateral hip and thigh pain; therefore, the management of these syndromes will be discussed in detail. Furthermore, because as many as one in four people with hip OA present with lateral hip pain and because lumbar radicular pain and spinal stenosis affecting the lumbar nerve roots can also refer pain to this region, the algorithm will describe how to identify pain from these referred sources, as well. Finally, while meralgia paresthetica (MP) is less common and its clinical presentation is often clearly distinct from the conditions listed above, we will also briefly review its presentation, diagnosis, and management. Pathology of many other lumbopelvic structures, such as the sacroiliac joints and lumbar facets, also refers pain to the lateral hip and thigh. Discussion of these conditions is beyond the scope of this paper, and if a patient does not respond in a timely manner to management outlined in the algorithm in Figure 1, referral should be made to a musculoskeletal specialist who can evaluate for these conditions, as well.

### Efficacy of neural prolotherapy in treatment of meralgia… [^1147kVWj]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Efficacy of Neural Prolotherapy in Treatment of Meralgia ParestheticaClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Meralgia paresthetica is an entrapment neuropathy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. Its main manifestation is neuropathic pain on the lateral aspect of the thigh. Neural prolotherapy has shown improvement and relieve of neuropathic pain. The aim of the current study was to assess the efficacy of neural prolotherapy on reliving pain and improvement of function and quality of life in patients with meralgia paresthetica. The symptoms may be provoked or worsened by prolonged standing and walking. Sitting may alleviate the pain because there is reduction of the tension over the nerve, The treatment of meralgia paresthetica is directed towards the improvement of the symptoms which is mainly pain with subsequent improvement of function and quality of life, as well as, treatment of the etiology.

The treatment includes conservative and surgical treatment. Conservative treatment consists of non-pharmacologic treatment and pharmacologic treatment. Surgical treatment takes place in case of failure of the conservative treatment. Surgical options consist of neurolysis and neurectomy. Neural prolotherapy was reported to improve and relieve of neuropathic pain including that of meralgia paresthetica. Neural prolotherapy is the subcutaneous perineural injection of isotonic dextrose solution especially at the points of fascial penetration of the sensory nerve. It is the site where the sensory nerve reaches the subcutaneous plane. There are scanty studies assessed this issue. The aim of the current study was to assess the efficacy of neural prolotherapy on reliving pain and improvement of function and quality of life in patients with meralgia paresthetica. Drug: Isotonic dextrose 5% in water solution
- 0303901.
- The patients had clinical evidence of meralgia paresthetica which was based on the following: the presence of pain, paraesthesia and numbness over the anterior and lateral aspect of the thigh; exacerbation of these symptoms on walking, standing and hip extension; and meralgia paresthetica was confirmed electrophysiologically by nerve conduction study with or without somatosensory evoked potentials.

### Spinal cord stimulation for treatment of meralgia paresthetica [^111fbFCE]. Pain Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Meralgia paresthetica is a clinical syndrome of pain, dysesthesia or both, in the anterolateral thigh. It is associated with an entrapment mononeuropathy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. Diagnosis of meralgia paresthetica is typically made clinically and is based on the characteristic location of pain or dysesthesia, sensory abnormality on exam, and absence of any other neurological abnormality in the leg. The majority of patients with meralgia paresthetica respond well to conservative treatment.

Objective

To present a case of intractable meralgia paresthetica in which conservative treatment options failed but which was successfully treated with a spinal cord stimulator.

Case Report

A 44-year-old woman presented to the pain clinic with a one-year history of bilateral anterolateral thigh pain. History, physical exam, and diagnostic work-up were consistent with meralgia paresthetica. Multiple medications, physical therapy, and chiropractic therapy were not successful for this patient. In addition, local anesthetic/steroid injection of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve provided only short-term relief. Ultimately, a spinal cord stimulator was implanted after a successful temporary percutaneous trial. Two months after the implantation, she continued to have 100% pain relief, worked full-time, was physically active, and no longer required any pain medication including opioids.

Conclusion

An implanted spinal cord stimulator may be an ideal treatment for intractable meralgia paresthetica after conservative treatments have failed because it is not destructive and can always be explanted without significant permanent adverse effects.

### Complex regional pain syndrome: practical diagnostic and treatment guidelines, 5th edition [^111GZxe8]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Opioids

The earliest known expert opinion regarding opioids in CRPS is that of S. Weir Mitchell, who commented that "for the easing of neurotraumatic pain [referring to "Causalgia" most like CRPS type I] the morphia salts… are invaluable". His description of the relief which the young soldiers he treated obtained is well worth reading, as it also highlights the issues underpinning the opioid crisis: opioids can work extremely well when taken for short periods; yet many problems arise with longer-term treatment (and patients may find it hard to understand why these drugs should not be available to them long-term). However, outside the battlefield, opioids may in fact be less effective even for short term treatment of CRPS. Only one RCT (level 2) has been conducted in CRPS evaluating controlled-release morphine, and reporting no difference in pain reduction when compared to placebo after 8 days' use. This trial would not meet today's quality standards, so the question about short-term efficacy of opioid medication in CRPS remains open. As neuropathic pain does not respond as universally or well as acute nociceptive pain, dose escalation is common, often with no added pain relief but accruing cumulative adverse effects. Patients prescribed 100 mg or more of morphine or equivalent have a 9 times greater risk of serious overdose than patients prescribed less than 20 mg of morphine or equivalent daily, even after adjustment for comorbid conditions. There is growing consensus that while at lower doses opioids are a reasonable 2nd or 3rd line treatment option to try, doses should not be escalated freely. Methadone has theoretical advantages for neuropathic pain because of its putative NMDA antagonism, as well as the practical advantage of low cost. Tramadol may be helpful due to its concomitant serotonin/norepinephrine re-uptake inhibition, a potential advantage shared by tapentadol, a potent opioid with noradrenergic reuptake inhibition. Tolerance and long term toxicity are unresolved issues in CRPS patients for the moment, yet it is worth noting that long-term high-dose opioid use can actually worsen allodynia and/or hyperpathia. Historically, Mitchell commented on tolerance: "When continuously used, it is very curious that its hypnotic manifestations lessen, while its power to abolish pain continues, so that the patient who receives a half grain or more of morphia may become free from pain, and yet walk about with little or no desire to sleep" reminding us that in some cases low dose opioid can be used successfully, chronically. However, in most cases analgesic tolerance co-occurs with "opioid induced hyperalgesia", indistinguishable from symptoms of CRPS. Thus there may be a consideration of the use of short-acting opioids for break-through pain ("rescue" dosing), but this has become controversial. Although occasionally taking an extra pill for a pain spike is unlikely to harm, too many patients end up with daily or near-daily use of "rescue" opioids, obviating their purpose and encouraging tolerance to what is effectively a higher daily dose.

We present three patients with signs and symptoms of meralgia paresthetica (MP) after long-distance walking and cycling. No other possible causes of MP, such as trauma or exogenous compression, were present. A neuropathy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve was confirmed in all patients with somatosensory evoked potentials. We propose that conduction block due to local ischemia during repetitive muscle stretching was the probable cause for the neuropathy.

### Dynamic decompression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve to treat meralgia paresthetica: technique and results [^116Z6RSJ]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The results of lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) decompression to treat idiopathic meralgia paresthetica (iMP) vary widely. Techniques to decompress the LFCN differ, which may affect outcome, but in MP it is unknown to what extent. The authors present a new technique using dynamic decompression and discuss the outcomes.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was performed in a consecutive series of 19 cases. The goal of decompression was pain relief and recovery of sensation. The plane ventral to the LFCN was decompressed by cutting the fascia lata and the inferior aspect of the inguinal ligament. The plane dorsal to the LFCN was decompressed by cutting the fascia of the sartorius muscle. Subsequently, the thigh was brought in full range of flexion and extension/abduction. The authors identified and additionally cut fibers that tightened and caused compression at various locations of the LFCN during movement in all patients, referring to this technique as dynamic decompression. Postoperatively, an independent neurologist scored pain and sensation on a 4-point scale: completely resolved, improved, not changed, or worsened. Patients scored their remaining pain or sensory deficit as a percentage of the preoperative level. Statistical assessment was done using ANOVA to assess the association between outcome and duration of preoperative symptoms, BMI, and length of follow-up.

Results

In 17 of the 19 cases (89%), the pain and/or paresthesia completely resolved. Patients in the remaining 2 cases (11%) experienced 70% and 80% reduction in pain. Sensation completely recovered in 13 of the 19 cases (69%). In 5 of the 19 cases (26%) sensation improved, but an area of hypesthesia remained. Four of these 5 patients indicated a sensory improvement of more than 75%, and the remaining patient had 50% improvement. Sensation remained unchanged in 1 case (5%) with persisting hypesthesia and mild hyperesthesia. There was no significant impact of preoperative symptom duration, BMI, and length of follow-up on postoperative outcome.

Conclusions

Dynamic decompression of the LFCN is an effective technique for the treatment of iMP. Most patients become completely pain free and sensation recovers considerably.

### Unusual causes for meralgia paresthetica: systematic review of the literature and single center experience [^1139QJRe]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Meralgia paresthetica is often idiopathic, but sometimes symptoms may be caused by traumatic injury to the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) or compression of this nerve by a mass lesion. In this article the literature is reviewed on unusual causes for meralgia paresthetica, including different types of traumatic injury and compression of the LFCN by mass lesions. In addition, the experience from our center with the surgical treatment of unusual causes of meralgia paresthetica is presented. A PubMed search was performed on unusual causes for meralgia paresthetica. Specific attention was paid to factors that may have predisposed to LFCN injury and clues that may have pointed at a mass lesion. Moreover, our own database on all surgically treated cases of meralgia paresthetica between April 2014 and September 2022 was reviewed to identify unusual causes for meralgia paresthetica. A total of 66 articles was identified that reported results on unusual causes for meralgia paresthetica: 37 on traumatic injuries of the LFCN and 29 on compression of the LFCN by mass lesions. Most frequent cause of traumatic injury in the literature was iatrogenic, including different procedures around the anterior superior iliac spine, intra-abdominal procedures and positioning for surgery. In our own surgical database of 187 cases, there were 14 cases of traumatic LFCN injury and 4 cases in which symptoms were related to a mass lesion. It is important to consider traumatic causes or compression by a mass lesion in patients that present with meralgia paresthetica.

### Meralgia paresthetica in children: case series and surgical technique [^11646RcR]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Meralgia paresthetica is a painful compressive neuropathy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, with minimal literature existing about the disorder in children. Easily overlooked, a misdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary imaging or surgical intervention. The purpose of this study was to increase provider awareness and compare patient-reported outcomes between surgical and nonsurgical management.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed records of pediatric patients treated for meralgia paresthetica by a single provider. Patients were initially treated with physical therapy, anti-inflammatories, and local injection to confirm the diagnosis. Individuals with persistent symptoms were offered surgical decompression. Patient-reported outcomes were assessed using the International Hip Outcome Tool 33 (iHOT-33) survey.

Results

Twenty-four patients were treated. The mean age was 12.7 years (range: 9 to 17 y). Ninety-two percent were female, 63% had bilateral involvement, and 38% were referred with an alternate diagnosis. The average BMI was 20.96. Local injection provided immediate relief for all patients and lasted an average of 11 days. Seventy-one percent (17/24) had persistent symptoms in follow-up and underwent surgical decompression. All patients improved following initial decompression, but 4/17 (24%) had recurrence of symptoms requiring a second surgery. All recurrences had accessory nerves missed during the first surgery. Seventy-nine percent of patients (19/24) completed the iHOT-33 survey at an average of 33 months after intervention (injection or surgery). The average iHOT-33 score was higher in the operative group but was not statistically significant (7.88 vs. 6.72, P = 0.250).

Conclusions

Meralgia paresthetica can be readily diagnosed using physical examination and confirmed with a local injection, without the need for advanced imaging. In our cohort, it predominantly affected thin, adolescent females. Steroid injection provided definitive treatment for 29% of our patients. Persistent symptoms can be improved with surgical decompression, and we found a high rate of aberrant anatomy and accessory nerves in this population. Outcomes were not significantly different between local injection only and surgical management. More studies are needed to determine the role of ligation versus decompression.

### Treatment of meralgia paresthetica (lateral femoral cutaneous neuropathy): a meta-analysis of ultrasound-guided injection versus surgery [^1124xffQ]. European Journal of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare ultrasound (US)-guided injections and surgery for the treatment of meralgia paresthetica (lateral femoral cutaneous neuropathy).

Methods

Two reviewers, independently, up to 10 October 2020 retrieved Studies that assessed the outcome of US-guided injections and surgery for the treatment of meralgia paresthetica from major medical libraries. Predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria were adopted.

Results

399 studies were initially found, and the meta-analysis was conducted on 10 studies for a total of 149 patients. US-guided injections were done in three studies, surgery in seven studies. N = 38% (57/149) of patients were treated with US-guided injection and 62% (92/149) were treated with surgery. After US-guided injections, 85% (49/57) of patients were treated successfully, whereas 80% (74/92) were treated with surgery successfully from the clinical point of view. Differences were not statistically significant even with a slight heterogeneity of studies and outcome pooled on random-effect model. No comparative cohort study or RCT was conducted.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis showed that there was no statistically significant difference in treatment of meralgia paresthetica with ultrasound-guided injection or surgery. A RCT to compare a standardized US-guided approach versus surgery is essential to compare these techniques properly.

### Ultrasound-guided injections at the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve: the inguinal ligament as a barrier [^116DLL4Z]. Pain Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ultrasound-guided perineural injections at the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) may confirm the correct diagnosis and provide symptom relief in meralgia paresthetica. Although correct visualization of the nerve is generally described as feasible, failure rates of the procedure may be as high as 30%.

Objectives

This study investigated the spread of injected fluids in ultrasound-guided perineural injections at the LFCN. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether the inguinal ligament impedes the distribution of injected fluids along the course of the LFCN.

Study Design

We used a descriptive research design.

Setting

Research was conducted at an anatomical research facility.

Methods

In fresh, nonembalmed cadavers, 2 mL of ink were injected with ultrasound-guidance at the LFCN below the inguinal ligament. The course of the nerve was then dissected to show the extent of nerve staining.

Results

Spread of the injected ink proximal to the inguinal ligament was found in 67.65% of specimens, while the ink did not pass the inguinal ligament in 32.35%. Concerning proximal spread, specimen body mass index was not of any relevance.

Limitations

This cadaver study is only a simulation of the real clinical setting and does not allow any insight into the efficacy of the injection in living patients.

Conclusions

The inguinal ligament is a barrier in the distribution of injected fluids in about one-third of specimens. This might be a major cause of failure in ultrasound-guided injections. The results from our study are in line with previously published failure rates and our findings might provide the anatomic basis to advance injection techniques.

### Nerve entrapment syndromes of the lower limb: a pictorial review [^113GfQbF]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve

The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is a sensory nerve arising from the dorsal divisions of L2 and L3. It emerges from the lumbar plexus on the lateral aspect of the psoas and descends obliquely on the anterior surface of the iliacus muscle. In most cases, it exits the pelvis deep to the inguinal ligament and medial to the anterior superior iliac spine. It divides into an anterior branch which provides sensory supply to the anterolateral thigh, and a posterior branch which supplies sensation to the posterolateral thigh. Entrapment typically occurs as the nerve travels inferior to the inguinal ligament or as it pierces the fascia lata. There are multiple causes of entrapment, including avulsion fracture of the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), iatrogenic injury during pelvic fracture repair, inguinal or abdominal surgery, and pelvic and retroperitoneal tumours. Other contributing factors include discrepancy in limb length, diabetes, weight gain, pregnancy and external compression by belts or tight clothing. The nerve is most commonly injured by mechanical compression at the level of the inguinal ligament. Neuropathy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve has been termed meralgia paresthetica. Patients typically present with pain, and paraesthesia in the skin overlying the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. The intrapelvic course of the nerve is not readily demonstrable on imaging. The extrapelvic course of the nerve can be visualised on MRI and ultrasound (Figs. 11 and 12). Nerve thickening and increased signal of the nerve can be seen. MRI can also identify lesions in the expected trajectory of the nerve. Treatment options include removal of the offending cause of compression, such as through weight loss and wearing loose clothing. Severe neuropathic pain can be treated with corticosteroid injections, radiofrequency ablation, or surgical intervention.

### An algorithm approach to phantom limb pain [^112fWUfV]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Traditional Treatment

When treating PLP, it is best to establish a multimodal treatment team. Members of this team could include a neurologist, pain specialist, physical therapist, neurosurgeon, rehabilitation specialist, anesthesiologist, and psychologist. A multimodal regimen can be established as early as the perioperative period, as early pain is a strong predictive factor of chronic and severe PLP. In clinical practice, this is challenging as there are few controlled clinical studies on treatment, many of which have equivocal outcomes. Additionally, many studies do not differentiate between residual limb pain and phantom limb pain, thus confounding results.

Below, we will summarize the literature with regard to current available treatment options. These treatments have been divided into different categories including pharmacological, surgical, interventional, physical, and psychological modalities.

### Meralgia paresthetica treated by injection, decompression, and neurectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of pain and operative outcomes [^115peUte]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Meralgia paresthetica is caused by entrapment of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) and often presents with pain. Multiple treatment options targeting the LFCN can be pursued to treat the pain should conservative measures fail, with the most common options being injection, neurolysis, and neurectomy. However, their efficacy in causing pain relief and their clinical outcomes have yet to be directly compared. The aim of this study was to interrogate the contemporary literature and quantitatively define how these options compare.

Methods

The electronic databases Ovid Embase, PubMed, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane Library were interrogated from inception to May 2020 following the PRISMA guidelines. Candidate articles were screened against prespecified criteria. Outcome data were abstracted and pooled by random-effects meta-analysis of proportions.

Results

There were 25 articles that satisfied all criteria, reporting outcomes for a total of 670 meralgia paresthetica patients, with 78 (12%) treated by injection, 496 (74%) by neurolysis, and 96 (14%) by neurectomy. The incidence of complete pain relief was 85% (95% CI 71%-96%) after neurectomy, 63% (95% CI 56%-71%) after neurolysis, and 22% (95% CI 13%-33%) after injection, which were all statistically different (p < 0.01). The incidence of revision procedures was 12% (95% CI 4%-22%) after neurolysis and 0% (95% CI 0%-2%) after neurectomy, which were significantly lower than 81% (95% CI 64%-94%) after injection (p < 0.01). The incidences of treatment complications were statistically comparable across all three treatments, ranging from 0% to 5% (p = 0.34).

Conclusions

There are multiple treatment options to target pain in meralgia paresthetica. The incidence of complete pain relief appears to be the greatest among the 3 interventions after neurectomy, accompanied by the lowest incidence of revision procedures. These findings should help inform patient preference and expectations. Greater exploration of the anatomical rationale for incomplete pain relief after surgical intervention will assist in optimizing further surgical treatment for meralgia paresthetica.

7.1.4.5 Opioids

Opioids provide pain relief by binding to mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors. A cross‐sectional study suggested moderate effectiveness of weak opioids, and a longitudinal audit in patients with abdominal MPS reported significant pain improvements. However, the evidence is insufficient to determine their effectiveness in managing MPS due to lack of RCT data.
