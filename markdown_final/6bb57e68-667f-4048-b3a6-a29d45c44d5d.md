## Question

Should the patient undergo parathyroid imaging or surgery?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a patient with primary hyperparathyroidism should undergo parathyroid imaging or proceed directly to surgery, and how to sequence these steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the biochemical diagnosis of PHPT. Then, I should verify whether the patient meets established surgical indications. Next, I will consider the role and timing of preoperative imaging, including what to do if imaging is negative or discordant. After that, I need to outline the surgical approach based on imaging results and intraoperative adjuncts. Finally, I should address special scenarios like normocalcemic PHPT, pregnancy, MEN1, and reoperative disease, and close with a concise recommendation summary.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis before anything else, because imaging does not establish PHPT. It is a biochemical diagnosis of hypercalcemia with inappropriately normal or elevated PTH after excluding secondary causes such as vitamin D deficiency, renal insufficiency, thiazides, lithium, or familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, and I should double-check that these exclusions have been addressed before moving forward [^1132GipD] [^115EuFiE] [^111cwjeB].

> Next, I should review whether the patient meets surgical indications, since surgery is the only definitive cure and is preferred for symptomatic PHPT, and I need to ensure I am applying the most current criteria: serum calcium more than 1.0 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal, osteoporosis or fragility fracture, vertebral compression fracture on imaging, impaired renal function or hypercalciuria with stone risk, nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, age under 50 years, and neurocognitive or neuropsychiatric symptoms attributable to PHPT. If any of these are present, parathyroidectomy is indicated and should be offered, and I should confirm that these elements have been systematically assessed in this patient [^117J3Tye] [^111RbJRd] [^112SpR7H] [^111Xmf47] [^115qS1Pq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging yet. I need to check the principle that imaging is for localization once surgery is decided, not for diagnosis, and I should verify that contemporary guidelines explicitly advise obtaining preoperative imaging only when surgery is planned, while emphasizing that negative or discordant imaging should never preclude surgical referral for appropriately indicated patients [^1132GipD] [^115adJ2W] [^116cAxbj].

> I will now examine the timing and sequence: if the patient meets surgical criteria, I should refer to an experienced endocrine surgeon first, and then obtain localization imaging afterward to guide operative planning. If the patient does not meet criteria and is being observed, imaging is deferred until and unless surgery becomes indicated, and I should confirm that this sequence is consistent with AAES and Fifth International Workshop guidance [^117J3Tye] [^1132GipD].

> Let me think about the imaging modalities and how to choose among them. Ultrasound is typically first-line because it is noninvasive, avoids radiation, and can identify concomitant thyroid disease, but it is operator dependent, whereas sestamibi SPECT/CT adds functional localization and performs well for single adenomas, and 4D-CT is a problem-solver for negative or discordant studies or reoperative cases. Choline PET/CT shows high diagnostic performance in comparative studies and may be considered where available, and I should tailor the choice to local expertise, patient factors, and prior imaging results [^112WTiUm] [^112NB5oy] [^11192ctP] [^114hBBZX].

> Wait, let me verify the approach when imaging is negative or discordant. Even with nonlocalizing studies, cure rates remain high with bilateral neck exploration by experienced surgeons, and I should not delay indicated surgery solely due to poor localization, as outcomes are excellent in image-negative patients when managed at high-volume centers with intraoperative adjuncts [^111c18YD] [^1132YjL2] [^117J3Tye].

> Next, I should review the operative strategy. With concordant localization supporting a single-gland adenoma, a focused minimally invasive parathyroidectomy with intraoperative PTH monitoring is appropriate and achieves high cure rates, whereas discordant or negative imaging, suspicion for multigland disease, or MEN1 should prompt a planned bilateral exploration with identification of all four glands and consideration of subtotal parathyroidectomy plus cervical thymectomy in MEN1, and I need to ensure the plan aligns with guideline-based surgical algorithms [^116hU4os] [^1132YjL2] [^1154Gjbk].

> But wait, what if the patient has normocalcemic PHPT? I should confirm that the same surgical indications generally apply, recognizing that localization can be more challenging due to smaller adenomas and a higher prevalence of multigland disease, so counseling should be individualized and referral to an experienced surgeon is particularly important in this phenotype [^111JjFxX] [^114Tu7pc].

> I need to ensure special populations are addressed. In pregnancy, ultrasound is first-line and radiation-sparing strategies such as 4D-dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI or carefully selected sestamibi may be considered if surgery is indicated, with minimally invasive parathyroidectomy preferred when feasible. In MEN1, bilateral exploration with subtotal parathyroidectomy and cervical thymectomy is standard given multigland disease. And in reoperative or persistent disease, sequential advanced imaging and intraoperative adjuncts are essential, ideally at high-volume centers [^112dwCku] [^1154Gjbk] [^114cJAyB].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to avoid any ambiguity: if the biochemical diagnosis of PHPT is established and the patient meets any surgical indication, proceed with surgical referral and obtain preoperative localization imaging afterward to plan the approach. If the patient does not meet surgical criteria, observe with guideline-based surveillance and defer imaging until surgery becomes indicated, and I should double-check that this plan is consistent with AAES and the Fifth International Workshop recommendations [^117J3Tye] [^1132GipD].

Parathyroid imaging is **not for diagnosis** [^1132GipD] but for surgical planning once PHPT is biochemically confirmed [^115EuFiE]. Surgery is the **only definitive cure** [^115o2tun] and is indicated for symptomatic patients [^111RbJRd], those with serum calcium > 1 mg/dL above normal [^117J3Tye], osteoporosis or fragility fractures [^112SpR7H], renal involvement [^111Xmf47], or inability to comply with surveillance [^115bkufZ]. Imaging (ultrasound, sestamibi, 4D-CT, or PET/CT) should be obtained only after deciding on surgery, to guide a minimally invasive approach [^1146PExw]; negative or discordant imaging does not preclude surgery [^111c18YD], and bilateral exploration remains appropriate when needed [^1132YjL2]. For patients who do not meet surgical criteria or decline surgery, medical management and surveillance are reasonable alternatives [^1145gdCr].

## Indications for parathyroid surgery

Parathyroidectomy is the **only curative treatment** for PHPT [^115o2tun], with high success and low complication rates when performed by experienced surgeons [^115adJ2W]. The AAES and international workshops recommend surgery for the following indications:

- **Symptomatic PHPT**: Nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, hypercalciuria, impaired renal function (GFR < 60 mL/min) [^111Xmf47], or neurocognitive/neuropsychiatric symptoms attributable to PHPT [^116nAg13].

- **Asymptomatic PHPT**: Serum calcium > 1 mg/dL above normal [^117J3Tye], osteoporosis (T-score ≤ -2.5), fragility fracture, or vertebral compression fracture on imaging [^112SpR7H], or inability/unwillingness to comply with surveillance protocols [^115bkufZ].

- **Age**: Patients < 50 years are generally recommended for surgery due to cumulative risks of untreated PHPT [^115qS1Pq].

---

## Role of parathyroid imaging

Parathyroid imaging is **not used to diagnose PHPT** [^1132GipD], which relies on biochemical confirmation of hypercalcemia with elevated or inappropriately normal PTH [^111cwjeB]. Imaging is used solely for **preoperative localization** to guide surgical strategy, particularly for minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) [^11192ctP]. Common modalities include:

| **Imaging modality** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Ultrasound | - Non-invasive <br/> - No radiation <br/> - Widely available | - Operator-dependent <br/> - Limited sensitivity for small or ectopic glands [^112NB5oy] |
| Sestamibi (MIBI) | - Functional imaging <br/> - Useful for adenomas | - Limited sensitivity for multigland disease <br/> - False positives/negatives [^notfound] |
| 4D-CT | - High sensitivity/specificity <br/> - Useful for reoperative cases or inconclusive imaging [^11192ctP] | - Radiation exposure <br/> - Contrast risks [^11723FS3] |
| PET/CT (e.g. 18F-fluorocholine) | - Emerging modality with promising results [^114hBBZX] | - Limited availability <br/> - Costly [^notfound] |

---

Imaging is **not required for diagnosis** [^1132GipD] and should be obtained only after deciding on surgery. Negative or discordant imaging does not preclude surgery; patients should still be referred to an experienced endocrine surgeon for evaluation [^116cAxbj] [^111c18YD].

---

## Surgical approaches

Two primary surgical approaches are used: **minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP)**, guided by preoperative localization and intraoperative PTH monitoring, with a small incision and targeted excision of the abnormal gland(s) [^112yyU9s]; and **bilateral neck exploration (BNE)**, a traditional approach exploring all four parathyroids, used when imaging is negative or discordant, multigland disease is suspected, or intraoperative PTH is unavailable [^1132YjL2]. Both approaches have high cure rates when performed by experienced surgeons [^117J3Tye].

---

## Risks and benefits of surgery

Parathyroidectomy offers **significant benefits**, including normalization of calcium and PTH, improvement in bone mineral density, reduced fracture risk, and resolution of renal and neurocognitive symptoms [^1119hk9G]. Risks are low but include hypocalcemia, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and persistent or recurrent disease; these risks are minimized with experienced surgeons and appropriate intraoperative adjuncts [^117J3Tye].

---

## Alternative medical management

For patients who do not meet surgical criteria or decline surgery, **medical management** includes:

- **Calcimimetics**: Cinacalcet to reduce serum calcium and PTH [^notfound].

- **Bisphosphonates**: To improve bone mineral density [^114Tu7pc].

- **Surveillance**: Annual monitoring of calcium, renal function, bone density, and renal imaging [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Diagnosis**: Biochemical confirmation of hypercalcemia with elevated or inappropriately normal PTH [^111cwjeB].

- **Indications for surgery**: Symptomatic PHPT, serum calcium > 1 mg/dL above normal, osteoporosis or fragility fracture, renal involvement, or inability to comply with surveillance [^111RbJRd].

- **Imaging**: Obtain only after deciding on surgery; negative imaging does not preclude surgery [^1132GipD].

- **Surgical approach**: MIP for localized disease; BNE for negative/discordant imaging or multigland disease [^1132YjL2].

- **Alternative management**: Medical therapy and surveillance for patients who do not meet surgical criteria or decline surgery [^1145gdCr].

---

Parathyroid imaging is **not for diagnosis** but for surgical planning once PHPT is biochemically confirmed [^1132GipD]. Surgery is the **only definitive cure** [^115o2tun] and is indicated for symptomatic patients, those with significant hypercalcemia, osteoporosis or fragility fractures, renal involvement, or inability to comply with surveillance. Imaging is obtained only after deciding on surgery, and negative or discordant imaging does not preclude surgery [^116cAxbj].

MEN1 primary hyperparathyroidism — parathyroidectomy approach and imaging considerations include that imaging has no role in the diagnosis of PHPT and negative imaging results do not preclude surgery; preoperative localization for an initial open bilateral neck exploration may be of limited benefit in MEN1-associated PHPT, with only 7% of patients estimated to have a different procedure based on preoperative localization, though many parathyroid surgeons consider 7% significant; optimal surgery is a bilateral neck exploration with identification of all 4 parathyroid glands and removal of 3.5 glands with a bilateral cervical thymectomy, and recurrent PHPT risk increases if less than subtotal parathyroidectomy (≤ 3.5 glands) is performed; intraoperative PTH monitoring may have limited benefit because it will not alter the operative strategy, and referral to a high-volume center is crucial to optimize outcomes.

### Approach to the patient with persistent or recurrent primary hyperparathyroidism [^115Lpvp7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Reoperative parathyroid surgery may be required in patients who have persistent primary hyperparathyroidism after an unsuccessful operation and in patients who had an initially successful exploration but develop recurrent disease at an interval greater than 6 months postoperatively. Additionally, patients who have had significant surgery in the cervical region, particularly total thyroidectomy, should be considered in this group because they pose identical technical challenges that in the past have resulted in suboptimal cure and complication rates. These patients require a meticulous review of their historical, biochemical, imaging, and operative data to confirm the diagnosis, to evaluate the possibility of familial forms of hyperparathyroidism, and to confirm the indications for surgery. Once a patient is deemed an appropriate surgical candidate, sequential imaging is required to yield a roadmap to guide surgical intervention. These reoperative procedures require an experienced parathyroid surgeon armed with intraoperative adjuncts to locate the offending parathyroid gland(s) and remove them while minimizing collateral injury, particularly to the recurrent laryngeal nerves. These patients are also at increased risk of postoperative hypocalcemia that can be life-threatening. Despite these concerns, an experienced endocrine team can diagnose persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism, localize residual abnormal parathyroid glands, and perform surgical intervention with success and complication profiles that approximate those achieved in the unexplored patient.

Optimizing outcomes in reoperative parathyroid surgery: definitive multidisciplinary joint consensus guidelines of the American head and neck society and the British association of endocrine and thyroid surgeons [^114cJAyB]. Head & Neck (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Revision parathyroid is challenging due to possible diagnostic uncertainty as well as the technical challenges it can present.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of distinguished experts from the American Head and Neck Society (AHNS) Endocrine Section, the British Association of Endocrine and Thyroid Surgeons (BAETS), and other invited experts have reviewed this topic with the purpose of making recommendations based on current best evidence. The literature was also reviewed on May 12, 2017. PubMed (1946–2017), Cochrane SR (2005–2017), CT databases (1997–2017), and Web of Science (1945–2017) were searched with the following strategy: revision and reoperative parathyroidectomy to ensure completeness.

Results

Guideline recommendations were made in 3 domains: preoperative evaluation, surgical management, and alternatives to surgery. Eleven guideline recommendations are proposed.

Conclusion

Reoperative parathyroid surgery is best avoided if possible. Our literature search and subsequent recommendations found that these cases are best managed by experienced surgeons using precision preoperative localization, intraoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH), and the team approach.

### Mild primary hyperparathyroidism: a literature review [^115ACQ1q]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

The biochemical profile of classic primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) consists of both elevated calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. The standard of care is parathyroidectomy unless prohibited by medical comorbidities. Because more patients are undergoing routine bone density evaluation and neck imaging studies for other purposes, there is a subset of people identified with a biochemically mild form of the pHPT that expresses itself as either elevated calcium or parathyroid hormone levels. These patients often do not fall into the criteria for operation based on the National Institutes of Health consensus guidelines, and they can present a challenge of diagnosis and management. The purpose of this paper is to review the available literature on mild pHPT in an effort to better characterize this patient population and to determine whether patients benefit from parathyroidectomy. Evidence suggests that there are patients with mild pHPT who have overt symptoms that are found to improve after parathyroidectomy. There is also a group of patients with biochemically mild pHPT who are found to progress to classic pHPT over time; however, it is not predictable which group of patients this will be. Early intervention for this group with mild pHPT may prevent progression of bone, psychiatric, and renal complications, and parathyroidectomy has proven safe in appropriately selected patients at high volume centers.

### Surgery for hyperparathyroidism in image-negative patients… [^111c18YD]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

All 42 patients underwent cervical exploratory surgery, which commenced on the right side. In 11 patients, an obviously abnormal right parathyroid gland was found and was resected with an associated drop in the rapid intraoperative PTH assay, consistent with cure. The remaining 31 patients went on to undergo a contralateral exploratory procedure. Among our 42 patients, no complications, including bleeding, hypocalcemia, and vocal cord paralysis or paresis occurred. Patients with negative imaging represent an important subset of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism in whom traditional 4-gland operative exploratory surgery remains the optimal management because of the increased frequency of multiglandular disease. Based on the findings of this study, these patients perform well with long-term cure of their disease after undergoing an appropriate surgical procedure.

Because of the higher incidence of multiglandular disease in these patients, surgery needs to be conducted with a level of suspicion that multiglandular disease exists to ensure that all diseased glands are resected during the operation. 2 If an adenoma is found immediately and is resected with an associated greater than 50% drop in PTH level at 10 minutes after the resection, contralateral exploratory surgery in theory can be abandoned, as was done in several of these cases. However, the common need for extensive surgical exploration, including paratracheal dissections and thyroid resections, indicates that the frequency of occult parathyroid adenomas and difficult explorations is increased in patients with negative imaging. Our data do not support this finding. The length of patient follow-up after surgery that is necessary to determine whether a patient is cured is a major ambiguity in the parathyroid surgery literature.

To our knowledge, other than the already-mentioned single patient with the adenoma on the aortic arch, there has not been persistent or recurrent disease in the patients described herein. Although solitary adenomas account for most abnormalities in this subset of patients with negative imaging, parathyroid exploratory surgery often and unpredictably requires more extensive neck exploration, including paratracheal dissection, thymectomy, and partial thyroidectomy. The immediate availability of intraoperative rapid PTH monitoring and of expert frozen section analysis is important to accomplish successful cures. This suggests the need for referral of these patients to high-volume medical centers for parathyroid surgery.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for the definitive surgical management of secondary and tertiary renal hyperparathyroidism [^1169C8aj]. Annals of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence-based recommendations for safe, effective, and appropriate treatment of secondary (SHPT) and tertiary (THPT) renal hyperparathyroidism.

Background

Hyperparathyroidism is common among patients with chronic kidney disease, end-stage kidney disease, and kidney transplant. The surgical management of SHPT and THPT is nuanced and requires a multidisciplinary approach. There are currently no clinical practice guidelines that address the surgical treatment of SHPT and THPT.

Methods

Medical literature was reviewed from January 1, 1985 to present January 1, 2021 by a panel of 10 experts in SHPT and THPT. Recommendations using the best available evidence was constructed. The American College of Physicians grading system was used to determine levels of evidence. Recommendations were discussed to consensus. The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons membership reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of the content.

Results

These clinical guidelines present the epidemiology and pathophysiology of SHPT and THPT and provide recommendations for work-up and management of SHPT and THPT for all involved clinicians. It outlines the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative management of SHPT and THPT, as well as related definitions, operative techniques, morbidity, and outcomes. Specific topics include Pathogenesis and Epidemiology, Initial Evaluation, Imaging, Preoperative and Perioperative Care, Surgical Planning and Parathyroidectomy, Adjuncts and Approaches, Outcomes, and Reoperation.

Conclusions

Evidence-based guidelines were created to assist clinicians in the optimal management of secondary and tertiary renal hyperparathyroidism.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for definitive management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^112SpR7H]. JAMA Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to parathyroidectomy, indications, AAES 2016 guidelines recommend to perform parathyroidectomy in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and any of the following:

- osteoporosis

- fragility fracture

- evidence of vertebral compression fracture on spine imaging.

### Preoperative imaging techniques in primary hyperparathyroidism: a review [^11192ctP]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Successful minimally invasive parathyroidectomy requires confident and accurate preoperative localization. Several noninvasive imaging techniques are well established for preoperative localization, and others are emerging.

Observations

Ultrasonography and sestamibi imaging are established preoperative localization techniques with good sensitivity and positive predictive value. Multiphase 4-dimensional computed tomography is a newer technique with arguably superior performance, particularly in the setting of negative or discordant ultrasonography and sestamibi imaging, residual or recurrent primary hyperparathyroidism following a previous surgical operation, and multiglandular disease. Emerging techniques that may further facilitate confident and accurate preoperative localization include ultrasonography, elastography, positron emission tomography, and 4-D magnetic resonance imaging.

Conclusions and Relevance

The optimal imaging localization algorithm for hyperparathyroidism remains undetermined, but a combination of techniques tailored to the specific scenario will likely yield the best outcomes. An algorithm is proposed that considers test performance, surgeon confidence, patient-specific factors, cost, local radiologic expertise, and patient radiation exposure.

### The EANM practice guidelines for parathyroid imaging [^111h7MvM]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Preamble

The European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) is a professional non-profit medical association that facilitates communication worldwide among individuals pursuing clinical and research excellence in nuclear medicine. The EANM was founded in 1985.

These guidelines are intended to assist practitioners in providing appropriate nuclear medicine care for patients. They are not inflexible rules or requirements of practice and are not intended, nor should they be used, to establish a legal standard of care.

The ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific procedure or course of action must be made by medical professionals taking into account the unique circumstances of each case. Thus, there is no implication that an approach differing from the guidelines, standing alone, is below the standard of care. To the contrary, a conscientious practitioner may responsibly adopt a course of action different from that set out in the guidelines when, in the reasonable judgment of the practitioner, such course of action is indicated by the condition of the patient, limitations of available resources, or advances in knowledge or technology subsequent to publication of the guidelines. The practice of medicine involves not only the science but also the art of dealing with the prevention, diagnosis, alleviation, and treatment of disease.

The variety and complexity of human conditions make it impossible to always reach the most appropriate diagnosis or to predict with certainty a particular response to treatment. Therefore, it should be recognized that adherence to these guidelines will not ensure an accurate diagnosis or a successful outcome.

All that should be expected is that the practitioner will follow a reasonable course of action based on current knowledge, available resources, and the needs of the patient to deliver effective and safe medical care. The sole purpose of these guidelines is to assist practitioners in achieving this objective.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for the definitive surgical management of thyroid disease in adults [^113hGfvy]. Annals of Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Definitive surgical management of thyroid disease — special situations emphasize that hypercalcemia occurs in up to 22% of patients with thyrotoxicosis, most often in older patients with Graves disease (GD), and a preoperative biochemical evaluation to differentiate this from primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) should be pursued. For hereditary risk, specific guidelines exist for MEN I and MEN IIA, and the guideline states: Evaluation for hyperparathyroidism (HPT) is recommended in patients scheduled to undergo thyroid surgery who have a history of familial pHPT (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: what is the role of parathyroid surgery? [^116eYUnq]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Successful surgery for nPHPT can yield significant benefits, including improvements in BMD and renal stone risk. However, there is evidence that suggests the magnitude of these improvements may be less in nPHPT patients compared with hPHPT patients. nPHPT can be more challenging to treat due to lower rates of pre-operative localisation, more patients requiring bilateral exploration and smaller but pathological multi-glandular disease. It provides further fuel to the adage that the most important factor is to localise a surgeon fluent in the disease and operative practice. Nonetheless, parathyroidectomy should be considered in patients with nPHPT, but it is important to assess and counsel patients individually to ensure appropriate expectations, even from technically successful parathyroidectomy.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of primary hyperparathyroidism [^114XDA3W]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common endocrine disorder, resulting from the autonomous production of parathyroid hormone from 1 or more abnormal parathyroid glands. Disease presentation ranges from asymptomatic to multiorgan involvement (skeletal, renal, neurocognitive, and gastrointestinal). This article outlines the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic algorithm for PHPT. Key laboratory assessments are discussed, as are imaging studies for preoperative localization. Indications for surgical intervention are detailed, as are potential indications for surveillance. Sporadic and genetic syndromes associated with PHPT are also described.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism in adults-(part I) assessment and medical management: position statement of the Endocrine Society of Australia, the Australian&New Zealand endocrine surgeons, and the Australian&New Zealand bone and mineral society [^113RT9pz]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To formulate clinical consensus recommendations on the presentation, assessment, and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in adults.

Methods

Representatives from relevant Australian and New Zealand Societies used a systematic approach for adaptation of guidelines (ADAPTE) to derive an evidence-informed position statement addressing nine key questions.

Results

PHPT is a biochemical diagnosis. Serum calcium should be measured in patients with suggestive symptoms, reduced bone mineral density or minimal trauma fractures, and in those with renal stones. Other indications are detailed in the manuscript. In patients with hypercalcaemia, intact parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, phosphate, and renal function should be measured. In established PHPT, assessment of bone mineral density, vertebral fractures, urinary tract calculi/nephrocalcinosis and quantification of urinary calcium excretion is warranted. Parathyroidectomy is the only definitive treatment and is warranted for all symptomatic patients and should be considered for asymptomatic patients without contraindications to surgery and with > 10 years life expectancy. In patients who do not undergo surgery, we recommend annual evaluation for disease progression. Where the diagnosis is not clear or the risk-benefit ratio is not obvious, multidisciplinary discussion and formulation of a consensus management plan is appropriate. Genetic testing for familial hyperparathyroidism is recommended in selected patients.

Conclusions

These clinical consensus recommendations were developed to provide clinicians with contemporary guidance on the assessment and management of PHPT in adults. It is anticipated that improved health outcomes for individuals and the population will be achieved at a decreased cost to the community.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^113dWWvX]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To review primary hyperparathyroidism and the key issues that are relevant to the practicing endocrinologist.

Methods

The latest information on the presentation, diagnosis, and traditional and nontraditional aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism is reviewed.

Results

The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is straightforward when the traditional hypercalcemic patient is documented to have an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. Commonly, patients are identified who have normal serum calcium levels but elevated PTH levels in whom no secondary causes for hyperparathyroidism can be confirmed. Traditional target organs of primary hyperparathyroidism-the skeleton and the kidneys-continue to be a focus in the patient evaluation. Bone mineral density shows a typical pattern of involvement with the distal one-third radius being selectively reduced compared with the lumbar spine in which bone mineral density is generally well maintained. Neurocognitive and cardiovascular aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism, while a focus of recent interest, have not been shown to definitively aid in the decision for or against surgery. The recommendation for surgery in primary hyperparathyroidism is based on guidelines that focus on the serum calcium level, renal function, bone mineral density, and age. In patients who do not meet guidelines, a nonsurgical management approach has merit.

Conclusions

Primary hyperparathyroidism is continuing to show changes in its clinical profile, with normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism being a topic of great interest. Skeletal and renal features of primary hyperparathyroidism drive, in most cases, the decision to recommend surgery. In patients who do not meet any criteria for surgery, a conservative approach with appropriate monitoring is acceptable.

### Parathyroid imaging [^112NB5oy]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common endocrine abnormality, caused in most cases by a single parathyroid adenoma. Surgery remains the first-line curative therapy in PHPT. Imaging plays a vital role in presurgical localization of parathyroid adenomas. Ultrasound provides a safe and quick imaging modality free of ionizing radiation, but is operator dependent. Sestamibi scan offers comparable sensitivity to ultrasound, improved with concurrent tomographic imaging. 4DCT remains a problem-solving technique in challenging cases and after failed neck exploration. We present an overview of various parathyroid imaging modalities, including protocols and findings, in addition to relevant pearls and pitfalls.

### Evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism: summary statement and guidelines from the fifth international workshop [^117YG2PD]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The last international guidelines on the evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) were published in 2014. Research since that time has led to new insights into epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, measurements, genetics, outcomes, presentations, new imaging modalities, target and other organ systems, pregnancy, evaluation, and management. Advances in all these areas are demonstrated by the reference list in which the majority of listings were published after the last set of guidelines. It was thus, timely to convene an international group of over 50 experts to review these advances in our knowledge. Four Task Forces considered: 1. Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, and Genetics; 2. Classical and Nonclassical Features; 3. Surgical Aspects; and 4. Management. For Task Force 4 on the Management of PHPT, Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology addressed surgical management of asymptomatic PHPT and non-surgical medical management of PHPT. The findings of this systematic review that applied GRADE methods to randomized trials are published as part of this series. Task Force 4 also reviewed a much larger body of new knowledge from observations studies that did not specifically fit the criteria of GRADE methodology. The full reports of these 4 Task Forces immediately follow this summary statement. Distilling the essence of all deliberations of all Task Force reports and Methodological reviews, we offer, in this summary statement, evidence-based recommendations and guidelines for the evaluation and management of PHPT. Different from the conclusions of the last workshop, these deliberations have led to revisions of renal guidelines and more evidence for the other recommendations. The accompanying papers present an in-depth discussion of topics summarized in this report. © 2022 The Authors.

### The management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^114h1XPC]. Clinical Endocrinology (2002). Low credibility.

Recent improvements in parathyroid imaging have led to renewed interest in the criteria for, and the surgical approach to, parathyroidectomy. It therefore seemed appropriate to review current evidence relating to the evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism for those working within a general endocrine service. The recommendations are based on an electronic search spanning the past decade using the search terms hyperparathyroidism, management and parathyroidectomy/surgery, but we have also included key publications outside this period. The findings have been graded systematically (Appendix), according to the quality of the information available, to indicate the level of evidence on which they are based.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for the definitive surgical management of thyroid disease in adults [^114hezu2]. Annals of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence-based recommendations for safe, effective, and appropriate thyroidectomy.

Background

Surgical management of thyroid disease has evolved considerably over several decades leading to variability in rendered care. Over 100,000 thyroid operations are performed annually in the US.

Methods

The medical literature from 1/1/1985 to 11/9/2018 was reviewed by a panel of 19 experts in thyroid disorders representing multiple disciplines. The authors used the best available evidence to construct surgical management recommendations. Levels of evidence were determined using the American College of Physicians grading system, and management recommendations were discussed to consensus. Members of the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of the content.

Results

These clinical guidelines analyze the indications for thyroidectomy as well as its definitions, technique, morbidity, and outcomes. Specific topics include Pathogenesis and Epidemiology, Initial Evaluation, Imaging, Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy Diagnosis, Molecular Testing, Indications, Extent and Outcomes of Surgery, Preoperative Care, Initial Thyroidectomy, Perioperative Tissue Diagnosis, Nodal Dissection, Concurrent Parathyroidectomy, Hyperthyroid Conditions, Goiter, Adjuncts and Approaches to Thyroidectomy, Laryngology, Familial Thyroid Cancer, Postoperative Care and Complications, Cancer Management, and Reoperation.

Conclusions

Evidence-based guidelines were created to assist clinicians in the optimal surgical management of thyroid disease.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for the definitive surgical management of thyroid disease in adults [^116aQSoE]. Annals of Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Definitive surgical management of thyroid disease — concurrent parathyroidectomy during initial thyroidectomy is directed as follows: Patients undergoing initial thyroidectomy who are diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) should undergo concurrent parathyroidectomy (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Supporting text notes this combined approach can be performed safely with equivalent rates of cure compared with parathyroidectomy alone but may result in increased rates of hypocalcemia, and that adding thyroidectomy to parathyroidectomy may increase the risk of RLN injury. When an enlarged parathyroid is unexpectedly encountered with normal preoperative calcium and/or PTH levels, retrospective series report occurrences of 1.0% and 1.9%; in such cases, the authors state, "We suggest that when other viable parathyroid glands are preserved, a single incidentally discovered, enlarged parathyroid should be removed, although data are lacking to support or refute this approach".

### The role of ultrasonography in parathyroid surgery… [^112yyU9s]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Ultrasonography is a useful tool in the preoperative evaluation of patients with hyperparathyroidism both for localization of parathyroid adenomas and for the diagnosis of concomitant thyroid disease. Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism with localizing studies were offered a minimally invasive approach. Using a skin crease, a small curvilinear transverse cervical incision was made over the area indicated by the localization study. A unilateral neck exploration was performed, and the enlarged parathyroid gland was excised. Successful excision of hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue was defined as a decrease of 50% or more from the baseline intraoperative parathyroid hormone level 20 minutes after surgery. 12 In patients with nonlocalizing scans, bilateral neck exploration was performed. Patients with concomitant thyroid disease were offered fine-needle aspiration or thyroid lobectomy at the time of parathyroidectomy for diagnosis.

11 If fine-needle aspiration indicated a suspicious, a malignant, or an indeterminant lesion, thyroid lobectomy was performed at time of parathyroidectomy. Frozen-section analysis was performed on all thyroid lobectomy specimens, allowing total thyroidectomy to be performed for any malignant or suspicious lesions at the same operation. Ninety-six of the 317 patients in the study were found to have clinically significant concomitant thyroid disease, which was identified preoperatively with ultrasonography in 66 patients, intraoperatively in 12 patients, and incidentally when the thyroid gland was removed for intrathyroidal parathyroid tissue in 18 patients. High-resolution ultrasonography is the modality of choice for the evaluation of concomitant thyroid disease.

Nodules with certain characteristics are at increased risk for being malignant and should be biopsied with fine-needle aspiration before the neck is entered or with thyroid lobectomy and frozen-section analysis at the time of parathyroidectomy. In conclusion, ultrasonography plays an important role in the preoperative evaluation of patients with hyperparathyroidism. For patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, preoperative localization allows the surgeon to use a minimally invasive approach. While we advocate the use of ultrasonography for parathyroid adenoma localization, a role for sestamibi scanning still exists.

### Nonsurgical management of mild primary hyperparathyroidism-a reasonable option [^1139fnCF]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a relatively common disorder which is often diagnosed incidentally and characterized in the majority of those affected by mild stable biochemical abnormalities and lack of symptoms. Nephrolithiasis and bone loss leading to an increased risk of fracture are generally accepted complications of PHPT. Some epidemiological studies report associations between PHPT and a wide range of common diseases, but these relationships may be confounded by the increased body weight observed in PHPT. Because there is a dearth of controlled clinical trial evidence in PHPT, optimal management is controversial. For individuals with mild stable PHPT, low fracture risk and no renal stones, observation without intervention is reasonable. Surgical treatment is clearly indicated for patients at risk of severe hypercalcaemia or with nephrolithiasis. For individuals with increased risk of fracture, antiresorptive therapies improve bone mineral density to a similar degree to surgical treatment. Calcimimetic agents may have a role in managing patients with symptomatic PHPT who cannot undergo, or fail, surgical treatment. There is a need for additional randomized clinical trials to inform management of PHPT.

### MEN2: surgical precision in the era of precision medicine [^112s1vkC]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Biochemistry and imaging

Although a large amount of information about genotype–phenotype correlation in patients with MEN2 is available, there is a dearth of data on biochemical and imaging assessment which specifically relates to patients with this syndrome who developed PHPT. Considering the rarity of MEN2, low penetrance of PHPT in this condition, and the fact that only some of the patients will require surgery, this gap in evidence is unlikely to disappear any time soon, if ever.

It is therefore reasonable and generally accepted that biochemical assessment of patients with MEN2 aiming at establishing the function of the parathyroid glands should follow recommendations for sporadic PHPT and include measuring albumin-corrected or ionised plasma calcium, intact parathormone, vitamin D levels, renal function and 24 h urine collection for calcium. Biochemistry is used for screening, establishing diagnosis of PHPT and deciding whether surgical intervention is necessary, as well as defining outcomes of surgery. According to ATA Guidelines, screening for PHPT should only be performed in patients with mutations associated with this condition and should start at the age of 11 and 16 years for high- and low-risk mutations respectively. Earliest reported cases of PHPT were 2, 6, 7 and 10 years old; there perhaps might be a case for screening to start at the age of 5. Diagnostic threshold for PHPT, defined by above normal levels of plasma calcium and PTH together with evidence of hypercalciuria, renal and skeletal damage, as well as patients' symptoms, should be considered together when deciding whether parathyroid surgery is indicated, similarly to patients with sporadic PHPT.

Imaging of parathyroid glands in patients with MEN2 is not essential in cases with proven PHPT who are scheduled to undergo total thyroidectomy. Four glands visualisation during operation, aided with intraoperative IOPTH monitoring, can correctly identify abnormal glands, and their removal should result in cure. Imaging of parathyroids with US, CT or nuclear scanning (MIBI, choline, methionine) is, however, essential if PHPT is diagnosed after thyroid surgery has been performed some time ago. Parathyroid imaging in patients with sporadic and familial PHPT is helpful, and meta-analyses of different methods showed sensitivity of 63–71% for US, 81% for 3D CT scans, 66–88% for MIBI and 69% for C-methionine, but is lower in recurrent disease.

Definitive surgical management of thyroid disease — parathyroid tissue handling and anatomic considerations report that incidental removal of normal parathyroid tissue occurs during 4% to 22% of thyroid resections, and unintended removal can also be due to intrathyroidal parathyroid location, which is reported in 0.7% to 4% of patients undergoing surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT).

### New perspectives in the management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^1116jEy2]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a biochemical syndrome caused by the inappropriate or unregulated overproduction of parathyroid hormone, Leading to hypercalcae-mia. It was previously considered a relatively rare disorder, with clinical manifestations dominated by renal and/or bone disease. However, in modern times the diagnosis is most frequently recognized coincidentally on biochemical testing in patients evaluated for unrelated complaints. Parathyroidectomy is the only curative treatment for PHPT, with improved outcomes in symptomatic patients following this procedure. However, surgical intervention in patients with no clear clinical features remains controversial. The National Institutes for Health (NIH) have developed consensus guidelines giving specific indications for when surgery is recommended in patients with asymptomatic PHPT. This article examines the impact of treatment on asymptomatic PHPT, focusing on bone disease, neurocognitive function, quality of Life, cardiovascular disease and mortality. Medical treatment options, including bisphospho-nates and cinacalcet, are also discussed.

### Guidelines for the management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: summary statement from the fourth international workshop [^111dqGvZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is routinely encountered in clinical practices of endocrinology throughout the world. This report distills an update of current information about diagnostics, clinical features, and management of this disease into a set of revised guidelines.

Participants

Participants, representing an international constituency, with interest and expertise in various facets of asymptomatic PHPT constituted four Workshop Panels that developed key questions to be addressed. They then convened in an open 3-day conference September 19–21, 2013, in Florence, Italy, when a series of presentations and discussions addressed these questions. A smaller subcommittee, the Expert Panel, then met in closed session to reach an evidence-based consensus on how to address the questions and data that were aired in the open forum.

Evidence

Preceding the conference, each question was addressed by a relevant, extensive literature search. All presentations and deliberations of the Workshop Panels and the Expert Panel were based upon the latest information gleaned from this literature search.

Consensus Process

The expert panel considered all the evidence provided by the individual Workshop Panels and then came to consensus.

Conclusion

In view of new findings since the last International Workshop on the Management of Asymptomatic PHPT, guidelines for management have been revised. The revised guidelines include: 1) recommendations for more extensive evaluation of the skeletal and renal systems; 2) skeletal and/or renal involvement as determined by further evaluation to become part of the guidelines for surgery; and 3) more specific guidelines for monitoring those who do not meet guidelines for parathyroid surgery. These guidelines should help endocrinologists and surgeons caring for patients with PHPT. A blueprint for future research is proposed to foster additional investigation into issues that remain uncertain or controversial.

### Nuclear imaging and minimally invasive surgery in the management of hyperparathyroidism [^113GZWwP]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of hypercalcemia, and the treatment is primarily surgical. Because of biochemical screening, more patients now present with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism, and consensus guidelines have been developed for the treatment of these patients. There is now considerable interest in minimally invasive approaches to the treatment of hyperparathyroidism. Sestamibi scanning as a localizing study, used in combination with anatomic imaging and intraoperative rapid parathyroid hormone assays, has enabled focused surgical approaches. Patients with localizing studies that indicate a single parathyroid adenoma are candidates for such approaches, including unilateral neck exploration, minimally invasive single-gland exploration, or endoscopic exploration instead of the traditional approach of bilateral neck exploration. Nuclear imaging is also critical to the successful management of patients with persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism.

### What steps should be considered in the patient who has had a negative cervical exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism? [^113y7SXQ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

The key to cure of the patient with persistent primary hyperparathyroidism is a clear understanding of the investigations, operative procedure and pathology related to the initial procedure. Reinvestigation and subsequent surgery should be performed in a specialist unit. A logical pathway of increasingly sophisticated localization studies (MIBI, ultrasound, CT/MRI, selective venous catheterization for PTH) will usually guide the surgeon to the missing parathyroid gland/s. Improved preoperative localization can facilitate the use of a minimally invasive small incision approach. The surgeon must have a detailed knowledge of the nuances of parathyroid embryology and a meticulous surgical technique, not only to identify and safely remove the retained gland/s but also do so without causing unnecessary morbidity. Results of re-operation (84–98% cure) from centres of excellence are highly commendable, yet the use of 'new' technology (that includes intra-operative PTH) has not translated into improved outcomes in all cases. Some parathyroid glands are extremely difficult to find! Re-operative parathyroid surgery is a challenge, sometimes easy, and on other occasions extremely difficult.

### Management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^112EhSbW]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Since the last international guidelines were published in 2014 on the evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), new information has become available with regard to evaluation, diagnosis, epidemiology, genetics, classical and nonclassical manifestations, surgical and nonsurgical approaches, and natural history. To provide the most current summary of these developments, an international group, consisting of over 50 experts in these various aspects of PHPT, was convened. This paper provides the results of the task force that was assigned to review the information on the management of PHPT. For this task force on the management of PHPT, two questions were the subject of systematic reviews using the Gradingof Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology. The full report addressing surgical and nonsurgical management of PHPT, utilizing the GRADE methodology, is published separately in this series. In this report, we summarize the results of that methodological review and expand them to encompass a much larger body of new knowledge that did not specifically fit the criteria of the GRADE methodology. Together, both the systematic and narrative reviews of the literature, summarized in this paper, give the most complete information available to date. A panel of experts then considered the last set of international guidelines in light of the newer data and assessed the need for their revision. This report provides the evidentiary background to the guidelines report. In that report, evidence from all task forces is synthesized into a summary statement and revised guidelines for the evaluation and management of PHPT. © 2022 The Authors.

### Contemporary management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^115Gbaya]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism can be asymptomatic or symptomatic, as well as classic, normocalcemic, or normohormonal. It is important to rule out other causes of hypercalcemia or hyperparathyroidism. Preoperative localization with imaging is necessary for a minimally invasive approach and can be helpful even if planning 4-gland exploration. There are a variety of intraoperative techniques that can assist with localization as well as confirming success. Standard of care remains surgical resection of affected glands. However, there are less invasive management strategies that can be considered for poor surgical candidates.

### American head and neck society endocrine surgery section update on parathyroid imaging for surgical candidates with primary hyperparathyroidism [^115wnX4D]. Head & Neck (2019). Medium credibility.

Health care consumer organizations and insurance companies increasingly are scrutinizing value when considering reimbursement policies for medical interventions. Recently, members of several American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) committees worked closely with one insurance company to refine reimbursement policies for preoperative localization imaging in patients undergoing surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism. This endeavor led to an AAO-HNS parathyroid imaging consensus statement (https://www.entnet.org/content/parathyroid-imaging). The American Head and Neck Society Endocrine Surgery Section gathered an expert panel of authors to delineate imaging options for preoperative evaluation of surgical candidates with primary hyperparathyroidism. We review herein the current literature for preoperative parathyroid localization imaging, with discussion of efficacy, cost, and overall value. We recommend that planar sestamibi imaging, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), SPECT/CT, CT neck/mediastinum with contrast, MRI, and four dimensional CT (4D-CT) may be used in conjunction with high-resolution neck ultrasound to preoperatively localize pathologic parathyroid glands. PubMed literature on parathyroid imaging was reviewed through February 1, 2019.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism: should surgery be performed on all patients? Current evidence and residual uncertainties [^115Jcdnu]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is the third most common endocrine disease and is characterized by hypercalcaemia and elevated or inappropriately 'normal' levels of the parathyroid hormone (PTH). The main target organs of PTH are the skeletal system and the kidneys. Before the 1970s, pHPT was a rarely detected disease associated with notable morbidity and premature mortality. Introduction of biochemical screening, allowing for a wide range of indications, has contributed to the detection of the full spectrum of the disease. A new entity with an isolated elevation of PTH, normocalcaemic HP, has emerged and is currently being explored. The highest incidence of pHPT, 3–5%, is observed amongst women, and the prevalence increases with age. The female-to-male ratio is 3–4: 1 except in younger patients where distribution is equal and known hereditary causes account for approximately 10% of the cases. In the last few decades, it has become evident that fewer patients than previously believed are truly asymptomatic. The cause of pHPT is often a benign tumour, a parathyroid adenoma, and the only definite treatment is parathyroidectomy (PTX). No medical treatment, single or combined, can achieve a curing of pHPT. Recent data indicate that PTX, despite being proven to be cost-effective compared to conservative treatment, is underutilized, especially in elderly pHPT patients. The decision of PTX should always be based on a safe diagnosis, and the potential benefits of curative treatment should not be outweighed by the risks of surgery or anaesthesia.

### The surgical management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the fourth international workshop [^115adJ2W]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The surgical management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) has undergone considerable advances over the past two decades. The purpose of this report is to review these advances.

Participants

This subgroup was constituted by the Steering Committee of the Fourth International Workshop on the Management of Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism to address key questions related to the surgical management of PHPT.

Evidence

Data since the last International Workshop were presented and discussed in detail. The topics included improvements in preoperative imaging, intraoperative adjuncts, refinements in local and regional anesthesia, and rapid intraoperative PTH assays.

Consensus Process

Questions were developed by the International Task Force on PHPT. A comprehensive literature search for relevant studies was undertaken. After extensive review and discussion, the subgroup agreed on what recommendations should be made to the Expert Panel regarding surgical approaches to parathyroidectomy.

Conclusions

1) All patients with PHPT who meet surgical criteria should be referred to an experienced endocrine surgeon to discuss the risks, benefits, and potential complications of surgery. 2) Patients who do not meet surgical criteria and in whom there are no medical contraindications to surgery may request a visit with an experienced endocrine surgeon. Alternatively, a multidisciplinary endocrine conference with surgeon involvement could be employed to address all relevant issues. 3) Imaging is not a diagnostic procedure; it is a localization procedure to help the surgeon optimize the operative plan. 4) The frequency of hereditary forms of PHPT may be underappreciated and needs to be assessed with increased vigilance. And 5) surgery is likely to benefit patients due to high cure rates, low complication rates, and the likelihood of reversing skeletal manifestations.

### AAES guidelines for primary hyperparathyroidism management… [^117J3Tye]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Cervical ultrasonography or other high-resolution imaging is recommended for operative planning. Patients with nonlocalizing imaging remain surgical candidates. Preoperative parathyroid biopsy should be avoided. Surgeons who perform a high volume of operations have better outcomes. The possibility of multigland disease should be routinely considered. Both focused, image-guided surgery and bilateral exploration are appropriate operations that achieve high cure rates. Quiz Ref IDRecommendation 3–1: Parathyroidectomy is indicated, and is the preferred treatment, for all patients with symptomatic pHPT. Recommendation 3–2: Parathyroidectomy is indicated when the serum calcium level is greater than 1 mg/dL above normal, regardless of whether objective symptoms are present or absent.

Recommendation 3–3: Parathyroidectomy is indicated for objective evidence of renal involvement, including silent nephrolithiasis on renal imaging, nephrocalcinosis, hypercalciuria with increased stone risk, or impaired renal function. The preoperative diagnosis of PCA may be difficult. If PCA is suspected, patients should be treated surgically because this is the only potentially curative treatment. Recommendation 3–6: Parathyroidectomy is indicated when the clinical or biochemical evidence is consistent with PCA. Patients with pHPT frequently have neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. With varying response patterns, 3 randomized clinical trials demonstrated neurocognitive benefits of surgery vs observation.

13, 14, 21 Recommendation 3–8: Parathyroidectomy is recommended for patients with neurocognitive and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms that are attributable to pHPT. Recommendation 4–2: Patients who are candidates for surgery and have negative or discordant imaging results should still be referred to a parathyroid surgeon for evaluation. For initial image-guided surgery, positive imaging directs where to start exploration, and the results of intraoperative PTH monitoring help to terminate it. Recommendation 6–1: When image-guided focused parathyroidectomy is planned, IPM is suggested to avoid higher operative failure rates.

### When would I use medical therapies for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism? [^112DEB6V]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Although there may be controversy surrounding the indications for parathyroidectomy in primary hyperparathyroidism, it remains the only accepted definitive therapy. However, even if parathyroidectomy is indicated, some patients refuse surgery, are medically unfit or have residual or recurrent disease inaccessible to further surgery. Some of these patients may be suitable for long-term observation but others require intervention for management of symptomatic or moderate to severe hypercalcaemia, loss of bone mineral density or renal calculi. The selection of a suitable therapy for each patient should be individualized.

3 PRIMARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM

pHPT is the most frequent manifestation of MEN1 and often the first manifestation of the disease. In paediatric patients who are prospectively screened, at least half already have early signs of pHPT, which is mostly asymptomatic and rarely seen before the age of 10. Symptomatic pHPT is usually not seen before the third decade of life. pHPT in MEN1 is a multiglandular disease, although glands are often affected asymmetrically and asynchronously. Patients with MEN1‐related pHPT have a lower bone mineral density (BMD) than patients with sporadic pHPT. Furthermore, urolithiasis is seen frequently and at a young age, and patients with MEN1 aged 20–59 appeared to have a higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease stage 3 compared to the general US population. It is therefore important to monitor patients with MEN1‐related pHPT for these complications. The treatment of pHPT is surgical, and the aim of initial parathyroidectomy is achieving eucalcemia for as long as possible, while preventing hypoparathyroidism and facilitating potential reoperative surgery. Since the publication of the guidelines and publication of additional studies, most experts agree that the preferred initial operation in MEN1 is a bilateral cervical exploration, identifying all four parathyroid glands and performing a subtotal parathyroidectomy with concomitant cervical thymectomy. This provides the best balance between rates of persistent/recurrent disease and postoperative hypoparathyroidism. In recent years it has been debated if for young people with MEN1‐related pHPT, a stepwise approach to parathyroid surgery should be offered in the form of unilateral clearance (resection of all parathyroids and cervical thymus on one side) as initial operation. The rationale for considering this in those with unilateral disease on preoperative imaging, is to provide several years of eucalcemia allowing to accumulate peak bone mass, while not being subjected to the risk of hypoparathyroidism. Others are fiercely opposed such an approach, due to unacceptable failure rates. As currently, no consensus exists, if such an approach is considered, the risks and benefits should be discussed with the patient and/or parents. Another topic that becomes increasingly important with more widespread use of predictive testing and prospective screening is the timing of initial parathyroidectomy when pHPT is mild and asymptomatic at diagnosis, especially in children. Arguments favouring initial observation are to avoid the risk of symptomatic hypoparathyroidism, multiple operations and making the glands more easily identifiable if the disease progressed a bit more. Others advocate early intervention based on early bone and renal complications. In children, the effect of mild pHPT on peak BMD or development in general is unknown as is the effect of hypoparathyroidism. Decisions are therefore different in children compared to adults and currently no consensus exists.

### Current issues in the presentation of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the fourth international workshop [^114uRtpo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

This report summarizes data on traditional and nontraditional manifestations of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) that have been published since the last International Workshop on PHPT.

Participants

This subgroup was constituted by the Steering Committee to address key questions related to the presentation of PHPT. Consensus was established at a closed meeting of the Expert Panel that followed.

Evidence

Data from the 5-year period between 2008 and 2013 were presented and discussed to determine whether they support changes in recommendations for surgery or nonsurgical follow-up.

Consensus Process

Questions were developed by the International Task Force on PHPT. A comprehensive literature search for relevant studies was undertaken. After extensive review and discussion, the subgroup came to agreement on what changes in the recommendations for surgery or nonsurgical follow-up of asymptomatic PHPT should be made to the Expert Panel.

Conclusions

1) There are limited new data available on the natural history of asymptomatic PHPT. Although recognition of normocalcemic PHPT (normal serum calcium with elevated PTH concentrations; no secondary cause for hyperparathyroidism) is increasing, data on the clinical presentation and natural history of this phenotype are limited. 2) Although there are geographic differences in the predominant phenotypes of PHPT (symptomatic, asymptomatic, normocalcemic), they do not justify geography-specific management guidelines. 3) Recent data using newer, higher resolution imaging and analytic methods have revealed that in asymptomatic PHPT, both trabecular bone and cortical bone are affected. 4) Clinically silent nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis can be detected by renal imaging and should be listed as a new criterion for surgery. 5) Current data do not support a cardiovascular evaluation or surgery for the purpose of improving cardiovascular markers, anatomical or functional abnormalities. 6) Some patients with mild PHPT have neuropsychological complaints and cognitive abnormalities, and some of these patients may benefit from surgical intervention. However, it is not possible at this time to predict which patients with neuropsychological complaints or cognitive issues will improve after successful parathyroid surgery.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: an update on diagnostic and management challenges [^114Tu7pc]. Clinical Endocrinology (2020). Medium credibility.

Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition that can present with intermittent hypercalcemia or may evolve into hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism. This milder biochemical entity remains incompletely understood because of a lack of long-term health outcomes regarding both medical and surgical approaches to its management. Medical therapies have shown some efficacy. A limited number of studies have found that bisphosphonates increase bone mineral density, and calcimimetics may decrease the risk of nephrolithiasis in patients with normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism. Studies have also described patient outcomes after applying the same surgical criteria used for patients with hypercalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism to those with the normocalcaemic form of the disease. These studies suggest that parathyroid surgery appears to be effective in normalizing elevated serum parathyroid hormone concentrations and decreasing adverse renal and skeletal outcomes in patients with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism. Given the available data and overall lack of consensus regarding the optimal management of these patients, a reasonable approach is to tailor treatment to the individual patient by considering their risk factors for new or accelerated bone loss, kidney stones, diminished quality of life, and cardiovascular disease.

### Surgeon-performed ultrasonography vs scintigraphy in primary hyperparathyroidism… [^112cphRU]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Question Is surgeon-performed ultrasonography, with or without contrast enhancement, noninferior to scintigraphy for localizing pathological parathyroid glands in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Findings In this prospective, paired, noninferiority cohort study, a total of 172 consecutive patients with primary hyperparathyroidism underwent scintigraphy followed by ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography by a blinded surgeon-sonographer. The study found that ultrasonography, both with and without contrast enhancement, was noninferior to scintigraphy. Meaning Conventional ultrasonography by an experienced parathyroid surgeon-sonographer may be a valid first-line imaging modality for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, with further imaging reserved for cases that are equivocal or nonlocalizing on ultrasonography.

Importance Scintigraphy and ultrasonography are common imaging modalities for the preoperative localization of enlarged parathyroid glands in primary hyperparathyroidism. When comparing the 2 modalities, the benefits of ultrasonography in terms of convenience, patient comfort, duration, cost, and lack of radiation should be taken into account. The diagnosis is strictly biochemical. 1 The definite cure for PHPT is surgical excision of all hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands, and imaging is only indicated when surgery is being considered. 1, 2 The majority of patients with PHPT have a single adenoma and can be cured by a minimally invasive. Participants formed a consecutive series and signed an informed consent document. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.
26.

A true-positive imaging result suggested the presence of disease in a quadrant from which a hyperplastic or adenomatous parathyroid gland was removed during surgery. A false-positive imaging result suggested the presence of disease in a quadrant from which no pathological gland was removed during surgery — in patients without residual disease at follow-up. A true-negative imaging result suggested the absence of disease in a quadrant from which no pathological gland was removed during surgery — in patients without residual disease at follow-up. In the study period, 362 patients were referred to Odense University Hospital for parathyroidectomy. Of these, 207 patients were eligible for inclusion and wished to participate. Thirty-five patients had to be excluded, leaving 172 patients enrolled in the study. All patients fulfilled the criteria for PHPT on diagnosis.

### Update in parathyroid imaging [^115W8aK7]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is characterized by excessive, dysregulated production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by 1 or more abnormal parathyroid glands. Minimally invasive surgical techniques have created a need for more precise localization of the parathyroid lesion by imaging. A variety of imaging protocols and techniques have been used for this purpose, but no one modality is clearly superior. Nuclear medicine scintigraphy and ultrasound imaging are established modalities, although multiphase or 4-dimensional computed tomography is an emerging modality with several advantages. This review provides a background regarding PHPT and key anatomy, and discusses these alternative parathyroid imaging modalities with updates.

### Direct comparison of preoperative imaging modalities for localization of primary hyperparathyroidism… [^114hBBZX]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

This study suggests that choline PET-CT would be the best preoperative imaging modality for localization of primary hyperparathyroidism. Importance Accurate preoperative localization of primary hyperparathyroidism is an important and challenging issue for a successful parathyroidectomy. Although new imaging modalities have been introduced during the past decade, direct comparative studies on advanced imaging techniques are limited. Results A total of 8495 patients from 119 direct comparative studies using 2 or more imaging modalities for localization of pHPT were included. Surgical resection of abnormal parathyroid glands through neck exploration is the mainstay for curative treatment in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.

Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy has recently become the standard surgical technique for pHPT with the help of image-guided focused exploration, which is associated with advantages in terms of operation time, length of hospital stay, cost, and patient satisfaction. 1, 2 Thus, a confident and accurate preoperative localization by noninvasive imaging studies is an important and challenging issue for successful parathyroidectomy. Although ultrasonography may be the most commonly used imaging modality in the preoperative setting of pHPT owing to its widespread availability, the sensitivity of US widely varies, with well-recognized operator-dependent properties. 3 Parathyroid scintigraphy has historically been established as a preoperative localization technique for pHPT either with dual tracer subtraction, such as technetium 99m sestamibi –Tc 99m pertechnetate, or dual phase of single tracer using MIBI.

Four-dimensional CT using the unique perfusion characteristics of the parathyroid lesion is a new imaging modality for localization of pHPT that showed more accurate results compared with both US and MIBI SPECT. 3 Positron emission tomography is another state-of-the-art imaging technology that provides functional information like scintigraphy with better spatial resolution. Radiolabeled choline is incorporated into the proliferating cell membranes, and the increased uptake of choline in hyperparathyroidism seems to be caused by increased phospholipid-dependent choline kinase activity from an overreleased parathyroid hormone. 146 Giovanella et al8 claim that FCH PET-CT will replace other current methods of preoperative parathyroid imaging owing to its excellent diagnostic performance and low radiation burden.

### The landmark series: management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^115o2tun]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgery is the only definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). The surgical management of PHPT has evolved over the past several decades in response to the continually growing body of evidence supporting its effectiveness in both symptomatic and asymptomatic disease. As imaging modalities for localization, operative approach, and intraoperative adjuncts, such as intraoperative parathyroid hormone testing, have been optimized, careful evaluation of the timing of parathyroidectomy in relationship to the disease's natural history has been pursued to limit the detrimental end-organ effects of untreated PHPT. Herein, we review select studies examining key aspects of PHPT management fundamental to the practicing surgical oncologist and endocrine surgeon caring for patients with PHPT.

Management

Patient work up and assessment with regard to 'candidates for surgery'

Referral for surgery

At present, for PHPT as a whole, referral for surgery is deemed necessary if patients are symptomatic, if there is end-organ involvement or if serum calcium is greater than 2.85 mmol/l. NICE also recommends to 'consider' surgery for those who do not fulfil the above criteria (see Table 2). This appears to be a reasonable starting point for nPHPT patients as those who may stand to benefit from prevention of progression of end organ effects can be referred for surgery. Questions remain, however, on whether surgery is of benefit to reduce risk of a number of non-skeletal and renal outcomes in nPHPT and whether alternative criteria should be developed.

Table 2.
Existing NICE guidance for PHPT surgical referral.

Localisation studies

Prior to surgery, ultrasonography and radionuclide scanning are utilised in an attempt to localise a parathyroid adenoma. However, studies have shown that imaging in nPHPT is less successful compared with hPHPT; this poses an additional challenge from a surgical perspective. In their case series of 616 patients, Trinh et al. reported a significantly higher incidence of multi-glandular disease (p = 0.002) in nPHPT patients, with 12% of nPHPT patients having multi-glandular disease compared with 4% of hPHPT patients. Moreover, Gómez-Ramírez et al. reported that parathyroid adenomas of nPHPT patients weighed on average 656 mg less than hPHPT patients (p = 0.058). These findings of a greater incidence of multi-glandular disease and smaller adenomas in nPHPT are supported extensively within the literature.– The combination of these two factors contributes to a lower sensitivity upon ultrasonography and technetium (Tc)-sestamibi scintigraphy amongst nPHPT patients.

### Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: diagnostic pitfalls and surgical intervention [^116BqGBx]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common disease, with a prevalence as high as 1 in 400 women and 1 in 1000 men, and most are asymptomatic. Patients with PHPT have hypercalcemia with inappropriately normal levels of parathyroid hormone. Parathyroidectomy is the only curative therapy, and the procedure has become more common and more safe. Among asymptomatic patients, parathyroidectomy halts the progression of disease, improves quality of life, and may decrease risk of fracture and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Thus, surgery should be considered in all patients with asymptomatic PHPT who have minimal perioperative risk and sufficient life expectancy, regardless of chronologic age.

### Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: new issues and new questions – bridging the past with the future [^11266dkG]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2002). Low credibility.

The earliest clinical descriptions of PHPT pointed to an inexorably progressive disorder. Now, in many asymptomatic individuals who do not meet any surgical guidelines. PHPT in general, does not seem to be progressive. Most asymptomatic patients seem to remain asymptomatic over many years of observation. In those with major clinical manifestations, nephrolithiasis is by far the most common. In these patients, surgery is clearly indicated. Bone densitometry is an indispensable component of the evaluation as well as in monitoring because there is evidence of bone involvement in most patients. This contrasts with the skeletal X-ray, which is invariably negative. Nevertheless, patients with PHPT can show a bone mass measurement either at the cortical or cancellous skeleton that is more than 2 SDs below age- and sex-matched control subjects. Bone density, serum calcium concentration, and/or urinary calcium excretion per se can show evidence for progression in as many as 25% of patients with asymptomatic PHPT. There are newer pharmacologic approaches to PHPT that are the subject of intense investigation. The bisphosphonates and the calcimimetics show particular promise in this regard. Unanswered are such questions as whether the lower bone density in the milder patients will increase substantially as in those who undergo successful parathyroidectomy and whether fracture risk would therefore be reduced. Can medical therapy reduce serum calcium. parathyroid hormone levels, and other biochemical indices of PHPT? Can medical therapy improve bone density without the need for surgery. The issues outlined in this presentation and further amplified in other presentations given in this workshop lead to a series of questions that, in turn, may lead to modified guidelines for the management of these patients. The questions are as follows. (1) Should there be any changes in diagnostic criteria for PHPT? (2) Should the guidelines for surgery in PHPT be changed in light of new data over the past decade? What should those guidelines be? (3) At present, is there sufficient evidence of clinical benefit with specific medical therapies to recommend their use? In which patients? (4) Can some patients be followed without surgery? If so, how should they be monitored? (5) When surgery is the preferred option, what are the relative merits of minimally invasive procedures compared with more conventional surgery? (6) What is the role of localization techniques in identifying abnormal parathyroid tissue preoperatively and intraoperatively? Are they sufficiently helpful and cost effective to warrant their use in all patients who undergo parathyroid surgery? If not, in what patients should they be recommended? (7) What items should be placed on the research agenda for PHPT over the next decade?

### Who benefits from treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism? [^116nQNtg]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Parathyroidectomy (PTx) is the only definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), but is commonly underutilized. Most patients are medically observed, whereas approximately 30% of patients are treated operatively. PTx is a low-risk surgical procedure and the most cost-effective treatment option. An international consensus statement was published in 1990 to guide clinicians in the management of patients with PHPT, particularly those with asymptomatic disease. Most patients with PHPT and low perioperative risk benefit from surgical treatment, regardless of whether they meet consensus criteria, due to fracture risk reduction, health-related quality-of-life improvements, and prevention or mitigation of disease progression.

Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence-based recommendations to guide the surgical management and postoperative follow-up of adults with primary hyperparathyroidism.

Methods

Representatives from relevant Australian and New Zealand Societies used a systematic approach for adaptation of guidelines (ADAPTE) to derive an evidence-informed position statement addressing eight key questions.

Results

Diagnostic imaging does not determine suitability for surgery but can guide the planning of surgery in suitable candidates. First-line imaging includes ultrasound and either parathyroid 4DCT or scintigraphy, depending on local availability and expertise. Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy is appropriate in most patients with concordant imaging. Bilateral neck exploration should be considered in those with discordant/negative imaging findings, multi-gland disease and genetic/familial risk factors. Parathyroid surgery, especially re-operative surgery, has better outcomes in the hands of higher volume surgeons. Neuromonitoring is generally not required for initial surgery but should be considered for re-operative surgery. Following parathyroidectomy, calcium and parathyroid hormone levels should be re-checked in the first 24h and repeated early if there are risk factors for hypocalcaemia. Eucalcaemia at 6 months is consistent with surgical cure; parathyroid hormone levels do not need to be re-checked in the absence of other clinical indications. Longer-term surveillance of skeletal health is recommended.

Conclusions

This position statement provides up-to-date guidance on evidence-based best practice surgical and postoperative management of adults with primary hyperparathyroidism.

Conclusion

Ensuring that patients are monitored appropriately and supplementation provided where necessary is vital to maintain patient safety at all times due to the significant consequences that are associated with a rapidly falling calcium level. Mapping the current process by flow-chart and using this as the basis for discussing experiences and identifying areas for improvement was a crucial first step towards achieving this. Implementing five simple interventions has been shown to greatly improve the monitoring of calcium post-operatively, and ultimately improve patient safety at the RD&E.

### Surgery for asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the third international workshop [^1119hk9G]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Context

An international workshop on primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) was convened on May 13, 2008, to review and update the previous summary statement on the management of asymptomatic PHPT published in 2002.

Evidence Acquisition

Electronic literature sources were systematically reviewed, addressing critical aspects of the surgical issues pertaining to the indications, imaging, surgical treatment, and cost-effective management of patients with PHPT.

Evidence Synthesis

The surgical group concluded that many patients with "asymptomatic" PHPT have neurocognitive symptoms that may be unmasked after successful parathyroidectomy. Furthermore, reduced bone density and increased fracture risk can be improved with parathyroidectomy. When PHPT is symptomatic, it may be associated with nephrolithiasis, increased cardiovascular disease, and decreased survival. Preoperative imaging studies should only be performed to help plan the operation, and negative imaging should never preclude surgical referral. Noninvasive localization studies including ultrasound and sestamibi scans are often employed, especially in anticipation of focused explorations. Invasive localization studies should be reserved for remedial explorations where noninvasive imaging has been unsuccessful.

Conclusions

When performed by expert parathyroid surgeons, parathyroid surgery is safe, cost-effective, and associated with very low perioperative morbidity. Minimally invasive approaches to parathyroid surgery appear to be as effective as the classic bilateral cervical exploration approach.

### Surgical management of the parathyroids [^113SRGjv]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The recent advance of intraoperative PTH monitoring combined with preoperative localization techniques allow for minimally invasive parathyroid surgery in 75% to 85% of cases. In cases where a single adenoma is identified, minimally invasive techniques should result in a need for repeat surgery in only 2% of cases. The cost of intraoperative PTH assays of localization and gamma probes limits their availability. Complications of parathyroidectomy are uncommon, but appropriate management is important, particularly for patients with hypocalcemia.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^113fus1j]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the most common cause of hypercalcemia, is most often identified in postmenopausal women. The clinical presentation of PHPT has evolved over the past 40 years to include three distinct clinical phenotypes, each of which has been studied in detail and has led to evolving concepts about target organ involvement, natural history, and management.

Methods

In the present review, I provide an evidence-based summary of this disorder as it has been studied worldwide, citing key concepts and data that have helped to shape our concepts about this disease.

Results

PHPT is now recognized to include three clinical phenotypes: overt target organ involvement, mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia, and high PTH levels with persistently normal albumin-corrected and ionized serum calcium values. The factors that determine which of these clinical presentations is more likely to predominate in a given country include the extent to which biochemical screening is used, vitamin D deficiency is present, and whether parathyroid hormone levels are routinely measured in the evaluation of low bone density or frank osteoporosis. Guidelines for parathyroidectomy apply to all three clinical forms of the disease. If surgical guidelines are not met, parathyroidectomy can also be an appropriate option if no medical contraindications are present. If either the serum calcium or bone mineral density is of concern and surgery is not an option, pharmacological approaches are available and effective.

Conclusions

Advances in our knowledge of PHPT have guided new concepts in diagnosis and management.

### Methodology for the guidelines on evaluation and management of hypoparathyroidism and primary hyperparathyroidism [^114jRBXb]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

To develop guidelines for hypoparathyroidism and primary hyperparathyroidism, the panel assembled a panel of experts in parathyroid disorders, general endocrinologists, representatives of the Hypoparathyroidism Association, and systematic review and guideline methodologists. The guideline panel referred to a formal process following the Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) methodology to issue GRADEd recommendations. In this approach, panelists and methodologists formatted the questions, conducted systematic reviews, evaluated risk of bias, assessed certainty of evidence, and presented a summary of findings in a transparent fashion. For most recommendations, the task forces used a less structured approach largely based on narrative reviews to issue non-GRADEd recommendations. The panel issued Eight GRADEd recommendations (seven for hypoparathyroidism and one for hyperparathyroidism). Each GRADEd recommendation is linked to the underlying body of evidence and judgments regarding the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations, values and preferences, and costs, feasibility, acceptability and equity. This article summarizes the methodology for issuing GRADEd and non-GRADEd recommendations for patients with hypoparathyroidism or hyperparathyroidism. © 2022 The Authors.

### Parathyroid imaging [^115kvq3t]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common endocrine disorder caused by the overproduction of parathyroid hormone either by a single adenomatous gland or by multiple adenomatous or hyperplastic glands. Surgical resection of the abnormal parathyroid glands is the standard treatment, the goal of initial parathyroidectomy being durable biochemical cure. Surgeons have recently shifted to more minimally invasive and selective techniques for parathyroid exploration. More selective surgical approaches rely on accurate preoperative imaging techniques to localize abnormal parathyroid glands. It is imperative that radiologists are familiar with imaging features of parathyroid glands as well as the role of imaging in patient care.

### Clinical review: parathyroid localization and implications for clinical management [^11723FS3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical Context

The prevalence of hyperparathyroidism, especially primary hyperparathyroidism, has increased in recent decades due to improvements in diagnostic techniques with a corresponding surge in parathyroid surgery, leading to the development of focused, minimally invasive surgical approaches. Focused parathyroidectomy is predicated on preoperative localization of suspected parathyroid pathology. As a result, there has been a proliferation of parathyroid imaging modalities and protocols, resulting in confusion about their indications and applications.

Evidence Acquisition

Bibliographies from clinical trials and review articles published since 2000 were reviewed and supplemented with targeted searches using biomedical databases. We also employed our extensive clinical experience.

Evidence Synthesis

The best-studied modalities for parathyroid localization are nuclear scintigraphy and sonography and are widely applied as initial studies. Multiple variations exist, and several additional noninvasive imaging techniques, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance, are described. The exquisite anatomical detail of 4-dimensional computed tomography must be balanced with significant radiation exposure to the thyroid gland. Invasive venous PTH sampling and parathyroid arteriography have important roles in remedial cases. Due to considerable heterogeneity in imaging, multidisciplinary collaboration between endocrinologists, surgeons, and radiologists is beneficial.

Conclusions

Parathyroid localization is indicated in surgical candidates. Crucial considerations when selecting an imaging study include availability, cost, radiation exposure, local expertise, and accuracy. Additional factors include the patient's anticipated pathology and whether it is de novo or refractory disease. An approach to imaging for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism is presented.

Introduction

Primary hyperparathyroidism is an endocrine disorder caused by one or more hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands. The suspicion of pHPT is typically raised by the detection of hypercalcemia and/or its associated symptoms. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) serum concentration is elevated, or within normal limits but inappropriate considering the presence of hypercalcemia. A rare type of pHPT is normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism presenting with normal serum calcium levels but an elevated PTH concentration.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the third most common endocrine disease, affecting women 2–3 times more often than men. It is caused by the hyperfunction of one or more parathyroid glands, which are overproducing PTH. Hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands are solitary adenomas in the majority of cases. Approximately 15–20% of cases are caused by multiglandular disease (MGD), i.e. multiple adenomas or hyperplasia, while parathyroid carcinoma accounts for less than 1% of cases. The majority of pHPT cases (95%) occur sporadically, but approximately 5% are part of hereditary syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia types 1, 2, and 4 (MEN-1, MEN-2, and MEN-4) and hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, or as part of non-syndromic familial pHPT.

Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, a potential differential diagnosis to pHPT, has to be recognized as it usually does not require surgery.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a disorder characterized by increased serum PTH levels due to parathyroid gland hyperplasia, triggered by hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, or decreased serum vitamin D concentration. The most common causes of sHPT are vitamin D deficiency and chronic renal disease. Sometimes pHPT and vitamin D deficiency occur simultaneously, which results in decreased or normal serum calcium levels. Rarer causes are long-term treatment with lithium or magnesium, intestinal malabsorption or malnutrition, or sunitinib treatment.

The therapy of sHPT depends on the primary cause. In the case of renal HPT, therapy mainly consists of a restriction of dietary intake together with medical treatment with calcimimetics, vitamin D analogues, and phosphorus binders. Still, parathyroidectomy is required in patients with renal sHPT refractory to medical treatment, i.e. in approximately 15% of patients after 10 years and 38% of patients after 20 years of renal dialysis therapy.

### Approach to the patient: management of parathyroid diseases across pregnancy [^112dwCku]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

After establishing the biochemical diagnosis of PHPT, the next step should be imaging if surgery is considered. If surgery during pregnancy is not indicated, imaging can be postponed until after delivery. Avoiding radiation exposure in pregnancy is important and therefore, neck ultrasonography should, of course, be the first imaging method. To improve the probability of correct preoperative localization of parathyroid adenoma(s) and to therefore improve the surgical success, it seems reasonable to perform 2 different imaging methods. In the case of pregnant women with PHPT, considerations require taking into account the potential benefits of an additional imaging method vs the potential harms, availability, and costs, etc. A 4D-dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan lacks ionizing radiation, but this technique might not be universally available. In addition, 99mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99mTc-MIBI) scans, sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT), 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT or methionine PET/CT could also be considered after careful consideration of potential risks and benefits. Of note, the fetal radiation exposure by a 99mTc-MIBI scan is below the threshold associated with fetal harm. 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT may have a lower maternal radiation dose than 99mTc-MIBI SPECT/CT, but the fetal radiation exposure by this imaging method is unclear and may be of concern. The generally high radiation of 4D-computed tomography argues against this method in pregnancy. Therefore, we personally consider it reasonable to perform an ultrasonography of the neck in combination with either 99mTc-MIBI scan or 4D-dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI as a suggested preoperative imaging approach in pregnant women with an indication for parathyroid surgery. Other approaches or ultrasonography alone in case of a clear ultrasonographic imaging result, may of course be acceptable choices for selected cases and special centers. It has to be stressed that any imaging method with radiation exposure should only be performed if considered to have a favorable benefit to risk ratio for the individual pregnant woman and her child.

The ideal surgical approach for sporadic PHPT in pregnancy is minimally invasive parathyroidectomy, at best performed with intraoperative PTH measurements, if available. Bilateral neck exploration may be performed for other specific forms of PHPT, such as hereditary forms.

Importance

Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is a common clinical entity, with approximately 100 000 new cases diagnosed each year in the United States. Most patients with pHPT have a relatively mild form of the disease and present with few if any overt signs or symptoms. This has led to a dilemma regarding which patients should be considered for parathyroid surgery. In this article, we review the established literature on the indications for surgery in asymptomatic pHPT and discuss the most recent consensus conference guidelines.

Observations

The reviewed literature suggests that there were improved outcomes among patients with asymptomatic pHPT who underwent curative surgery.

Conclusions and Relevance

Most patients with pHPT should be considered for parathyroidectomy. More randomized clinical trials are needed to strongly support a surgical recommendation for all asymptomatic patients with pHPT.

### What medical options should be considered for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism? [^115Ndujv]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common, often asymptomatic, endocrine disorder characterized by hypercalcaemia in the face of a nonsuppressed parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. For those with symptomatic disease or who meet surgical criteria, parathyroidectomy is the treatment of choice. However, those patients who do not meet surgical criteria or who cannot undergo or refuse surgery must be managed medically. Medical management of PHPT involves continual assessment to determine who will benefit from surgical intervention, replacement of vitamin D, treatment of parathyroid bone disease and management of hypercalcaemia and renal stone disease.

### Imaging techniques in parathyroid surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism [^117SAzJp]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2011). Low credibility.

As more patients present with the incidental diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism due to biochemical screening, treatment guidelines have been developed for the treatment of hyperparathyroidism. Management of primary hyperparathyroidism has evolved in recent years, with considerable interest in minimally invasive approaches. Successful localization of the diseased gland(s) by nuclear imaging and anatomical studies, along with rapid intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay, has allowed for focused and minimally invasive surgical approaches. Patients in whom the localization studies have identified single-gland adenoma or unilateral disease are candidates for such focused approaches instead of the traditional approach of bilateral exploration. These imaging techniques have also been critical in the successful management of patients with persistent or recurrent disease.

### Management of primary hyperparathyroidism: historical and contemporary perspectives [^1117XBS1]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a frequently diagnosed endocrine condition most commonly caused by a single parathyroid adenoma. Our understanding of the epidemiology and management of PHPT have evolved in the past few decades. Asymptomatic PHPT has been the most common presentation in developed countries since the advent of routine biochemical screening. Symptomatic disease is now also decreasing in developing nations. Normocalcemic PHPT is a newer phenotype that can be diagnosed in the setting of elevated PTH concentrations with persistently normal serum calcium, however, evaluation for secondary causes of hyperparathyroidism is critical as it is a diagnosis of exclusion. Genetic testing can be helpful in patients younger than 30 years of age and/or patients with intermediate or equivocal ranges of the urinary calcium to creatinine ratio (between 0.01 and 0.02) to differentiate PHPT from FHH and to evaluate for other genetic etiologies that may affect management. Surgery is the recommended treatment modality for symptomatic PHPT, and patients with asymptomatic PHPT meeting recommended criteria should also be considered for parathyroidectomy. "Asymptomatic" patients should be screened for the presence of nephrolithiasis and/or vertebral fracture, since many will be reclassified as having symptomatic disease with further investigation. For poor surgical candidates or patients not meeting criteria for surgery, medical therapy includes cinacalcet for hypercalcemia and antiresorptive therapies for osteoporosis.

Does surgical referral differ for nPHPT patients?

A key question remains as to whether nPHPT should be considered a different entity to hPHPT, or if they can be managed using a single approach. Whilst studies have reported that nPHPT presents differently to hPHPT, such as with a higher incidence of multi-glandular disease,– studies have also shown that a proportion of normocalcaemic patients will progress to hypercalcaemia. In line with this, a standardised approach to managing PHPT irrespective of serum calcium appears appropriate and the aforementioned NICE guidance for PHPT surgical referral remains applicable for nPHPT. However, it is important that discussions regarding surgery are individualised and patient expectations are comprehensively explored. This involves counselling the patient to ensure adequate understanding of both the positive (a reduction in end-organ effects) and adverse (risk of surgical complications) outcomes that may occur following surgery.

For clinicians, it is also important to avoid routinely screening PTH levels unless there is evidence to suggest measurement would be appropriate. This includes evidence of calcium homeostasis disturbance, renal dysfunction and occasionally if there is vitamin D deficiency.

Limitations of the current literature

Many of the studies investigating the role of surgery in the treatment of nPHPT consist of a relatively small cohort of patients. This is compounded by comparative studies in the field generally having a significantly larger number of hPHPT patients relative to nPHPT patients. Future studies should aim to analyse larger nPHPT cohorts, with comparative studies providing equal representation to nPHPT and hPHPT patients. Moreover, there is a need for large consortia based prospective registries of those managed both surgically and medically, with an extended follow up period of more than 10 years. This would enable the true natural history and adverse events of treatment to be observed, providing much needed clarity to clinicians.
