## Question

What are the inclusion criteria for peritoneal dialysis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the inclusion criteria for peritoneal dialysis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle that most patients with kidney failure are medically suitable for PD and that modality choice should be patient-centered. Then, I should verify absolute contraindications that would exclude PD. Next, I will examine relative contraindications and how they can be mitigated. After that, I need to consider special populations and scenarios like urgent-start PD, pediatrics, and ADPKD. Finally, I will integrate psychosocial and logistical factors and synthesize a practical decision framework with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: the vast majority of patients with end-stage kidney disease are medically suitable for PD if they choose it, and modality selection should be driven by shared decision-making that incorporates patient preferences, lifestyle, and goals of care, rather than rigid exclusion criteria alone [^b8f4f042] [^c81f30cf] [^5365f90c].

> Wait, let me verify the absolute contraindications that would truly exclude PD. The strongest evidence-based exclusions include active intra-abdominal infection, uncorrectable mechanical defects of the abdominal wall such as a loss of domain hernia, dense adhesions that obliterate peritoneal volume and are not amenable to lysis, severe protein-calorie malnutrition with proteinuria greater than 10 g/day, and documented ultrafiltration failure of the peritoneal membrane. These are consistently cited across high-quality guidelines and reviews and should be treated as true exclusions in most cases [^3f91397e] [^190e6002] [^a209d497].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about relative contraindications. I need to check which conditions are manageable with planning and technique modifications. Prior abdominal surgery is not a contraindication and many patients with adhesions can still undergo PD, particularly with advanced laparoscopic techniques and adhesiolysis when appropriate. Obesity may require larger fill volumes and careful monitoring but is not an absolute barrier. Diabetes, polycystic kidney disease, and heart failure warrant individualized assessment and may still be compatible with PD. Advanced age alone should not preclude PD, though frailty and caregiver support must be addressed [^190e6002] [^a209d497] [^f33bb19f] [^4fa33668].

> I should double-check the special case of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. KDIGO advises that PD is a viable option in ADPKD, with caution only when massive kidney or liver enlargement or other standard contraindications are present, reinforcing that ADPKD is not a blanket exclusion and that shared decision-making is essential [^4fa33668] [^a8478b01].

> Next, I should review urgent-start PD, because this is where inclusion criteria and risk-benefit framing differ. Urgent-start PD, initiated within two weeks of catheter placement, is increasingly used to avoid temporary hemodialysis via central venous catheter. It may increase dialysate leak but can reduce bacteremia compared with CVC-based HD, and technique survival appears comparable in observational data, so suitability depends on patient selection, catheter insertion method, and close follow-up for leaks and infections [^179e2232] [^2f99c166] [^2604bb72].

> Let me consider pediatric patients carefully. PD is often the preferred initial modality for children, including infants, because it facilitates home care, school attendance, and family routines. Urgent-start PD is feasible in select pediatric cases, and advanced laparoscopic techniques may be favored when anatomy or adhesions are a concern, though evidence quality is limited and decisions should be individualized within a multidisciplinary pediatric framework [^5365d11b] [^26f986b0] [^5ab22b59].

> I need to ensure I incorporate psychosocial and logistical inclusion factors, not just medical ones. The ability to perform exchanges independently or with assistance, a suitable home environment, reliable supplies, and access to training and support are critical. Assisted PD programs can expand eligibility for those with physical or cognitive limitations, and predialysis education markedly increases PD uptake, underscoring that these are integral, not peripheral, inclusion considerations [^67d29c20] [^acf06a4a] [^16b120a3].

> But wait, what if the patient is anuric or has very low residual kidney function? Does that preclude PD? I should confirm that anuria is not an absolute contraindication. PD can still be feasible in anuric patients depending on body size and peritoneal transport characteristics, though prescriptions often need intensification and close monitoring of volume status and adequacy, so this becomes a relative limitation rather than an exclusion [^95b55619] [^9eb73ad1].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. Inclusion for PD should start with the assumption of medical suitability unless an absolute contraindication is present. Then screen for relative issues that are modifiable with planning, assess psychosocial readiness and support systems, and align the choice with patient preferences and goals. For urgent starts, weigh the benefits of avoiding CVC-related complications against the higher risk of dialysate leak and ensure rapid training and surveillance. Throughout, use shared decision-making and document the rationale for any exclusions or deferrals [^b8f4f042] [^c81f30cf] [^2604bb72].

> In summary, I should confirm that the inclusion criteria for PD are best framed as absence of absolute contraindications plus the presence of a viable plan for training, support, and patient-preferred home therapy, rather than a rigid checklist. This patient-centered, risk-mitigated approach is consistent with contemporary guidelines and maximizes equitable access to PD while maintaining safety and outcomes [^3f91397e] [^b8f4f042] [^5365f90c].

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is appropriate for most patients with end-stage kidney disease, but **absolute contraindications** include active intra-abdominal infection, uncorrectable abdominal wall defects, loss of peritoneal function, and severe malnutrition. Relative contraindications — such as extensive prior abdominal surgery, obesity, or polycystic kidney disease — can often be managed with careful planning. Patient selection should be **individualized**, incorporating medical, psychosocial, and lifestyle factors, and supported by shared decision-making to optimize outcomes and technique survival [^c81f30cf] [^5365f90c].

---

## Absolute contraindications

Absolute contraindications are conditions that **preclude PD** because of unacceptable risks or inability to deliver effective therapy:

- **Active intra-abdominal infection**: Ongoing peritonitis or intra-abdominal abscess is a strict contraindication until fully resolved [^190e6002].

- **Uncorrectable abdominal wall defects**: Loss of domain hernia or other uncorrectable defects that compromise dialysate containment or increase hernia risk [^190e6002].

- **Loss of peritoneal function**: Dense adhesions or peritoneal fibrosis that obliterate effective peritoneal surface area or prevent dialysate distribution [^190e6002].

- **Severe malnutrition**: Protein-energy wasting with severe hypoalbuminemia or proteinuria > 10 g/day, which worsens with PD protein losses [^3f91397e].

---

## Relative contraindications

Relative contraindications are conditions that **require careful assessment and may be manageable** with planning, modified technique, or close monitoring:

- **Extensive prior abdominal surgery**: Multiple or complex surgeries increase adhesion risk; advanced laparoscopic techniques can facilitate catheter placement and adhesiolysis [^190e6002].

- **Obesity**: BMI > 35 kg/m² may limit fill volumes and increase hernia risk; APD with smaller, more frequent exchanges and hernia prophylaxis can mitigate issues [^notfound].

- **Polycystic kidney disease**: Massive kidney/liver enlargement can limit intraperitoneal space; PD is feasible if space allows and hernia risk is addressed [^4fa33668].

- **Severe respiratory compromise**: Large fill volumes may impair diaphragmatic excursion; low-volume, frequent exchanges or APD can help [^notfound].

- **Cognitive impairment or lack of caregiver support**: Home PD requires reliable technique; assisted PD programs can enable participation [^67d29c20].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing suitability

Beyond medical contraindications, **patient-specific factors** significantly influence PD suitability:

| **Factor** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|
| Age | No absolute limit; older adults benefit from home therapy, but frailty and comorbidity must be assessed [^f33bb19f] |
| Comorbidities | Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity require individualized planning and monitoring [^f33bb19f] |
| Lifestyle and preferences | Home-based therapy suits patients valuing autonomy, travel, or flexible schedules [^81b04224] |
| Psychosocial support | Adequate support is essential for training, adherence, and emergency management [^67d29c20] |
| Residual renal function | PD preserves residual function better than HD, benefiting patients with significant urine output [^623eca3b] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Urgent-start PD**: Can be initiated within 2 weeks of catheter placement to avoid temporary HD; higher leak risk but comparable infection and technique survival with appropriate precautions [^179e2232] [^2604bb72].

- **Pediatric patients**: PD is often preferred for infants and children due to growth preservation, school attendance, and family-centered care [^5365d11b].

- **Assisted PD**: Enables patients with physical or cognitive limitations to receive home PD with trained helpers [^67d29c20].

---

## Role of shared decision-making

Shared decision-making is essential to align modality choice with patient values, preferences, and goals. Education on PD benefits (autonomy, home therapy, residual function preservation) and risks (peritonitis, hernia, technique failure) enables informed choice and improves adherence and outcomes [^c81f30cf] [^acf06a4a].

---

## Summary of inclusion criteria

In summary, **PD is appropriate** for patients who:

- Have no absolute contraindications (active intra-abdominal infection, uncorrectable abdominal wall defect, loss of peritoneal function, severe malnutrition) [^3f91397e].

- Have manageable relative contraindications with planning and monitoring (prior abdominal surgery, obesity, polycystic kidney disease, respiratory compromise, cognitive impairment) [^190e6002].

- Possess adequate psychosocial support and willingness to perform home therapy [^67d29c20].

- Engage in shared decision-making to align modality with preferences and goals [^c81f30cf].

Peritoneal dialysis is a viable, patient-centered modality for most patients with end-stage kidney disease when contraindications are assessed and managed proactively, and when care is individualized to patient needs and preferences [^b8f4f042].

### Factors related to patient selection and initiation of peritoneal dialysis [^3ee5a554]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2017). Low credibility.

The majority of dialysis patients initiate dialysis using hemodialysis, rather than peritoneal dialysis (PD), although they may be candidates for either modality. Multiple factors account for this selection, including pre-dialysis education, physician familiarity with hemodialysis versus PD, and patient-related factors. This paper will discuss the various considerations by both providers and patients in the selection of PD as a modality.

### Peritoneal dialysis versus haemodialysis for people commencing dialysis [^715e3416]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) and haemodialysis (HD) are two possible modalities for people with kidney failure commencing dialysis. Only a few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated PD versus HD. The benefits and harms of the two modalities remain uncertain. This review includes both RCTs and non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSIs).

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of PD, compared to HD, in people with kidney failure initiating dialysis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies from 2000 to June 2024 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register were identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for NRSIs from 2000 until 28 March 2023.

Selection Criteria

RCTs and NRSIs evaluating PD compared to HD in people initiating dialysis were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two investigators independently assessed if the studies were eligible and then extracted data. Risk of bias was assessed using standard Cochrane methods, and relevant outcomes were extracted for each report. The primary outcome was residual kidney function (RKF). Secondary outcomes included all-cause, cardiovascular and infection-related death, infection, cardiovascular disease, hospitalisation, technique survival, life participation and fatigue.

Main Results

A total of 153 reports of 84 studies (2 RCTs, 82 NRSIs) were included. Studies varied widely in design (small single-centre studies to international registry analyses) and in the included populations (broad inclusion criteria versus restricted to more specific participants). Additionally, treatment delivery (e.g. automated versus continuous ambulatory PD, HD with catheter versus arteriovenous fistula or graft, in-centre versus home HD) and duration of follow-up varied widely. The two included RCTs were deemed to be at high risk of bias in terms of blinding participants and personnel and blinding outcome assessment for outcomes pertaining to quality of life. However, most other criteria were assessed as low risk of bias for both studies. Although the risk of bias (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) was generally low for most NRSIs, studies were at risk of selection bias and residual confounding due to the constraints of the observational study design. In children, there may be little or no difference between HD and PD on all-cause death (6 studies, 5752 participants: RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.07; I² = 28%; low certainty) and cardiovascular death (3 studies, 7073 participants: RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.59; I² = 29%; low certainty), and was unclear for infection-related death (4 studies, 7451 participants: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.46; I² = 56%; very low certainty). In adults, compared with HD, PD had an uncertain effect on RKF (mL/min/1.73 m²) at six months (2 studies, 146 participants: MD 0.90, 95% CI 0.23 to 3.60; I² = 82%; very low certainty), 12 months (3 studies, 606 participants: MD 1.21, 95% CI -0.01 to 2.43; I² = 81%; very low certainty) and 24 months (3 studies, 334 participants: MD 0.71, 95% CI -0.02 to 1.48; I² = 72%; very low certainty). PD had uncertain effects on residual urine volume at 12 months (3 studies, 253 participants: MD 344.10 mL/day, 95% CI 168.70 to 519.49; I² = 69%; very low certainty). PD may reduce the risk of RKF loss (3 studies, 2834 participants: RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.68; I² = 17%; low certainty). Compared with HD, PD had uncertain effects on all-cause death (42 studies, 700,093 participants: RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.98; I² = 99%; very low certainty). In an analysis restricted to RCTs, PD may reduce the risk of all-cause death (2 studies, 1120 participants: RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.86; I² = 0%; moderate certainty). PD had uncertain effects on both cardiovascular (21 studies, 68,492 participants: RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.19; I² = 92%) and infection-related death (17 studies, 116,333 participants: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.42; I² = 98%) (both very low certainty). Compared with HD, PD had uncertain effects on the number of patients experiencing bacteraemia/bloodstream infection (2 studies, 2582 participants: RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.18; I² = 68%) and the number of patients experiencing infection episodes (3 studies, 277 participants: RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.62; I² = 20%) (both very low certainty). PD may reduce the number of bacteraemia/bloodstream infection episodes (2 studies, 2637 participants: RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.71; I² = 24%; low certainty). Compared with HD; It is uncertain whether PD reduces the risk of acute myocardial infarction (4 studies, 110,850 participants: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.10; I² = 55%), coronary artery disease (3 studies, 5826 participants: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.97; I² = 62%); ischaemic heart disease (2 studies, 58,374 participants: RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.28; I² = 95%), congestive heart failure (3 studies, 49,511 participants: RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.21; I² = 89%) and stroke (4 studies, 102,542 participants: RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.99; I² = 0%) because of low to very low certainty evidence. Compared with HD, PD had uncertain effects on the number of patients experiencing hospitalisation (4 studies, 3282 participants: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.30; I² = 97%) and all-cause hospitalisation events (4 studies, 42,582 participants: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.29; I² = 91%) (very low certainty). None of the included studies reported specifically on life participation or fatigue. However, two studies evaluated employment. Compared with HD, PD had uncertain effects on employment at one year (2 studies, 593 participants: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.20 to 3.43; I² = 97%; very low certainty).

Authors' Conclusions

The comparative effectiveness of PD and HD on the preservation of RKF, all-cause and cause-specific death risk, the incidence of bacteraemia, other vascular complications (e.g. stroke, cardiovascular events) and patient-reported outcomes (e.g. life participation and fatigue) are uncertain, based on data obtained mostly from NRSIs, as only two RCTs were included.

### Peritoneal dialysis patient selection from a comorbidity perspective [^f33bb19f]. Seminars in Dialysis (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite many medical and socioeconomic advantages, peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an underutilized dialysis modality that in most countries is used by only 5%-20% of dialysis patients, while the vast majority are treated with in-center hemodialysis. Several factors may explain this paradox, such as lack of experience and infrastructure for training and monitoring of PD patients, organizational issues, overcapacity of hemodialysis facilities, and lack of economic incentives for dialysis centers to use PD instead of HD. In addition, medical conditions that are perceived (rightly or wrongly) as contraindications to PD represent barriers for the use of PD because of their purported potential negative impact on clinical outcomes in patients starting PD. While there are few absolute contraindications to PD, high age, comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, polycystic kidney disease, heart failure, and previous history of abdominal surgery and renal allograft failure, may be seen (rightly or wrongly) as relative contraindications and thus barriers to initiation of PD. In this brief review, we discuss how the presence of these conditions may influence the strategy of selecting patients for PD, focusing on measures that can be taken to overcome potential problems.

### Choice of dialysis modality [^f94cbcca]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Few medical decisions have as profound an impact on every aspect of a patient's life as the selection of dialysis modality by a patient with end-stage renal disease. It remains uncertain whether the outcome differences seen between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients, if any, in observational studies are attributable to the dialysis modality. Such studies, thus, are insufficient to deny patients a choice in selecting their dialysis modality.

### Determinants in APD selection [^b33bf7b1]. Seminars in Dialysis (2002). Low credibility.

Automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) is the most prevalent form of peritoneal dialysis in the United States. Optimizing the success of this treatment requires appropriate patient selection; however, there are few data available on which patients are most likely to benefit the most from this form of therapy. The key factors to evaluate when APD is being considered include patient preferences and lifestyle, patient age, solute transport characteristics, residual renal function (RRF), cost, dialysis adequacy targets, and the potential for complications of therapy. Patients who prefer home dialysis at night, children, those with high average or high peritoneal transport characteristics, and those with significant RRF are ideal candidates for APD. Because of the flexibility that is possible in prescribing this form of dialysis, APD can be successfully performed in individuals who do not meet this ideal profile, and it can be an excellent form of dialysis, particularly as part of an integrated care program for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

### SAGES peritoneal dialysis access guideline update 2023 [^050201ab]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis decision criteria and additional considerations — context and rationale: Peritoneal Dialysis offers clinical and quality of life advantages over HD and there are cost benefits to home dialysis. In 2021, CMS passed the End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Treatment Choices Model, to improve or maintain the quality of care and reduce Medicare expenditures for patients with CKD, which promotes PD and kidney transplantation for its recipients. This has prompted a movement among nephrologists in the US to increase the penetration of PD and urgent start is one way to do this. In the past, patients needing urgent dialysis were given a venous catheter for inpatient HD and then discharged on scheduled outpatient HD, and once the patient developed this routine, they rarely switched to PD. Therefore, there are several benefits to avoiding urgent HD and instituting an urgent start PD program, and these may outweigh the increased risks involved.

### Selection bias explains apparent differential mortality between dialysis modalities [^8d060c6b]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

The relative risk of death for patients treated with peritoneal dialysis compared with those treated with hemodialysis appears to change with duration of dialysis therapy. Patients who start dialysis urgently are at high risk for mortality and are treated almost exclusively with hemodialysis, introducing bias to such mortality comparisons. To better isolate the association between dialysis treatment modality and patient mortality, we examined the relative risk for mortality for peritoneal dialysis compared with hemodialysis among individuals who received ≥ 4 months of predialysis care and who started dialysis electively as outpatients. From a total of 32,285 individuals who received dialysis in Ontario, Canada during a nearly 8-year period, 6,573 patients met criteria for elective, outpatient initiation. We detected no difference in survival between peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis after adjusting for relevant baseline characteristics. The relative risk of death did not change with duration of dialysis therapy in our primary analysis, but it did change with time when we defined our patient population using the more inclusive criteria typical of previous studies. These results suggest that peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis associate with similar survival among incident dialysis patients who initiate dialysis electively, as outpatients, after at least 4 months of predialysis care. Selection bias, rather than an effect of the treatment itself, likely explains the previously described change in the relative risk of death over time between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.

### Patient education and peritoneal dialysis modality selection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^acf06a4a]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Educational interventions are increasingly used to promote peritoneal dialysis (PD), the most common form of home therapy for end-stage renal disease. A systematic review of the evidence in support of dialysis modality education is needed to inform the design of patient-targeted interventions to increase selection of PD. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to characterize the relationship between patient-targeted educational interventions and choosing and receiving PD.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Setting & Population

Published original studies and abstracts.

Selection Criteria For Studies

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and EBMR. We included controlled observational studies and randomized trials of educational interventions designed to increase PD selection.

Intervention

Predialysis educational interventions.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was choosing PD, defined as intention to use PD regardless of whether PD was ever used. The secondary outcome, receiving PD, was defined as an individual receiving PD as his or her treatment.

Results

Of 3,540 citations, 15 studies met our inclusion criteria, including 1 randomized trial. In the single randomized trial (N = 70), receipt of an educational intervention was associated with a more than 4-fold increase in the odds of choosing PD (OR, 4.60; 95% CI, 1.19–17.74). Based on results from 4 observational studies (N = 7,653), patient-targeted educational interventions were associated with a 2-fold increase in the odds of choosing PD (pooled OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.07–4.32; I(2) = 76.7%). Based on results from 9 observational studies (N = 8,229), patient-targeted educational intervention was associated with a 3-fold increase in the odds of receiving PD as the initial treatment modality (OR, 3.50; 95% CI, 2.82–4.35; I(2) = 24.9%).

Limitations

Most studies were observational studies, which can establish an association between education and choosing PD or receiving PD, but does not establish causality.

Conclusions

This systematic review demonstrates a strong association between patient-targeted education interventions and the subsequent choice and receipt of PD.

### SAGES peritoneal dialysis access guideline update 2023 [^323d3dca]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

SAGES peritoneal dialysis access guideline update 2023 — evidence synthesis methods used a standard systematic review with two independent reviewers (± third party arbitration), a librarian search of PubMed, the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Embase from 2012 to April 2020 with pediatric criteria expanded to 2005, and an updated search in September 2021; both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies addressing the KQs of interest were eligible for inclusion. Study risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for RCTs and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale for non-RCTs. Meta-analysis was conducted in Revman using the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model, and heterogeneity was quantified by the I2 statistic and tested with the Chi2 test. For each outcome, certainty of evidence was graded as per the GRADE approach and summarized in Evidence Tables in the online GradePro tool. Recommendation development took an individual patient perspective using patient-based values, utilized the GRADE EtD framework in the GRADEPro tool to judge the magnitude of desirable and undesirable effects across important and critical outcomes, and specified that the balance of effects, overall certainty across critical outcomes, and acceptability and feasibility determine the recommendation and its strength.

### Perceptions about the dialysis modality decision process among peritoneal dialysis and in-center hemodialysis patients [^d54ce2bd]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Over 120,000 patients reaching end-stage renal disease (ESRD) every year in the United States (US) are faced with a complex and difficult decision regarding renal replacement therapy (RRT) modality options. Although kidney transplant results in the best clinical outcomes, 97% of ESRD patients will require dialysis, most frequently peritoneal dialysis (PD) or in-center hemodialysis (HD). Although clinical contraindications restrict modality choice in occasional cases, most patients are candidates for both PD and HD. Either dialysis modality may be a better fit for a specific patient based on dialysis treatment characteristics and their impact on daily life. Thus, the choice between modalities should center on patient preferences, and it is critical that patients are included and engaged in the dialysis modality decision. This is supported by increasing evidence that aligning treatment with patient preferences may improve adherence to therapy, quality of life, and ultimately better medical outcomes.

### Dialysis access: issues related to conversion from peritoneal dialysis to hemodialysis and vice versa [^cc20c681]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2017). Low credibility.

ABSTRACTHemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) represent two complementary modalities of renal replacement therapy (RRT) for end-stage renal disease patients. Conversion between the two modalities is frequent and more likely to happen from PD to HD. Every year, 10% of PD patients convert to HD, suggesting the need for recommendations on how to proceed with the creation of a vascular access in these patients. Criteria for selecting patients who would likely fail PD, and therefore take advantage of a backup access, are undefined. Creating backup fistulas at the time of PD treatment start to allow emergency access for HD has proved to be inefficient, but it may be considered in patients with progressive difficulty in achieving adequate depuration and/or peritoneal ultrafiltration. A big challenge is represented by patients switching from PD to HD for unexpected infectious complications. Those patients need to start HD with a central venous catheter (CVC), but an alternative approach might be using an early cannulation graft, provided that infection has been cleared by the circulation. An early cannulation graft might also be used to considerably shorten the time spent using a CVC. In patients who need a conversion from HD to PD, urgent-start PD is now an accepted and well-established approach.

### Outcomes of incident patients treated with incremental haemodialysis as compared with standard haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis [^df411a9b]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What is already known about this subject?

Residual kidney function has been associated with improved survival in dialysis patients and is considered better preserved with twice-weekly incremental haemodialysis (I-HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) as compared with conventional thrice-weekly HD (TW-HD).
Despite current guidelines supporting an incremental approach to HD initiation, the vast majority of patients requiring kidney replacement therapy (KRT) still begin on conventional TW-HD in resource-rich countries.

What this study adds?

In selected patients initiating dialysis, I-HD is a suitable KRT modality that can be maintained for a significant amount of time before transitioning to a conventional TW-HD regimen.
In the appropriate clinical setting, I-HD initiation is associated with improved survival as compared with TW-HD or PD.

What impact this may have on practice or policy?

An I-HD regimen can be safely implemented in patients initiating dialysis when carefully selected.
These results reinforce current guidelines and call for long-awaited randomized controlled trials prior to large-scale implementation of I-HD programmes.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on peritoneal dialysis in adults and children [^42e3dd4a]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

These guidelines cover the organisation and performance of peritoneal dialysis as a treatment for kidney patients, including infants and children. It includes prevention and treatment of complications. It does not include factors involved in the choice of peritoneal dialysis compared to other options for patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease. This document is intended for use by any member of the health care team engaged in the care of kidney patients treated with peritoneal dialysis.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is long established as a major option for renal replacement therapy in patients with end-stage renal disease. It is an important part of an integrated service for renal replacement therapy that is frequently selected by patients as their preferred initial mode of therapy and is a therapeutic option for patients wishing or needing to swap from HD and after renal transplant failure. PD is the best option for infants and small children. NICE Clinical Guideline 125 (2011) recommends PD as the initial dialysis treatment of choice of chronic kidney disease stage 5 for children aged 2 years or older, people with residual renal function and adults without significant associated comorbidities.

For the first time, this Renal Association guideline includes recommendations relating to PD in children. Recommendations in this guideline will refer to both adult and paediatric patients, except where the recommendation specifies one of these patient groups or provides alternative recommendations to them.

This guideline is an update of the PD module published on-line on the Renal Association website, in 2010. The English language literature was searched in December 2016 to identify relevant articles on PD published between 2008 and 2016 including:
Medline search using 'peritoneal dialysis' combined with relevant terms from each of the sections - Equipment & Resources, Training & Catheter Insertion, Dialysis Clearance, Ultrafiltration & Overhydration, Infections, Peritonitis, Exit Site Infections, Renal Osteodystrophy & Diabetes Mellitus, Encapsulating Peritoneal Sclerosis, Assisted Peritoneal Dialysis, Icodextrin, Peritoneal Membrane, Urgent Start and Biocompatible Solutions
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
Review of other national/international PD clinical guidelines
Identification of further articles quoted in identified papers
Review of Peritoneal Dialysis International's table of contents for articles relating to the content of the guidelines
Searches within the major renal journals (Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation, Kidney International, American Journal of Kidney Diseases) for articles with 'peritoneal dialysis' in the title/abstract

The recommendations in this guideline have been harmonised with other PD guidelines whenever possible and the recommendations to follow international PD or other Renal Association guidelines have not been graded.

### Peritoneal dialysis for acute kidney injury [^9dcf689a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been suggested as an effective and safe dialysis modality in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). However, whether PD is superior to extracorporeal therapy (e.g. haemodialysis) in terms of improving survival, recovery of kidney function, metabolic and clinical outcomes is still inconclusive.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to evaluate the benefits and harms of PD for patients with AKI compared with extracorporeal therapy or different PD modalities.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies to 29 May 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched the China Biological Medicine Database.

Selection Criteria

We included patients with AKI who were randomised to receive PD, extracorporeal therapy, or different PD modalities regardless of their age, sex, primary disease and clinical course.

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening, selection, data extraction and quality assessments for each retrieved article were carried out by two authors using standardised forms. Authors contacted when published data were incomplete. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity among studies was explored using the Cochran Q statistic and the I 2 test. Outcomes of interest included all-cause mortality, recovery of kidney function, weekly delivered Kt/V, correction of acidosis, fluid removal, duration of dialysis, and infectious complications. Confidence in the evidence was assessing using GRADE.

Main Results

Six studies (484 participants) met our inclusion criteria. Five studies compared high volume PD with daily haemodialysis, extended daily haemodialysis, or continuous renal replacement therapy. One study focused on the intensity of PD. The overall risk of bias was low to unclear. Compared to extracorporeal therapy, PD probably made little or no difference to all-cause mortality (4 studies, 383 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.55; I² = 69%; moderate certainty evidence), or kidney function recovery (3 studies, 333 participants: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.35; I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence). PD probably slightly reduces the amount of fluid removal compared to extracorporeal therapy (3 studies, 313 participants: MD -0.59 L/d, 95% CI -1.19 to 0.01; I² = 89%; low certainty evidence), and probably made little or no difference to infectious complications (2 studies, 263 participants: RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.78; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether PD compared to extracorporeal therapy has any effects on weekly delivered Kt/V (2 studies, 263 participants: MD -2.47, 95% CI -5.17 to 0.22; I² = 99%; very low certainty evidence), correction of acidosis (2 studies, 89 participants: RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.13 to 13.60; I² = 96%; very low certainty evidence), or duration of dialysis (2 studies, 170 participants: MD -1.01 hours, 95% CI -91.49 to 89.47; I² = 98%; very low certainty evidence). Heterogeneity was high and this may be due to the different extracorporeal therapies used. One study (61 participants) reported little or no difference to all-cause mortality, kidney function recovery, or infection between low and high and intensity PD. Weekly delivered Kt/V and fluid removal was lower with low compared to high intensity PD.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on moderate (mortality, recovery of kidney function), low (infectious complications), or very low certainty evidence (correction of acidosis) there is probably little or no difference between PD and extracorporeal therapy for treating AKI. Fluid removal (low certainty) and weekly delivered Kt/V (very low certainty) may be higher with extracorporeal therapy.

### Survival of patients who opt for dialysis versus conservative care: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^43e2c11c]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Study selection

All records were screened by title and abstract by a minimum of two authors independently (W.V. I.W. C.V. and M.O.). Consecutively, full-text articles were screened for eligibility by the same authors using predefined eligibility criteria (Supplementary data, Table S1).

All studies that reported and compared survival outcomes of patients choosing either dialysis or CC were considered for inclusion. Ideally, included studies should use a randomized controlled design and assess survival from the moment the decision for either CC or dialysis is made using an intention-to-treat approach, with an average equal kidney function between both groups, to rule out selection bias (Figure 1A). In such an ideal trial, as opposed to observational studies, confounding factors such as age, comorbidities, frailty, functional status and cognitive status are expected to be equal in both groups due to randomization. In observational studies, confounding by indication affects this ideal comparison. In our review, at a minimum, both treatment strategies should be presented as reasonable options and an explicit choice for either dialysis or CC had to be made. CC had to be applied as non-dialytic care for kidney failure, intended to be provided until death and not just to delay the start of dialysis. We defined the dialysis pathway as a choice for haemodialysis (HD) and/or peritoneal dialysis (PD), both including patients who would eventually start dialysis or were yet to start. For patient selection within the studies, where reported data allowed us to do so, we excluded patients with short-term dialysis for acute kidney injury or where the decision to withhold dialysis was the nephrologist's decision based on medical grounds only. Articles were excluded if they were non-English language or when the study solely reported on patients approaching kidney failure who had not yet decided on a preferred treatment yet. In the case of disagreements, we strove for consensus with a third reviewer (W.B.). If necessary, authors of original studies were approached for additional information. In the case of overlapping study populations, we aimed at including the study with the longest follow-up and most patients.

### Comparison of outcomes of incremental vs. standard peritoneal dialysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^42d5a2c2]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Search protocol

The present study was reported by the guidelines of PRISMA and registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023458440). All studies published on PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to 5th September 2023. Only English-language studies were eligible. It was conducted by an experienced medical librarian along with one study reviewer. The search strategy included MeSH/Emtree terms and free keywords namely: "low dose", "incremental", "peritoneal dialysis", "incremental dialysis", "survival" " and "mortality". Details can be found in Supplementary Table 1. All search results were downloaded into EndNote X8 (Thompson ISI Research soft, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), a reference manager software. Duplicate articles were identified and excluded. All remaining unique citations underwent screening by two reviewers. Full texts of articles found important were downloaded and further screened based on inclusion criteria.

Inclusion criteria

Both reviewers independently checked the eligibility of studies based on the following criteria:

Any study design conducted on patients undergoing PD without any age restriction.
Comparing outcomes of IPD with SPD. We did not predefine IPD and accepted the criteria mentioned in the included studies.
Outcomes included all-cause mortality, peritonitis, technique survival, anuria-free survival, and RRF.

Studies comparing IPD with HD, not reporting any outcomes, on urgent-start PD, and single-arm studies were excluded.

All studies underwent final screening based on these criteria. The reviewers resolved any disagreements (if any) involving the study selection by discussion. In the end, one reviewer undertook a hand search of the reference list of included studies for any possible inclusions. In two studies were found to use the same database and had same or overlapping study duration, the study reporting the maximum outcomes was to be included.

Data extraction

A pre-defined data collection form was used by the reviewers to collect data. It included the author and publication information, location, IPD and SPD definition, duration of IPD, follow-up, sample size, age, gender details, diabetics, creatinine, baseline renal function, haemoglobin, albumin, baseline 24-hour urine output, and drug use. The second reviewer then cross-checked the data for correctness. All endpoint data based on the inclusion criteria was extracted. We did not predefine any endpoints and all definitions reported by the included studies were acceptable.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2020 ISPD practice recommendations for prescribing high-quality goal-directed peritoneal dialysis [^5365d11b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis care in children — principles, initiation, decision-making, access, and volume assessment are summarized as follows: "The principles of prescribing and assessing delivery of high-quality PD to children are the same as for adults" and "in all cases, the PD prescription should be designed to meet the medical, mental health social and financial needs of the individual child and family". For initiation timing, the guideline "suggests that dialysis be initiated when estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decreases to < 10 mL/min/1.73 m²", yet the KDOQI work group "does not support a universally applicable eGFR threshold below which dialysis should be initiated in the absence of clinical or biochemical manifestations of uremia", while noting "use of an eGFR threshold may be justified in selected subpopulations of children". Modality selection emphasizes engagement: "The ungraded recommendation provides guidance for dialysis modality selection in children and includes that the child and their parents/caregivers be engaged in the decision", and "the burden of performing home PD for both the child and their caregiver should be considered and that the child and parents'/caregivers' choice be respected". Access and delivery constraints include that "most dialysis facilities for children are located only in large medical centers, making in-center HD less accessible to children", whereas "the use of PD in children is also bolstered by the concept that home dialysis may limit barriers to school attendance and participation in life activities". For volume assessment, "Clinical assessment, including monitoring body weight, remains the mainstay of assessment of volume status in children", and clinicians should "use clinical judgment to determine whether an increase in weight and/or BP is a manifestation of fluid overload".

### Factors influencing dialysis withdrawal: a scoping review [^634dac72]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Selection of studies based on pre-defined selection criteria

To be included in this review, a study had to meet all of the following criteria
Examined dialysis attrition, withdrawal, discontinuation, stopping, withholding, cessation or refusal and associated factors such as age, gender, patient characteristics, diseases and comorbidities, dialysis indicators and blood and serum markers.
Included patients with any modality of renal dialysis such as home, facility, hemodialysis, or peritoneal dialysis.
Written in English.
Published from 1st January 1997 to 31st December 2016.

The exclusion criteria consisted of two parameters:
Studies only included renal-transplant patients.
Case series or case reports.

The research strategy, selection criteria, and assessment of the studies were discussed with experts in the field. The titles and abstracts of the relevant articles identified by the systematic search strategies were used to categorize the articles as "included", "excluded", or "unsure" by each researcher independently based on the selection criteria. The full text of the "uncertain articles" were read to determine whether they should be included in the current review based on the selection criteria. Any disagreement in study selection between the researchers were resolved through discussion. The findings were recorded from the full text of the articles. Of the articles identified by the search strategy, only 15 met the selection criteria as described in Fig. 1.

Data charting

A chart approach, based on a descriptive-analytical method, was used to synthesize and interpret the quantitative and qualitative data collected from the selected studies. Following this approach, the authors' names, year of publication, study setting, objectives of the study, study design, methods, and study results were recorded if available within a study. In order to extract the study results from the reviewed studies, the result sections from each of the full text articles were carefully read to identify statements pertaining to the predictors and variables related to dialysis withdrawal. References to the results of other studies in the discussion sections of the reviewed articles were excluded. These statements, along with information related to the above variables, were entered on a separate form for each study. The summaries of the reviewed articles are provided in Table 1.

### Comparison of outcomes of incremental vs. standard peritoneal dialysis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1b86200b]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

There are other limitations to the review as well. The overall number of studies was not very high. Too many methodological differences, especially regarding IPD definition, study type, study population, exclusion criteria, follow-up period, etc. prevented a comprehensive quantitative analysis. The endpoints reported by the studies were also not numerically amenable to quantitative synthesis due to variability in reporting. Most of the data was observational and from medical records, therefore prone to bias. The method of selection of IPD patients was also not mentioned in studies. We were unable to differentiate the outcomes of CAPD and APD due to a lack of sufficient data from the studies. Also, it was unclear what were the outcomes in PD patients who subsequently underwent hemodialysis or kidney transplantation, as separate data for such patients was not reported. Lastly, important outcomes like cardiovascular diseases and pulmonary infections could not be assessed due to lack of data from the included studies.

Nevertheless, this systematic review presents a comprehensive qualitative analysis of outcomes with IPD and SPD. It sheds light on the limitations of current literature while also presenting important evidence for physicians who can make informed decisions. We believe the current review will encourage further research on the efficacy and safety of IPD vs. SPD in a more rigorous study design. Future studies should include comparable equivalent groups of patients for whom the observations should start at the beginning of PD. Such studies should report all the outcomes included in this review after sufficiently long follow-up to provide robust evidence.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2020 ISPD practice recommendations for prescribing high-quality goal-directed peritoneal dialysis [^5365f90c]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The recently published 2020 International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) practice recommendations regarding prescription of high-quality goal-directed peritoneal dialysis differ fundamentally from previous guidelines that focused on "adequacy" of dialysis. The new ISPD publication emphasizes the need for a person-centered approach with shared decision making between the individual performing peritoneal dialysis and the clinical care team while taking a broader view of the various issues faced by that individual. Cognizant of the lack of strong evidence for the recommendations made, they are labeled as "practice points" rather than being graded numerically. This commentary presents the views of a work group convened by the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) to assess these recommendations and assist clinical providers in the United States in interpreting and implementing them. This will require changes to the current clinical paradigm, including greater resource allocation to allow for enhanced services that provide a more holistic and person-centered assessment of the quality of dialysis delivered.

### Dialysis modality and survival: done to death [^90a73620]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

The debate surrounding whether peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis is associated with differential survival continues as the numerous comparative studies over the past 3 decades have yielded conflicting results. Findings have also evolved over time in the setting of changing patient characteristics, advances in dialytic technologies, and the use of more robust statistical and epidemiologic approaches. Here, we will critically review the body of evidence, both historical and contemporary, comparing survival across dialysis modalities. Significant limitations of the observational nature of the current literature will be highlighted given that no adequately powered randomized controlled trials exist. Given the lack of consistency and limitations of current studies, coupled with the poor survival across both modalities, we can likely conclude that survival comparisons between both modalities do not appreciably differ. Hence, the choice of dialysis modality should not be dictated by survival comparisons, but rather be based on an individualized and informed decision making that places patient preference and lifestyle considerations at the forefront, while integrating medical factors and availability of resources and support. The emphasis of future research should move beyond survival outcomes when comparing dialysis modalities, and instead be redirected to patient-endorsed and patient-reported outcomes.

Palliative peritoneal dialysis (PD) — "For some people who require dialysis and who are old, frail or have a poor prognosis, there may be a quality of life benefit from a reduced dialysis prescription to minimize the burden of treatment". The commentary emphasizes that "Individualizing PD therapy to maximize benefit and minimize burden is key in developing a high-quality goal-directed PD treatment plan", noting many goals "were developed without the frailest, most ill, and most elderly in mind", and that these individuals may have "limited life spans; therefore, managing symptoms and maximizing quality of life are the paramount objectives". The approach "begins with screening to identify people who would most benefit from this approach to PD prescription" followed by "a frank, detailed, and often difficult discussion" to define goals, "including whether dialysis therapies are concordant with their goals of care". Barriers include that "many nephrologists and other practitioners have limited experience and expertise in this aspect of care", and "such assessment may not be acceptable to some people with kidney failure".

### Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis versus conventional-start peritoneal dialysis for people with chronic kidney disease [^179e2232]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis (PD), defined as initiation of PD within two weeks of catheter insertion, has been emerging as an alternative mode of dialysis initiation for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) requiring urgent dialysis without established permanent dialysis access. Recently, several small studies have reported comparable patient outcomes between urgent-start and conventional-start PD.

Objectives

To examine the benefits and harms of urgent-start PD compared with conventional-start PD in adults and children with CKD requiring long-term kidney replacement therapy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 25 May 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. For non-randomised controlled trials, MEDLINE (OVID) (1946 to 27 June 2019), EMBASE (OVID) (1980 to 27 June 2019), Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov (up to 27 June 2019) were searched.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs comparing the outcomes of urgent-start PD (within 2 weeks of catheter insertion) and conventional-start PD (≥ 2 weeks of catheter insertion) treatment in children and adults CKD patients requiring long-term dialysis were included. Studies without a control group were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted and quality of studies were examined by two independent authors. The authors contacted investigators for additional information. Summary estimates of effect were examined using random-effects model and results were presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as appropriate for the data. The certainty of evidence for individual outcome was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

A total of 16 studies (2953 participants) were included in this review, which included one multicentre RCT (122 participants) and 15 non-RCTs (2831 participants): 13 cohort studies (2671 participants) and 2 case-control studies (160 participants). The review included unadjusted data for analyses due to paucity of studies reporting adjusted data. In low certainty evidence, urgent-start PD may increase dialysate leak (1 RCT, 122 participants: RR 3.90, 95% CI 1.56 to 9.78) compared with conventional-start PD which translated into an absolute number of 210 more leaks per 1000 (95% CI 40 to 635). In very low certainty evidence, it is uncertain whether urgent-start PD increases catheter blockage (4 cohort studies, 1214 participants: RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.40 to 4.43; 2 case-control studies, 160 participants: RR 1.89, 95% CI 0.58 to 6.13), catheter malposition (6 cohort studies, 1353 participants: RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.80 to 3.32; 1 case-control study, 104 participants: RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.64 to 13.96), and PD dialysate flow problems (3 cohort studies, 937 participants: RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.34 to 6.14) compared to conventional-start PD. In very low certainty evidence, it is uncertain whether urgent-start PD increases exit-site infection (2 cohort studies, 337 participants: RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.24 to 8.61; 1 case-control study, 104 participants RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.41 to 3.50), exit-site bleeding (1 RCT, 122 participants: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.03 to 16.81; 1 cohort study, 27 participants: RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.07 to 35.32), peritonitis (7 cohort studies, 1497 participants: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.46; 2 case-control studies, participants: RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.12 to 9.51), catheter readjustment (2 cohort studies, 739 participants: RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.40 to 4.02), or reduces technique survival (1 RCT, 122 participants: RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.20; 8 cohort studies, 1668 participants: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.07; 2 case-control studies, 160 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.06). In very low certainty evidence, it is uncertain whether urgent-start PD compared with conventional-start PD increased death (any cause) (1 RCT, 122 participants: RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.53; 7 cohort studies, 1509 participants: RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.3; 1 case-control study, 104 participants: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.27 to 3.02; very low certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported on tunnel tract infection.

Authors' Conclusions

In patients with CKD who require dialysis urgently without ready-to-use dialysis access in place, urgent-start PD may increase the risk of dialysate leak and has uncertain effects on catheter blockage, malposition or readjustment, PD dialysate flow problems, infectious complications, exit-site bleeding, technique survival, and patient survival compared with conventional-start PD.

### Comparison of patient survival between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis among patients eligible for both Modalities [^8426fa01]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Although peritoneal dialysis (PD) costs less to the health care system compared to in-center hemodialysis (HD), it is an underused therapy. Neither modality has been consistently shown to confer a clear benefit to patient survival. A key limitation of prior research is that study patients were not restricted to those eligible for both therapies.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting & Participants

All adult patients developing end-stage renal disease from January 2004 to December 2013 at any of 7 regional dialysis centers in Ontario, Canada, who had received at least 1 outpatient dialysis treatment and had completed a multidisciplinary modality assessment.

Predictor

HD or PD.

Outcomes

Mortality from any cause.

Results

Among all incident patients with end-stage renal disease (1,579 HD and 453 PD), PD was associated with lower risk for death among patients younger than 65 years. However, after excluding approximately one-third of all incident patients deemed to be ineligible for PD, the modalities were associated with similar survival regardless of age. This finding was also observed in analyses that were restricted to patients initiating dialysis therapy electively as outpatients. The impact of modality on survival did not vary over time.

Limitations

The determination of PD eligibility was based on the judgment of the multidisciplinary team at each dialysis center.

Conclusions

HD and PD are associated with similar mortality among incident dialysis patients who are eligible for both modalities. The effect of modality on survival does not appear to change over time. Future comparisons of dialysis modality should be restricted to individuals who are deemed eligible for both modalities to reflect the outcomes of patients who have the opportunity to choose between HD and PD in clinical practice.

### Changing landscape for peritoneal dialysis: optimizing utilization [^e9b161dc]. Seminars in Dialysis (2017). Low credibility.

The future growth of peritoneal dialysis (PD) will be directly linked to the shift in US healthcare to a value-based payment model due to PD's lower yearly cost, early survival advantage over in-center hemodialysis, and improved quality of life for patients treating their kidney disease in the home. Under this model, nephrology practices will need an increased focus on managing the transition from chronic kidney disease to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), providing patient education with the aim of accomplishing modality selection and access placement ahead of dialysis initiation. Physicians must expand their knowledge base in home therapies and work toward increased technique survival through implementation of specific practice initiatives that highlight PD catheter placement success, preservation of residual renal function, consideration of incremental PD, and competence in urgent start PD. Avoidance of both early and late PD technique failures is also critical to PD program growth. Large dialysis organizations must continue to measure and improve quality metrics for PD, expand their focus beyond the sole provision of PD to holistic patient care, and initiate programs to reduce PD hospitalization rates and encourage physicians to consider the benefits of PD as an initial modality for appropriate patients. New and innovative strategies are needed to address the main reasons for PD technique failure, improve the connectivity of the patient in the home, leverage home biometric data to improve overall outcomes, and develop PD cycler devices that lower patient treatment burden and reduce both treatment fatigue and treatment-dependent complications.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on peritoneal dialysis in adults and children [^b8f4f042]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) (guidelines PD 2.1–2.4)

Guideline 2.1 – PD: Preparation for peritoneal dialysis

We recommend that all patients (and parents of paediatric patients) should, where possible, be adequately prepared for renal replacement therapy and this should include receiving information and education about PD treatment, delivered by an experienced member of the MDT. Patients commencing RRT in an unplanned fashion for whatever reason should receive this information once appropriate (1C). Fast track education and urgent PD catheter insertion with acute start of PD should be available, and be offered to suitable patients urgently starting on RRT who wish to avoid temporary haemodialysis, with the associated negative aspects of temporary vascular access and disruption to their lives (1C).
Audit Measure 8: Audit of care pathway for dialysis preparation to include information given (including proportion of patients offered PD), when and who delivers it.
Audit Measure 9: Audit of information on modality options provided to patients presenting who urgently require RRT, and both initial and subsequent modality of RRT selected by these patients.

Rationale

The arguments and rationale for this guideline relate to the National Service Framework for Renal Services, Part 1. The reader is referred to standard 2, Preparation and Choice pp. 21–23. The vast majority of patients commencing dialysis are medically suitable to receive PD if they select it. Some commonly perceived medical "contraindications" to PD are overstated. The majority of patients with a previous history of major abdominal surgery may successfully be treated with PD. It is also unusual to be unable to achieve target small solute clearances in the majority of larger patients (with the availability of APD, even when anuric).

When patients present needing prompt, unplanned start to renal replacement therapy, rapid insertion of a PD catheter with acute start of PD, along with fast track education regarding dialysis modalities, may allow a proportion to commence directly on PD, avoiding temporary vascular access and urgent haemodialysis. Such patients who initially receive acute start of haemodialysis should receive follow up education regarding RRT options.

Guideline 2.2 – PD: Preparation for peritoneal dialysis

We recommend that, where possible, timing of PD catheter insertion should be planned to accommodate patient convenience, commencement of training between 10 days and 6 weeks and before RRT is essential to enable correction of early catheter-related problems without the need for temporary haemodialysis (1C).
Audit Measure 10: Audit of care pathway for catheter insertion to include timeliness and need for temporary haemodialysis

Four databases were used to detect potential articles, including Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane. The last search was run on March 8, 2023. An initial literature search using the following keywords in a varied order: "haemodialysis", "peritoneal dialysis", "PD", "HD", "transfer", "change", "switch", "shift", "transition", "dropout", "drop-out", "stop", "withdraw" was performed. A librarian assisted with optimisation of the search. Associated references and sources were assessed after a review of reference lists and included as appropriate. Two reviewers (X.S. and C.M.) screened the titles and abstracts first. Full-text articles were screened based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria for further data extraction and quality assessment. Any disagreement was discussed and agreed upon with a third reviewer (S.O.).

### Peritoneal dialysis-first policy made successful: perspectives and actions [^ad384709]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) represents an important but underused strategy for patients who are beginning dialysis treatment worldwide. The development of a health care model that encourages increased use of PD is hampered by a lack of expertise and absence of pragmatic strategies. This article provides a brief review of a PD-first initiative that was implemented in Hong Kong more than 25 years ago and issues related to this policy. Clinical studies and research by the authors' and other teams around the world have shown evidence that, as a home-based dialysis therapy, PD can improve patient survival, retain residual kidney function, lower infection risk, and increase patient satisfaction while reducing financial stress to governments by addressing the burden of managing the growing number of patients with end-stage renal disease. Achieving a successful PD-first policy requires understanding inherent patient factors, selecting patients carefully, and improving technique-related factors by training physicians, nurses, patients, and caregivers better. Dialysis centers have the important role of fostering expertise and experience in PD patient management. Dialysis reimbursement policy also can be helpful in providing sufficient incentives for choosing PD. However, despite successes in improving patient survival, PD treatment has limitations, notably the shortcoming of technique failure. Potential strategies to and challenges of implementing a PD-first policy globally are discussed in this review. We highlight 3 important elements of a successful PD-first program: nephrologist experience and expertise, peritoneal dialysis catheter access, and psychosocial support for PD patients.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2020 ISPD practice recommendations for prescribing high-quality goal-directed peritoneal dialysis [^efefd700]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Pediatric peritoneal dialysis — implementation and challenges are described: The recommendation for initiation of dialysis appropriately includes subjective measures that allow clinical judgment and the well-being of the child to guide decision making, but implementation and interpretation of these instruments often requires a multidisciplinary team, including behavioral psychologists, and resources may not always be available in pediatric nephrology clinics with some instruments not applicable in infants or very young children. Adequate engagement of the parents/caregivers and the children in modality selection requires iterative dialysis modality education and decision support, and the KDOQI work group suggests inclusion of peer support in the modality selection process, which may promote an informed decision by the child and/or their caregivers. The ISPD recommendation acknowledges that an inadequate living situation may be a relative contraindication for home dialysis.

### Peritoneal dialysis access: open versus laparoscopic surgical techniques [^a2e6007a]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

To outline pros and cons with the open and laparoscopic techniques when placing peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheters.

Background

Controversy exists regarding which technique, the open and laparoscopic, if any, is superior to the other. In addition, there is the question of which approach is best in rescuing malfunctioning PD catheters.

Results

Rather than promoting one doctrine fits all, philosophically, doing the right thing for the patient by specific criteria is ethically the better model. These specific selection criteria include patient characteristics, the team's skills and knowledge and institutional resources and commitment. Also, the sophistication of a PD unit for training and monitoring of patients is crucial for successful outcomes. Open paramedian and two laparoscopic approaches are described in detail, outlining advantages and disadvantages of each, with suggestions when one method is preferred.

Conclusions

In general, the laparoscopic technique is associated with longer operative times, higher costs and the need to utilize general anesthesia. It is, however, the preferred method when rescuing malfunctioning catheters and may increase the PD patient population in patients with previous abdominal surgeries. The dialysis access surgeon should be familiar with both open and laparoscopic techniques and appropriately choose the ideal method based upon the individual patient and institutional resources.

### SAGES peritoneal dialysis access guideline update 2023 [^5049c1bb]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

Updating and limitations — after publication, SAGES Living Guidelines Task Force will plan to perform repeat literature searches on a frequent interval and, when substantive literature is identified, the guideline will undergo formal update; the limitations are inherent to the very low certainty of the evidence identified for all KQs, with selection bias in some instances where severely obese or patients with history of prior abdominal operations were not included, and multiple research priorities were made to try to improve the certainty and quality of the evidence for which recommendations were made.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2020 ISPD practice recommendations for prescribing high-quality goal-directed peritoneal dialysis [^88d2df6f]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Clinical utility — peritoneal dialysis (PD) prescription flexibility is emphasized, noting choice of continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) or APD with dialysate selection and APD adjustability, including that "fill volumes can be increased in 100-mL increments" and exchange numbers "overnight (generally 3–5) or during the day (generally 0–2)". Additional options include "urgent-start PD", "incremental PD", "assisted PD", and "palliative PD", and given these options, the statement has "high clinical utility".

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2020 ISPD practice recommendations for prescribing high-quality goal-directed peritoneal dialysis [^b8be2f6d]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Pediatric peritoneal dialysis — clinical utility and monitoring are outlined: The pediatric recommendations have high clinical utility, with objective measures to guide dialysis initiation other than eGFR routinely monitored in children with chronic kidney disease, such as potassium, total CO2, phosphate, and nutritional and growth parameters, and subjective measures including fatigue, inability to concentrate, and perceived poor quality of life that can be assessed during routine clinic visits. For modality selection, the ISPD guidelines include absolute and relative contraindications for PD in children and allow for inclusion of proximity to a pediatric HD center, as well as "the ability to achieve and maintain a suitable vascular access", and engagement of the child and caregivers in the selection process is appropriately mandated. Regular and repeat assessment of nutritional status by a dietician is an integral part of multidisciplinary care and there should be no barriers to the review and modification of sodium and fluid intake; indications for diuretics, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, and icodextrin are clearly provided; the peritoneal equilibration test has been validated in children with recommended procedure and reference data readily available; and serum phosphate and Kt/V urea are routinely monitored with suggested modifications to optimize phosphate removal.

Clinical utility — individualized assessment over clearance targets: The KDOQI work group supports the focus on individualized assessment and decreased emphasis on specific targets for small-solute clearance in individuals treated with PD, endorsing that if symptoms, nutrition, and volume status are all controlled, the PD prescription should not be changed for the sole purpose of reaching a small-solute clearance target; rather, adjustments in PD prescription should be made with a holistic assessment of metabolic control as described with statement 3c.

### A feasibility study of peritoneal dialysis with CLS PD, which… [^c459381e]. ClinicalTrials (2017). Low credibility.

Study Overview Each patient will be studied during a daytime treatment session of 8 hours. After the inclusion criteria have been met the patient will undergo a Personal Dialysis Capacity test to establish the characteristics of the peritoneal membrane, which is required for the individual glucose-salt setting in the device. An ECG and coagulation status will also be performed at this visit. The clinical study requires the insertion of a temporary catheter in addition to the patients existing standard PD catheter, and it will be inserted on the morning of the study session. Once the temporary catheter is in situ the peritoneal cavity is filled with a standard glucose based PD solution. Heparin will be added to the PD solution to prevent clogging of the CLS PD.

The device is then connected to the catheters and the temporary catheter is used for inflow and positioned in the upper right abdominal quadrant whereas the standard PD catheter in the lower quadrant is used for outflow. Participation Criteria For general information about clinical research, read Learn About Studies. Inclusion Criteria:

- Male or female patients, > 18 years of age.
- Prevalent PD patients with ESRD on stable PD without clinical signs of dehydration
- Obtained written consent to participate in the study.

### Will peritoneal dialysis be left behind? [^cba9d7fc]. Seminars in Dialysis (2005). Low credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) enjoyed huge growth in the 1980s, followed by a rapid decline in the late 1990s, and a now persistently low utilization rate in many countries, including the United States. Recent clinical data indicate a survival advantage for patients started on PD. Residual renal function is better preserved with PD. Adequacy targets are being revised and will likely allow PD prescriptions to be simplified. The physiology of the peritoneum is better understood and treatment strategies reflect that understanding. New solutions have been developed in response to studies that have assessed the impact of conventional PD dialysate on the structure and function of the peritoneum. A remaining challenge is to ensure that nephrology trainees and nephrologists in practice are fully informed of the advantages of PD for many patients and of the advances in the therapy. If this can be achieved, PD should start to grow again.

Clinical utility of shared decision making — This guideline is of high clinical utility because people do best when they are well informed and engaged, and kidney failure is a lifelong condition; individuals will be more likely to follow the treatment regimen when respected and involved in the decision-making process, understanding of prognosis prepares people for what to expect and might help with coping and acceptance, and the guideline outlines specific conversations providers should have such as consideration of manual versus automated PD (APD), incremental PD, and palliative PD.

### Peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis: towards improving evidence, practices, and outcomes [^c3871947]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Peritonitis is a common serious complication of peritoneal dialysis that results in considerable morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. It also significantly limits the use of this important dialysis modality. Despite its importance as a patient safety issue, peritonitis practices and outcomes vary markedly and unacceptably among different centers, regions, and countries. This article reviews peritonitis risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, particularly focusing on potential drivers of variable practices and outcomes, controversial or unresolved areas, and promising avenues warranting further research. Potential strategies for augmenting the existing limited evidence base and reducing the gap between evidence-based best practice and actual practice also are discussed.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^623eca3b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Dialysis modality choice and residual kidney function (RKF) — the Work Group encourages PD (peritoneal dialysis) as a first choice of modality for patients initiating KRT as a means of preserving RKF; however, most patients are not candidates for self-dialysis outside of a clinic, thus HD (hemodialysis) remains the most common initial modality choice for new patients, and the same attention that is given to RKF in PD patients should be directed to the much larger group of HD patients.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^4fa33668]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

ADPKD kidney failure — dialysis modality selection emphasizes shared decision-making: Choice of dialysis modality should be determined based on shared decision-making between physician and patient. We suggest that in people with ADPKD, selection of dialysis modality (hemodialysis [HD] or peritoneal dialysis [PD]) for treatment of kidney failure should be determined by patient-related factors, patient choice, and availability of facilities (2C). Peritoneal dialysis should be considered as a viable kidney replacement therapy (KRT) for people with ADPKD complicated by kidney failure, with caution indicated only when massive kidney and/or liver enlargement or other standard PD contraindications are present. The prescription of HD and supportive therapies, such as anticoagulation, should be the same as that for people without ADPKD.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on peritoneal dialysis in adults and children [^67d29c20]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale for clinical practice guidelines for peritoneal dialysis

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) (guidelines PD 1.1–1.5)

Guideline 1.1 – PD: Equipment and resources

We recommend that Peritoneal Dialysis should be delivered in the context of a comprehensive and integrated service for renal replacement therapies, including haemodialysis (including temporary backup facilities), transplantation and conservative care. Both continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and automated peritoneal dialysis (APD), in all its forms should be available (1C).

Guideline 1.1.2 – PD: Equipment and resources

We recommend that a dedicated PD nursing team should be part of the multidisciplinary team (1C).

Guideline 1.1.3 – PD: Equipment and resources

We recommend that where feasible, each unit has a designated lead clinician for PD (1C).

Guideline 1.1.4 – PD: Equipment and resources

We recommend that assisted PD should be available to patients wishing to have home dialysis treatment but unable to perform self-care PD, including as a temporary measure where a patient who is, or will become, independent is unable to perform PD alone (1C).

Rationale

Evidence from observational studies or registry data, with all its limitations, indicate that peritoneal dialysis (PD) used in the context of an integrated dialysis programme is associated with good clinical outcomes, certainly comparable to haemodialysis in the medium term (HD) and potentially better in the first 2 years of dialysis. NICE recommends PD as the initial dialysis treatment of choice of chronic kidney disease stage 5 for children aged 2 years or older, people with residual renal function and adults without significant associated comorbidities (NICE Clinical Guideline 125, 2011). The only randomised study (NECOSAD), comparing HD to PD as a first treatment showed no differences in 2 year quality adjusted life years or 5 year mortality, but the number randomised was insufficient to generalize this observation; notably, most patients in this national study had sufficient life-style preferences related to one modality to decline randomisation. PD has a significant technique failure rate however, so patients need to be able to switch treatment modality (to either temporary or permanent HD) in a timely manner, which has implications for HD capacity and the timing for HD access creation.

### Identification of patients receiving peritoneal dialysis using health insurance claims data [^c45a5176]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this analysis was to assess alternative methods of identification of patients treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) in health care claims databases for possible use in future analyses of costs of this treatment modality.

Methods

Using a US health insurance claims database spanning January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2006, we identified all patients with renal failure who satisfied a case-finding algorithm for PD anticipated to be highly specific, but not necessarily sensitive-namely, ≥ 2 claims for PD-related physician services (algorithm 1). All claims from these patients were assessed to identify additional PD-related codes, from which 6 additional algorithms were developed, each of which focused on specific categories of billing codes (eg, diagnostic, procedural/service, equipment). Patient selection was then reimplemented using these alternative algorithms. Concordance between the various algorithms and the extent to which resulting samples were similar in terms of patient characteristics, health care resource utilization, and costs were assessed.

Results

We identified a total of 132,274 patients in the database with ≥ 1 claim for renal failure and valid enrollment data. Among these patients, a total of 2329 satisfied case-selection criteria for algorithm 1, and 4031 patients met criteria for at least 1 of the 7 algorithms for PD. The most sensitive algorithm identified 2859 patients who might have received PD; the least sensitive, 211. Concordance between algorithms was relatively poor. Patients identified using each algorithm were similar, however, with respect to mean age (45–50 years), sex (54%-56% male), and the prevalence of selected comorbidities. Annualized median health care costs were similar across the various algorithms (range, US $80,967-$118,668).

Conclusions

Based on the results from this analysis, it seems that health care providers bill insurers for PD-related care using a variety of codes. Investigators using health insurance claims data for analyses of patients treated with PD need to take this into account.

### Treatment of peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^de350f83]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Peritonitis frequently complicates peritoneal dialysis. Appropriate treatment is essential to reduce adverse outcomes. Available trial evidence about peritoneal dialysis peritonitis treatment was evaluated.

Selection Criteria For Studies

The Cochrane CENTRAL Registry (2005 issue), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2006), EMBASE (1985 to February 2006), and reference lists were searched to identify randomized trials of treatments for patients with peritoneal dialysis peritonitis.

Interventions

Trials of antibiotics (comparisons of routes, agents, and dosing regimens), fibrinolytic agents, peritoneal lavage, and intraperitoneal immunoglobulin.

Outcomes

Treatment failure, relapse, catheter removal, microbiological eradication, hospitalization, all-cause mortality, and adverse reactions.

Results

36 eligible trials were identified: 30 trials (1,800 patients) of antibiotics; 4 trials (229 patients) of urokinase; 1 trial of peritoneal lavage (36 patients); and 1 trial of intraperitoneal immunoglobulin (24 patients). No superior antimicrobial class was identified. In particular, glycopeptides and first-generation cephalosporins were equivalent (3 trials, 387 patients; relative risk [RR], 1.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95 to 3.58). Simultaneous catheter removal/replacement was superior to urokinase at decreasing treatment failures (1 trial, 37 patients; RR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.13 to 4.91). Continuous and intermittent intraperitoneal antibiotic dosing were equivalent regarding treatment failure (4 trials, 338 patients; RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.37 to 1.30) and relapse (4 trials, 324 patients; RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.39). One trial showed superiority of intraperitoneal antibiotics over intravenous therapy.

Limitations

The method quality of trials generally was suboptimal and outcome definitions were inconsistent. Small patient numbers led to inadequate power to show an effect. Interventions, such as optimal duration of antibiotic therapy, were not evaluated.

Conclusions

Trials did not identify superior antibiotic regimens. Intermittent and continuous antibiotic dosing are equivalent treatment strategies.

### Peritoneal dialysis – current status and future challenges [^18cf9dc2]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2013). Medium credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis is now a well established, mature treatment modality for advanced chronic kidney disease. The medium term (at least 5 year) survival of patients on peritoneal dialysis is currently equivalent to that of those on haemodialysis, and is particularly good in patients who are new to renal replacement therapy and have less comorbidity. Nevertheless the modality needs to keep pace with the constantly evolving challenges associated with the provision and delivery of health care. These challenges, which are gradually converging at a global level, include ageing of the population, multimorbidity of patients, containment of cost, increasing self care and environmental issues. In this context, peritoneal dialysis faces particular challenges that include multiple barriers to the therapy and unsatisfactory and poorly defined technique survival as well as limitations relating to intrinsic aspects of the therapy, such as peritoneal membrane longevity and hypoalbuminaemia. To move the therapy forward and favourably influence health-care policy, the peritoneal dialysis community needs to integrate their research effort more effectively by undertaking clinically meaningful studies-with a strong focus on technique survival — that are supported by multidisciplinary expertise in patient-centred outcomes, study design and analysis.

### Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis versus automated peritoneal dialysis for end-stage renal disease [^f8f8b91f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) can be performed either manually as in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or using mechanical devices as in automated PD (APD). APD has been considered to have several advantages over CAPD such as reduced incidence of peritonitis, mechanical complications and greater psychosocial acceptability.

Objectives

To assess the comparative efficacy of CAPD and APD in patients who are dialysed for end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register and CINAHL. Authors of included studies were contacted, reference lists of identified RCTs and relevant narrative reviews were screened. Date of most recent search: May 2006

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing CAPD with APD in patients with ESRD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were abstracted independently by two authors onto a standard form. Relative risk (RR) for dichotomous data and a mean difference (MD) for continuous data were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Three trials (139 patients) were included. APD did not differ from CAPD with respect to mortality (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.51 to 4.37), risk of peritonitis (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.11), switching from original PD modality to a different dialysis modality (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.02), hernias (RR 1.26, 95% interval 0.32 to 5.01), PD fluid leaks (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.11 to 9.83), PD catheter removal (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.48) or hospital admissions (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.17). There was no difference between either PD modality with respect to residual renal function (MD -0.17, 95% CI -1.66 to 1.32). One study found that peritonitis rates and hospitalisation were significantly less in patients on APD when results were expressed as episodes/patient-year. Another study found that patients on APD had significantly more time for work, family and social activities.

Authors' Conclusions

APD has not been shown to have significant advantages over CAPD in terms of important clinical outcomes. APD may however be considered advantageous in select group of patients such as in the younger PD population and those in employment or education due to its psychosocial advantages. There is a need for a RCT comparing CAPD with APD with sufficiently large patient numbers looking at important clinical outcomes including residual renal function, accompanied by an economic evaluation to clarify the relative clinical and cost-effectiveness of both modalities.

### PD first: peritoneal dialysis as the default transition to dialysis therapy [^38df4424]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) and in-center hemodialysis (HD) are accepted as clinically equivalent dialysis modalities, yet in-center HD is the predominant renal replacement therapy (RRT) modality offered to new end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients in the United States and most other industrialized nations. This predominance has little to do with clinical outcomes, patient choice, cost, or quality of life. It has been driven by ease of HD initiation, physician experience and training, inadequate pre-ESRD patient education, ample in-center HD capacity, and lack of adequate infrastructure for PD-related care. As compared with in-center HD, PD is a widely applicable, yet underutilized modality of RRT that provides comparable clinical outcomes, superior quality of life measures, significant cost savings, and many other unmeasured advantages. A "PD First" approach not only has advantages for patients but also physicians, healthcare systems, and society. In this review, we will summarize evidence demonstrating that PD should be the default modality when new ESRD patients are transitioning to dialysis therapy when preemptive transplantation is not an option and highlight the essential infrastructural requirements to allow for a "PD First" model.

### Propensity score matched mortality comparisons of peritoneal and in-centre haemodialysis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^e078b0d2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Search strategy, study selection and data synthesis

The protocol of this review was registered and published previously on PROSPERO.

Electronic searches were conducted on the PubMed, Cochrane and EMBASE databases from inception until 30 November 2018 using a sensitive search strategy (Supplementary data, Table S1). Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (i) primary objective to compare mortality risks between PD and in-centre HD, (ii) adult patients with incident ESKD, (iii) PSM as the primary strategy to control for confounding and (iv) published in the English language. Studies that employed propensity score methods other than a matching strategy were not included. In addition, editorials, letters and case reports were also excluded. Two reviewers (M.E.E. and A.D.M.) independently screened and identified studies for inclusion from a web-based platform. In cases of disagreement, a subsequent discussion took place with the resolution of discrepancies by consensus. Data were extracted using a form that was developed prior to article review. The following data were extracted: year of publication, type of study, country of the study, source of the cohort, years of cohort establishment, last year of follow-up, variables used to derive propensity scores, type of matching, number of matched patients and risk of death estimates expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) or relative risks (RRs). Information was retrieved where available on analysis by age group, diabetes and duration on dialysis (vintage), as these factors have previously been shown to modify the impact of modality on mortality.

Quality assessment and risk of bias

Risk of bias was examined against the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale for observational studies. This scale awards studies a star-based score that serves as a quick visual assessment tool across three main domains: selection of study groups (up to four stars), comparability of the groups (up to two stars) and ascertainment of the exposure or the outcome of interest (up to three stars). A maximum score of nine stars reflects a study with the highest methodological quality. We also investigated the quality of reporting on PSM methods and the appropriateness of their use. This was assessed on the following domains as proposed by Austin: derivation of propensity scores including choice of variables, reporting and handling of missingness, type of matching methods and definitions, assessment of matching adequacy from appropriate balance diagnostics and adjustment for within-pair correlation in the final model.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^a8478b01]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Kidney replacement therapy in ADPKD — Recommendation 3.3.1 states, "We suggest that in people with ADPKD, selection of dialysis modality (hemodialysis [HD] or peritoneal dialysis [PD]) for treatment of kidney failure should be determined by patient-related factors, patient choice, and availability of facilities (2C)". Practice Point 3.3.1 adds that choice of dialysis modality should be determined based on shared decision-making between physician and patient, Practice Point 3.3.2 states that peritoneal dialysis should be considered as a viable kidney replacement therapy for people with ADPKD complicated by kidney failure with caution only when massive kidney and/or liver enlargement or other standard PD contraindications are present, and Practice Point 3.3.3 states that the prescription of HD and supportive therapies, such as anticoagulation, should be the same as that for people without ADPKD. The guideline notes that this recommendation places a high value on balancing benefits and harms despite limited data, that outcomes are similar between HD and PD, and that the recommendation is Level 2 due to low certainty of evidence.

### Peritoneal dialysis should not be the first choice for renal replacement therapy in the elderly [^42ab807c]. Seminars in Dialysis (2012). Low credibility.

Based on our review, it appears fair to infer that substantive differences in long-term outcome with PD compared with in-center HD have not been documented. PD may offer a slight advantage in younger, nondiabetic patients in the early phase of renal replacement therapy. Nevertheless, PD is not an advantageous option for that large cohort of the dialysis population in the United States comprised of elderly patients with diabetes.

### Past, present, and future of quantified peritoneal dialysis [^21114e56]. Seminars in Dialysis (2001). Low credibility.

The role of peritoneal dialysis (PD) as a modality in renal replacement therapy has been well established. In this article we review various aspects in the evolution of PD, with special emphasis on adequacy. Until the late 1950s PD was still considered as a last resort in the treatment of terminal uremia. The introduction of a chronic indwelling catheter made chronic PD possible. The concept of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), proposed in 1975, had a major impact on the way PD was performed later. The value of determining the adequacy, using urea clearance normalized to total body water (Kt/V) or creatinine clearance normalized to body surface area, was clearly highlighted by the Canada-USA (CANUSA) study. Introduction of standardized peritoneal equilibration tests has been very helpful in enhancing the efficiency of PD. In 1995 the National Kidney Foundation-Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiatives (NKF-DOQI) established guidelines to improve patient survival and outcome on dialysis. These guidelines established minimum criteria for PD adequacy. Compliance and malnutrition remain important factors determining the efficacy of PD. The "healthy start" concept emphasizes an early start of dialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The quest for an ideal PD modality has recently led to renewed interest in the idea of continuous flow peritoneal dialysis (CFPD). PD continues to grow and at the same time faces many challenges. Its role as a renal replacement therapy is likely to evolve further in the years to come.

Study objectives and methods

Study subjects

Employed a strategy of recruiting patients who met specific criteria to select the case and control groups, a retrospective analysis was conducted on 161 PDAP prevalent individuals admitted to our hospital. One patient was excluded due to unclear records of peritonitis occurrences, and three were excluded due to missing contamination information. Ultimately, 157 individuals were included for statistical analysis.

Inclusion criteria: Individuals diagnosed with PDAP meeting any two of the following three criteria in the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis Guidelines: (1) Clinical features consistent with peritonitis, including abdominal pain or cloudy dialysis fluid; (2) White blood cell count > 100/µL or > 0.1 × 10⁹/L (after at least 2 h of dwell time) in the dialysis effluent, with polymorphonuclear cells accounting for > 50%;(3) Growth of pathogenic microorganisms in the dialysis fluid culture. In addition, individuals aged ≥ 18 years and with at least one episode of PDAP were included. The markers listed were all collected during the peritonitis episode. Exclusion criteria: Individuals with concurrent tuberculosis or other chronic infectious diseases, and those with incomplete clinical data. All individuals or their legal guardians signed informed consent forms to voluntarily participate in this study.

Study groups

According to the different clinical outcomes of PDAP, individuals were divided into a treatment-improved group (n = 70) and a treatment failure group (n = 87), as shown in the flowchart in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
Flowchart of the cohort study

The main outcome of interest in this study was treatment failure of PDAP, defined as removal or repositioning (may increase the risk of complications and infections) of the catheter, or death after treatment. The criteria for treatment improved were as follows: patients were followed up at least six months after completing the full course of antibiotic treatment. Clinical symptoms improved, white blood cell count in the dialysis effluent < 1 × 10⁸/L, and negative dialysis effluent culture.

### Peritoneal dialysis in anuric patients: concerns and cautions [^95b55619]. Seminars in Dialysis (2002). Low credibility.

Most recent studies have found an equivalent survival for patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD); evidence even suggests that PD might be the preferred modality during the first 3–4 years of renal replacement therapy. This is probably related to the continuous and minimally invasive character of PD as compared to HD, resulting in better preservation of residual renal function (RRF) and less cardiovascular strain. On the other hand, blood pressure control, fluid balance, and adequacy targets may be difficult to obtain in long-term PD patients. The question arises whether PD is a feasible option in anuric patients. It is clear that the answer depends on the body size and the peritoneal membrane transport characteristics of the patient, so that PD will be feasible in some anuric patients, whereas in others it will not be. Evaluation of the peritoneal transport characteristics and adaptation of the PD prescription is warranted. A constant evaluation of the fluid balance, nutritional, and cardiovascular status is needed. This article reviews the physiologic insights and clinical evidence necessary for a good PD prescription in anuric patients.

### SAGES peritoneal dialysis access guideline update 2023 [^d4cd7147]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

Discussion — what's new in this guideline — states that most recommendations from the 2014 SAGES guideline are still current and applicable, while twelve new recommendations were added for adult and pediatric patients based on updated literature; topics include hernia repair at the time of PD access creation and the urgent start of dialysis, which is described as one of the first evidence-based recommendations on this subject. The authors compared outcomes of urgent and traditional start head-to-head, note that when dialysis is needed urgently hemodialysis is performed via temporary venous catheter and most patients never switch to PD, and add that there may be benefits of urgent start PD and avoiding temporary HD that outweigh the risk of urgent start PD.

### Factors influencing the symptom-to-contact time in patients with peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis: a multi-center retrospective study [^72e49bc7]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and setting

A retrospective review was conducted to select patients with PDAP from three grade III A hospitals in Xiamen, Fujian Province, China, to participate in the survey between January 2022 and October 2024. In China, hospitals are categorized into different levels based on their size, facilities, technical capabilities, and quality of medical services. A 'grade III A hospital' is the highest level in this classification system, indicating that the hospital possesses advanced medical equipment, specialized medical teams, and high-quality medical services. These hospitals are capable of providing comprehensive medical care, including complex surgeries and specialized treatments. In this study, all patients were treated in a grade III A hospital, ensuring access to the highest standard of care.

All three participating hospitals followed the same clinical protocol for managing peritonitis in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. This protocol was based on the latest recommendations from the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) and included standardized procedures for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. The consistency of the clinical protocol across the hospitals ensured that patient management was uniform, minimizing potential center variation.

PDAP Diagnostic Criteria: According to the 2022 edition of the ISPD guidelines for the prevention and treatment of peritonitis, the criteria are as follows: the patient has abdominal pain and/or cloudy effluent, with or without fever; biochemical examination of the effluent shows a white blood cell count ≥ 100 µL or > 0.1 × 10⁹/L (with dwell/retention time of the effluent > 2 h) accompanied by a percentage of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) > 50%; the culture of the effluent is positive for pathogenic microorganisms (1 C). The presence of two or more of the above criteria permits the diagnosis of PDAP.

### Efficiency and nutritional parameters in an elderly high risk population on hemodialysis and hemodiafiltration in Italy and France: different treatments with similar names? [^3d732c9a]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The choice of dialysis is context sensitive, and while the focus is usually on the treatment choice (peritoneal dialysis versus extracorporeal dialysis, hemodialysis versus hemodiafiltration), it is also acknowledged that results do not only depend upon the treatment in itself, but upon subtle differences in prescriptions and modalities. Indeed, this issue has been extensively explored for PD and extracorporeal dialysis, but less studied for haemodialysis (HD) and hemodiafiltration (HDF).

HF and HDF are widely employed in several European Countries, including Italy and France; both treatments may be differently prescribed, and for different goals, thus impacting on dialysis-related variables; the impact may be higher in elderly, high-comorbidity patients, with high mortality at baseline. Differences in prescriptions, and not only in methods, may be at the basis of the inconsistent results of comparisons between modes of treatment, available in the literature.

Hence, we undertook this cross-sectional study aimed at exploring in detail the relationship between dialysis prescriptions, selection criteria, dialysis efficiency and nutritional parameters in two relatively large cohorts of high-comorbidity dialysis patients, treated with haemodialysis (HD) and hemodiafiltration (HDF) in Italy and France.

The two centers where the study was undertaken (Cagliari in Italy and Le Mans in France) are similar in a number of ways: they are situated in relatively small cities, with large, mainly rural, areas of referral, work in cooperation with networks of out-of-hospital facilities, and share a policy of selecting the patients with the highest comorbidity for in-hospital dialysis. Their policies on selecting patients for HD and HDF are quite different, however. While in Italy the criterion driving the choice of HDF is its superior tolerance, in France it is its efficiency.

It is hoped that the present study will help in the interpretation of commonly used clinical markers in patients with high comorbidity, treated by HDF or HD, favouring comparison between dialysis policies, and ultimately casting light on the specific influences of different prescriptions.

### International variations in peritoneal dialysis utilization and implications for practice [^16b120a3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

In many countries, the use of peritoneal dialysis (PD) remains low despite arguments that support its greater use, including dialysis treatment away from hospital settings, avoidance of central venous catheters, and potential health economic advantages. Training patients to manage aspects of their own care has the potential to enhance health literacy and increase patient involvement, independence, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness of care. Complex reasons underlie the variable use of PD across the world, acting at the level of the patient, the health care team that is responsible for them, and the health care system that they find themselves in. Important among these is the availability of competitively priced dialysis fluid. A number of key interventions can affect the uptake of PD. These include high-quality patient education around dialysis modality choice, timely and successful catheter placement, satisfactory patient training, and continued support that is tailored for specific needs, for example, when people present late requiring dialysis. Several health system changes have been shown to increase PD use, such as targeted funding, PD First initiatives, or physician-inserted PD catheters. This review explores the factors that explain the considerable international variation in the use of PD and presents interventions that can potentially affect them.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2020 ISPD practice recommendations for prescribing high-quality goal-directed peritoneal dialysis [^a8ff060a]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Implementation and challenges in U.S. quality programs for PD: Absent Kt/Vurea, there is no other obvious metric to use for this purpose; however, the KDOQI work group agrees that — independent of the measured Kt/Vurea — it is appropriate to intensify the PD prescription in persons undergoing PD who have residual symptoms or metabolic abnormalities that may be attributable to uremia or inadequate dialysis. In the United States, quality metrics include monitoring of the percentage of patients achieving a delivered Kt/V (peritoneal + residual) of 1.7 or greater, and for people treated with PD the minimum threshold for dose of dialysis is set at 1.7, with the percentage of patients achieving the minimum threshold dose of dialysis being 1 of 14 measures for dialysis facilities. For payment year 2022 (performance year calendar year 2020), facilities are expected to score 54 on a total of 100 points to avoid any payment cuts, and with the current structure of the quality incentive program, dialysis facilities will need to continue to measure and report total weekly Kt/Vurea; the work group also notes that arguably not every person needs to meet the Kt/Vurea threshold of 1.7 to succeed under this regulatory schema.

### Catheter insertion techniques for improving catheter function and clinical outcomes in peritoneal dialysis patients [^c918c902]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) relies on the optimal functionality of the flexible plastic PD catheter present within the peritoneal cavity to enable effective treatment. As a result of limited evidence, it is uncertain if the PD catheter's insertion method influences the rate of catheter dysfunction and, thus, the quality of dialysis therapy. Numerous variations of four basic techniques have been adopted in an attempt to improve and maintain PD catheter function. This review evaluates the association between PD catheter insertion technique and associated differences in PD catheter function and post-PD catheter insertion complications OBJECTIVES: Our aims were to 1) evaluate if a specific technique used for PD catheter insertion has lower rates of PD catheter dysfunction (early and late) and technique failure; and 2) examine if any of the available techniques results in a reduction in post-procedure complication rates including postoperative haemorrhage, exit-site infection and peritonitis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 24 November 2022 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining adults and children undergoing PD catheter insertion. The studies examined any two PD catheter insertion techniques, including laparoscopic, open-surgical, percutaneous and peritoneoscopic insertion. Primary outcomes of interest were PD catheter function and technique survival. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently performed data extraction and assessed the risk of bias for all included studies. Main outcomes in the Summary of Findings tables include primary outcomes - early PD catheter function, long-term PD catheter function, technique failure and postoperative complications. A random effects model was used to perform meta-analyses; risk ratios (RRs) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MD) were calculated for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. MAIN RESULTS: Seventeen studies were included in this review. Nine studies were suitable for inclusion in quantitative meta-analysis (670 randomised participants). Five studies compared laparoscopic with open PD catheter insertion, and four studies compared a 'medical' insertion technique with open surgical PD catheter insertion: percutaneous (2) and peritoneoscopic (2). Random sequence generation was judged to be at low risk of bias in eight studies. Allocation concealment was reported poorly, with only five studies judged to be at low risk of selection bias. Performance bias was judged to be high risk in 10 studies. Attrition bias and reporting bias were judged to be low in 14 and 12 studies, respectively. Six studies compared laparoscopic PD catheter insertion with open surgical insertion. Five studies could be meta-analysed (394 participants). For our primary outcomes, data were either not reported in a format that could be meta-analysed (early PD catheter function, long-term catheter function) or not reported at all (technique failure). One death was reported in the laparoscopic group and none in the open surgical group. In low certainty evidence, laparoscopic PD catheter insertion may make little or no difference to the risk of peritonitis (4 studies, 288 participants: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.48; I² = 7%), PD catheter removal (4 studies, 257 participants: RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.64; I² = 0%), and dialysate leakage (4 studies, 330 participants: RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.49 to 4.02; I² = 0%), but may reduce the risk of haemorrhage (2 studies, 167 participants: RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.28 to 10.31; I² = 33%) and catheter tip migration (4 studies, 333 participants: RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.92; I² = 12%). Four studies compared a medical insertion technique with open surgical insertion (276 participants). Technique failure was not reported, and no deaths were reported (2 studies, 64 participants). In low certainty evidence, medical insertion may make little or no difference to early PD catheter function (3 studies, 212 participants: RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.83; I² = 0%), while one study reported long-term PD function may improve with peritoneoscopic insertion (116 participants: RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.92). Peritoneoscopic catheter insertion may reduce the episodes of early peritonitis (2 studies, 177 participants: RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.71; I² = 0%) and dialysate leakage (2 studies, 177 participants: RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.71; I² = 0%). Medical insertion had uncertain effects on catheter tip migration (2 studies, 90 participants: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.15 to 3.73; I² = 0%). Most of the studies examined were small and of poor quality, increasing the risk of imprecision. There was also a significant risk of bias therefore cautious interpretation of results is advised.

Authors' Conclusions

The available studies show that the evidence needed to guide clinicians in developing their PD catheter insertion service is lacking. No PD catheter insertion technique had lower rates of PD catheter dysfunction. High-quality, evidence-based data are urgently required, utilising multi-centre RCTs or large cohort studies, in order to provide definitive guidance relating to PD catheter insertion modality.

### Automated peritoneal dialysis versus continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis for people with kidney failure [^3bc9d571]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a home-based kidney replacement therapy (KRT) performed in people with kidney failure. PD can be performed by manual filling and draining of the abdominal cavity, i.e. continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD), or using a device connected to the PD catheter that is programmed to perform PD exchanges, i.e. automated PD (APD). APD is considered to have several advantages over CAPD, such as a lower incidence of peritonitis, fewer mechanical complications, and greater psychosocial acceptability. Acknowledging the increasing uptake of APD in incident and prevalent patients undergoing PD, it is important to re-evaluate the evidence on the comparative clinical and patient-reported outcomes of APD compared to CAPD. This is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2007.

Objectives

To compare clinical and patient-reported outcomes of APD to CAPD in people with kidney failure.

Search Methods

In this update, we searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies until 29 August 2024. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing APD with CAPD in adults (≥ 18 years) with kidney failure.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened the search results and extracted data. Data synthesis was performed using random-effects meta-analyses, expressing effect estimates as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs for continuous data. Certainty in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

Two RCTs (131 randomised people) comparing APD with CAPD were included in this update. One RCT had a follow-up of six months, and one RCT had a follow-up of 24 months. The risk of bias in the included studies was mostly low, except for the high risk of performance bias for subjective outcomes. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of APD compared to CAPD on death, hospitalisations, PD-related peritonitis, change of dialysis modality, residual kidney function, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), overhydration, blood pressure, exit-site infections, tunnel infections, mechanical complications, PD catheter removal, or dialysis adequacy measures. These results were largely based on low to very low certainty evidence; hence, caution is warranted when drawing conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

Insufficient evidence exists to decide between APD and CAPD in kidney failure patients with regard to clinical and patient-reported outcomes. Therefore, current evidence is insufficient as a guide for clinical practice. Given that the sample sizes of existing studies are generally small with insufficient follow-up, there is a need for large-scale, multicentre studies. Future research should focus on possible differences between APD and CAPD in residual kidney function, euvolaemia, and patient-reported outcomes such as HRQoL, symptoms, patient satisfaction and life participation.

### Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis versus haemodialysis for people with chronic kidney disease [^2f99c166]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who require urgent initiation of dialysis but without having a permanent dialysis access have traditionally commenced haemodialysis (HD) using a central venous catheter (CVC). However, several studies have reported that urgent initiation of peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a viable alternative option for such patients.

Objectives

This review aimed to examine the benefits and harms of urgent-start PD compared to HD initiated using a CVC in adults and children with CKD requiring long-term kidney replacement therapy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 25 May 2020 for randomised controlled trials through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. For non-randomised controlled trials, MEDLINE (OVID) (1946 to 11 February 2020) and EMBASE (OVID) (1980 to 11 February 2020) were searched.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and non-RCTs comparing urgent-start PD to HD initiated using a CVC.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors extracted data and assessed the quality of studies independently. Additional information was obtained from the primary investigators. The estimates of effect were analysed using random-effects model and results were presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The GRADE framework was used to make judgments regarding certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

Overall, seven observational studies (991 participants) were included: three prospective cohort studies and four retrospective cohort studies. All the outcomes except one (bacteraemia) were graded as very low certainty of evidence given that all included studies were observational studies and few events resulting in imprecision, and inconsistent findings. Urgent-start PD may reduce the incidence of catheter-related bacteraemia compared with HD initiated with a CVC (2 studies, 301 participants: RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.41; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence), which translated into 131 fewer bacteraemia episodes per 1000 (95% CI 89 to 145 fewer). Urgent-start PD has uncertain effects on peritonitis risk (2 studies, 301 participants: RR 1.78, 95% CI 0.23 to 13.62; I² = 0%; very low certainty evidence), exit-site/tunnel infection (1 study, 419 participants: RR 3.99, 95% CI 1.2 to 12.05; very low certainty evidence), exit-site bleeding (1 study, 178 participants: RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.33; very low certainty evidence), catheter malfunction (2 studies; 597 participants: RR 0.26, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.91; I² = 66%; very low certainty evidence), catheter re-adjustment (2 studies, 225 participants: RR: 0.13; 95% CI 0.00 to 18.61; I² = 92%; very low certainty evidence), technique survival (1 study, 123 participants: RR: 1.18, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.61; very low certainty evidence), or patient survival (5 studies, 820 participants; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.07; I² = 0%; very low certainty evidence) compared with HD initiated using a CVC. Two studies using different methods of measurements for hospitalisation reported that hospitalisation was similar although one study reported higher hospitalisation rates in HD initiated using a catheter compared with urgent-start PD.

Authors' Conclusions

Compared with HD initiated using a CVC, urgent-start PD may reduce the risk of bacteraemia and had uncertain effects on other complications of dialysis and technique and patient survival. In summary, there are very few studies directly comparing the outcomes of urgent-start PD and HD initiated using a CVC for patients with CKD who need to commence dialysis urgently. This evidence gap needs to be addressed in future studies.

### Peritoneal dialysis vs. hemodialysis among patients with end-stage renal disease in iran: which is more cost-effective? [^a3733089]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Markov model for CEA of HD vs. PD

In this study, four scenarios were examined. The base scenario was defined based on available data (rate of PD in ESKD patients), which was 3% for PD compared to 97% for HD. These figures were extracted from the health insurance information. The other scenarios were determined assuming an increase in PD patients compared to HD: the second scenario (30% PD, 70% HD), the third scenario (50% PD, 50% HD), and the fourth scenario (70% PD, 30% HD).

To estimate the costs of dialysis modalities, first, the list of HD, PD, and kidney transplant patients covered by the Iranian Health Insurance Organization (IHIO) was obtained from the database of the National Institute for Health Insurance Research in 2022. The healthcare system in Iran relies on several health insurance funds to provide coverage for the entire population as mandated by law. The largest of these is the IHIO, which is legally required to cover over half of the country's citizens. Eligibility for coverage under this organization is defined by legislation, and enrollment is compulsory for most people meeting the criteria. Once enrolled, there is little flexibility to change funds or insurers. The system is structured so that each eligible citizen must remain in their assigned fund based on the guidelines. This means that for the majority enrolled in the IHIO, they cannot opt out or select alternate coverage even if desired. Next, according to the number of patients with CKD in seven provinces (Tehran, Yazd, Fars, West Azarbaijan, East Azarbaijan, Hamadan, and Qazvin) and the total population of the provinces, 760 patients were selected as the final sample. The average age was 57.7 years, with a standard deviation of 16.6. The sample contained more males (60%) than females (40%). The largest proportion of patients were on HD (43.6%), followed by those with a kidney transplant (42.6%), and PD (13.8%). The average annual direct medical costs per patient, including medications, physician visits, lab tests, imaging services, dialysis service, and hospitalization, were estimated. The total direct medical costs of PD, HD, kidney transplant in the first year, and kidney transplant in the second year were 1,143,654,799 IRR, 848,855,549 IRR, 538,750,671 IRR, and 64,458,254 IRR, respectively. All cost data were calculated according to 2022–2023 prices. According to the NICE guidelines, the Iranian version of the EQ-5D-5 L questionnaire was used through direct interviews with 518 patients to extract the utility values for patients with PD (n = 76), HD (n = 312), and kidney transplantation (n = 130). The questionnaire includes 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), and each dimension has 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems). The mean (SD) utility values were 0.550 (0.468) for PD patients, 0.423 (0.549) for HD patients, and 0.695 (0.341) for kidney transplant patients.

### Factors influencing dialysis withdrawal: a scoping review [^4c44c334]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Research on factors associated with dialysis withdrawal is scarce. This study examined the predictors that might influence rate of dialysis withdrawal. Existing literature is summarized, analyzed and synthesized to identify gaps in the literature with regard to the factors associated with dialysis withdrawal.

Methods

This scoping review used a systematic search to synthesize research findings related to dialysis withdrawal and identified gaps in the literature. The search strategy was developed and applied using PubMed, EMBASE and CINHAL databases. The selection criteria included articles written in English and published between 1997 and 2016 that examined dialysis withdrawal and associated factors in patients with any modality of renal dialysis. Case reports and studies only including renal transplant patients were excluded. Fifteen articles were selected in accordance with these selection criteria.

Results

The literature review revealed a scarcity of research on dialysis withdrawal and associated factors. Furthermore, the study findings were inconsistent and inconclusive. Authors have defined dialysis withdrawal in terms of dialysis discontinuation, withholding, death, withdrawal, treatment refusal/cessation, or technique failure. Authors have selected homogeneous patient population on either hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, thus making comparisons of studies and generalization of findings difficult.

Conclusion

Future studies should explore the influence of both HD and PD on patient-elected dialysis withdrawal using a large a priori calculated sample size.

### Outcomes of incident patients treated with incremental haemodialysis as compared with standard haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis [^11a99ae0]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

In Europe, 100 000 patients initiated kidney replacement therapy (KRT) in 2016, corresponding to an overall incidence of 132 per million population. In-centre haemodialysis (HD) is the most commonly used modality. Most incident patients still have a significant residual kidney function (RKF) when starting HD, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 6–10 mL/min/1.73 m². The importance of RKF preservation in dialysed patients is increasingly recognized as it has been associated with improved survival and quality of life, as well as decreased inflammation and erythropoietin use in observational studies. A dogma of thrice-weekly HD (TW-HD) has been implemented based on urea kinetic modelling and dialysis adequacy targets, as evaluated by small molecule dialytic clearance (Kt/V). This metric was first formalized in the 1980s and later updated in the 2000s in large randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Results from those seminal studies have defined the concept of 'dialysis adequacy' with a target sessional delivered single pool Kt/V of 1.2 still recommended in current guidelines. However, most included patients did not have significant RKF. Incremental HD (I-HD) is generally defined as a once- or twice-weekly HD regimen prescribed in incident end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients in order to achieve the target weekly small molecule clearance while accounting for RKF. I-HD has been associated with greater preservation of RKF in incident patients as compared with TW-HD in observational studies. Despite current guidelines supporting the choice of an incremental approach for HD prescription, the vast majority of ESKD patients still begin on a TW-HD regimen in resource-rich countries. Although not universal, incremental prescription considering RKF is more commonly accepted in peritoneal dialysis (PD). Moreover, PD has also been associated with better RKF preservation as compared with TW-HD in observational reports.

As an incremental approach to dialysis prescription is gaining wider acceptance, our aim is to describe the impact of initial KRT modality (I-HD, TW-HD or PD) on overall mortality and other selected outcomes in incident ESKD patients.

### SAGES peritoneal dialysis access guideline update 2023 [^2604bb72]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

SAGES peritoneal dialysis access guideline — urgent start versus traditional start in adults initiating peritoneal dialysis: For adult patients, the panel suggests traditional start as opposed to urgent start when initiating peritoneal dialysis. (conditional recommendation, very low certainty evidence). Urgent start peritoneal dialysis (PD) is defined as initiation of PD prior to the standard 2 week break-in period after implantation surgery, and the benefits of avoiding bridging hemodialysis (HD) include preservation of vascular access, better outcome after renal transplantation, and lower risk of hepatitis B and C infection. Evidence included a total of nine observational studies comparing urgent start to traditional start, with mortality deemed critical to decision-making. The panel considered the desirable effects of urgent start to be small, though beginning renal replacement therapy urgently may improve clinical status and avoid fluid overload, hyperkalemia, uremia, and even death, while avoiding temporary hemodialysis. In this group there was a lower incidence of late catheter dysfunction and less exit site infection, with late catheter dysfunction estimated 60 fewer events per 1,000 patients (95% CI 119 fewer to 21 more) based on 4 studies with 828 patients.

### Comparison of life participation activities among adults treated by hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation: a systematic review [^81b04224]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

A comprehensive assessment of the association of patients' renal replacement therapy (RRT) modality with their participation in life activities (physical function, travel, recreation, freedom, and work) is needed.

Study Design

Systematic review of peer-reviewed published studies.

Setting & Population

Adults undergoing RRT (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or transplantation).

Selection Criteria For Studies

We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE from January 1980 through April 2012 for English-language articles that compared participation in life activities among patients receiving: (1) hemodialysis compared with peritoneal dialysis, (2) hemodialysis compared with kidney transplantation, or (3) peritoneal dialysis compared with kidney transplantation.

Predictor

RRT modality.

Outcomes

Reported rates of physical function, travel, recreation, freedom, and work-related activities by RRT modality.

Results

46 studies (6 prospective cohort, 38 cross-sectional, and 2 pre-post transplantation) provided relevant comparisons of life participation activities among patients treated with hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation. Studies were conducted in 1985–2011 among diverse patient populations in 16 distinct locations. A majority of studies reported greater life participation rates for patients with kidney transplants compared with patients receiving either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. In contrast, a majority of studies reported no differences in outcomes between patients receiving hemodialysis and patients receiving peritoneal dialysis. These results were consistent throughout the study period, across diverse populations, and among the subset of studies that performed appropriate adjustments for potential confounding factors.

Limitations

Many studies included in the review had significant design weaknesses.

Conclusions

Evidence suggests that patients with kidney transplants may experience better rates of life participation compared with patients receiving dialysis, whereas patients receiving hemodialysis and patients receiving peritoneal dialysis may experience similar rates of life participation. Rigorously performed studies are needed to better inform patients about the association of RRT with these important patient-reported outcomes.

### The effect of contraindications and patient preference on dialysis modality selection in ESRD patients in the Netherlands [^50a3c9e8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are about to start long-term dialysis therapy are faced with the question of modality choice. The aim of the current study is to determine the influence of different factors on long-term dialysis modality choice.

Methods

As part of a large Dutch prospective multicenter study, the Netherlands Cooperative Study on the Adequacy of Dialysis, we consecutively included all new patients with ESRD. Nephrologists indicated the most important reason for the modality selection.

Results

Of 1,347 included patients, 36% (n = 483) had a contraindication to either peritoneal dialysis (PD) or hemodialysis (HD) therapy. Eighty percent (n = 386) of all contraindications were directed to PD therapy. The most frequently mentioned contraindication was a social one; ie, the expected incapability of patients to perform PD exchanges themselves. Patients with contraindications were older, had more comorbidity, and lived alone more often compared with patients without contraindications. In patients without contraindications (64%), modality choice was based on patient preference. Older age increased the odds of choosing HD, whereas receipt of predialysis care was associated with a lower preference for HD.

Conclusion

Older age was associated with more contraindications to PD therapy and stronger patient preference for HD therapy. An elderly patient therefore was more likely to start with HD therapy. Results from the current study suggest that an increase in provision of predialysis care, in combination with a reduction in social contraindications to PD therapy, may be associated with an increase in likelihood of starting with PD therapy. In a time of an aging population, increasing demand on dialysis capacity, and limited amount of financial supplies, we may reconsider current strategies to provide future patients with ESRD the possibility to start with the dialysis modality they prefer.

### Left ventricular assist devices, kidney disease, and dialysis [^fac6ad51]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) improve survival in patients with advanced heart failure. As LVAD use increases, so do the number of patients with LVADs who also have kidney disease. However, there are only sparse data on how best to care for these patients. This review provides an overview of LVAD principles and indications, including blood pressure assessment and criteria for receipt of both destination and bridge to transplantation LVADs. Following LVAD implantation, kidney function may improve in the short term, particularly if cardiorenal physiology was present; in the longer term, data remain limited. Individuals with glomerular filtration rates chronically < 30mL/min/1.73 m², including those treated with maintenance dialysis, are generally ineligible for destination LVADs. However, select patients with advanced chronic kidney disease can be considered for LVADs as a bridge to heart or heart-kidney transplantation. Patients who develop acute kidney injury and require dialysis following LVAD implantation have high mortality rates. Although thrice-weekly hemodialysis is the most common modality for patients with LVADs, peritoneal dialysis and home hemodialysis are additional options. Peritoneal dialysis in particular may be associated with lower risk for bloodstream infection and fewer hemodynamic shifts. For those treated with hemodialysis, arteriovenous fistulas can successfully be used for vascular access. Many questions remain, including optimal anemia management and refinement of hemodialysis protocols for patients with an LVAD, and further research is needed in this field.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on peritoneal dialysis in adults and children [^9eb73ad1]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) (guidelines PD 3.1–3.3)

Guideline 3.1 – PD: Solute clearance

We recommend that both residual urine and peritoneal dialysis components of small solute clearance should be measured at least six monthly or more frequently if dependant on residual renal function to achieve clearance targets or if clinically or biochemically indicated in adults and in children. Both urea and/or creatinine clearances can be used to monitor dialysis adequacy and should be interpreted within the limits of the methods (1C).

Guideline 3.2.1 – PD: Solute clearance

We recommend that a combined urinary and peritoneal Kt/V urea of 1.7/week or a creatinine clearance of 50 L/week/1.73 m² should be considered as minimal treatment doses for adults (1A). We recommend/suggest that clearance targets for children should be a minimum of those for adults (1C).

Guideline 3.2.2 – PD: Solute clearance

We recommend that the dose of dialysis should be increased in patients experiencing uraemic symptoms, or inadequate growth in children, even if meeting minimum clearance targets (1B).

Guideline 3.3 – PD: Solute clearance

We recommend that a continuous 24 h PD regime is preferred to an intermittent regime for anuric patients (1B).

### Guidelines for laparoscopic peritoneal dialysis access surgery [^407a437c]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Laparoscopic peritoneal dialysis access — literature review scope and inclusion thresholds are as follows: A systematic literature search was performed on MEDLINE in May 2010 and was updated January 2013, identifying 66 articles on laparoscopic insertion of PD catheters, of which 37 were on salvage and 14 on peritoneoscopic insertion. Randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews were selected for further review along with prospective and retrospective studies when a higher level of evidence was lacking; for inclusion, prospective and retrospective studies had to report outcomes on at least 30 laparoscopic PD catheter insertions, and lower evidence level studies were not considered when Level 1 evidence was adequate. For pediatrics, a separate search was undertaken in 2013 with inclusion requiring outcomes on at least 15 peritoneal dialysis catheter insertions; Forty five articles relevant to pediatric patients were reviewed, and overall, a total of 170 graded articles relevant to laparoscopic PD insertion were included to formulate the recommendations.

### Peritoneal dialysis first: rationale [^ff935dd9]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

The use of peritoneal dialysis (PD) has become wide spread since the introduction of continuous ambulatory PD more than 25 years ago. Over this time, many advances have been made and PD is an alternative to hemodialysis (HD), with excellent comparable survival, lower cost, and improved quality of life. The percentage of prevalent PD patients in the United States is approximately 7%, which is significantly lower compared with the 15% PD prevalence from the mid-1980s. Despite comparable survival of HD and PD and improved PD technique survival over the last few years, the percentage of patients performing PD in the United States has declined. The increased numbers of in-center HD units, physician comfort with the modality, perceived superiority of HD, and reimbursement incentives have all contributed to the underutilization of PD. In addition to a higher transplantation rate among patients treated with PD in the United States, an important reason for the low PD prevalence is the transfer to HD. There are various reasons for the transfer (e.g., episodes of peritonitis, membrane failure, patient fatigue, etc.). This review discusses the various factors that contribute to PD underutilization and the rationale and strategies to implement "PD first" and how to maintain it. The PD first concept implies that when feasible, PD should be offered as the first dialysis modality. This concept of PD first and HD second must not be seen as a competition between therapies, but rather that they are complementary, keeping in mind the long-term goals for the patient.

### Optimising intraperitoneal gentamicin dosing in peritoneal dialysis patients with peritonitis (GIPD) study [^74f8e016]. BMC Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are preferentially delivered via the peritoneal route to treat peritonitis, a major complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD), so that maximal concentrations are delivered at the site of infection. However, drugs administered intraperitoneally can be absorbed into the systemic circulation. Drugs excreted by the kidneys accumulate in PD patients, increasing the risk of toxicity. The aim of this study is to examine a model of gentamicin pharmacokinetics and to develop an intraperitoneal drug dosing regime that maximises bacterial killing and minimises toxicity.

Methods/Design

This is an observational pharmacokinetic study of consecutive PD patients presenting to the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital with PD peritonitis and who meet the inclusion criteria. Participants will be allocated to either group 1, if anuric as defined by urine output less than 100 ml/day, or group 2: if non-anuric, as defined by urine output more than 100 ml/day. Recruitment will be limited to 15 participants in each group. Gentamicin dosing will be based on the present Royal Brisbane & Women's Hospital guidelines, which reflect the current International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis Peritonitis Treatment Recommendations. The primary endpoint is to describe the pharmacokinetics of gentamicin administered intraperitoneally in PD patients with peritonitis based on serial blood and dialysate drug levels.

Discussion

The study will develop improved dosing recommendations for intraperitoneally administered gentamicin in PD patients with peritonitis. This will guide clinicians and pharmacists in selecting the most appropriate dosing regime of intraperitoneal gentamicin to treat peritonitis.

### The differential impact of risk factors on mortality in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis [^dd8b3c3d]. Kidney International (2004). Low credibility.

Background

While the survival ramifications of dialysis modality selection are still debated, it seems reasonable to postulate that outcome comparisons are not the same for all patients at all times. Trends in available data indicate the relative risk of death with hemodialysis (HD) compared to peritoneal dialysis (PD) varies by time on dialysis and the presence of various risk factors. This study was undertaken to identify key patient characteristics for which the risk of death differs by dialysis modality.

Methods

Analyses utilized incidence data from 398,940 United States Medicare patients initiating dialysis between 1995 and 2000. Proportional hazards regression identified the presence of diabetes, age, and the presence of comorbidity as factors that significantly interact with treatment modality. Stratifying by these factors, proportional and nonproportional hazards models were used to estimate relative risks of death [RR (HD:PD)].

Results

Of the 398,940 patients studied, 11.6% used PD as initial therapy, 45% had diabetes mellitus (DM), 51% were 65 years or older, and 55% had at least one comorbidity. Among the 178,693 (45%) patients with no baseline comorbidity, adjusted mortality rates in nondiabetic (non-DM) patients were significantly higher on HD than on PD [age 18–44: RR (95% CI) = 1.24 (1.07, 1.44); age 45–64: RR = 1.13 (1.02, 1.25); age 65+: RR = 1.13 (1.05, 1.21)]. Among diabetic (DM) patients with no comorbidity, HD was associated with a higher risk of death among younger patients [age 18–44: RR = 1.22(1.05, 1.42)] and a lower risk of death among older patients [age 45–64: RR = 0.92 (0.85, 1.00); age 65+: RR = 0.86 (0.79, 0.93)]. Within the group of 220,247 (55%) patients with baseline comorbidity, adjusted mortality rates were not different between HD and PD among non-DM patients [age 18–44: RR = 1.19 (0.94, 1.50); age 45–64: RR = 1.01 (0.92, 1.11); age 65+: RR = 0.96 (0.91, 1.01)] and younger DM patients [age 18–44: RR = 1.10 (0.92, 1.32)], but were lower with HD among older DM patients with baseline comorbidity [age 45–64: RR = 0.82 (0.77, 0.87); age 65+: RR = 0.80 (0.76, 0.85)].

Conclusion

Valid mortality comparisons between HD and PD require patient stratification according to major risk factors known to interact with treatment modality. Survival differences between HD and PD are not constant, but vary substantially according to the underlying cause of ESRD, age, and level of baseline comorbidity. These results may help identify technical advances that will improve outcomes of patients on dialysis.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2020 ISPD practice recommendations for prescribing high-quality goal-directed peritoneal dialysis [^7377e021]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis prescribing — clinical utility and U.S. implementation challenges highlight that, given measurement limitations, "a main outcome associated with prescribing PD becomes a subjective assessment of the well-being of the individual, rather than the usual definable quality metrics", and in such cases "one should take extra caution to ensure that provision of a dose of dialysis less than that previously studied is not itself responsible for exacerbating the clinical condition of the individual maintained on PD". Implementation needs include that "the care team will need to gain expertise, or work with consultants who have such expertise, to target appropriate care for people on long-term PD, no matter their age and degree of frailty or comorbidity", and "ideally, all people receiving long-term PD would be assessed for palliative care needs, which includes management of symptoms". System barriers are noted: "However, resources are not fully available within the current system", and "several payers, including Medicare, will not support concurrent hospice and long-term dialysis treatment unless a person requests hospice for a non–kidney failure–related diagnosis", creating "challenges to the US environment that may only be addressed by waivers within burgeoning value-based care models or future legislation".

### Guidelines for laparoscopic peritoneal dialysis access surgery [^a209d497]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Patient selection — Guideline recommendations for laparoscopic peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter insertion state that contraindications include active abdominal infection and uncorrectable mechanical defects of the abdominal wall, with a "Strong recommendation". History of prior abdominal surgery, regardless of how many, is not a contraindication to laparoscopic PD catheter insertion, and it is appropriate for surgeons with experience in advanced laparoscopy to attempt lysis of adhesions and catheter placement in these patients, with a "Strong recommendation". Patients with abdominal wall hernias should be diagnosed and repaired before or at the same time as PD catheter insertion, and a repair should be chosen that minimizes peritoneal dissection and does not place mesh intraperitoneally, with a "Weak recommendation". PD may be initiated in patients with intraabdominal foreign bodies such as after open abdominal aortic aneurysm graft repair, but a four month waiting period is recommended, and data are very limited regarding PD in the presence of an adjustable gastric band, with a "Weak recommendation". PD may be safely initiated in patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts, with a "Weak recommendation". Gastrostomy tubes can be used in pediatric patients on PD, though placement by blind percutaneous endoscopic technique (PEG) appears to be associated with higher infection rates compared to open insertion, with a "Weak recommendation". Laparoscopic PD catheter insertion with carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum requires general anesthesia; patients who are high risk to undergo general anesthesia should be considered for techniques using local anesthesia and sedation (such as open insertion or fluoroscopically guided percutaneous insertion), and laparoscopic insertion using nitrous oxide pneumoperitoneum and local anesthesia is also an option where available, with a "Weak recommendation".

### End-stage renal disease [^39d4d52b]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) affects more than 1500 people per million population in countries with a high prevalence, such as Japan, Taiwan, and the US. Approximately two-thirds of people with ESRD receive haemodialysis, one quarter have kidney transplants, and one tenth receive peritoneal dialysis.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of different doses for peritoneal dialysis? What are the effects of different doses and membrane fluxes for haemodialysis? What are the effects of interventions aimed at preventing secondary complications? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 26 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: cinacalcet, darbepoetin, erythropoietin, haemodialysis (standard-dose, increased-dose), high membrane-flux haemodialysis, increased-dose peritoneal dialysis, low membrane-flux haemodialysis, mupirocin, sevelamer, standard-dose dialysis, and statins.

### Target weight achievement and ultrafiltration rate thresholds: potential patient implications [^558eb834]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Study design and selection criteria

This study was approved by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Institutional Review Board. Data were taken from the records of 196,635 patients from 2449 U.S. facilities in the 2012 electronic medical record of a single dialysis provider. Cohort entry occurred between January 1 and November 30, 2012 and was based on rolling monthly application of selection criteria. Patients entered and exited the cohort throughout the year and could contribute to different facility monthly cohorts. This design mirrors real-world measure implementation and facilitated calculation of monthly and annual proportions of facility patients with post-dialysis weigh-arget weight differences outside of the proposed 1 kg threshold. Patient and facility eligibility criteria were assessed monthly and were based on the selection criteria set-forth by the measure developers. In-center hemodialysis patients aged ≥ 18 years who were present at the reporting facility for ≥ 30 days were included. Peritoneal dialysis and home hemodialysis patients, patients dialyzing at facilities with < 11 patients, patients with incomplete post-dialysis weight or target weight data and patients with < 7 treatments at the facility in the reporting month were excluded. These selection criteria were proposed by the measure developers to promote equitable assessment of target weight achievement across facilities and to focus on patients within facility control during the assessment period (i.e. to avoid undue influence from patients with prolonged hospitalizations or high percentages of missed outpatient treatments).

In analyses estimating theoretical fluid-related weight gain after application of an UF rate threshold of 13 mL/h/kg, we considered patients with complete treatment data from February 2012 (i.e. no missed outpatient treatments and no missing pre-weight, post-weight or target weight data) and who survived 60 days after the end of February 2012. In these analyses, IDWG was calculated as: pre-dialysis weight minus post-dialysis weight from prior treatment. Prescribed UF rate (mL/h/kg) was calculated as: IDWG (mL)/ prescribed TT (h)/ post-dialysis weight (kg).

### SAGES peritoneal dialysis access guideline update 2023 [^3f91397e]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) epidemiology, modality comparison, and contraindications in the USA are summarized as follows: In 2022 over 786,000 patients relied on renal replacement therapy (RRT), of whom 71% were on dialysis and 29% had a functioning transplant, and in 2020 16,528 patients initiated PD, representing 12.7% of incident end stage renal disease (ESRD). Hemodialysis (HD) has been found to be inferior to PD with regards to patient autonomy, quality of life, preservation of residual renal function, survival for the first two years, and cost. Absolute contraindications to PD include documented ultrafiltration failure of the peritoneal membrane, severe protein calorie malnutrition and/or proteinuria > 10 g/day, active intraabdominal infection, loss of domain / unrepairable abdominal wall hernia, and loss of peritoneal volume due to dense abdominal adhesions not amenable to laparoscopic lysis, and perceived barriers include advanced age, obesity, and polycystic kidney disease.

### SAGES peritoneal dialysis access guideline update 2023 [^1570de58]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

SAGES peritoneal dialysis (PD) access guideline update 2023 — evidence summary and research needs for urgent versus conventional start PD. A well-constructed multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) that can adequately compare the outcomes of starting hemodialysis (HD) and converting to PD versus initial urgent start PD is needed. A Cochran database review in 2019 identified 16 studies (2953 participants) examining the outcomes of urgent versus conventional start PD, and when results from patients who initiated dialysis two weeks after catheter insertion were compared to those who initiated dialysis urgently, the latter were more likely to have leakage of dialysis fluid outside the abdominal cavity into the skin near the exit-site of peritoneal dialysis catheter. The study was unable to make conclusions about differences in rates of peritonitis, exit-site infection, mechanical complications of peritoneal dialysis (including catheter blockage, catheter malposition and catheter readjustment), patients remaining on peritoneal dialysis (technique survival), and death. The ISPD 2019 guideline update concluded, "There are no RCTs comparing urgent start on PD with urgent start on hemodialysis".

### Peritoneal dialysis adequacy and risk of death [^0e3d217d]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

The debate on the relationship between small solute clearance and patient outcome on peritoneal dialysis has intensified in the past year with the publication or presentation of a number of important new studies. Previous studies had found a correlation between clearances and subsequent patient survival. However, this effect was all accounted for by residual renal clearance. The failure to detect an independent effect of peritoneal clearance on outcomes had been attributed to a lack of well-done studies with sufficient variation in peritoneal clearance to detect such an effect. New prospective and randomized studies suggest, however, that the relationship between peritoneal clearance and outcome is weak or absent within the usual dose ranges delivered in clinical practice. Existing clearance targets may need to be reviewed.

### Use of peritoneal dialysis in AKI: a systematic review [^3bd24b0e]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The role of peritoneal dialysis in the management of AKI is not well defined, although it remains frequently used, especially in low-resource settings. A systematic review was performed to describe outcomes in AKI treated with peritoneal dialysis and compare peritoneal dialysis with extracorporeal blood purification, such as continuous or intermittent hemodialysis.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched in July of 2012. Eligible studies selected were observational cohort or randomized adult population studies on peritoneal dialysis in the setting of AKI. The primary outcome of interest was all-cause mortality. Summary estimates of odds ratio were obtained using a random effects model.

Results

Of 982 citations, 24 studies (n = 1556 patients) were identified. The overall methodological quality was low. Thirteen studies described patients (n = 597) treated with peritoneal dialysis only; pooled mortality was 39.3%. In 11 studies (7 cohort studies and 4 randomized trials), patients received peritoneal dialysis (n = 392, pooled mortality = 58.0%) or extracorporeal blood purification (n = 567, pooled mortality = 56.1%). In the cohort studies, there was no difference in mortality between peritoneal dialysis and extracorporeal blood purification (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 1.71). In four randomized trials, there was also no difference in mortality (odds ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.46 to 4.86); however, heterogeneity was significant (I(2) = 73%, P = 0.03).

Conclusions

There is currently no evidence to suggest significant differences in mortality between peritoneal dialysis and extracorporeal blood purification in AKI. There is a need for good-quality evidence in this important area.
