## Question

Free radicals contribute to the onset and progression of which disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which disease's onset and progression are contributed to by free radicals/reactive oxygen species (ROS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanistic role of free radicals and oxidative stress in human disease. Then, I should identify the specific diseases explicitly tied to ROS in the key references. Next, I will cross-check for consistency across vascular and metabolic conditions and weigh the evidence for prominence. After that, I need to consider broader associations such as neurodegeneration and cancer while not overextending beyond the corpus. Finally, I will reconcile mechanistic plausibility with clinical trial data on antioxidants to avoid overstating causality or therapeutic implications, before synthesizing a prioritized answer supported by the references.

> Let me first confirm the foundational mechanism so I don't jump to conclusions: free radicals and ROS, when in excess of endogenous antioxidant defenses, create oxidative stress that damages lipids, proteins, and DNA and drives pathobiology across multiple systems; I need to ensure that this mechanistic base is present in the corpus to ground disease links, which it is and is explicitly stated in key overviews of oxidative stress biology and endothelial dysfunction.

> I will now examine the primary sources highlighting disease associations; wait, let me verify the index conditions emphasized. The review focused on "Role of free radical in atherosclerosis, diabetes and dyslipidaemia" directly names these three as principal ROS-linked conditions, while the vascular disease review broadens to cardiovascular diseases including ischemic heart disease, atherosclerosis, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension, and diabetes, establishing a consistent theme that vascular pathology is a major ROS domain [^114zL5Hb] [^112iWguF].

> Hold on, I should verify which disease emerges as most prominent in the corpus; scanning repeatedly returns atherosclerosis as the dominant ROS-related disease process, with extensive mechanistic and translational literature ranging from innate immunity and complement activation to imaging and plaque biology, all consistent with oxidative stress as a key driver within the atherogenic cascade and its complications [^1162jxZb] [^112qYu8a] [^112iWguF].

> Next, I should review the metabolic dimension; oxidative stress in diabetes is repeatedly linked to endothelial dysfunction and accelerated atherosclerosis, suggesting that while diabetes is itself a ROS-associated condition, much of its clinical hazard is mediated through atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, reinforcing the primacy of atherosclerosis in this network of ROS-driven pathology [^115aVaFP] [^112iWguF].

> But wait, what if other diseases are equally central? Let me consider the broader context cautiously. The provided references also connect ROS to cancer, neurodegeneration (including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's), and aging biology; however, within this corpus these appear as important but comparatively less emphasized associations than atherosclerosis and cardiometabolic disease, so I should avoid overstating their relative prominence here while acknowledging the mechanistic links [^116CwgTn] [^117AXrck] [^113gxEm9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to therapeutic conclusions; I need to check the translational signal from antioxidant trials. Despite robust mechanistic and preclinical data, large clinical trials of generalized antioxidants have largely failed to improve outcomes in atherosclerosis, diabetes, or vascular cognitive risk, indicating that while ROS are mechanistically involved, nontargeted antioxidant supplementation has not translated into clear clinical benefit in these domains, which tempers causal interpretation and guides focus toward targeted redox and disease-specific strategies [^112iWguF] [^1132uqJ1] [^115aVaFP] [^111AfkCW].

> In summary, after double-checking the mechanistic and disease-level signals across the references, free radicals/ROS are most consistently and prominently implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of atherosclerosis, with strong secondary associations to diabetes and dyslipidemia within the broader cardiovascular disease spectrum; mechanistically, oxidative stress injures vascular endothelium and lipoproteins, fuels inflammation, and accelerates plaque formation and complications, while broader links to cancer, neurodegeneration, and aging are present but less central in this corpus [^114zL5Hb] [^112iWguF] [^112iWguF].

Free radicals play a central role in the initiation and progression of **atherosclerosis** [^112iWguF] by driving oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction [^116EomRL], and inflammation [^113hSyxg] [^114zL5Hb]. They **oxidize LDL to oxLDL** [^117Sv87H], which is taken up by macrophages to form foam cells and fatty streaks [^113Tgcr9], and promote plaque instability and rupture through ongoing vascular injury [^112iWguF] and inflammatory signaling [^112mPDgn]. Free radicals also contribute to other cardiovascular diseases, including ischemic heart disease [^112iWguF], hypertension [^114zL5Hb], and diabetes-related vascular complications [^115aVaFP].

## Mechanisms of free radical involvement in atherosclerosis

Vascular cells produce free radicals — particularly reactive oxygen species (ROS) [^112iWguF] — that contribute to **oxidative stress**, a key driver of atherosclerosis [^113gxEm9].

- **Oxidative modification of LDL**: Free radicals oxidize LDL cholesterol, forming oxidized LDL (oxLDL) [^112iWguF], which is readily taken up by macrophages, leading to foam cell formation and fatty streaks, the earliest visible lesions of atherosclerosis [^1159Hda1].

- **Endothelial dysfunction**: ROS impair endothelial function by reducing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability [^112iWguF], promoting vasoconstriction, inflammation, and increased vascular permeability, facilitating lipid infiltration into the arterial wall [^116EomRL].

- **Inflammatory signaling**: Free radicals activate inflammatory pathways, including the NLRP3 inflammasome [^112tGv9p], leading to chronic vascular inflammation, plaque instability, and rupture [^113hSyxg].

---

## Evidence supporting the role of free radicals in atherosclerosis

There is extensive experimental and clinical evidence [^112iWguF] supporting the **central role** of free radicals in atherosclerosis:

- **Animal models**: Studies in animal models have demonstrated that oxidative stress accelerates atherosclerosis progression [^112iWguF], while antioxidant interventions can reduce lesion formation.

- **Human studies**: Clinical investigations have shown increased oxidative stress markers in patients with atherosclerosis [^112iWguF], correlating with disease severity and progression [^113gxEm9].

- **Therapeutic interventions**: Antioxidant therapies, although with mixed results [^1132uqJ1], have shown potential in reducing oxidative stress and slowing atherosclerosis progression in certain populations.

---

## Clinical implications and therapeutic strategies

Understanding the role of free radicals in atherosclerosis has significant **clinical implications**:

- **Antioxidant therapies**: Targeted antioxidant therapies [^1132uqJ1] may help reduce oxidative stress and slow atherosclerosis progression, although further research is needed to identify effective interventions.

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Lifestyle changes, such as smoking cessation, healthy diet, and regular exercise, can reduce oxidative stress and lower cardiovascular risk [^1162rCXC].

- **Pharmacological interventions**: Statins and other lipid-lowering agents indirectly reduce oxidative stress by lowering LDL cholesterol levels [^1159Hda1], thereby reducing substrate availability for oxidation [^113y8XTG].

---

Free radicals play a **central role** in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis by driving oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation. Understanding these mechanisms provides opportunities for targeted therapeutic interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk [^1162jxZb].

### Role of free radical in atherosclerosis, diabetes and dyslipidaemia: larger-than-life [^114zL5Hb]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

During the past few decades, there have been numerous studies related to free radical chemistry. Free radicals, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species, are generated by the human body through various endogenous systems, exposure to different physiochemical conditions, or pathological states, and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases. These free radicals are also common by-products of many oxidative biochemical reactions in cells. When free radicals overwhelm the body's ability to regulate them, a condition known as oxidative stress ensues. They adversely alter lipids, proteins, and DNA, which trigger a number of human diseases.

In a number of pathophysiological conditions, the delicate equilibrium between free radical production and antioxidant capability is distorted, leading to oxidative stress and increased tissue injury. ROS, which are mainly produced by vascular cells, are implicated as possible underlying pathogenic mechanisms in the progression of cardiovascular diseases, including ischemic heart disease, atherosclerosis, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension, and diabetes. This review summarizes the key roles played by free radicals in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, diabetes, and dyslipidaemia. Although not comprehensive, this review also provides a brief perspective on some of the research being conducted in this area for a better understanding of the role free radicals play in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, diabetes, and dyslipidaemia.

### Oxidative stress and vascular disease [^112iWguF]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2005). Low credibility.

Growing evidence indicates that chronic and acute overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under pathophysiologic conditions is integral in the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). These ROS can be released from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) oxidase, xanthine oxidase, lipoxygenase, mitochondria, or the uncoupling of nitric oxide synthase in vascular cells.

ROS mediate various signaling pathways that underlie vascular inflammation in atherogenesis: from the initiation of fatty streak development through lesion progress to ultimate plaque rupture. Various animal models of oxidative stress support the notion that ROS have a causal role in atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases. Human investigations also support the oxidative stress hypothesis of atherosclerosis. Oxidative stress is the unifying mechanism for many CVD risk factors, further reinforcing its central role in CVD.

Despite the demonstrated role of antioxidants in cellular and animal studies, the ineffectiveness of antioxidants in reducing cardiovascular death and morbidity in clinical trials has led many investigators to question the importance of oxidative stress in human atherosclerosis. Others have argued that the prime factor for the mixed outcomes from using antioxidants to prevent CVD may be the lack of specific and sensitive biomarkers to assess the oxidative stress phenotypes underlying CVD. A better understanding of the complexity of cellular redox reactions, development of a new class of antioxidants targeted to specific subcellular locales, and th

### Adjustment for atherosclerosis diagnosis distorts the effects of percutaneous coronary intervention and the ranking of hospital performance [^1134BzLR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Coronary atherosclerosis raises the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and is usually included in AMI risk-adjustment models. Although percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) does not cause atherosclerosis, it may contribute to the notation of atherosclerosis in administrative claims. We investigated how adjustment for atherosclerosis affects rankings of hospitals that perform PCI.

- **Methods and results**: This was a retrospective cohort study of 414,715 Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for AMI between 2009 and 2011. The outcome was 30-day mortality. Regression models determined the association between patient characteristics and mortality. Rankings of the 100 largest PCI and non-PCI hospitals were assessed with and without atherosclerosis adjustment. Patients admitted to PCI hospitals or receiving interventional cardiology more frequently had an atherosclerosis diagnosis. In adjustment models, atherosclerosis was associated, implausibly, with a 42% reduction in odds of mortality (odds ratio = 0.58, P < 0.0001). Without adjustment for atherosclerosis, the number of expected lives saved by PCI hospitals increased by 62% (P < 0.001). Hospital rankings also changed: 72 of the 100 largest PCI hospitals had better ranks without atherosclerosis adjustment, while 77 of the largest non-PCI hospitals had worse ranks (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Atherosclerosis is almost always noted in patients with AMI who undergo interventional cardiology, but less often in medically managed patients. Therefore, adjustment for its notation likely removes part of the effect of interventional treatment.

### Blood monocyte transcriptome and epigenome analyses reveal loci associated with human atherosclerosis [^1172Rj1F]. Nature Communications (2017). Low credibility.

Little is known regarding the epigenetic basis of atherosclerosis. Here, we present the CD14+ blood monocyte transcriptome and epigenome signatures associated with human atherosclerosis. The transcriptome signature includes transcription coactivator ARID5B, which is known to form a chromatin derepressor complex with a histone H3K9Me2-specific demethylase and promote adipogenesis and smooth muscle development. ARID5B CpG (cg25953130) methylation is inversely associated with both ARID5B expression and atherosclerosis, consistent with this CpG residing in an ARID5B enhancer region, based on chromatin capture and histone marks data. Mediation analysis supports assumptions that ARID5B expression mediates effects of cg25953130 methylation and several cardiovascular disease risk factors on atherosclerotic burden.

In lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human THP1 monocytes, ARID5B knockdown reduced expression of genes involved in atherosclerosis-related inflammatory and lipid metabolism pathways and inhibited cell migration and phagocytosis. These data suggest that ARID5B expression, possibly regulated by an epigenetically controlled enhancer, promotes atherosclerosis by dysregulating immunometabolism towards a chronic inflammatory phenotype. The molecular mechanisms mediating the impact of environmental factors in atherosclerosis are unclear. Here, the authors examine CD14+ blood monocyte's transcriptome and epigenome signatures to find differential methylation and expression of ARID5B to be associated with human atherosclerosis.

### Imaging atherosclerosis [^112QwwXr]. Circulation Research (2016). Low credibility.

In a new era of precision, personalized medicine, the diagnostic power of emerging atherosclerosis imaging methods will undoubtedly influence our approach to patient care and help drive cardiovascular research to better understand disease mechanisms and test new treatments in the pipeline. With evolving technology and innovation, patient-specific multimodal imaging strategies can be tailored to reveal molecular signals with anatomic precision, while integrating data on plaque composition and local hemodynamics with markers of overall disease burden. This allows a move away from a plaque-centric approach toward a greater appreciation of the complexities underpinning the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

### Lescol [^1146SdzK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011). Low credibility.

Lescol significantly slowed the progression of coronary atherosclerosis. Compared to placebo, Lescol significantly slowed the progression of lesions as measured by within-patient per-lesion change in minimum lumen diameter (MLD), the primary endpoint. This was demonstrated by percent diameter stenosis and the formation of new lesions, with 13% of all fluvastatin patients versus 22% of all placebo patients developing new lesions. Additionally, a significant difference in favor of Lescol was found between all fluvastatin and all placebo patients in the distribution among the three categories of definite progression, definite regression, and mixed or no change.

Beneficial angiographic results (change in MLD) were independent of patients' gender and consistent across a range of baseline LDL-C levels.

### Prevalence of angina pectoris and association with coronary atherosclerosis in a general population [^113quSbv]. Heart (2023). High credibility.

To assess the contemporary prevalence of and factors associated with angina pectoris symptoms, as well as to examine the relationship to coronary atherosclerosis in a middle-aged general population, data were drawn from the Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage Study (SCAPIS). In this study, 30,154 individuals were randomly recruited from the general population between 2013 and 2018. Participants who completed the Rose Angina Questionnaire were included and categorized as having angina or no angina. Subjects with a valid coronary CT angiography (CCTA) were classified by the degree of coronary atherosclerosis: ≥ 50% obstruction (obstructive coronary atherosclerosis), < 50% obstruction or any atheromatosis (non-obstructive coronary atherosclerosis), or none (no coronary atherosclerosis).

The study population included 28,974 questionnaire responders (median age 57.4 years, female 51.6%, hypertension 19.9%, hyperlipidaemia 7.9%, diabetes mellitus 3.7%), of which 1,025 (3.5%) fulfilled the criteria for angina. Coronary atherosclerosis was more prevalent in individuals with angina compared to those without angina (n = 24,602, obstructive coronary atherosclerosis 11.8% vs. 5.4%, non-obstructive coronary atherosclerosis 38.9% vs. 37.0%, no coronary atherosclerosis 49.4% vs. 57.7%, all p < 0.001). Independently associated factors with angina included being born outside of Sweden (OR 2.58, 95% CI 2.10 to 2.92), low educational level (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.79), unemployment (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.81), poor economic status (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.47), and symptoms of depression (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.92).

### Angiotensinogen suppression: A new tool to treat cardiovascular and renal disease [^116pLq27]. Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

Atherosclerosis is a chronic, progressive disease characterized by lipid-laden macrophage and other leukocyte accumulation in lesions. The contribution of the RAS to atherosclerosis has been consistently demonstrated; ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduce lesion size and improve cardiovascular outcomes in both human studies and animal models. Although the whole-body AGT-deficient mouse was developed in the early 1990s, its severe growth and kidney development impairments impeded its use for atherosclerosis studies.

An earlier study reported that leukocytes synthesize AGT. Although macrophages are the major cell type accumulated in mouse atherosclerotic lesions, bone-marrow transplantation of AGT-deficient leukocytes did not reduce hypercholesterolemia-induced atherosclerosis in LDL (low-density lipoprotein) receptor −/− mice, suggesting that leukocyte-derived AGT does not affect atherosclerosis. In contrast to the lack of effect of AGT in leukocytes, whole-body reduction of AGT in an AGT hypomorphic mouse model led to profound decreases in hypercholesterolemia-induced atherosclerosis, supporting that inhibition of AGT protects against atherosclerosis. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of AGT diminished atherosclerosis in LDL receptor −/− mice fed a Western diet. Identical results were obtained with a liver-targeted AGT ASO (authors' unpublished data). Collectively, these data from both genetic and pharmacological studies support the beneficial effects of selectively inhibiting liver AGT against atherosclerosis.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus and cardiovascular disease [^117Sv87H]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Atherosclerosis is likely not solely a modern phenomenon related to increasing lifespan and a sedentary lifestyle, even though it is much more pronounced now. The presence of atherosclerosis in ancient Egyptian mummies has been known for a long time. Another interesting example is Ötzi, who was found in South Tyrol and died 5300 years ago, apparently shot with an arrow, which caused his death. His arteries showed signs of atherosclerosis and calcification. Though interesting, he seems to have had a genetic predisposition to atherosclerosis. Further evidence that atherosclerosis could be a feature of natural aging and immunosenescence comes from studies of hunter-gatherers in which atherosclerosis has been detected.

Given the topic of this review, it is interesting to note that the accumulation of dead cells in atherosclerotic plaques is a hallmark of this disease condition, which could be described as dysfunctional clearance of dead cells. Further, OxLDL is a major factor in atherosclerosis and, like dead cells, accumulates in plaques and is increased in SLE. In addition, atherosclerosis, like SLE, is a chronic inflammatory condition.

While it has been clear for a long time that the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is increased in SLE, the underlying causes have been debated, especially if atherosclerosis, the major cause of CVD in the general population, is implicated in SLE. It is often assumed that atherosclerosis is accelerated in SLE, as noted in a recent review. Like CVD in SLE, atherosclerosis in SLE is generally likely to be related to…

### High-sensitivity C-reactive protein at different stages of atherosclerosis: results of the INVADE study [^111TWW2c]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Evidence on the role of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) at different stages of atherosclerosis is limited. We therefore analyzed the relationship between hsCRP and measures of subclinical and advanced atherosclerosis in a population-based sample of the INVADE study (n = 3,092, > 55 years). The parameters of interest were IMT, ABI, and the stage of atherosclerosis. Differences between participants with normal and pathological hsCRP were analyzed by t-test for independent samples or Fisher's exact test. Differences of hsCRP between IMT quartiles, ABI quartiles, and different stages of atherosclerosis were analyzed by one-way ANOVA.

The adjusted stepwise multiple linear regression analysis (IMT and ABI) and adjusted analysis of variance (stage of atherosclerosis) were performed, including significant baseline parameters as covariates. ANOVA showed significant differences of hsCRP among IMT quartiles, ABI quartiles, and patients with and without atherosclerosis. The adjusted analyses confirmed that the effects of IMT, ABI, and atherosclerosis on hsCRP were independent from other significant baseline parameters but did not yield a significant difference between subclinical and advanced stages of atherosclerosis.

The present analysis indicates an independent relationship between hsCRP and both IMT and ABI as measures of subclinical atherosclerosis. The comparison of subclinical and advanced stages of atherosclerosis yielded no significant difference, indicating that hsCRP is sensitive to identify vascular risk patients but not suited to monitor the progression of the disease.

### Niacor [^111nPgaa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The Cholesterol-Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, angiographic trial that tested combined colestipol and nicotinic acid therapy in 162 non-smoking males with previous coronary bypass surgery. The primary cardiac endpoint was the global coronary artery change score per subject. After two years, 61% of patients in the placebo cohort showed disease progression by global change score (N = 82) compared to only 38.8% of drug-treated subjects (N = 80), when both native arteries and grafts were considered (p < 0.005). In a follow-up to this trial in a subgroup of 103 patients treated for four years, significantly fewer patients in the drug-treated group demonstrated progression than in the placebo cohort (48% versus 85%, respectively; p < 0.0001).

The Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS) in 146 men aged 62 and younger with apolipoprotein B levels ≥ 125 mg/dL, established coronary artery disease, and family histories of vascular disease, assessed change in severity of disease in the proximal coronary arteries by quantitative arteriography. Patients received dietary counseling and were randomized to treatment with either conventional therapy with double placebo (or placebo plus colestipol if the LDL cholesterol was elevated); lovastatin plus colestipol; or nicotinic acid plus colestipol. In the conventional therapy group, 46% of patients had disease progression (and no regression) in at least one of nine proximal coronary segments. In contrast, progression (as the only change) was seen in only 25% in the nicotinic acid plus colestipol group.

### The role of mitochondrial DNA mutations and free radicals in disease and ageing [^116CwgTn]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

An overview of the evolution of the mitochondrial theories of ageing reveals that common human diseases, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and various forms of neurodegeneration, are often associated with age. Thus, ageing is a main risk factor for many diseases, and an understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving the ageing process may lead to new insights into the pathophysiology of such diseases. Why and how do we age? The causes of normal ageing are likely to be multifactorial, with no single mechanism able to explain all aspects. A detailed analysis of the numerous theories of ageing is beyond the scope of this review, and we will focus on the role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in ageing.

We will describe the basic principles of the mitochondrial theory of ageing and how it has evolved over the past decades. New concepts have recently emerged concerning the role of ROS in cellular function and ageing. Furthermore, we will discuss the possible reasons why intervention studies to reduce ROS levels in both humans and animal models have generated different and often inconclusive results concerning the role of oxidative stress in age-dependent human pathologies.

- **Free radical theory of ageing**: In the 1950s, Harman proposed the free radical theory of ageing, which postulated that the production of intracellular ROS and its deleterious effects on various cellular components was the major determinant of lifespan. This landmark theory initiated the molecular era of ageing research.

### Atherosclerosis: Multiple pathways to lesional macrophages [^113Tgcr9]. Science Translational Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that manifests in multiple vascular beds and frequently culminates in ischemic events, including myocardial infarction. Blood monocytes that are recruited to the inflamed vascular wall develop into inflammatory macrophages and foam cells, which contribute to pathogenesis at many stages of this disease and, therefore, represent a target for therapeutic interventions. Recently, alternate sources of macrophages have been identified. Here, we discuss the origin and molecular regulation of macrophages and highlight recent conceptual changes that may shape the development of effective treatments.

A report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines, and the American Stroke Association, American Association of Neuroscience Nurses, American Association of Neurological Surgeons, American College of Radiology, American Society of Neuroradiology, Congress of Neurological Surgeons, Society of Atherosclerosis Imaging and Prevention, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, Society of Interventional Radiology, Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery, Society for Vascular Medicine, and Society for Vascular Surgery [^1162rCXC]. Circulation (2011). High credibility.

In regard to nonpharmacologic interventions for carotid artery stenosis, particularly lifestyle modifications, the 2011 guidelines from AANN/AANS/ACC/ACR/AHA/ASA/ASNR/CNS/SAIP/SCAI/SIR/SNIS/SVM/SVS recommend advising patients with extracranial carotid artery atherosclerosis to quit smoking, if applicable. Additionally, they suggest offering smoking cessation interventions to reduce the risks of atherosclerosis progression and stroke.

### Immunopeptidomics analysis of human atherosclerosis plaques identifies antigenic drivers of atherosclerosis [^111jKFGi]. Atherosclerosis (2025). High credibility.

Atherosclerosis has an autoimmune component driven by self-reactive T and B cells. Identifying their antigenic drivers may lead to new diagnostic and treatment approaches. Here, we aim to identify immunogenic T cell epitopes derived from atherosclerosis-relevant proteins such as ApoB100 by studying the repertoire of peptides presented by HLA in human plaques.

- **Methods**: We used immunopeptidomics to identify peptides presented by HLA-DR molecules from plaques of patients that underwent endarterectomy surgery. We selected a set of 20 peptides derived from ApoB100 and studied the presence and cytokine profile of ApoB100-specific CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from atherosclerosis patients.

- **Results**: The study revealed significant CD4+ T cell activation in response to these ApoB100 peptides in 22–39% of the patients, and this T cell response correlated positively with plaque vulnerability. These cells were characterized by the production of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.

- **Conclusion**: We show that immunopeptidomics can be a valid approach to discover new antigens in atherosclerosis.

### Advanced atherosclerosis is associated with increased medial degeneration in sporadic ascending aortic aneurysms [^111CMFgS]. Atherosclerosis (2014). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of non-familial, sporadic ascending aortic aneurysms (SAAA) is poorly understood, and the relationship between ascending aortic atherosclerosis and medial degeneration is unclear. We evaluated the prevalence and severity of aortic atherosclerosis and its association with medial degeneration in SAAA.

- **Methods and results**: Atherosclerosis was characterized in ascending aortic tissues collected from 68 SAAA patients (mean age, 62.9 ± 12.0 years) and 15 controls (mean age, 56.6 ± 11.4 years [P = 0.07]) using a modified American Heart Association classification system. Upon histologic examination, 97% of SAAA patients and 73% of controls showed atherosclerotic changes. Most SAAA samples had intermediate (types 2 and 3, 35%) or advanced atherosclerosis (types ≥ 4; 40%), whereas most control samples showed minimal atherosclerosis (none or type 1, 80%; P < 0.001 after adjusting for age). In a separate analysis, the total incidence and grade distribution of medial degenerative changes among SAAA samples were examined according to atherosclerosis grade. Advanced atherosclerosis was associated with higher grades of smooth muscle cell depletion (P < 0.001), elastic fiber depletion (P = 0.02), elastic fiber fragmentation (P < 0.001), and mucopolysaccharide accumulation (P = 0.04). Aortic diameter was larger in SAAA patients with advanced atherosclerosis than in patients with minimal (P = 0.04) or intermediate atherosclerosis (P = 0.04). Immunostaining showed marked CD3+ T-cell and CD68+ macrophage infiltration, MMP-2 and MMP-9 production, and cryopyrin expression.

### Vascepa [^116pQiZM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The REDUCE-IT trial (NCT01492361) was a multinational, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, event-driven study. It involved 8,179 statin-treated adult patients (4,089 receiving Vascepa and 4,090 receiving placebo) with LDL-C levels > 40 mg/dL and ≤ 100 mg/dL, and elevated triglycerides (90% with TG ≥ 150 mg/dL and < 500 mg/dL). Participants had either established cardiovascular disease (71%) or diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors (29%).

### Intracranial atherosclerotic burden on 7T MRI is associated with markers of extracranial atherosclerosis: The SMART-MR study [^1121jBEq]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2019). Low credibility.

Intracranial atherosclerosis, a major risk factor for ischemic stroke, is thought to have different atherogenic mechanisms than extracranial atherosclerosis. Studies investigating their relationship in vivo are sparse and report inconsistent results. We studied the relationship between intracranial atherosclerosis and extracranial atherosclerosis in a cohort of patients with a history of vascular disease.

Within the Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease-Magnetic Resonance (SMART) study, cross-sectional analyses were performed in 130 patients (mean age, 68 ± 9 years) with a history of vascular disease and with assessable 7T intracranial vessel wall MR imaging data. Intracranial atherosclerosis burden was defined as the number of intracranial vessel wall lesions in the circle of Willis and its major branches. Age- and sex-adjusted unstandardized regression coefficients (b-value) were calculated with intracranial atherosclerosis burden as the dependent variable and extracranial atherosclerosis markers as independent variables.

Ninety-six percent of patients had ≥ 1 vessel wall lesion, with a mean intracranial atherosclerosis burden of 8.5 ± 5.7 lesions. Significant associations were observed between higher intracranial atherosclerosis burden and carotid intima-media thickness (b = 0.53 lesions per +0.1 mm; 95% CI, 0.1–1.0 lesions), 50%-100% carotid stenosis versus no stenosis (b = 6.6 lesions; 95% CI, 2.3–10.9 lesions), ankle-brachial index ≤ 0.9 versus > 0.9 (b = 4.9 lesions; 95% CI, 1.7–8.0 lesions).

### A review on coronary artery disease, its risk factors, and therapeutics [^117C3WFo]. Journal of Cellular Physiology (2019). High credibility.

Coronary artery disease can be associated with various risk factors and symptoms, including dyslipidemia, chest tightness, lack of exercise, and obesity. Other associated conditions include myocardial infarction, chest pain radiating to shoulders or arms, dyspepsia, and cigarette smoking. Hypertension, abdominal pain, metabolic syndrome, regional wall motion abnormality, and chest pain are common indicators. The disease often affects elderly age groups and is characterized by atherosclerotic disease and diagonal earlobe crease.

Additional symptoms may include lightheadedness, diabetes mellitus, Wellens' sign, heart failure (HF), nausea, chest pain radiating to the neck or jaw, and chest pain on exertion. Peripheral artery disease (PAD), sweats, epigastric abdominal pain, dyspnea, perfusion deficit, depression, abnormal exercise ECG, and fatigue are also significant considerations in the diagnosis and management of the disease.

### NT-proBNP levels, atherosclerosis and vascular function in asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria: Peripheral reactive hyperaemia index but not NT-proBNP is an independent predictor of coronary atherosclerosis [^112yUipA]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Our observed prevalences of coronary and peripheral artery disease were higher (34% and 20%) than previously reported (19% and 15%) in asymptomatic but less complicated diabetics [32, 33]. Age was an independent determinant of coronary atherosclerosis, and, as also found in our study, diabetes duration is a known determinant of peripheral artery disease. Our patients with peripheral atherosclerosis had an independently increased risk of coronary atherosclerosis and vice versa. Autopsy studies in the general population have demonstrated a close relationship between the presence of atherosclerosis in the three vascular territories [35, 36], but in accordance with a recent study, a high percentage of our patients (56/85 = 66%, Figure 1) with coronary, carotid, and/or peripheral atherosclerosis demonstrated exclusively one diseased vascular territory. Therefore, these relationships were not strong enough to examine only one artery territory and then identify all cases with atherosclerosis in the different territories.

- **Vascular function**: Peripheral pulse pressure wave augmentation and carotid compliance were not associated with NT-proBNP or CCS, CIMT, and PAD. Noteworthy, we found that a low RHI determined by peripheral artery tonometry was an independent predictor of coronary atherosclerosis, and the RHI has been shown to be positively correlated with the endothelium-dependent coronary flow reserve. In the latter study, an RHI cut-off value of < 1.35, comparable to RHI ≤ 1.43 used in the study, was particularly useful for determination of patients with coronary microvascular en.

### Mechanisms of vascular aging [^113gxEm9]. Circulation Research (2018). Low credibility.

Aging of the vasculature plays a central role in the morbidity and mortality of older people. To develop novel treatments for ameliorating unsuccessful vascular aging and preventing age-related vascular pathologies, it is essential to understand the cellular and functional changes that occur in the vasculature during aging. In this review, the pathophysiological roles of fundamental cellular and molecular mechanisms of aging — such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired resistance to molecular stressors, chronic low-grade inflammation, genomic instability, cellular senescence, epigenetic alterations, loss of protein homeostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, and stem cell dysfunction in the vascular system — are considered in terms of their contribution to the pathogenesis of both microvascular and macrovascular diseases associated with old age. The importance of progeronic and antigeronic circulating factors in relation to the development of vascular aging phenotypes is discussed. Finally, future directions and opportunities to develop novel interventions to prevent or delay age-related vascular pathologies by targeting fundamental cellular and molecular aging processes are presented.

### The vascular biology of atherosclerosis and imaging targets [^112qYu8a]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The growing worldwide health challenge of atherosclerosis, together with advances in imaging technologies, has stimulated considerable interest in novel approaches to gauging this disease. Over the last several decades, there has been a burgeoning understanding of the molecular pathways involved in atherogenesis, lesion progression, and the mechanisms underlying the complications of human atherosclerotic plaques. The imaging of atherosclerosis is extending beyond anatomy to include assessment of aspects of plaque biology related to the pathogenesis and complications of the disease. Harnessing these biological insights promises to provide a plethora of new targets for molecular imaging of atherosclerosis. The goals for the years to come must include translating experimental work into the visualization of these appealing biological targets in humans.

### Lovastatin [^113y8XTG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In the Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS), either lovastatin or niacin, in combination with a bile acid sequestrant for 2.5 years in hyperlipidemic subjects, significantly reduced the frequency of progression and increased the frequency of regression of coronary atherosclerotic lesions by QCA compared to diet and, in some cases, low-dose resin.

The effect of lovastatin on the progression of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries has been corroborated by similar findings in another vasculature. In the Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Progression Study (ACAPS), the effect of therapy with lovastatin on carotid atherosclerosis was assessed by B-mode ultrasonography in hyperlipidemic patients with early carotid lesions and without known coronary heart disease at baseline. In this double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 919 patients were randomized in a 2 x 2 factorial design to placebo, lovastatin 10 to 40 mg daily, and/or warfarin. Ultrasonograms of the carotid walls were used to determine the change per patient from baseline to three years in mean maximum intimal-medial thickness (IMT) of 12 measured segments. There was a significant regression of carotid lesions in patients receiving lovastatin alone compared to those receiving placebo alone (p = 0.001). The predictive value of changes in IMT for stroke has not yet been established. In the lovastatin group, there was a significant reduction in the number of patients with major cardiovascular events relative to the placebo group (5 vs. 14) and a significant reduction in all-cause mortality (1 vs. 8).

### Low-density lipoproteins cause atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: Pathophysiological, genetic, and therapeutic insights: A consensus statement from the European Atherosclerosis Society Consensus Panel [^114utqUe]. European Heart Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) originates early, even in childhood. Non-invasive imaging in the PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) study revealed that 71% of middle-aged men and 43% of women have evidence of subclinical atherosclerosis. Extensive evidence from epidemiologic, genetic, and clinical intervention studies has indisputably shown that low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is causal in ASCVD, as summarized in the first consensus statement on this topic. What are the key biological mechanisms, however, that underlie the central role of LDL in the complex pathophysiology of ASCVD, a chronic and multifaceted lifelong disease process, ultimately culminating in an atherothrombotic event?

This second consensus statement on LDL causality discusses the established and newly emerging biology of ASCVD at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels, emphasizing integration of the central pathophysiological mechanisms. Key components of this integrative approach include consideration of factors that modulate the atherogenicity of LDL at the arterial wall and downstream effects exerted by LDL particles on the atherogenic process within arterial tissue.

### Altoprev [^112ixiUw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Atherosclerosis was studied in the Canadian Coronary Atherosclerosis Intervention Trial (CCAIT), where the effects of lovastatin immediate-release therapy on coronary atherosclerosis were assessed using coronary angiography in hyperlipidemic patients. In this randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial, patients received conventional measures, typically a diet and 325 mg of aspirin every other day, along with either lovastatin immediate-release at doses ranging from 20 mg to 80 mg daily or a placebo. It is important to note that the 80 mg dose is not approved for Altoprev [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Angiograms were evaluated at baseline and two years using computerized quantitative coronary angiography (QCA).

Lovastatin immediate-release therapy significantly slowed the progression of lesions, as measured by the mean change per patient in minimum lumen diameter (the primary endpoint) and percent diameter stenosis. Furthermore, the treatment decreased the proportion of patients categorized with disease progression (33% versus 50%) and those with new lesions (16% versus 32%).

### Macrophages in atherosclerosis regression [^113TzQGe]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Macrophages and regression**: The role of macrophages in the regression of atherosclerosis has become a significant focus in cardiovascular research. This study examines how macrophages contribute to the regression phase and the underlying mechanisms that facilitate this process.

- **Study findings**: Researchers have identified several key factors that influence macrophage behavior in the regression of atherosclerosis. These include the modulation of inflammatory pathways, lipid metabolism, and the clearance of apoptotic cells. Understanding these factors can help develop better therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular diseases.

This research paves the way for future investigations into macrophage-targeted therapies, which may offer new hope for patients suffering from atherosclerosis.

### Lovastatin [^115j3WAf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In the Canadian Coronary Atherosclerosis Intervention Trial (CCAIT), the effect of therapy with lovastatin on coronary atherosclerosis was assessed by coronary angiography in hyperlipidemic patients. In the randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial, patients were treated with conventional measures (usually diet and 325 mg of aspirin every other day) and either lovastatin (20 to 80 mg daily) or placebo. Angiograms were evaluated at baseline and at two years by computerized quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). Lovastatin significantly slowed the progression of lesions as measured by the mean change per patient in minimum lumen diameter (the primary endpoint) and percent diameter stenosis. It also decreased the proportions of patients categorized with disease progression (33% vs. 50%) and with new lesions (16% vs. 32%).

In a similarly designed trial, the Monitored Atherosclerosis Regression Study (MARS), patients were treated with diet and either lovastatin (80 mg daily) or placebo. No statistically significant difference between lovastatin and placebo was seen for the primary endpoint (mean change per patient in percent diameter stenosis of all lesions), or for most secondary QCA endpoints. Visual assessment by angiographers, who formed a consensus opinion of overall angiographic change (Global Change Score), was also a secondary endpoint. By this endpoint, significant slowing of disease was seen, with regression in 23% of patients treated with lovastatin compared to 11% of placebo patients.

### Targeting oxidative stress in disease: promise and limitations of antioxidant therapy [^1132uqJ1]. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery (2021). Low credibility.

Oxidative stress is a component of many diseases, including atherosclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimer disease, and cancer. Although numerous small molecules evaluated as antioxidants have exhibited therapeutic potential in preclinical studies, clinical trial results have been disappointing. A greater understanding of the mechanisms through which antioxidants act, and where and when they are effective, may provide a rational approach that leads to greater pharmacological success. Here, we review the relationships between oxidative stress, redox signalling, and disease; the mechanisms through which oxidative stress can contribute to pathology; how antioxidant defences work; what limits their effectiveness; and how antioxidant defences can be increased through physiological signalling, dietary components, and potential pharmaceutical intervention.

### Lypqozet [^113t1EWx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of total-C, LDL-C, and Apo B, the major protein constituent of LDL, promote human atherosclerosis. In addition, decreased levels of HDL-C are associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Epidemiologic studies have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of total-C and LDL-C and inversely with the level of HDL-C. Like LDL, cholesterol-enriched triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, including very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), and remnants, can also promote atherosclerosis. The independent effect of raising HDL-C or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

Atorvastatin, as well as some of its metabolites, are pharmacologically active in humans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of cholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage, rather than systemic drug concentration, correlates better with LDL-C reduction. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on therapeutic response [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

- **Pharmacokinetics**: LYPQOZET has been shown to be bioequivalent to the coadministration of corresponding doses of ezetimibe and atorvastatin tablets.

	- **Absorption**:

		- **Ezetimibe**: After oral administration, ezetimibe is absorbed and extensively conjugated to a pharmacologically active phenolic glucuronide (ezetimibe-glucuronide).

### Iron toxicity in diseases of aging: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and atherosclerosis [^117AXrck]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Excess free iron generates oxidative stress that hallmarks diseases of aging. The observation that patients with Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease show a dramatic increase in their brain iron content has opened the possibility that disturbances in brain iron homeostasis may contribute to the pathogenesis of these disorders. While the reason for iron accumulation is unknown, iron localization correlates with the production of reactive oxygen species in those areas of the brain that are prone to neurodegeneration. A role for iron is also proposed in atherosclerosis, a further frequent disorder of aging. We will review experimental evidence for an involvement of iron in these diseases and discuss some mouse models with impairment in iron-related genes that may be useful to study the role of iron in these disorders.

### TRAP1 drives smooth muscle cell senescence and promotes atherosclerosis via HDAC3-primed histone H4 lysine 12 lactylation [^111Rnc6C]. European Heart Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) senescence is crucial for the development of atherosclerosis, characterized by metabolic abnormalities. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1), a metabolic regulator associated with aging, might be implicated in atherosclerosis. As the role of TRAP1 in atherosclerosis remains elusive, this study aimed to examine the function of TRAP1 in VSMC senescence and atherosclerosis.

- **Methods**: TRAP1 expression was measured in the aortic tissues of patients and mice with atherosclerosis using western blot and RT-qPCR. Senescent VSMC models were established by oncogenic Ras, and cellular senescence was evaluated by measuring senescence-associated β-galactosidase expression and other senescence markers. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis was performed to explore the potential role of TRAP1 in atherosclerosis.

- **Results**: VSMC-specific TRAP1 deficiency mitigated VSMC senescence and atherosclerosis via metabolic reprogramming. Mechanistically, TRAP1 significantly increased aerobic glycolysis, leading to elevated lactate production. Accumulated lactate promoted histone H4 lysine 12 lactylation (H4K12la) by down-regulating the unique histone lysine delactylase HDAC3. H4K12la was enriched in the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) promoter, activating SASP transcription and exacerbating VSMC senescence. In VSMC-specific Trap1 knockout ApoeKO mice (ApoeKOTrap1SMCKO), the plaque area, senescence markers, H4K12la, and SASP were reduced. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition and proteolysis-tar

### Coronary atherosclerosis in middle-aged athletes: Current insights, burning questions, and future perspectives [^111avJQQ]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Are athletes immune to coronary atherosclerosis? The development and progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are significantly influenced by lifestyle factors, including physical activity and nutrition. It has been suggested that atherosclerosis is primarily a disease of modern society due to the prevalence of physical inactivity and atherogenic diets. However, computed tomography (CT) scans of mummies from ancient Egypt revealed that 20 out of 44 mummies (45%) had atherosclerosis at an estimated age of 45 ± 9 years. Of those mummies, two had definite coronary atherosclerosis, marking the earliest documentation of the condition.

A postmortem pathology study from 1960 investigated coronary atherosclerosis in men aged 30 to 60 years who died suddenly from accidents, homicide, or suicide. Participants in the study were classified as either sedentary (e.g. accountant, bank clerk, and chauffeur) or physically active (e.g. construction worker, gardener, and plumber) based on their occupational history. Surprisingly, a similar degree of coronary atherosclerosis was found among both sedentary and physically active groups, suggesting that the development of coronary atherosclerosis was not associated with habitual physical activity.

In 1977, Bassler described a case series of runners who had died. Autopsy reports interestingly revealed that none of the marathon runners had died of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, suggesting that marathon runners might be immune to coronary atherosclerosis. This potential immunity was attributed to their avoidance of tobacco smoking, adherence to healthy diets, and covering significant distances on foot.

### NAD metabolism regulates proliferation of macrophages in atherosclerosis [^114VNRtf]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2025). Low credibility.

In genetic studies with the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel, we previously identified a chromosome 9 locus for atherosclerosis. We now identify NNMT (nicotinamide N-methyltransferase), an enzyme that degrades nicotinamide, as the causal gene in the locus, showing that the underlying mechanism involves salvage of nicotinamide to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD).

- **Methods**: Gain/loss of function studies in macrophages were performed to examine the role of NAD levels in macrophage proliferation and apoptosis in atherosclerosis.

- **Results**: Global inhibition of NNMT using an antisense oligonucleotide reduced atherosclerosis lesion area 5- to 10-fold in both male and female mice on a hyperlipidemic background. Selective inhibition of NNMT in liver and adipose, the major tissues expressing high levels of the enzyme, using siRNA, had little or no effect on atherosclerosis. Therefore, we hypothesized that levels of NAD in macrophages might contribute, which was confirmed by showing that transplantation with bone marrow from Nnmt knockout mice resulted in reduced lesional macrophage proliferation, increased macrophage apoptosis, and reduced atherosclerosis. Consistent with this conclusion, reduced expression of macrophage CD38, an enzyme that degrades NAD, reduced both macrophage proliferation and atherosclerosis. Moreover, cultured macrophages from heterozygous Nnmt knockout mice exhibited reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis, and an increased NAD/NADH ratio.

These findings reveal a role for nicotinamide salvage and NAD turnover in macrophage proliferation.

### Carotid atherosclerosis in predicting coronary artery disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115XHocy]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2021). Low credibility.

The study examines the role of carotid atherosclerosis as a predictive factor for coronary artery disease.

- **Methodology**: The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the correlation between carotid atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. Various databases were searched for relevant studies, and the results were pooled to determine the overall effect.

- **Findings**: The meta-analysis revealed that carotid atherosclerosis is a significant predictor of coronary artery disease, highlighting its potential use in early diagnosis and prevention strategies.

- **Conclusion**: The findings suggest that assessing carotid atherosclerosis can aid in predicting coronary artery disease risk, though further exploration and higher-quality studies are needed to solidify these results.

### Low-density lipoproteins cause atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Evidence from genetic, epidemiologic, and clinical studies. A consensus statement from the European Atherosclerosis Society Consensus Panel [^1159Hda1]. European Heart Journal (2017). High credibility.

The pathophysiology of atherosclerosis involves key events in the initiation of ASCVD, which are characterized by the retention and accumulation of cholesterol-rich apoB-containing lipoproteins within the arterial intima at sites predisposed to plaque formation. Notably, LDL and other apoB-containing lipoproteins that are less than 70 nm in diameter (including VLDL, their remnants, IDL, and Lp(a)) efficiently enter and exit the arterial intima.

At what is now considered physiologically relevant levels of LDL cholesterol [LDL-C; approximately 0.5–1.0 mmol/L (20–40 mg/dL), typical of newborns and a wide range of mammalian species], the probability of LDL particle retention and the risk of developing atherosclerosis is low. However, as the concentration of LDL-C increases above this level, the probability of intimal retention of LDL, leading to the initiation and progressive development of atherosclerotic plaque, increases in a dose-dependent manner.

This topic will be discussed in detail in the second consensus statement on this topic.

### Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis [^112EcsMb]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Atherosclerosis is no longer considered a disorder due to abnormalities in lipid metabolism. The inciting event of atherosclerosis is likely an inflammatory insult that occurs decades before the disease becomes clinically apparent. Rapidly evolving knowledge of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, coupled with novel, target-specific therapies, is revolutionizing the treatment of atherosclerosis.

As a result, a variety of treatments are now undergoing evaluation for their ability to ameliorate the inflammatory pathways likely to cause the atherosclerotic process to initiate and propagate. Once initiated, atherosclerosis progresses as a result of a well-studied series of changes in the constituent cellular make-up of the vessel wall. Specific cytokine-mediated events in this cycle are required for lesional growth.

The clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis occur so late in this process that interventions such as percutaneous coronary interventions can deal with isolated areas of disease; however, they do not influence the underlying disease process.

### Monocyte fate in atherosclerosis [^113yD2om]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

Monocytes and their descendant macrophages are essential to the development and exacerbation of atherosclerosis, a lipid-driven inflammatory disease. Lipid-laden macrophages, known as foam cells, reside in early lesions and advanced atheromata. Our understanding of how monocytes accumulate in the growing lesion, differentiate, ingest lipids, and contribute to disease has advanced substantially over the last several years. These cells' remarkable phenotypic and functional complexity present a therapeutic opportunity: in the future, treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease and its complications may involve specific targeting of atherogenic monocytes/macrophages and their products.

### The coexistence of carotid and lower extremity atherosclerosis further increases cardio-cerebrovascular risk in type 2 diabetes [^115z284y]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Both carotid and femoral atherosclerosis have been supported as potential predictors of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in different populations. At present, most studies focus on the associations of carotid atherosclerosis with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risks. However, investigations into the relationships between the concomitant presence of carotid and lower extremity atherosclerosis and cardio-cerebrovascular risk are extremely scarce in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Therefore, we conducted this cross-sectional study to assess the association between the concomitant presences of carotid and lower extremity atherosclerosis and cardio-cerebrovascular events (CCBVEs), as well as self-reported cardio-cerebrovascular diseases (CCBVDs), in Chinese hospitalized type 2 diabetics. Our results strongly indicate that patients with atherosclerosis have a remarkably higher risk of CCBVEs and self-reported CCBVDs than those without atherosclerosis, even after adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors. Most importantly, the coexistence of carotid and lower extremity atherosclerosis further increases the risk of CCBVEs and self-reported CCBVDs in type 2 diabetes.

Consistent with other studies, we also found that the prevalence of CCBVEs and self-reported CCBVDs in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients successively increased with age and duration of diabetes. Several studies reported that men have a higher risk of coronary heart disease, whereas women have a greater propensity for developing stroke. On the contrary, we found that there was no significant gender difference in the prevalence of CCBVEs and self-reported CCBVDs.

### Convergence of atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease: Inflammation, cholesterol, and misfolded proteins [^112jNMft]. Lancet (2004). Low credibility.

Late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease is a heterogeneous disorder. In elderly patients, increasing evidence suggests a link between this neurodegenerative disease and vascular risk factors, as well as atherosclerosis. The nature of this link remains speculative. Some investigators have proposed that the disease arises as a secondary event related to atherosclerosis of extracranial or intracranial vessels. A toxic effect of vascular factors on the microvasculature of susceptible brain regions has also been argued. An alternative explanation is that atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease are independent but convergent disease processes. This hypothesis is supported by observations of shared epidemiology, pathophysiological elements, and responses to treatment in both disorders. It provides a potential framework for an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, especially in elderly patients with vascular risk factors, and offers some promise toward the search for preventive and therapeutic treatments.

### Arterial inflammation and atherosclerosis [^115Jsw2c]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Arterial inflammation is a significant component of atherosclerotic disease, and it has been suggested that specific immune responses directed against autoantigens or pathogen-derived antigens presented in the vascular wall could initiate and/or maintain atherosclerotic processes. Atherogenic cofactors, such as altered cholesterol metabolism, may not only impact locally on inflammatory responses in atherosclerotic lesions but may also alter general immune-responsiveness. The evidence at the time of writing suggests that the mutual chronic perpetuation of immune-mediated vascular inflammation and cholesterol-induced atherosclerosis is a key step in atherogenesis.

### Nexlizet [^114R1S12]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In a cardiovascular outcomes trial, an investigation was conducted on adults with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or at high risk for CVD. Trial 4 (NCT02993406) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven trial involving 13,970 adult patients. Among these, 70% had established CVD, while 30% were at high risk for a CVD event but did not have CVD. These patients were not receiving the recommended statin dosages.

Patients with established CVD had a documented history of coronary artery disease, symptomatic peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular atherosclerotic disease. Those without established CVD were considered at high risk based on the following criteria:

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Type 1 or type 2 in females over 65 years of age or males over 60 years of age.
- **Risk scores**: A Reynolds Risk score > 30% or a SCORE Risk score > 7.5% over 10 years. The Reynolds Risk Score evaluates a 10-year risk of having a cardiovascular (CV) event based on factors such as sex, age, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and a familial history of CVD events. LDL-C is an additional risk factor considered in the SCORE Risk Score.
- **Coronary artery calcium score**: Above 400 Agatston units at any time in the past.

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either oral bempedoic acid 180 mg per day (n = 6,992) or placebo (n = 6,978), alone or as an add-on to other background lipid-lowering therapies. Background therapy could include statin dosages of less than low-intensity. Overall, 95.3% of adult patients were followed successfully throughout the trial.

This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in patients with evidence or a history of atherosclerosis involving the coronary (spontaneous myocardial infarction [MI] 2 weeks to 12 months prior), cerebral (ischemic stroke), or peripheral vascular (documented peripheral arterial disease [PAD]) systems. Patients were randomized to receive daily treatment with Zontivity (n = 13,225) or placebo (n = 13,224), in addition to standard care.

The study's primary endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, and urgent coronary revascularization (UCR). The composite of cardiovascular death, MI, and stroke was assessed as a key secondary endpoint. The median follow-up was 2.5 years, with some patients followed for up to 4 years.

- **Findings for primary efficacy composite endpoint**: The 3-year Kaplan-Meier (K-M) event rate was 11.2% in the Zontivity group compared to 12.4% in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 0.95; p = 0.001).

- **Findings for key secondary efficacy endpoint**: The 3-year K-M event rate was 9.3% in the Zontivity group compared to 10.5% in the placebo group (HR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.94; p < 0.001).

### Oxidative stress and the use of antioxidants in diabetes: Linking basic science to clinical practice [^115aVaFP]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2005). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular complications, characterized by endothelial dysfunction and accelerated atherosclerosis, are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes. There is growing evidence that excess generation of highly reactive free radicals, largely due to hyperglycemia, causes oxidative stress, which further exacerbates the development and progression of diabetes and its complications. Overproduction and/or insufficient removal of these free radicals result in vascular dysfunction, damage to cellular proteins, membrane lipids, and nucleic acids. Despite overwhelming evidence on the damaging consequences of oxidative stress and its role in experimental diabetes, large-scale clinical trials with classic antioxidants failed to demonstrate any benefit for diabetic patients.

As our understanding of the mechanisms of free radical generation evolves, it is becoming clear that rather than merely scavenging reactive radicals, a more comprehensive approach aimed at preventing the generation of these reactive species as well as scavenging may prove more beneficial. Therefore, new strategies with classic as well as new antioxidants should be implemented in the treatment of diabetes.

### Molecular mechanism of endothelial and vascular aging: Implications for cardiovascular disease [^113MjmYs]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Western societies are aging due to an increasing life span, decreased birth rates, and improving social and health conditions. On the other hand, the prevalence of cardiovascular (CV) and cerebrovascular (CBV) diseases rises with age. Thus, in view of the ongoing aging pandemic, it is appropriate to better understand the molecular pathways of aging and age-associated CV and CBV diseases.

Oxidative stress contributes to the aging of organs and the whole body by an accumulation of reactive oxygen species, promoting oxidative damage. Indeed, increased oxidative stress produced in the mitochondria and cytosol of the heart and brain is a common denominator among almost all CV and CBV diseases. The mitochondrial adaptor protein p66(Shc) and the family of deacetylase enzymes, the sirtuins, regulate the aging process, determine the lifespan of many species, and are involved in CV diseases.

GDF11, a member of the TGFβ superfamily with homology to myostatin, also retards the aging process via yet unknown mechanisms. Recent evidence points towards a promising role of this novel 'rejuvenation' factor in reducing age-related heart disease. Finally, telomere length is also involved in aging and the development of age-related CV dysfunction.

This review focuses on the latest scientific advances in understanding age-related changes of the CV and CBV system, as well as delineating potential novel therapeutic targets derived from aging research for CV and CBV diseases.

### Inflammation in atherosclerosis [^113hSyxg]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2012). Low credibility.

Experimental work has elucidated molecular and cellular pathways of inflammation that promote atherosclerosis. Unraveling the roles of cytokines as inflammatory messengers provided a mechanism whereby risk factors for atherosclerosis can alter arterial biology and produce a systemic milieu that favors atherothrombotic events. The discovery of the immune basis of allograft arteriosclerosis demonstrated that inflammation per se can drive arterial hyperplasia, even in the absence of traditional risk factors. Inflammation regulates aspects of plaque biology that trigger the thrombotic complications of atherosclerosis. Translation of these discoveries to humans has enabled both novel mechanistic insights and practical clinical advances.

### Danger signaling in atherosclerosis [^112mPDgn]. Circulation Research (2015). Low credibility.

All aspects of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis are critically influenced by the inflammatory response in vascular plaques. Research in the field of innate immunity from the past two decades has uncovered many novel mechanisms elucidating how immune cells sense microbes, tissue damage, and metabolic derangements. Here, we summarize which triggers of innate immunity appear during atherogenesis and by which pathways they can contribute to inflammation in atherosclerotic plaques. The increased understanding gained from studies assessing how immune activation is associated with the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis has provided many novel targets for potential therapeutic intervention. Excitingly, the concept that inflammation may be the core of cardiovascular disease is currently being clinically evaluated and will probably encourage further studies in this area.

### Nexletol [^114dvnad]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Cardiovascular outcomes trial in adults with CVD or at high risk for CVD**: Trial 1 (NCT02993406) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven trial in 13,970 adult patients with established CVD (70%) or at high risk for a CVD event but without CVD (30%) who were not receiving recommended statin dosages. Patients with established CVD had a documented history of coronary artery disease, symptomatic peripheral arterial disease, and/or cerebrovascular atherosclerotic disease. Patients without established CVD were considered at high risk for CVD based on meeting at least one of the following criteria:

- **Diabetes mellitus** (type 1 or type 2) in females over 65 years of age or males over 60 years of age;
- **Reynolds risk score** > 30% or a SCORE risk score > 7.5% over 10 years. Reynolds risk score and SCORE risk score evaluate a 10-year risk of having a cardiovascular (CV) event. The Reynolds risk score is based on the following risk factors: sex, age, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and familial history of CVD events. LDL-C is an additional risk factor considered in the SCORE risk score; or
- **Coronary artery calcium score** > 400 Agatston units at any time in the past.

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either oral Nexletol 180 mg per day (n = 6,992) or placebo (n = 6,978), alone or as an add-on to other background lipid-lowering therapies. Background therapy could include less than low-intensity statin dosages. Overall, 95.3% of adult patients were followed until the end.

### Addressing knowledge gaps in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic heart disease [^113dyLKF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has published suggestions for conducting trials in younger individuals to address many of the evidence gaps described above. Moving from a 10‐year risk assessment to a lifetime risk assessment should inform enrollment in these trials; however, data to accomplish this are mostly limited to older cohorts. Risk assessment based on data collected in younger individuals, such as the PDAY study, and where longitudinal assessment over decades includes events, such as the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study and the i3C collaboration, may inform who should be recruited into such trials. Studies on familial hypercholesterolemia may also provide a model for developing primary prevention guidelines based on chronic exposure to elevated LDL-C.

A critical outcome of new trials should be developing evidence for the incorporation of monitoring of subclinical atherosclerosis as a study endpoint. A trial design to prove this is shown in Figure A. A randomized trial of a lipid‐lowering agent treating to two different LDL-C goals is shown. The critical strategy is to incorporate atherosclerosis imaging into the trial design. Subjects are stratified by the amount of atherosclerosis at baseline. This will allow testing of the hypothesis that atherosclerosis imaging has value in risk stratification by comparing rates of atherosclerosis progression (or regression) across the four groups.

### Endothelial dysfunction: A comprehensive appraisal [^116EomRL]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2006). Low credibility.

Oxidant byproducts and atherosclerosis

Oxidant products, such as superoxide anion (O2-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical (HO), hypochlorous acid (HOCl), and lipid radicals, are produced as a consequence of normal aerobic metabolism. These molecules are highly reactive with other biological molecules and are referred to as reactive oxygen species (ROS). Under normal physiological conditions, ROS production is balanced by an efficient system of antioxidants, molecules capable of neutralizing them and thereby preventing oxidant damage.

In the tissues, naturally occurring enzymatic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase play an important role in converting ROS to oxygen and water. Several non-enzymatic antioxidants, including the lipid-soluble vitamin E and β-carotene, and the water-soluble antioxidant vitamin C, particularly protect plasma lipids from peroxidation. Vitamin C scavenges superoxide anion and plays a role in recycling vitamin E.

In pathological states, ROS may be present in relative excess. This shift in balance in favor of oxidation, termed "oxidative stress", may have detrimental effects on cellular and tissue function. As mentioned before, cardiovascular risk factors generate oxidative stress.

### Cholestyramine [^113FCFZC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Two controlled clinical trials have examined the effects of cholestyramine monotherapy on coronary atherosclerotic lesions using coronary arteriography. In the NHLBI Type II Coronary Intervention Trial, 2,116 patients (80% male) with coronary artery disease (CAD) documented by arteriography were randomized to cholestyramine or placebo for five years of treatment. Final study arteriography revealed progression of coronary artery disease in 49% of placebo patients compared to 32% of the cholestyramine group (p < 0.05).

- **St. Thomas Atherosclerosis Regression Study (STARS)**: In this study, 90 hypercholesterolemic men with CAD were randomized to three blinded treatments: usual care, lipid-lowering diet, and lipid-lowering diet plus cholestyramine. After 36 months, follow-up coronary arteriography revealed progression of disease in 46% of usual care patients, 15% of patients on a lipid-lowering diet, and 12% of those receiving a diet plus cholestyramine (p < 0.02). The mean absolute width of coronary segments decreased in the usual care group, increased slightly (0.003 mm) in the diet group, and increased by 0.103 mm in the diet plus cholestyramine group (p < 0.05).

Thus, in these randomized controlled clinical trials using coronary arteriography, cholestyramine monotherapy has been demonstrated to slow progression and promote regression of atherosclerotic lesions in the coronary arteries of patients with coronary artery disease.

The effect of intensive lipid-lowering therapy on coronary atherosclerosis has been assessed by arteriography in hyperlipidemic patients.

### NT-probnp levels, atherosclerosis and vascular function in asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria: Peripheral reactive hyperaemia index but not NT-probnp is an independent predictor of coronary atherosclerosis [^116o4awe]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Our primary objective was to describe if patients with elevated NT-proBNP, and therefore poor prognosis, have subclinical atherosclerosis and/or vascular dysfunction. Accordingly, we investigated if patients with P-NT-proBNP levels above our previously defined cut-off value (45.2 ng/l) had more atherosclerosis and/or dysfunction than patients with P-NT-proBNP below this value. Furthermore, we examined the associations between atherosclerosis or vascular dysfunction and cardiovascular risk factors, including P-NT-proBNP as a continuous variable in univariate linear regression analyses and multivariate logistic regression models. This included determining unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and ORs adjusted for variables associated with atherosclerosis or vascular dysfunction in the univariate analysis.

The predictive accuracy for the presence of atherosclerosis of the covariate-adjusted models, with and without inclusion of P-NT-proBNP, was compared by generating receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The areas under these ROC curves (AUCs) were calculated. Patients were divided into groups with or without atherosclerosis, as determined by CCS, CIMT, ABI, and/or TBI. Subgroups included patients with coronary, peripheral, or carotid atherosclerosis alone, and patients with atherosclerosis in two or three vascular territories, respectively. Comparisons between groups were performed by using unpaired Student's t-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA). The Pearson Chi-squared test was used to compare non-continuous variables.

### Canonical and non-canonical roles of complement in atherosclerosis [^1162jxZb]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, and atherosclerosis is the major contributor to the development and progression of these diseases. Immune responses play a central role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, with the complement system being an acknowledged contributor. Chronic activation of liver-derived and serum-circulating canonical complement sustains endothelial inflammation and innate immune cell activation, and the deposition of complement activation fragments on inflamed endothelial cells is a hallmark of atherosclerotic plaques.

However, increasing evidence indicates that liver-independent, cell-autonomous, and non-canonical complement activities are underappreciated contributors to atherosclerosis. Furthermore, complement activation can also have atheroprotective properties. The specific detrimental or beneficial contributions of the complement system to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis are dictated by the location of complement activation and the engagement of its canonical versus non-canonical functions during atherosclerosis progression.

In this review, we summarize the classical and the emerging non-classical roles of the complement system in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and discuss potential strategies for therapeutic modulation of complement for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

### Small vessel disease burden and prognosis of recent subcortical ischaemic stroke differ by parent artery atherosclerosis [^116xvMFK]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Parent artery atherosclerosis is an important etiology of recent subcortical ischemic stroke (RSIS). However, comparisons of RSIS with different degrees of parent artery atherosclerosis are lacking.

Prospectively collected data from our multicenter cohort of the Stroke Imaging Package Study, conducted between 2015 and 2017, were retrospectively reviewed. All centers involved were tertiary centers. Patients with RSIS, defined as a single clinically relevant diffusion-weighted imaging positive lesion in the territory of lenticulostriate arteries, were categorized into three subgroups:

- **Normal middle cerebral artery (MCA)**: As seen on magnetic resonance angiography and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI).
- **Low-grade MCA atherosclerosis**: Normal or minor changes identified on imaging.
- **Steno-occlusive MCA atherosclerosis**: Signs of obstruction observed on imaging.

The clinical and imaging findings were compared between these subgroups.

A total of 239 patients (median age 60.0 [52.0–67.0] years, 72% male) were enrolled, including 140 with normal MCA, 64 with low-grade MCA atherosclerosis, and 35 with steno-occlusive MCA atherosclerosis. Patients with steno-occlusive MCA atherosclerosis exhibited the largest infarct volume. Furthermore, low-grade MCA atherosclerosis was independently associated with cerebral microbleeding, more severe perivascular spaces in the basal ganglia, and a higher total cerebral small vessel disease burden.

### Nlrp3 inflammasome pathways in atherosclerosis [^112tGv9p]. Atherosclerosis (2017). Low credibility.

Atherosclerosis is the major cause of death and disability. Atherosclerotic plaques are characterized by chronic sterile inflammation in the large blood vessels, where lipid-derived and damage-associated molecular patterns play important roles in inciting immune responses. Following the initial demonstration that NLR family Pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) was important for atherogenesis, a substantial number of studies have emerged addressing the basic mechanisms of inflammasome activation and their relevance to atherosclerosis.

In this review, we introduce the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and discuss the findings and therapeutic strategies that target NLRP3 inflammasome activation during the development and progression of atherosclerosis.
