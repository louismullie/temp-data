## Question

Can TVUS screen for ovarian cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) can be used to screen for ovarian cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between population screening and diagnostic evaluation. Then, I should review randomized trial evidence on mortality benefit. Next, I will examine systematic reviews and meta-analyses to quantify benefits and harms. After that, I need to check major guidelines for consensus recommendations. I will then consider high-risk populations and whether TVUS changes management there. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable bottom line with appropriate caveats and monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame because I need to ensure we are not conflating screening with diagnostic assessment. Screening refers to testing asymptomatic, average-risk women to reduce mortality, whereas diagnostic evaluation involves imaging symptomatic women or those with identified adnexal masses. TVUS is recommended as first-line for diagnostic assessment of adnexal masses by multiple societies, but that does not imply efficacy for screening asymptomatic populations, and I should be careful not to extrapolate the former to the latter [^113AraQS] [^112ZqXmf] [^114gZbc6] [^116ZDjiS].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence on screening and mortality, and I will now examine the randomized trials. The UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS), with more than 200,000 participants and long-term follow-up, showed no statistically significant reduction in ovarian or tubal cancer mortality with either multimodal screening or ultrasound-first screening compared with no screening, despite detecting more early-stage disease in the multimodal arm, and I need to emphasize that the mortality endpoint is key here [^111UR7gt] [^113UN7Fb]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions based on stage shift alone; the PLCO trial similarly failed to show a mortality reduction, and the USPSTF evidence review integrates these RCTs in concluding no benefit, so the absence of mortality benefit is consistent across trials [^111e1WBz] [^114gZbc6].

> I need to check whether pooled data alter this interpretation, so let me consider systematic reviews and meta-analyses. A GRADE-based meta-analysis of randomized trials showed no reduction in all-cause or ovarian cancer–specific mortality and no significant reduction in advanced-stage diagnoses; importantly, TVUS screening led to an average of 38 surgeries per cancer detected, with 6% severe surgical complications, and increased distress among false-positive cases, which signals net harm at the population level [^112hEmSL]. Hmm, wait a minute, could newer syntheses overturn this; contemporary reviews continue to highlight high false-positive rates with substantial unnecessary surgeries and complications, corroborating the harm signal seen in earlier work [^111UFsdo] [^113nRzGA].

> Now, I should verify guideline positions because they integrate evidence and clinical judgment. The USPSTF issues a Grade D recommendation against screening asymptomatic, average-risk women with TVUS, CA-125, or pelvic examination, concluding with moderate certainty that harms outweigh benefits, and I do not see exceptions for ultrasound alone in this context [^114gZbc6]. ACOG likewise states there is insufficient evidence to support routine screening with TVUS or CA-125 in average-risk women, and the AAFP aligns by recommending against screening, reinforcing a uniform consensus across primary care and specialty guidelines [^1131bMsk] [^1171yZcK].

> But wait, what if the patient is high risk due to BRCA or strong family history; I should confirm how that changes the calculus. For women with pathogenic BRCA variants or markedly elevated familial risk, risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy remains the standard because screening has not demonstrated improved survival; short-term surveillance with TVUS or CA-125 may be considered in select high-risk women who are deferring surgery, but it is not a substitute for prophylactic surgery and should occur within specialist care pathways with genetic counseling [^111dCGEw] [^113Ed69M] [^113KMSNo]. Evidence from high-risk screening cohorts shows poor sensitivity for early-stage detection and no clear survival advantage, which supports prioritizing preventive surgery over screening in this group [^113xtQbS] [^115rF2JQ].

> I should double-check the balance of benefits and harms because this underpins screening recommendations. Benefits are limited by low disease prevalence, short sojourn times for aggressive histologies, and low positive predictive value of TVUS in asymptomatic populations, whereas harms include high false-positive rates, frequent unnecessary surgeries, and meaningful surgical morbidity along with anxiety and distress from abnormal results, tipping the balance unfavorably for screening [^112hEmSL] [^111e1WBz] [^113nRzGA]. Hold on, I should verify whether any subgroup benefited in RCTs; no prespecified subgroup in UKCTOCS or PLCO showed a definitive mortality reduction, supporting a consistent harm-leaning risk–benefit profile for population screening [^111UR7gt] [^111e1WBz].

> Let me consider alternative interpretations and ongoing research, and I need to be careful with apparent positives. Initially, the observed stage shift in the multimodal arm of UKCTOCS might suggest benefit, but I must correct myself because mortality did not improve, and later divergence of curves still did not reach significance; algorithmic approaches like ROCA can improve test performance characteristics yet have not translated into mortality reduction to date, consistent with modeling of short sojourn times for high-grade serous cancers that limit screening yield [^113UN7Fb] [^116MpieM] [^113pHnES]. Contemporary oncology and guideline updates continue to state there is no validated screening strategy that reduces ovarian cancer mortality, which keeps screening in the realm of investigational approaches rather than standard care [^114BM3av] [^112aSH9m].

> Next, I should review where TVUS clearly fits, because I need to ensure appropriate use is emphasized. TVUS remains the first-line imaging modality to evaluate suspected adnexal masses or relevant symptoms, and when combined with structured risk models and expert operators, it helps triage to observation versus referral and surgery; this is diagnostic use, not screening, and is supported across gynecologic oncology and radiology guidelines [^113AraQS] [^116LyW2P] [^112aSH9m] [^112ZqXmf]. Hold on, I should verify operator dependence; accuracy improves with expertise, which further underscores why screening programs based on TVUS can propagate false positives in community settings while expert diagnostic imaging is appropriate for symptomatic evaluation [^111UFsdo].

> Final synthesis and answer: Can TVUS screen for ovarian cancer; technically, it can detect ovarian abnormalities, but it should not be used as a screening tool in asymptomatic women because large randomized trials show no mortality benefit, high-quality meta-analyses demonstrate substantial harms from false positives and unnecessary surgeries, and major guidelines uniformly recommend against screening; TVUS remains appropriate for diagnostic evaluation of symptoms or masses and, in high-risk women deferring risk-reducing surgery, surveillance may be discussed but does not replace prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy [^111UR7gt] [^112hEmSL] [^114gZbc6] [^111dCGEw] [^112ZqXmf].

Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) **should not be used for routine screening** for ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women [^114gZbc6], as it does not reduce mortality [^111UR7gt] and has a high false-positive rate that leads to unnecessary surgeries and complications [^112hEmSL] [^113nRzGA]. TVUS is **appropriate for evaluating symptomatic patients or known adnexal masses** [^112ZqXmf] [^113AraQS] but is not recommended for routine screening in average- or high-risk women. For high-risk women, risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy is the preferred strategy; TVUS may be considered only if surgery is declined or delayed.

---

## Evidence from major clinical trials

Several large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated TVUS for ovarian cancer screening, **with no demonstrated mortality reduction**:

- **PLCO trial**: No reduction in ovarian cancer mortality with annual TVUS and CA-125; high false-positive rates led to unnecessary surgeries and complications [^114gZbc6] [^111e1WBz].

- **UKCTOCS**: No significant mortality reduction with TVUS alone or multimodal screening (CA-125 plus TVUS); TVUS alone had lower sensitivity and specificity than multimodal approaches [^113UN7Fb] [^11664iqZ].

- **Systematic reviews**: Consistently show no mortality benefit and substantial harms from false positives and unnecessary surgeries [^112hEmSL] [^111e1WBz].

---

## Sensitivity and specificity of TVUS

TVUS has moderate sensitivity and specificity, **with significant limitations** [^11664iqZ] [^111e1WBz]:

| **Metric** | **TVUS alone** | **TVUS + CA-125** |
|-|-|-|
| Sensitivity | 84% | 85% |
| Specificity | 98% | 96% |
| False-positive rate | 9.8% | 5.3% |

- **False positives** lead to unnecessary surgeries, anxiety, and complications [^112hEmSL] [^113nRzGA], whereas **false negatives** miss early-stage cancers, limiting effectiveness [^111e1WBz].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major professional organizations **recommend against routine TVUS screening**:

- **USPSTF**: Recommends against screening asymptomatic women, including those at average or high risk.

- **ACOG**: Recommends against routine TVUS screening in asymptomatic women, including those with BRCA mutations or family history [^1131bMsk] [^113Ed69M].

- **SOGC**: Recommends against routine TVUS screening in asymptomatic women.

---

## Risks and harms associated with TVUS screening

TVUS screening carries **significant risks and harms**:

- **False positives**: Lead to unnecessary surgeries, anxiety, and complications [^112hEmSL] [^113nRzGA].

- **False negatives**: Miss early-stage cancers, delaying diagnosis and treatment [^111e1WBz].

- **Psychological impact**: Increased anxiety and distress from false positives [^112hEmSL].

---

## TVUS in high-risk populations

TVUS is **not recommended for routine screening** in high-risk populations. For women with **BRCA mutations**, there is no evidence of mortality reduction, and **risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy is preferred** [^114BM3av] [^113Ed69M] [^113xtQbS]. Similarly, for those with a **family history**, there is no evidence of mortality reduction, with **risk-reducing surgery preferred** [^111dCGEw] [^114BM3av].

---

## Alternative screening methods

Alternative methods have been evaluated, but **none are recommended for routine screening** [^111e1WBz]. **CA-125** has limited sensitivity and specificity and is not recommended alone or with TVUS [^1131bMsk] [^114gZbc6]; **multimodal screening** likewise shows no significant mortality reduction and is not recommended [^111UR7gt] [^113UN7Fb].

---

## Current role of TVUS in clinical practice

TVUS is **valuable for diagnostic evaluation** of symptomatic patients or known adnexal masses [^112aSH9m]. For **symptomatic patients**, TVUS is recommended for evaluating suspected ovarian cancer [^112ZqXmf]; for **known adnexal masses**, it is recommended for initial evaluation and characterization [^113AraQS] [^116ZDjiS].

---

TVUS is **not recommended for routine ovarian cancer screening** in asymptomatic women because of the lack of mortality benefit and the significant harms from false positives [^114gZbc6] [^112hEmSL]. It remains useful for evaluating symptomatic patients or known adnexal masses; for high-risk women, risk-reducing surgery is preferred [^113Ed69M].

### Cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: 2021 update [^114BM3av]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, there are no documented effective screening methods that reduce the mortality of ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancers. Studies using CA125, ultrasonography of the pelvis, and pelvic examination do not have an acceptable level of sensitivity and specificity, based on trials carried out in women in the general population and those in the high-risk population. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening asymptomatic women for ovarian cancer with pelvic examination, pelvic ultrasound, or serum tumor marker measurements. The low prevalence of disease and lack of high-quality screening methods make it more likely to obtain false-positive results, leading to unnecessary interventions.

A recent study of multimodal screening using CA125, based on a risk of ovarian cancer algorithm (ROCA) every 4 months and transvaginal ultrasound annually or earlier where indicated by the ROCA in women at high risk of ovarian cancer, reported that screening was associated with a low rate of high-volume disease at primary surgery and very high rates of no residual disease after surgery. Given that the majority of women with advanced-stage ovarian cancer, even with complete resection, will relapse after chemotherapy, this does not seem to be a good alternative to risk-reducing surgery. The authors of the screening study concluded that risk-reducing salpingectomy-oophorectomy remains the treatment choice for women at high risk of ovarian/fallopian tube cancer.

Women at increased genetic risk should be encouraged to consider risk-reducing bilateral salpingectomy-oophorectomy.

### Risks and benefits of screening asymptomatic women for ovarian cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112hEmSL]. Gynecologic Oncology (2013). High credibility.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the risks and benefits of screening asymptomatic women for ovarian cancer.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL, without language restrictions, from January 1, 1979, to February 5, 2012. Eligible studies randomly assigned asymptomatic women to screening or usual care. Two reviewers independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data using a standardized, piloted extraction form, and assessed bias and strength of inference for each outcome using the GRADE framework. Chance-corrected agreement was calculated at each step, and disagreements were resolved through consensus.

- **Results**: Ten randomized trials proved eligible. Screening did not reduce all-cause mortality (relative risk (RR) = 1.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96–1.06), ovarian cancer-specific mortality (RR = 1.08, 95% CI 0.84–1.38), or risk of diagnosis at an advanced stage (RR of diagnosis at FIGO stages III-IV = 0.86, 95% CI 0.68–1.11). Transvaginal ultrasound resulted in a mean of 38 surgeries per ovarian cancer detected (95% CI 15.7–178.1), while screening with CA-125 led to 4 surgeries per ovarian cancer detected (95% CI 2.7–4.5). Surgery was associated with severe complications in 6% of women (95% CI 1%-11%). Quality of life was not affected by screening; however, women with false-positive results had increased cancer-specific distress compared to those with normal results (odds ratio (OR) = 2.22, 95% CI 1.23–3.99).

- **Conclusions**: Screening asymptomatic women for ovarian cancer does not reduce mortality or diagnosis at an advanced stage while leading to a substantial number of unnecessary surgeries and associated complications.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for ovarian cancer, particularly related to indications for screening within the general population, the ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend that there is insufficient evidence to support obtaining transvaginal ultrasounds and tumor markers, such as CA-125, either alone or in combination, for the early detection of ovarian cancer in average-risk females.

### Contemporary progress in ovarian cancer screening [^117DyHED]. Current Oncology Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Our limited understanding of the natural biology of ovarian cancer, along with its low prevalence in the general population, makes early detection especially challenging. To be successful at the population level, an ovarian cancer screening test must demonstrate a beneficial effect on ovarian cancer-specific mortality while achieving near-perfect specificity to minimize the harms resulting from false-positive results. No screening tests for ovarian cancer fulfill these expectations. We review the status and challenges of ovarian cancer screening in the context of evidence-based principles that define a valuable cancer screening program.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® ovarian cancer screening: 2024 update [^1128pXRs]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer remains low in prevalence but has the highest mortality of all gynecologic malignancies. Population-based screening for ovarian cancer is a topic of interest in contemporary practice, given that the majority of cancers encountered are high-grade aggressive malignancies, for which favorable survival is achieved in early-stage disease. This document summarizes a review of the available data from randomized and observational trials that have evaluated the role of imaging for ovarian cancer screening in average-risk and high-risk patients.

When considering screening using pelvic ultrasound in average-risk patients, we found insufficient published evidence to recommend ovarian cancer screening. Randomized controlled trials have not demonstrated a mortality benefit in this setting. Screening with pelvic ultrasound may be appropriate for select patients at high risk, although the existing data remain limited as large, randomized trials have not been performed in this setting.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of these criteria.

### Risk algorithm using serial biomarker measurements doubles the number of screen-detected cancers compared with a single-threshold rule in the United Kingdom collaborative trial of ovarian cancer screening [^116MpieM]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Following the initial prevalence screen, trial participants underwent an annual blood test on the anniversary of the randomization date. Serum CA-125 (level I screen) was measured using an electrochemiluminescence sandwich immunoassay (Catalog No. 11776223 322; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The screening protocol and management of screen-detected abnormalities have been previously described.

- **Screening system**: At the annual screen, women were triaged as follows: risk of ovarian cancer (ROC) normal, return to annual screening; ROC intermediate, repeat CA-125 (repeat level I screen) in 12 weeks; and ROC elevated, repeat CA-125 and transvaginal scan (TVS; level II screen) in 6 weeks, with earlier screens arranged when results are suggestive of clinical disease.

- **Level II procedure**: At level II screen, women with normal or intermediate ROC and a normal scan were returned to annual screening. However, those with elevated ROC and a normal scan or an unsatisfactory scan irrespective of ROC had a repeat level II screen in 6 weeks. Those with abnormal scans irrespective of ROC were referred for clinical assessment. At repeat level II, women were again triaged to annual screening or clinical assessment. Women with an ROC of more than 1 in 5 (severe risk) were recommended to have surgery irrespective of scan findings.

### Reducing ovarian cancer mortality through screening: Is it possible, and can we afford it [^112kzicP]. Gynecologic Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Given the low prevalence of this disease, the effectiveness of screening strategies has not been established. We aimed to estimate the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of potential screening strategies for ovarian cancer using population-specific data.

A Markov state transition model was used to simulate the natural history of ovarian cancer in a cohort of women aged 20 to 100. Age-specific incidence and mortality rates were obtained from SEER. Base-case characteristics of a potential screening test included sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 95%, and a cost of $50. Outcome measures were mortality reduction, the lifetime number of false positive screening tests, positive predictive value, years of life saved (YLS), lifetime costs in US dollars, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER, in cost/YLS).

Model-predicted lifetime risk of ovarian cancer was 1.38%, lifetime risk of death from ovarian cancer was 0.95%, and stage distribution was as follows: stage I-19%, stage II-7%, and stage III, IV, or unstaged - 74%, closely approximating SEER data. Annual screening resulted in a 43% reduction in ovarian cancer mortality, with an ICER of $73,469/YLS (base case) and $36,025/YLS (high-risk population), compared to no screening. In the base case, the average lifetime number of false positive tests was 1.06. The cost-effectiveness of screening is most sensitive to test frequency, specificity, and cost.

Annual screening for ovarian cancer has the potential to be cost-effective, particularly in high-risk populations.

### Assessing the rates of false-positive ovarian cancer screenings and surgical interventions associated with screening tools: A systematic review [^113nRzGA]. BMJ Oncology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The complete checklist is included in the online supplemental appendix.

- **Search strategy**: Eligible studies were initially identified by searching PubMed and Embase in March 2023. To increase the rigour of this study, searches were conducted again in March 2024 using PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL. We also reviewed grey literature using SCOPUS and searched for the last 5 years of conference proceedings from the Ovarian Cancer Research Symposium and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology Annual Meeting. The complete search strategy can be found in online supplemental appendix A.

- **Selection criteria**: All observational studies, retrospective studies, and randomised/non-randomised trials published between 2003 and 2023 reporting unnecessary surgical interventions secondary to a false-positive screening were included. Studies published prior to 2003 or not written in English were excluded.

- **Study selection and data collection process**: The studies for this review were selected using Covidence software (Figure 1). Two reviewers independently screened all titles and abstracts, blinded to each other's decisions. A study was included if both reviewers independently determined fulfilment of inclusion criteria. Disputes were discussed among reviewers and, if necessary, resolved by a third reviewer. The same process was followed for full-text review and data extraction.

### Risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA-related cancer in women: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^113CTVgD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for ovarian cancer, specifically concerning indications for screening and patients at risk, the USPSTF 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining screening for ovarian cancer in patients with a family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer. This should be done using a screening tool designed to identify an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 or BRCA2).

### Sensitivity of transvaginal ultrasound screening for endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women: a case-control study within the UKCTOCS cohort [^114eA6YD]. The Lancet Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

The increase in the worldwide incidence of endometrial cancer relates to rising obesity, falling fertility, and the aging of the population. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) is a possible screening test, but there have been no large-scale studies. We report the performance of TVS screening in a large cohort.

- **Methods**: We conducted a nested case-control study of postmenopausal women who underwent TVS in the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) following recruitment between April 17, 2001, and September 29, 2005. Endometrial thickness and endometrial abnormalities were recorded, and follow-up, through national registries and a postal questionnaire, documented the diagnosis of endometrial cancer. Our primary outcome measure was endometrial cancer and atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH). Performance characteristics of endometrial thickness and abnormalities for detection of endometrial cancer within 1 year of TVS were calculated. Epidemiological variables were used to develop a logistic regression model and assess a screening strategy for women at higher risk. Our study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00058032, and with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial register, number ISRCTN22488978.

- **Findings**: A total of 48,230 women underwent TVS in the UKCTOCS prevalence screen. Of these, 9078 women were ineligible because they had undergone a hysterectomy and 2271 because their endometrial thickness had not been recorded; however, 157 of these women had an endometrial abnormality on TVS and were included in the analysis.

### Executive summary of the ovarian cancer evidence review conference [^115jvPgX]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Low credibility.

Our review did not find any high-quality evidence supporting the use of other serum markers, circulating tumor cells, or algorithms in ovarian cancer screening. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening for ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women who are not known to have a high-risk hereditary cancer syndrome, concluding that "there is at least moderate certainty that the harms of screening for ovarian cancer outweigh the benefits".

- **Screening in patients at high risk**: We found no randomized controlled trials of ovarian cancer screening in women at high risk. Secondary analysis of the PLCO cancer screening trial data revealed similar rates of abnormal ovarian cancer screening with ultrasonography and CA 125 evaluation across all risk groups and no difference in overall or disease-specific mortality. The University of Kentucky Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, which used screening ultrasonography and CA 125 assessment, reported increased 5- and 10-year survival rates for patients with screening-detected epithelial ovarian cancer compared with unscreened patients with epithelial ovarian cancer; however, this study was not randomized, lacked a control group, and did not describe patients' cancer histology.

Because of the lack of efficacy of ovarian cancer screening in patients at high risk, none of the professional societies included in this review explicitly recommend ovarian cancer screening for this population; however, several state that ovarian cancer screening can be offered to patients at high risk.

### Ovarian cancer screening and mortality in the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS): a randomised controlled trial [^112aVP2C]. Lancet (2016). High credibility.

Ovarian cancer has a poor prognosis, with just 40% of patients surviving 5 years. We designed this trial to establish the effect of early detection by screening on ovarian cancer mortality.

- **Methods**: In this randomised controlled trial, we recruited postmenopausal women aged 50–74 years from 13 centres in National Health Service Trusts in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Exclusion criteria were previous bilateral oophorectomy or ovarian malignancy, increased risk of familial ovarian cancer, and active non-ovarian malignancy. The trial management system confirmed eligibility and randomly allocated participants in blocks of 32 using computer-generated random numbers to annual multimodal screening (MMS) with serum CA125 interpreted with the use of the risk of ovarian cancer algorithm, annual transvaginal ultrasound screening (USS), or no screening, in a 1:1:2 ratio. The primary outcome was death due to ovarian cancer by Dec 31, 2014, comparing MMS and USS separately with no screening, ascertained by an outcomes committee masked to randomisation group. All analyses were by modified intention to screen, excluding the small number of women we discovered after randomisation to have a bilateral oophorectomy, have ovarian cancer, or had exited the registry before recruitment. Investigators and participants were aware of the screening type. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00058032.

- **Findings**: Between June 1, 2001, and Oct 21, 2005, we randomly allocated 202,638 women: 50,640 (25.0%) to MMS, 50,639 (25.0%) to USS, and 101,359 (50.0%) to no screening.

### Ovarian cancer screening and mortality in the UK collaborative trial of ovarian cancer screening (UKCTOCS): A randomised controlled trial [^111CtuhQ]. Lancet (2016). High credibility.

Annual screening in the MMS group used serum CA125 concentration testing, with the pattern over time interpreted using the risk of ovarian cancer calculation, which identifies significant rises in CA125 concentration above baseline. Next, ROCA triaged women to normal (annual screening), intermediate (repeat CA125 concentration testing in 3 months), and elevated (repeat CA125 concentration testing and transvaginal USS as a second-line test in 6 weeks) risk. Annual screening in the USS group used transvaginal USS as the primary test, which was classified as normal (annual screening), unsatisfactory (repeat in 3 months), or abnormal (scan with a senior ultrasonographer within 6 weeks). In both groups, women with persistent abnormalities had clinical assessment and additional investigations within the NHS by a trial clinician. We deemed women who had surgery or a biopsy for suspected ovarian cancer after clinical assessment screen positive.

Screening was implemented centrally by the CC using a web-based trial management system, which ensured that protocol deviations were kept to a minimum. A quality assurance programme for transvaginal USS and accreditation for scanning of postmenopausal ovaries was overseen by the ultrasound committee. We linked women using their NHS number in England as well as Wales to the Health and Social Care Information Centre for cancer and death registrations and, in Northern Ireland, to the Central Services Agency and Northern Ireland Cancer Registry. For women from English RCs, we also obtained data for cancer diagnosis from the National Cancer Registry.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^115o9EiP]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: This systematic review–based guideline product was developed by a multinational, multidisciplinary Expert Panel, which included a patient representative and ASCO guidelines staff member with expertise in health research methodology. The Expert Panel met via teleconference and corresponded through e-mail. On the basis of the consideration of the evidence, the authors were asked to contribute to the development of the guideline, provide critical review, and finalize the guideline recommendations. Members of the Expert Panel were responsible for reviewing and approving the penultimate version of the guideline, which was then circulated for external review and submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for editorial review and consideration for publication.

- **Guideline development process**: This guideline adaptation was also informed by the ADAPTE methodology and consensus methodology together as an alternative to de novo guideline development. Adaptation of guidelines is considered by ASCO in selected circumstances when one or more quality guidelines from other organizations already exist on the same topic. The objective of the ADAPTE process is to take advantage of existing guidelines to enhance efficient production, reduce duplication, and promote the local uptake of quality guideline recommendations.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^112sgzyT]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). High credibility.

The recommendations were developed by a multinational, multidisciplinary group of experts using evidence from existing guidelines and clinical experience as a guide. The ASCO Expert Panel underscores that health care practitioners who implement the recommendations presented in this guideline should first identify the available resources in their local and referral facilities and endeavor to provide the highest level of care possible with those resources. The authors would like to make some general points applying to recommendations throughout this guideline: outcomes should be balanced with quality of life (QoL), including financial toxicity; recommendations are made regarding what is feasible in resource-constrained settings.

Because of the large breadth of recommendations, the Panel elected to discuss selected areas.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^116JZwDe]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

ASCO's adaptation process begins with a literature search by ASCO guidelines staff to identify candidate guidelines for adaptation. Adapted guideline manuscripts are reviewed and approved by the ASCO Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPGC). The review includes two parts: methodological review and content review. The methodological review is completed by a member of the CPGC's Methodology Subcommittee and/or by ASCO guidelines staff. The content review is completed by an expert panel. All funding for the administration of the project was provided by ASCO. Further details of the methods used for the development of this guideline are reported in the ASCO Guidelines Methodology Manual.

This guideline was partially informed by ASCO's modified Delphi formal expert consensus methodology. During this process, the expert panel was supplemented by additional experts recruited to rate their agreement with the drafted recommendations. The entire membership of experts is referred to as the Consensus Panel. In round 1, 20 experts (plus two who were on the expert panel) participated; in round 2, there were a total of 26 respondents (nine of whom were on the expert panel).

The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part, using the Guidelines Into Decision Support methodology. The guideline recommendations were sent for an open comment period of 2 weeks, allowing the public to review and comment on the recommendations after submitting a confidentiality agreement. These comments were taken into consideration.

### Screening for ovarian cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^1177zHPX]. JAMA (2018). Low credibility.

With approximately 14,000 deaths per year, ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death among US women and the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancer. More than 95% of ovarian cancer deaths occur among women 45 years and older.

- **Objective**: To update the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for ovarian cancer.

- **Evidence review**: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women not known to be at high risk for ovarian cancer (i.e. high risk includes women with certain hereditary cancer syndromes that increase their risk for ovarian cancer). Outcomes of interest included ovarian cancer mortality, quality of life, false-positive rate, surgery and surgical complication rates, and psychological effects of screening.

- **Findings**: The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening for ovarian cancer does not reduce ovarian cancer mortality. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that the harms from screening for ovarian cancer are at least moderate and may be substantial in some cases, and include unnecessary surgery for women who do not have cancer. Given the lack of mortality benefit of screening, and the moderate to substantial harms that could result from false-positive screening test results and subsequent surgery, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms of screening for ovarian cancer outweigh the benefit, and the net balance of the benefit and harms of screening is negative.

- **Conclusions and recommendation**: The USPSTF recommends against screening for ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women not known to be at high risk for the disease.

### Early detection of ovarian cancer using the risk of ovarian cancer algorithm with frequent CA125 testing in women at increased familial risk - combined results from two screening trials [^112t4Jwq]. Clinical Cancer Research (2017). Low credibility.

The study focuses on the screening practices of women at familial/genetic risk for ovarian cancer, which often proceed despite unproven efficacy. Research indicates that each woman has a unique CA125 baseline, and substantial increases above this personal baseline might allow for earlier cancer detection compared to the standard 6- to 12-monthly CA125 threshold of > 35 U/mL.

The experimental design involved combining data from the prospective Cancer Genetics Network and Gynecologic Oncology Group trials, screening 3,692 women (13,080 woman-screening years) who have a strong family history of breast/ovarian cancer or BRCA1/2 mutations. The novel screening strategy involved measuring serum CA125 every three months and evaluating results using a risk of ovarian cancer algorithm (ROCA). This approach detected significant increases above each subject's baseline and prompted transvaginal ultrasound examinations. Specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) from this approach were compared with those from general population screening (specificity 90%, PPV 10%), and the stage-at-detection was compared with historical high-risk controls.

Results showed a specificity of 92% for ultrasound referrals compared to 90% (P = 0.0001), with a PPV of 4.6% versus 10% (P > 0.10). Screening or risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) detected 18 of 19 malignant ovarian neoplasms (prevalent = 4, incident = 6, RRSO = 9). Among incident cases, which best reflect long-term screening performance, three of six invasive cancers were detected at an early stage (I/II; 50% vs. 10% historical BRCA1 controls; P = 0.016), and six of nine RRSO-related cases were stage I. Notably, ROCA identified three of six (50%) incident cases before CA125 levels exceeded 35 U/mL.

**Guideline implementation**: ASCO guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness of the guideline recommendations among frontline practitioners and patients with ovarian cancer and to provide adequate services in the face of limited resources. The guideline bottom line was designed to facilitate implementation of recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely, including through many forms of ASCO communications and the ASCO website.

### Biology of epithelial ovarian cancer: Implications for screening women at high genetic risk [^113Sno4h]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Our aim was to analyze the clinicopathologic features of screen-detected ovarian cancers identified in women, either at general population risk or high genetic risk of ovarian cancer, who have participated in screening studies.

- **Methods**: Studies published between 1988 and April 2003 were categorized by the population screened and the primary screening modalities used. Each report was examined with reference to the histologic type, stage, and grade of screen-detected cancers. Reports of studies of prophylactically removed ovaries from women at high risk of ovarian cancer were also reviewed.

- **Results**: Of the stage I tumors detected by screening women at population risk, almost half were borderline ovarian tumors, granulosa-cell tumors, or germ-cell tumors, which is disproportionate to their frequency. Furthermore, of the stage I invasive epithelial cancers diagnosed in women at population risk, the majority were endometrioid, clear-cell, and mucinous histologic subtypes. Most ovarian cancers that occur in women at high genetic risk are high-grade serous cancers, and these are infrequently screen detected at an early stage.

- **Conclusion**: The clinicopathologic features of screen-detected ovarian cancers suggest that screening may not reduce mortality in women at increased genetic risk. Prospective screening studies are required in genetically high-risk populations to answer this important question. Women electing surveillance should be aware of the lack of proven benefit and the low likelihood of detecting early stage serous cancers.

### Practice bulletin no 182: Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome [^113Ed69M]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for ovarian cancer, specifically with respect to indications for screening, patients at risk, and the ACOG/SGO 2017 guidelines, it is recommended to avoid routine ovarian cancer screening with transvaginal ultrasound or serum CA-125 in patients with BRCA mutations or with a personal or family history of ovarian cancer.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^111HbTHh]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

The overarching clinical question addresses the optimal diagnosis and staging strategies for adult women with ovarian masses and/or epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).

- **Evaluation and diagnosis of adult women with ovarian masses or symptoms of EOC**: Recommendations on evaluation and diagnosis for women with ovarian masses are detailed in Tables 5 and 6, as well as Appendix Figures A1, A2, A8, and A9. These recommendations are adapted, and in some cases modified, from guidelines developed by organizations such as Belgian KCE, Irish NCEC, SIGN, BGCS, ASCO, and SGO, informed by clinical expertise.

- **Diagnostic strategies**: These recommendations pertain to the assessment of adult women with ovarian masses in basic, limited, and enhanced healthcare settings.

	- **Basic-resource settings**: Women with ovarian cancer may report generalized symptoms such as pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, abdominal bloating, or feeling full with small meals (early satiety). Other focal signs can include a patient's report of an abdominal mass, symptoms of abdominal distension, abdominal or pelvic pain, or changes in bowel function like diarrhea or constipation (the latter occurring for less than 12 months but more than 12 times per month). Women presenting with symptoms possibly associated with EOC require further evaluation. Despite their nonspecific nature, these underlying symptoms can be severe or significantly impact life, potentially indicating cancer. In basic-resource settings, a general practitioner often relies on the patient's history and physical examination to determine the cause of these symptoms.

### Ultrasound screening for the early detection of ovarian cancer [^116mbyKk]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer screening in the general population has been performed using ultrasound examination of the female pelvis and serum tumor marker determinations. Ultrasound examinations, particularly transvaginal sonography (TVS), have been advocated as potentially useful modalities. Investigators from the University of Kentucky (Lexington, KY) and Hirosaki University (Hirosaki, Japan) have recently published results from ultrasound-based ovarian cancer screening studies. The Kentucky trial screened 14,469 women using TVS on an annual basis. One hundred eighty women underwent surgery, and 17 ovarian cancers were detected, 11 of which were invasive epithelial lesions. The Hirosaki trial reported the results of an ultrasound-based screening study among 51,550 women who were first-time participants. Three hundred twenty-four women underwent surgery, and 22 ovarian cancers were detected. In each of these trials, the positive predictive value of gray-scale sonography was low. Morphologic tumor indexing and Doppler examinations have both been proposed as potential second-line studies, which could increase the positive predictive value of gray-scale ultrasound. A review of these techniques is presented. At present, ovarian cancer screening in the general population using ultrasound examinations is an experimental technique. Further studies are needed to determine whether second-line testing can improve the positive predictive value of gray-scale sonography such that asymptomatic women do not undergo unnecessary surgery for benign masses.

### Ovarian cancer screening and mortality in the UK collaborative trial of ovarian cancer screening (UKCTOCS): A randomised controlled trial [^114n629Z]. Lancet (2016). High credibility.

Ovarian cancer has a poor prognosis, with just 40% of patients surviving 5 years. This trial was designed to establish the effect of early detection by screening on ovarian cancer mortality.

In this randomised controlled trial, we recruited postmenopausal women aged 50–74 years from 13 centres in National Health Service Trusts in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Exclusion criteria included previous bilateral oophorectomy or ovarian malignancy, increased risk of familial ovarian cancer, and active non-ovarian malignancy. The trial management system confirmed eligibility and randomly allocated participants in blocks of 32 using computer-generated random numbers to annual multimodal screening (MMS) with serum CA125 interpreted using the risk of ovarian cancer algorithm, annual transvaginal ultrasound screening (USS), or no screening, in a 1:1:2 ratio.

The primary outcome was death due to ovarian cancer by December 31, 2014, comparing MMS and USS separately with no screening, ascertained by an outcomes committee masked to randomisation group. All analyses were by modified intention to screen, excluding the small number of women we discovered after randomisation to have a bilateral oophorectomy, ovarian cancer, or had exited the registry before recruitment. Investigators and participants were aware of the screening type.

Between June 1, 2001, and October 21, 2005, we randomly allocated 202,638 women: 50,640 (25.0%) to MMS, 50,639 (25.0%) to USS, and 101,359 (50.0%) to no screening. This trial is registered, number.

### Update in women's health for the general internist [^111xzGGT]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The randomized trial examining ovarian cancer screening has provided insights into the effectiveness of different methods. Annually, over 22,000 women in the United States are diagnosed with ovarian cancer, with more than 15,000 succumbing to the disease. Early-stage diagnosis (Stage I or II) significantly improves prognosis compared to later stages. At the time of writing, screening attempts using transvaginal ultrasound or CA125 tumor marker levels have not demonstrated a reduction in mortality.

This study investigated whether combined screening with transvaginal ultrasound and CA125 could lower ovarian cancer mortality. Over 34,000 women aged 55–74 years were randomized to receive annual transvaginal ultrasound and CA125 versus usual care for four years. Positive results led to management by the patient's personal physician. At the baseline screen, 5.8% of women tested positive for either method; among them, 33.8% (n = 566) underwent biopsy, resulting in the diagnosis of 18 new ovarian cancers (83% were Stage III or IV). By the end of the fourth round, 42 additional invasive cancers were diagnosed (67% late stage). During each screening round, the number of cancers diagnosed per 10,000 women screened ranged from 4.7 to 5.9. The surgery-to-invasive cancer ratio was 31:1 at baseline and decreased to 14:1 by the end of round four. Cases detected by ultrasound alone (normal CA125) were often early stage (71% of 14 cases) but led to most unnecessary surgeries. In contrast, cases identified by elevated CA125 (regardless of ultrasound results) predicted late-stage disease (79–89%).

### Screening for familial ovarian cancer: Poor survival of BRCA1/2 related cancers [^113xtQbS]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

To assess the effectiveness of annual ovarian cancer screening through transvaginal ultrasound and serum CA125 estimation in reducing mortality among women with an increased genetic risk, a cohort of 3532 women was screened across five European centers from January 1991 to March 2007. The survival from the diagnosis of ovarian cancer was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis, comparing proven BRCA1/2 carriers with non-carriers, and examining whether the cancer was detected at prevalence or post-prevalent scan. Screening involved annual transvaginal ultrasound and serum CA125 measurements.

Among the cohort, 64 epithelial ovarian malignancies (59 invasive and 5 borderline) were identified. Of these, 26 tumors were detected at the prevalent round, with 27 incident detected cancers and 11 interval cancers. Notably, 65% of the cancers were diagnosed at stage 3 or 4, with little difference in stage and survival between prevalent versus post-prevalent cancers. Among 49 BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, the five-year and ten-year survival rates were 58.6% (95% CI 50.9% to 66.3%) and 36% (95% CI 27% to 45%), respectively. This was significantly worse than the rates for 15 non-BRCA carriers, which were 91.8% (95% CI 84% to 99.6%) for both five and ten years, with both comparisons showing statistical significance (p = 0.015). However, the survival difference between carriers and non-carriers was not significant when borderline tumors were excluded.

In conclusion, annual surveillance using transvaginal ultrasound scans and serum CA125 measurements in women at increased familial risk of ovarian cancer is ineffective in detecting tumors at an early enough stage to impact overall survival.

### Results from four rounds of ovarian cancer screening in a randomized trial [^116MdpqP]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

The objective was to test whether annual screening with transvaginal ultrasonography and CA 125 reduces ovarian cancer mortality.

- **Methods**: Data from the first four annual screens, denoted T0-T3, are reported. A CA 125 value at or above 35 units/mL or an abnormality on transvaginal ultrasonography was considered a positive screen. Diagnostic follow-up of positive screens was performed at the discretion of participants' physicians. Diagnostic procedures and cancers were tracked and verified through medical records.

- **Results**: Among 34,261 screening arm women without prior oophorectomy, compliance with screening ranged from 83.1% (T0) to 77.6% (T3). Screen positivity rates declined slightly with transvaginal ultrasonography, from 4.6 at T0 to 2.9–3.4 at T1-T3; CA 125 positivity rates (range 1.4–1.8%) showed no time trend. Eighty-nine invasive ovarian or peritoneal cancers were diagnosed; 60 were screen detected. The positive predictive value (PPV) and cancer yield per 10,000 women screened on the combination of tests were similar across screening rounds (range 1.0–1.3% for PPV and 4.7–6.2 for yield); however, the biopsy (surgery) rate among screen positives decreased from 34% at T0 to 15–20% at T1-T3. The overall ratio of surgeries to screen-detected cancers was 19.5:1. Seventy-two percent of screen-detected cases were late stage (III/IV).

The conclusion is that through four screening rounds, the ratio of surgeries to screen-detected cancers was high, and most cases were late stage. However, the effect of screening on mortality is as yet unknown.

### Executive summary of the ovarian cancer evidence review conference [^1164rrFn]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funded the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) to create and disseminate educational material for clinicians on the early diagnosis and prevention of gynecologic cancers, including early-onset breast cancer. Ovarian cancer is relatively rare, ranking 17th among all cancers in the United States, with an incidence of 10.6 per 100,000 from 2015 to 2019. However, ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in women in the United States and is the deadliest form of gynecologic cancer. Due to its high mortality rate, ovarian cancer was chosen as the second gynecologic cancer for educational material development. To ensure that these materials were based on the most current literature and guidelines, an extensive literature review was conducted. This article serves as the evidence summary, which is presented in detail in Appendices 2–8, available online. The health care professional educational material is also available online.

### Assessing the rates of false-positive ovarian cancer screenings and surgical interventions associated with screening tools: A systematic review [^116zgbuT]. BMJ Oncology (2024). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer is the fifth-leading cause of cancer-related death among women worldwide. Early detection of ovarian cancer significantly enhances patient outcomes and improves overall survival rates, yet the disease frequently remains undetected until it has reached advanced stages, resulting in a poor 5-year survival rate. This underscores the necessity for efficient screening strategies to identify the disease at an earlier stage, which can markedly improve both treatment results and survival. Nevertheless, the United States Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend specific methods for routine ovarian cancer screening.

In the absence of recommended methods, serum tumor biomarkers and imaging techniques such as cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) have been traditionally used for diagnosing ovarian cancer in symptomatic patients and are also being considered as potential screening tools. However, these methods are prone to producing false-positive results. False-positive screenings can lead to unnecessary surgical interventions, such as bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, causing patients undue physical, economic, and emotional harm. For example, such procedures can result in infertility and induced menopause in premenopausal women. Therefore, given that these tests are the most common means of identifying ovarian cancer, it is essential to explore the potential risks of their use as screening tools.

When considering these tests and others as screening tools, stratifying populations between high-risk and average-risk patient populations is crucial.

### Ovarian cancer screening falls short [^112WwGP5]. Cancer Discovery (2021). Low credibility.

A massive study of ovarian cancer screening has determined that annual screening with ultrasound alone or CA125 testing, followed by ultrasound if necessary, does not reduce mortality in the general population. Although more early cases were identified through screening, the increase was not large enough to yield a statistically significant improvement in survival.

### Early detection of ovarian cancer [^1149bW4k]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Early detection is the only way to achieve a high cure rate in women with ovarian cancer. Unfortunately, at the time of writing, there is no effective strategy for early detection, despite rapidly emerging biomarkers. The low prevalence of ovarian cancer, low specificity, and high rates of false positives have been limitations of screening programs. In the hands of experts, transvaginal sonography and MRI are effective tools to characterize ovarian masses. Currently, ongoing efforts in standardization of technique and analysis are likely to improve diagnostic capabilities in clinical routine, as well as the introduction of predictive risk models of malignancy. Radiomics and radiogenomics potentially offer a broad spectrum of complementary information in ovarian cancer diagnosis and treatment.

- **Key points**: Transvaginal sonography and MRI are effective tools to characterize ovarian masses. Standardization of imaging technique and implementation of predictive models of risk of malignancy contribute to early detection of ovarian cancer.

### Ovarian cancer screening — current status, future directions [^116w4JmS]. Gynecologic Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Evidence of a mortality benefit continues to elude ovarian cancer (OC) screening. Data from the US Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, which used a screening strategy incorporating CA125 cut-off and transvaginal ultrasound, has not shown a mortality benefit. The United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) is using the Risk of Ovarian Cancer (ROC) time series algorithm to interpret CA125, which has shown encouraging sensitivity and specificity. However, the mortality data will only be available in 2015.

- **Impact on future screening**: The article explores the impact of growing insights into disease etiology and evolution and biomarker discovery on future screening strategies. A better understanding of the target lesion, improved design of biomarker discovery studies, and a focus on detecting low-volume disease using cancer-specific markers suggest that a new era in screening is underway. Novel biospecimens such as cervical cytology, targeted imaging, and the use of time series algorithms for interpreting marker profiles are also highlighted as significant advancements.

### Risk of malignancy in unilocular ovarian cystic tumors less than 10 centimeters in diameter [^115xkQte]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

To determine the natural history and to estimate the risk of malignancy of unilocular ovarian cystic tumors less than 10 cm in diameter, asymptomatic women at least 50 years old were followed conservatively by transvaginal ultrasound. From 1987 to 2002, 15,106 women entered the University of Kentucky's Ovarian Cancer Screening Program and underwent initial transvaginal ultrasonography. If the screening revealed nothing abnormal, women were asked to repeat transvaginal ultrasonography yearly. If abnormalities were detected, transvaginal ultrasonography was repeated in 4 to 6 weeks, along with Doppler flow ultrasonography and CA 125 testing.

Of the 15,106 women, 2763 women (18%) were diagnosed with 3259 unilocular ovarian cysts. A total of 2261 (69.4%) of these cysts resolved spontaneously, 537 (16.5%) developed a septum, 189 (5.8%) developed a solid area, and 220 (6.8%) persisted as a unilocular lesion. During this period, 27 women were diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and ten had been previously diagnosed with simple ovarian cysts. However, all ten women either developed another morphologic abnormality, experienced resolution of the cyst before developing cancer, or developed cancer in the contralateral ovary. No woman with an isolated unilocular cystic ovarian tumor developed ovarian cancer in this population.

In conclusion, the risk of malignancy in unilocular ovarian cystic tumors less than 10 cm in diameter in women 50 years old or older is extremely low. The majority of these cysts will resolve spontaneously and can be followed conservatively.

### ACR appropriateness criteria ovarian cancer screening [^113xh4ug]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

There has been much interest in identifying a successful ovarian cancer screening test, specifically one that can detect ovarian cancer at an early stage and improve survival. We reviewed the currently available data from randomized and observational trials examining the role of imaging for ovarian cancer screening in average-risk and high-risk women.

- **Screening in average-risk women**: We found insufficient evidence to recommend ovarian cancer screening when considering the imaging modality (pelvic ultrasound) and population (average-risk postmenopausal women) for which there is the greatest available published evidence; randomized controlled trials have not demonstrated a mortality benefit in this setting.

- **Screening in high-risk women**: Screening high-risk women using pelvic ultrasound may be appropriate in some clinical situations; however, related data are limited because large, randomized trials have not been performed in this setting.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence.

### Frequency and disposition of ovarian abnormalities followed with serial transvaginal ultrasonography [^1121TjsM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to examine the prevalence, incidence, persistence, and resolution of ovarian abnormalities using serial transvaginal ultrasonography. A group of 39,337 women in the University of Kentucky Ovarian Cancer Screening Program were monitored with 221,576 baseline and interval transvaginal ultrasonographies.

The results showed that the transvaginal ultrasonogram was normal for first and all subsequent visits for 31,834 participants (80.9%), whereas 6,807 women (17.3%) had transvaginal ultrasonograms interpreted as abnormal and were monitored over 21,588 ultrasonograms. Ovarian cysts were more common in premenopausal women (prevalence 34.9%, incidence 15.3%) than in postmenopausal women (prevalence 17.0%, incidence 8.2%).

For the group with abnormalities, the initial transvaginal ultrasonogram was abnormal in 46.7% of the cases, of which 63.2% resolved to normal on subsequent ultrasonograms. Of 35,314 cases classified as normal on the first examination, 9.9% were abnormal on subsequent annual examinations. The abnormal findings were classified as follows: unilocular cysts (11.5%), cysts with septations (9.8%), cysts with solid areas (7.1%), and solid masses (1.8%). Many transvaginal ultrasonographic abnormalities were followed to resolution.

Surgery was performed on 557 participants for 85 ovarian malignancies and 472 nonmalignancies. Over the duration of the study, the positive predictive value (PPV) increased from 8.1% to 24.7%.

In conclusion, serial ultrasonography has shown that many ovarian abnormalities resolve, even if the initial appearance is complex, solid, or bilateral.

ACOG guidelines for the evaluation of women with a pelvic mass employ a combination of physical exam, imaging, and CA125 to guide physicians in the triage of women to gynecologic oncologists. We studied the use of ROMA with clinical assessment for cancer risk assessment in women with a pelvic mass.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective, multicenter trial evaluating women with a pelvic mass who had an initial clinical risk assessment (ICRA) performed by a generalist. ROMA scores were calculated, and sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were determined for ICRA and ICRA+ROMA.

- **Results**: A total of 461 women were entered into the study. There were 375 benign tumors, 48 EOC, 18 LMP tumors, and 20 non-ovarian malignancies. For detection of ovarian cancer alone, ICRA had a sensitivity of 85.4%, a specificity of 84.3%, and a NPV of 97.8%. Adding ROMA to ICRA produced a significant improvement of 8.4% in sensitivity, achieving a sensitivity of 93.8% with a specificity of 67.2% and a NPV of 98.8%. Examination of all malignancies (ovarian & non-ovarian) provided a sensitivity of 89.7% for ROMA+ICRA in comparison to 77.9% for ICRA alone, a significant increase in sensitivity of 11.8%. The NPV also significantly increased from 95.5% to 97.3%. Overall, ROMA detected 13 additional malignancies missed by ICRA.

- **Conclusions**: Adjunctive use of ROMA with clinical assessment improves the stratification of women with a pelvic mass into low and high-risk groups for ovarian cancer. The combination is particularly effective in ruling out malignant disease.

### The management of ovarian cysts in postmenopausal women [^116LWpKe]. RCOG (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ovarian cancer, particularly in relation to diagnostic imaging, the 2016 RCOG guidelines recommend obtaining transvaginal ultrasound studies. These studies should use multifrequency probes operated by trained clinicians with expertise in gynecological imaging.

### Screening for ovarian cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^117A1CVp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) reaffirmed its 2004 recommendation statement on screening for ovarian cancer in 2012. A review of the literature commissioned by the USPSTF in 2008 did not reveal new evidence about the benefits of screening for ovarian cancer but did provide some new data concerning observed harms. A bridge search conducted until 2011 focused on evidence from randomized, controlled trials.

This recommendation is applicable to asymptomatic women and does not extend to women with known genetic mutations that increase the risk of ovarian cancer, such as BRCA mutations. The USPSTF recommends against screening for ovarian cancer in women (D recommendation).

### Ovarian cancer prevention and screening [^111NZ4Ti]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

There has been much progress in ovarian cancer screening and prevention in recent years. Improved tools that combine genetic and epidemiologic factors to predict an individual's ovarian cancer risk are set to become available for tailoring preventive and screening approaches. Increasing evidence on the tubal origins of a proportion of ovarian cancer has paved the way for the use of opportunistic bilateral salpingectomy at tubal ligation and hysterectomy in the general population.

Clinical trials are in progress to estimate the long-term effects on endocrine function. In women at high risk, risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy remains the standard of care, focusing on the management of resulting non-cancer outcomes, especially sexual dysfunction in younger women. This has led to the evaluation of early bilateral salpingectomy and delayed oophorectomy in this population. Meanwhile, modeling suggests that BRCA mutation carriers should consider using the oral contraceptive pill for chemoprevention.

In the general population, the largest ovarian cancer screening trial at the time of writing, the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening, reported a stage shift with annual multimodal screening using the longitudinal CA 125 Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm, but not with annual transvaginal ultrasound screening. There was no definitive mortality reduction with either screening strategy compared to no screening. Further follow-up until December 2018 is now underway. Stage shift and higher rates of optimal cytoreduction were also reported during 3- to 4-month multimodal screening in the Un.

### Assessing the rates of false-positive ovarian cancer screenings and surgical interventions associated with screening tools: A systematic review [^111UFsdo]. BMJ Oncology (2024). Low credibility.

Additionally, the observed variability in false-positive rates across studies could be partly attributed to the inherent limitations of the screening methods. For example, previous studies have shown that the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound is highly dependent on the operator's experience. Timmerman et al. analyzed the use of ultrasound in the diagnosis of adnexal masses, finding that experienced operators were more accurate (91%) compared with less experienced operators (82%–87%). Similar findings have been observed in other disease sites, where there was notable variation in radiological assessments based on the individual. This highlights the need for involvement of clinicians experienced in the use of ultrasound prior to discussions around surgery, particularly for individuals presenting with clinically ambiguous lesions on initial imaging.

Only four studies reported on the physical consequences of unnecessary surgical interventions. The results from these studies indicate that approximately 15% of individuals experienced complications including perforation, blood loss, bowel injury, fainting, and bruising. In the study by Buys et al, they found that of the 1080 patients who underwent surgery for a false-positive result, 163 of them experienced major complications. The limited data on complications from ovarian cancer screening highlight a critical gap in understanding the physical impacts on patients. For instance, a study focusing on colorectal cancer screenings found surgery to be the main cause of morbidity and mortality in the colorectal screening program.

### Time to de-implementation of low-value cancer screening practices: A narrative review [^112m7Gkh]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2025). Low credibility.

- **Ovarian cancer screening in asymptomatic women**: The 1996 ovarian cancer screening Grade D guideline cited studies published in 1990, 1991, and 1993, showing no benefit of pelvic screening, serum tumour testing, and transvaginal ultrasound screening methods. Subsequent USPSTF guidelines cited two large RCTs published in 2011 and 2016 to support the continuation of the Grade D rating. Two national surveys measured physician-reported ovarian cancer screening practices after the guideline publication. A 2012 survey of women's primary care physicians (n = 1088, response rate 61.7%) found that 28% of respondents reported performing inappropriate screening. Similarly, a 2016 survey of gynaecologists (n = 401, response rate 67.1%) found that 58% of respondents reported regularly recommending inappropriate screening. Given the lack of evidence on pre-guideline practice trends, our characterization of the time to de-implementation is limited to the 3 years between the publication of evidence demonstrating the lack of benefit of screening (1993) and the release of the USPSTF guidelines (1996).

- **Thyroid cancer screening in asymptomatic adults**: The Grade D recommendation for thyroid cancer screening was issued in 1996 and cited studies published as late as 1992. The recommendation statement described a lack of evidence for screening benefits and poor accuracy of available screening methods. The 2017 guideline evidence review also found insufficient evidence to support screening for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic adults or children. A meta-analysis of seven single-centre observational studies was published…

### Estimating sojourn time and sensitivity of screening for ovarian cancer using a Bayesian framework [^113pHnES]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2024). High credibility.

Ovarian cancer is among the leading causes of gynecologic cancer-related death. Past ovarian cancer screening trials using a combination of cancer antigen 125 testing and transvaginal ultrasound failed to yield statistically significant mortality reduction. Estimates of ovarian cancer sojourn time — that is, the period from when the cancer is first screen detectable until clinical detection — may inform future screening programs.

- **Methods**: We modeled ovarian cancer progression as a continuous-time Markov chain and estimated screening modality-specific sojourn time and sensitivity using a Bayesian approach. Model inputs were derived from the screening arms (multimodal and ultrasound) of the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian cancer screening trials. We assessed the quality of our estimates by using the posterior predictive P value. We derived histology-specific sojourn times by adjusting the overall sojourn time based on the corresponding histology-specific survival from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program.

- **Results**: The overall ovarian cancer sojourn time was 2.1 years (posterior predictive P value = .469) in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian studies, with a screening sensitivity of 65.7%. The sojourn time was 2.0 years (posterior predictive P value = .532) in the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening's multimodal screening arm and 2.4 years (posterior predictive P value = .640) in the ultrasound screening arm, with sensitivities of 93.2% and 64.5%, respectively.

### Ovarian cancer population screening and mortality after long-term follow-up in the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS): a randomised controlled trial [^111UR7gt]. Lancet (2021). High credibility.

Ovarian cancer continues to have a poor prognosis with the majority of women diagnosed with advanced disease. Therefore, we undertook the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) to determine if population screening can reduce deaths due to the disease. We report on ovarian cancer mortality after long-term follow-up in UKCTOCS.

- **Methods**: In this randomised controlled trial, postmenopausal women aged 50–74 years were recruited from 13 centers in National Health Service trusts in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Exclusion criteria were bilateral oophorectomy, previous ovarian or active non-ovarian malignancy, or increased familial ovarian cancer risk. The trial management system confirmed eligibility and randomly allocated participants in blocks of 32 using computer-generated random numbers to annual multimodal screening (MMS), annual transvaginal ultrasound screening (USS), or no screening, in a 1:1:2 ratio. Follow-up was through national registries. The primary outcome was death due to ovarian or tubal cancer (WHO 2014 criteria) by June 30, 2020. Analyses were by intention to screen, comparing MMS and USS separately with no screening using the versatile test. Investigators and participants were aware of screening type, whereas the outcomes review committee was masked to the randomisation group.

- **Findings**: Between April 17, 2001, and Sept 29, 2005, of 1,243,282 women invited, 202,638 were recruited and randomly assigned, and 202,562 were included in the analysis.

### Guideline no. 403: Initial investigation and management of adnexal masses [^116LyW2P]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ovarian cancer, particularly with respect to diagnostic imaging, the SOGC 2020 guidelines recommend using risk prediction models, such as the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis group simple rules. These models are used for the ultrasound evaluation of adnexal masses, allowing operators with varying degrees of expertise to employ uniform terminology and accurately classify these masses as "likely malignant", "benign", or "indeterminate".

### Sensitivity and specificity of multimodal and ultrasound screening for ovarian cancer, and stage distribution of detected cancers: Results of the prevalence screen of the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) [^11664iqZ]. The Lancet Oncology (2009). High credibility.

Ovarian cancer has a high case-fatality ratio, with most women not diagnosed until the disease is in its advanced stages. The United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) is a randomized controlled trial designed to assess the effect of screening on mortality. This report summarizes the outcome of the prevalence (initial) screen in UKCTOCS.

- **Methods**: Between 2001 and 2005, a total of 202,638 post-menopausal women aged 50–74 years were randomly assigned to no treatment (control; n = 101,359); annual CA125 screening (interpreted using a risk of ovarian cancer algorithm) with transvaginal ultrasound scan as a second-line test (multimodal screening [MMS]; n = 50,640); or annual screening with transvaginal ultrasound (USS; n = 50,639) alone, in a 2:1:1 ratio using a computer-generated random number algorithm. All women provided a blood sample at recruitment. Women randomized to the MMS group had their blood tested for CA125 and those randomized to the USS group were sent an appointment to attend for a transvaginal scan. Women with abnormal screens had repeat tests. Women with persistent abnormality on repeat screens underwent clinical evaluation and, where appropriate, surgery. This trial is registered as ISRCTN22488978 and with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00058032.

- **Findings**: In the prevalence screen, 50,078 (98.9%) women underwent MMS, and 48,230 (95.2%) underwent USS. The main reasons for withdrawal were death (two MMS, 28 USS), non-ovarian cancer or other disease (none MMS, 66 USS), removal of ovaries (five MMS, 29 USS), and relocation (none MMS).

### Ovarian cancer population screening and mortality after long-term follow-up in the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS): a randomised controlled trial [^113UN7Fb]. Lancet (2021). High credibility.

Ovarian cancer remains the most deadly of all gynaecological cancers. Most patients (58%) are diagnosed at an advanced stage (III or IV), which is associated with poor survival (5-year survival is 27% for stage III and 13% for stage IV ovarian cancer). The greater than 90% survival rates in women detected at stage I have spurred international efforts in early detection spanning across four decades. All trials have used combinations of the biomarker CA125 and pelvic imaging using transvaginal ultrasound scans (TVS). Despite these extensive endeavors, at the time of writing, there is no evidence that screening for ovarian cancer saves lives.

In our multicentre randomised trial (UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening [UKCTOCS]), 202,638 women from the general population were randomly assigned to two annual screening groups — multimodal screening (MMS; longitudinal CA125 and second line TVS) and ultrasound screening (USS; TVS first and second-line test), and a no screening group. We reported previously, with a median follow-up of 11.1 years, that an absolute proportion of 13% more women with ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancer were diagnosed with stage I or II disease in the MMS group than in the no screening group. There was no change in stage in the USS group. There was no evidence of a reduction in disease-specific deaths in either screened group compared with the no screening group, using the Cox version of the log-rank test. The observed reduction in deaths was delayed, and the cumulative mortality curves appeared to be diverging at the time of previous reporting.

### The management of ovarian cysts in postmenopausal women [^115rmLvZ]. RCOG (2016). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ovarian cancer, specifically in relation to diagnostic imaging, the RCOG 2016 guidelines recommend not using transabdominal ultrasound in isolation. Instead, it should be used to provide supplementary information to transvaginal ultrasound, especially when an ovarian cyst is large or extends beyond the field of view of the transvaginal ultrasound.

### Screening for familial ovarian cancer: Failure of current protocols to detect ovarian cancer at an early stage according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics system [^115rF2JQ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

To assess the effectiveness of annual ovarian cancer screening — comprising transvaginal ultrasound and serum CA-125 estimation — in detecting presymptomatic ovarian cancer in women at increased genetic risk, a cohort of 1,110 women was screened between January 1991 and March 2004. Of these, 553 were identified as moderate-risk individuals (4% to 10% lifetime risk), and 557 were high-risk individuals (> 10% lifetime risk).

Outcome measurements included the number and stage of screen-detected cancers, the number and stage of cancers not detected at screening, the number of equivocal screening results requiring recall/repetition, and the number of women undergoing surgery for benign disease.

Thirteen epithelial ovarian malignancies (12 invasive and one borderline) developed in the cohort. Ten tumors were detected at screening: three International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I (including borderline), two stage II, four stage III, and one stage IV. Of the three cancers not detected by screening, two were stage III and one was stage IV. Additionally, 29 women underwent diagnostic surgery but were found not to have ovarian cancer.

The study concludes that annual surveillance via transvaginal ultrasound scanning and serum CA-125 measurement in women at increased familial risk of ovarian cancer is ineffective in detecting tumors at a sufficiently early stage to influence prognosis. With a positive predictive value of 17% and sensitivity of less than 50%, the performance of ultrasound does not satisfy WHO screening standards.

### Assessing the risk of ovarian malignancy in asymptomatic women with abnormal CA 125 and transvaginal ultrasound scans in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Screening Trial [^1143zkfb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

To estimate the risk of ovarian malignancy among asymptomatic women with abnormal transvaginal ultrasound scans or CA 125 and to provide guidance to physicians managing these women.

- **Methods**: A cohort of women from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial with abnormal ovarian results at the initial (T0) and subsequent (T1+) screens were analyzed to estimate which findings were associated with a high risk of ovarian cancer. Cancer risks more than 10% were designated as high, and risks of 3% or less were designated as low.

- **Results**:
	- **For the T0 screen, two high-risk categories were identified**: CA 125 of 70 or more with a negative transvaginal ultrasound scan (positive predictive value [PPV] 15.9%, CI 14.7–17.7%); and positive for both CA 125 and transvaginal ultrasound scan (PPV 25.0%, CI 23.3–27.3%).
	- **For T1+ screens, three high-risk categories were identified**: negative transvaginal ultrasound scan with a change in CA 125 of 45 or more (PPV 29.0%, CI 28.3–30.3%); increase in size of cyst 6 cm or more with negative CA 125 (PPV 13.3%, CI 10.5–18.0%); and positive for both tests (PPV 42.9%, CI 40.0–46.0%).
	- High-risk criteria for T0 provide a sensitivity of 60%, specificity of 96.2%, PPV of 19.7%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.3%. T1+ criteria yielded a sensitivity of 85.3%, specificity of 95.6%, PPV of 29.6%, and NPV of 99.7%.

- **Conclusions**: High-risk categories for predicting the risk of cancer in women with abnormal CA 125, transvaginal ultrasound scan, or both at initial and subsequent screens have been identified.

### Screening for ovarian cancer: Updated evidence report and systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force [^111e1WBz]. JAMA (2018). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer is relatively rare but is the fifth-leading cause of cancer mortality among United States women. This report aims to systematically review the evidence on the benefits and harms of ovarian cancer screening among average-risk women to inform the United States Preventive Services Task Force.

Key data sources included MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials, with studies published in English from January 1, 2003, through January 31, 2017. Ongoing surveillance in targeted publications continued through November 22, 2017.

The study selection focused on randomized clinical trials of ovarian cancer screening in average-risk women that reported mortality or quality-of-life outcomes. Interventions involved transvaginal ultrasound, cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) testing, or their combination, with comparators being usual care or no screening.

Data extraction and synthesis were conducted independently by two reviewers who performed critical appraisals and data abstraction. Due to the small number of studies and heterogeneity of interventions, meta-analytic pooling of results was not performed.

The main outcomes and measures assessed included ovarian cancer mortality, false-positive screening results and subsequent surgeries, surgical complications, and the psychological effects of screening.

In the results, four trials comprising 293,587 participants were included. Out of these, three trials (n = 293,038) assessed ovarian cancer mortality, and one trial (n = 549) focused solely on psychological outcomes. Screening interventions evaluated were transvaginal ultrasound alone, transvaginal ultrasound plus CA-125 testing, and CA-125 testing alone. Test positivity for CA-125 was defined by a fixed serum level.

### Management of suspected ovarian masses in premenopausal women [^111PVfYr]. RCOG (2011). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for ovarian cancer, specifically in the context of monitoring ovarian cysts, the BSGE/RCOG 2011 guidelines recommend obtaining annual ultrasound surveillance for patients with simple ovarian cysts measuring 5–7 cm in diameter. For patients with larger simple cysts, consideration should be given to either obtaining further imaging, such as an MRI, or offering surgical intervention.
