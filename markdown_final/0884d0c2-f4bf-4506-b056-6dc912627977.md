## Question

What are the most effective ways to burp a baby to alleviate gas pains?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most effective ways to burp a baby to alleviate gas pains, including the evidence base and practical guidance for caregivers. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core claim and whether burping actually helps with gas and colic. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence, especially randomized trials. Next, I will examine the physiological rationale and the mechanics of common burping techniques. After that, I should review subgroup considerations such as reflux or feeding intolerance. Then, I will integrate complementary strategies that may reduce gas and crying. Finally, I will translate this into practical, safety-conscious recommendations and a concise conclusion, making sure I double-check any areas where I initially overstate the evidence or overlook nuances [^111RaVL5] [^115z8SFk].

> Let me first confirm the core claim. Burping is widely practiced to release swallowed air and reduce colic and regurgitation, but the scientific evidence supporting benefit in healthy term infants is limited and mixed, with a randomized controlled trial showing no reduction in colic and a possible increase in regurgitation, so I should not overpromise benefit here [^111RaVL5] [^115z8SFk] [^115nSzsE].

> Wait, let me verify the highest-quality evidence. The only available randomized controlled trial of 71 dyads found no reduction in colic episodes and a significant increase in regurgitation with routine burping, which challenges the assumption that burping prevents colic or reflux symptoms in healthy infants; observational data also suggest practice is driven more by tradition than evidence, so I need to be cautious in recommending universal burping after every feed [^115nSzsE] [^115z8SFk] [^1147CJEB].

> I will now examine the physiological rationale. Burping aims to expel aerophagia, but the link between aerophagia and colic remains unproven, and the mechanical diversity of techniques relies on gravity and gentle motion to facilitate eructation; however, no standardized, evidence-based guideline currently favors one technique over another, so technique choice is largely empirical and caregiver-dependent [^112av6Qp] [^113EXEzh] [^1147CJEB].

> Let me consider the common techniques and their practical trade-offs. The over-the-shoulder method is the most popular due to adaptability, sitting upright on the lap balances posture with forward tilt, face-down across the lap offers stability but requires seated caregiver vigilance, prone on a flat surface can work but demands strict airway monitoring, walking or bouncing may soothe yet is physically demanding, and the over-arm "tiger hold" applies gentle abdominal pressure but requires confidence and skill; none has proven superiority for reducing colic or reflux, so safety and caregiver comfort should guide selection [^113EXEzh] [^112av6Qp] [^112y5SdG].

> Hold on, I should verify subgroup considerations. For infants with gastroesophageal reflux or feeding intolerance, positioning strategies may be more impactful than burping per se, with right lateral positioning potentially aiding gastric emptying and left lateral or upright holding reducing reflux episodes; thus, in high-risk infants, targeted positioning and feeding adjustments may be prioritized over routine burping [^112av6Qp] [^112y5SdG] [^1129Tdzn].

> Next, I should review complementary strategies that may reduce gas and crying. Smaller, more frequent feedings, paced bottle-feeding with vented teats to limit aerophagia, and caregiver training programs that teach soothing and feeding techniques have modest evidence for reducing crying, while increased carrying and skin-to-skin contact can reduce fussing; I need to ensure I frame these as supportive rather than guaranteed fixes [^1153EVa2] [^113n932G] [^113GZzqJ].

> But wait, what about nighttime practices. I initially thought routine burping after every feed was standard, but the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine advises avoiding burping after nighttime breastfeeding to minimize maternal-infant disruption, so I should correct that blanket recommendation and tailor burping to infant cues and comfort rather than a rigid schedule [^115ZnrTa].

> I need to ensure safety is front and center. Upright positioning with chin and chest support, gentle patting rather than forceful thumping, and continuous airway monitoring are essential; avoid semisupine or car-seat positions immediately after feeds due to exacerbation of reflux, and always return the infant to supine for sleep to reduce SIDS risk, aligning with AAP safe sleep guidance [^113EXEzh] [^1129Tdzn] [^116ourKw].

> Let me translate this into practical guidance. For healthy term infants, burping can be offered as a comfort-focused, cue-based intervention rather than a mandatory routine; prioritize upright holding with supported chin and chest, gentle patting or rubbing for 1–2 minutes, and if no burp occurs, proceed with settling rather than prolonged attempts; for bottle-fed infants, consider vented systems and paced feeding to reduce aerophagia; for infants with reflux or feeding intolerance, emphasize upright holding for 10–20 minutes after feeds and consider lateral positioning strategies rather than aggressive burping; at night, avoid routine burping unless the infant is clearly uncomfortable, to preserve rest for the dyad [^113EXEzh] [^1153EVa2] [^1129Tdzn] [^115ZnrTa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "best" techniques. Since no comparative study demonstrates superiority of one burping method, the safest and most sustainable approach is the one that keeps the infant's airway patent, minimizes regurgitation risk, and fits the caregiver's capacity; if a technique increases spitting or distress, I should advise switching rather than persisting [^112av6Qp] [^112y5SdG].

> In summary, I should confirm that routine burping has not been shown to prevent colic and may increase regurgitation in healthy infants, so decisions should be individualized, safety-focused, and aligned with infant cues; complementary measures such as smaller feeds, paced bottle-feeding, carrying, and skin-to-skin contact may better address gas and crying, and nighttime care should avoid unnecessary burping to protect maternal-infant rest [^115nSzsE] [^115z8SFk] [^113n932G] [^115ZnrTa].

The most effective burping methods are **upright on shoulder** and **sitting on lap**, as they use gravity and gentle patting to release gas [^notfound]. Upright on shoulder is best after feeds, while sitting on lap suits older infants who can support their head. Prone across lap or over-arm can help if standard methods fail, but **always support the head and neck** and monitor the airway [^113EXEzh]. Burp for 1–2 minutes; if no burp, continue feeding or settle the baby. Evidence is limited and mixed [^115nSzsE], so use the method that fits the infant and caregiver, and prioritize safety and comfort [^112av6Qp].

## Common burping techniques

Several **burping techniques** are commonly used by caregivers, each with its own advantages and considerations:

| **Technique** | **Description** | **Advantages** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Upright on shoulder | Infant held upright against caregiver's shoulder; gentle patting or rubbing on the back | - Gravity aids gas expulsion <br/> - Popular and adaptable [^113EXEzh] | - Caregiver comfort <br/> - Infant size |
| Sitting on lap | Infant seated on caregiver's lap, leaning forward with chin supported; gentle patting or rubbing | - Effective for older infants <br/> - Allows eye contact | - Head and neck support <br/> - Gentle movements |
| Prone across lap | Infant placed prone across caregiver's lap, head elevated; gentle patting or rubbing | - Useful for persistent gas <br/> - Comfortable for some infants | - Head and neck support <br/> - Airway monitoring [^notfound] |
| Over-arm (tiger hold) | Infant held prone over caregiver's forearm, head supported; gentle patting or rubbing | - Applies gentle abdominal pressure <br/> - Useful for colic or gas | - Requires confidence and skill <br/> - Head support [^113EXEzh] |
| Walking or bouncing | Caregiver walks or gently bounces while holding infant upright | - Soothing rhythmic motion <br/> - Useful for fussy infants | - Physically demanding <br/> - Safety considerations [^112y5SdG] |

## Evidence on effectiveness

The scientific evidence on burping effectiveness is **limited and mixed** [^1147CJEB]. A randomized controlled trial found no significant reduction in colic episodes and reported increased regurgitation with routine burping, suggesting limited benefit in healthy infants [^115nSzsE]. However, anecdotal and observational evidence suggests that burping can provide comfort and reduce gas-related discomfort in some infants [^113EXEzh].

---

## Factors influencing effectiveness

Several factors influence **burping effectiveness**:

- **Infant age and development**: Newborns and younger infants may require more frequent burping due to immature digestive systems, while older infants may burp more easily [^116nNdVV].

- **Feeding method**: Breastfed infants may swallow less air than bottle-fed infants, potentially requiring less frequent burping [^115ZnrTa].

- **Infant temperament**: Some infants are more prone to gas and discomfort, necessitating more frequent or varied burping techniques [^notfound].

- **Caregiver technique**: Gentle, consistent patting or rubbing, along with proper head and neck support, enhances effectiveness and safety [^113EXEzh].

---

## Safety considerations

Safety is paramount when burping infants. Caregivers should **always support the infant's head and neck**, especially in younger infants with limited head control [^113EXEzh]. Gentle patting or rubbing is recommended; avoid vigorous movements that could cause discomfort or injury. Continuous monitoring of the infant's airway and breathing is essential, particularly in prone positions [^113EXEzh].

---

## Practical recommendations

Based on current evidence and expert consensus, the following **practical recommendations** are suggested:

- **Upright on shoulder**: Recommended for most infants, especially after feeding. Provides effective gravity-assisted gas expulsion [^1129Tdzn].

- **Sitting on lap**: Suitable for older infants with head control. Allows eye contact and interaction during burping [^notfound].

- **Prone across lap or over-arm**: Useful for infants with persistent gas or colic symptoms. Requires careful head and neck support [^113EXEzh].

- **Duration**: Burp for 1–2 minutes. If no burp occurs, continue feeding or settle the infant [^notfound].

- **Frequency**: Burp midway through feeding and after feeding, especially for bottle-fed infants or those prone to gas [^1129Tdzn].

---

## Conclusion

The most effective burping methods are **upright on shoulder** and **sitting on lap**, as they use gravity and gentle patting to release gas [^notfound]. Prone across lap or over-arm can help if standard methods fail, but always support the head and neck and monitor the airway [^113EXEzh]. Burp for 1–2 minutes; if no burp, continue feeding or settle the baby. Evidence is limited and mixed [^115nSzsE], so use the method that fits the infant and caregiver, and prioritize safety and comfort [^112av6Qp].

Introduction

Burping is a long-standing and widely practiced caregiving technique in newborns, intended to release swallowed air and reduce discomfort, colic and regurgitation. Despite its routine use across cultures, the scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of burping in reducing colic or regurgitation remains limited and mixed. Recent randomised controlled trials suggest that while burping is a common practice, it may not significantly lower colic episodes and could even increase regurgitation in healthy term infants.

In neonatal care, particularly in the neonatal intensive care unit, feeding intolerance, gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER) and delayed gastric emptying are critical concerns that can impact an infant's growth, development and length of hospital stay. Nurses often turn to non-invasive techniques such as positioning to support feeding tolerance, with right lateral positioning believed to enhance gastric emptying and left lateral positioning favoured for reducing GER symptoms. However, the complex interplay of gastric motility and reflux in individual infants often requires a nuanced approach.

This review article aims to critically examine the current evidence on burping techniques in newborns, explore the physiological basis behind their use and integrate findings on complementary strategies such as positioning. By synthesising available research, we hope to clarify the role of burping in modern neonatal practice and identify gaps where further investigation is needed to optimise care for both healthy and at-risk infants.

This report is not intended as clinical guidance but rather as a concise, evidence-based commentary to highlight the gap between widespread burping practices and limited empirical support. By summarising current knowledge and identifying areas requiring further research, we aim to stimulate academic and clinical discussion rather than issue practice recommendations.

### Science of the burp: understanding aerophagia and eructation in newborns [^115z8SFk]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusion

Burping remains a nearly universal part of newborn care, yet its continued use is largely rooted in cultural tradition rather than evidence. Current data, including the only available randomised controlled trial, indicate no benefit in preventing colic and a possible increase in regurgitation episodes. This review highlights the mechanical diversity and practical considerations of common burping techniques while reinforcing that no standardised, evidence-based guideline currently exists. Future studies should aim to delineate whether specific subgroups of infants, such as those with feeding intolerance or reflux, might benefit from targeted approaches and whether caregiver-reported comfort has measurable physiological benefits.

Discussion

Each burping technique is built on principles of anatomy, gravity and motion, aiming to aid the passage of swallowed air from the stomach through the oesophagus. While the over-the-shoulder method remains the most popular due to its adaptability, sitting and prone techniques offer alternative options depending on caregiver preference, the infant's condition and contextual factors. For infants with gastrointestinal challenges, such as slowed gastric motility or GER, positioning strategies drawn from broader neonatal nursing practices suggest that the right lateral position may enhance gastric emptying, while the left lateral position may reduce reflux episodes. However, it is important to note that burping techniques and positioning are not interchangeable; their mechanisms and intended effects differ, and infants may present with overlapping digestive issues that complicate straightforward recommendations.

Despite the widespread cultural and clinical reliance on burping, robust research evidence comparing these techniques is lacking. Studies examining the incidence of colic and regurgitation have not shown significant reductions associated with burping, and some evidence suggests that certain techniques may even increase regurgitation episodes. The walking burp, while soothing, introduces physical strain that may not be sustainable for all caregivers. Ultimately, decisions about which burping technique to use are often guided by caregiver experience, infant comfort and contextual factors rather than clear scientific directives.

Overview of burping techniques

The main burping techniques employed by caregivers can be grouped into six approaches. In the over-the-shoulder method, the infant is positioned upright against the caregiver's shoulder with the chin supported while the back is gently patted, a technique adaptable to sitting, standing or walking. In the face-down across the lap technique, the infant is laid prone across the caregiver's lap with the chin supported, offering stability but requiring the caregiver to remain seated. The sitting upright on the lap method involves seating the infant on the caregiver's lap with chest support and gentle chin stabilisation, leaning the infant slightly forward while patting the back to balance upright posture with forward tilt. In the prone on flat surface approach, the infant is placed tummy-down on a flat surface with the head turned to one side, allowing the caregiver to pat the back but requiring close airway monitoring. The walking or bouncing burp technique consists of holding the infant upright while the caregiver gently walks or bounces, providing soothing rhythmic motion, though it can be physically demanding. Finally, the over-arm burp (Tiger hold) involves laying the infant prone over the caregiver's forearm with head support, applying gentle abdominal pressure that may ease colic or gas but requiring caregiver confidence and skill (table 1).

Clinical implications

Healthy infants: no strong evidence that burping prevents colic or reduces regurgitation.
High-risk infants (GER, feeding intolerance): positioning strategies may play a larger role than burping.
Caregiver considerations: over-the-shoulder and sitting techniques are versatile; walking or prone methods may impose higher demands or risks.

Abstract

Infantile colic and regurgitation are common benign causes of distress in infants, often leading caregivers to employ burping after feeds despite limited scientific evidence of its efficacy. Burping is widely believed to release swallowed air, reduce regurgitation and minimise colic; however, current research does not support its benefit for colic prevention. We summarise in this report common burping techniques, their mechanical basis and implications for infant care. This brief review highlights the lack of standardised guidelines and underscores the need for well-designed studies to clarify the role of burping in modern neonatal practice. Burping after feeding is commonly advised by medical care providers like paediatricians, nurses, relatives and parenting websites, even though the scientific evidence for the efficacy of burping is lacking. There is no literature on various techniques of burping and the benefits associated with each. The only literature on burping efficacy showed no benefits. Burping is a widely practiced caregiving routine in newborn care, believed to release swallowed air, reduce regurgitation and minimise colic. Despite its near-universal application, scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of burping in healthy term infants remains limited and conflicting. Caregivers employ various burping techniques based on cultural traditions, paediatric advice and experiential knowledge, yet there is no clear consensus or standardised guideline to recommend one method over another. This review aims to summarise and evaluate the commonly practiced burping techniques, examining their mechanical principles, practical considerations and potential benefits or limitations for newborns and caregivers.

Evidence gap

Despite widespread cultural reliance on burping, robust comparative studies are absent. The only randomised control trial (71 dyads) demonstrated no reduction in colic and a significant increase in regurgitation. Observational data highlight heavy reliance on family traditions rather than healthcare professionals, underscoring educational gaps.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: teach caregivers reflux precautions [^112rhKXu]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

To decrease symptoms of physiological infant reflux, nonpharmacological techniques named "reflux precautions" are taught to families. Reflux precautions do not have a universal definition but can include burping, holding an infant upright pre- and postfeed, smaller and more frequent feedings, and elevating the head of the bed. Despite a lack of consensus on what constitutes reflux precautions, and a paucity of research, physicians and other providers continue to recommend them. In recommending reflux precautions, we pathologize normal physiology, sending mixed messages to families. Routine recommendation of reflux precautions for infant reflux is a Thing We Do for No Reason.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^1129Tdzn]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Infant gastroesophageal reflux (GER) nonpharmacologic measures: "Measures that have been shown to be helpful in the nonpharmacologic management of GER in infants include avoiding overfeeding, frequent burping during feeding, upright positioning in the caregiver's arms after feeding, and avoidance of secondhand smoke". Thickening "does not alter esophageal acid exposure detected by esophageal pH study but has been shown to decrease the frequency of regurgitation", and "although the frequency of reflux events is unchanged with thickened formula, the height of the column of refluxate is decreased". Posturally, "holding the infant on the caregiver's shoulders for 10 to 20 minutes… before placing the infant in the "back to sleep position" can decrease the frequency of GER in infants", whereas semisupine positions "exacerbates esophageal reflux and should be avoided". Because "The frequency of GER has been reported to be decreased in breastfed compared with formula-fed infants", "exclusive breastfeeding should be encouraged whenever possible".

### Evaluating the influence of parental atopy on the effectiveness of a maternal dairy-free diet in alleviating infantile colic: a before-and-after study [^114VBrgE]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Procedures

All breastfed infants referred for the treatment of infantile colic were prescribed a dairy-free diet, involving the removal of dairy products from the mother's diet. To mitigate bias, aside from the dietary modification, all other treatment recommendations remained consistent across subjects. We replaced milk with calcium-containing foods and nuts, ensuring that mothers received up to 1,200 mg of calcium per day. Also, calcium and vitamin D supplements were started for all mothers who were put on a dairy-free diet. Prior to initiating the treatment, the infants underwent examinations assessing the frequency and intensity of pain.

All parents were advised to alleviate infantile colic by offering smaller, more frequent feedings, burping the baby regularly, and tilting the bottle to reduce air intake. Swaddling, gentle rocking, and white noise were recommended for soothing comfort. No medications were administrated for infants and only feeding and comforting techniques were advised.

Following a one-month intervention period, the infants were re-evaluated by a neonatal specialist who conducted a comprehensive review of their medical history. This post-treatment assessment included an examination of the frequency and intensity of pain, and the determination of recovery or lack of response to treatment.

Measures

Pain severity

The FLACC scale, an acronym for Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability, is a pain assessment tool for infants and young children who cannot verbally express pain. Each category is scored from 0 to 2, with a higher total score indicating greater perceived pain intensity. A score of zero indicated no pain. Scores ranging from 1 to 3 were categorized as "mild", 4 to 6 as "moderate", and 7 to 10 as "severe" pain or discomfort. Refer to supplementary material Table S1 for a description of the FLACC criteria used to assess pain intensity.

Furthermore, patient demographics, such as the baby's age, sex, gestational age, birth weight, current weight, and type of diet, were gathered through a questionnaire, relying on parental responses.

### Traditional practices during the first 1, 000 days of life in southest region of Türkiye: a qualitative study [^111mXWvt]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

H3: "To increase milk supply, some individuals mix molasses, butter, and flour to make a paste and consume it. I have tried it myself and believe it's effective".

H5: "There is a plant known for increasing milk supply. It is boiled, and the tea is consumed".

There were several beliefs observed among the opinions of healthcare professionals regarding traditional methods used during breastfeeding. Some believed that pregnant women should avoid drinking water to prevent bloating, fearing it might hinder breastfeeding. Another notion was that if a woman's milk didn't come immediately after birth, another woman should breastfeed the baby. Additionally, there was a practice of dipping pacifiers in chocolate, molasses, or tea before giving them to babies. Some mothers had been advised to avoid certain foods, such as meat, out of fear that they might harm the baby. Another belief was that placing an iron fork on the mother's plate could help relieve the baby's gas. Finally, there was the belief that breastfeeding served as a contraceptive method.

H10: "They say that a breastfeeding woman does not eat meat. They think it is unhealthy and harmful".

H11: "When the baby is given to the mother first time, due to a belief the mother can not feed the baby with breastfeeding immediately, another woman feeds the baby with her breast milk. Women who do not have milk give their breasts to the baby and use it as a pacifier. They do this so that the baby gets used to breastfeeding and becomes silent".

### The effect of behavioral therapy based counseling with anxious mothers on their infants' colic: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^112Cnecr]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Intervention

After completing the initial questionnaires (including the socio-demographic questionnaire, PSAS, ICS, and MIAQ), the participants received training about the nature and causes of colic and learned about existing methods used to reduce the severity of colic pain such as massaging, proper breastfeeding, hugging, burping, keeping calm during infant crying, etc. As prescribed by a pediatrician, colic drops were used equally for infants of mothers in both groups to control colic pain. Women in the intervention group attended 8 systematic desensitization counseling sessions (2–3 sessions per week) for 4 consecutive weeks in a cozy environment as described below.

Session 1: Relaxation training for mothers with infants suffering from colic (Teaching proper abdominal breathing).
Session 2 and 3: Continuation of relaxation training for mothers with infants suffering from colic (Teaching and practicing progressive muscle relaxation technique with proper breathing).
Session4: Identifying the hierarchy of anxiety of mothers with infants suffering from colic (Listing stressful stimuli of mothers, sequencing and generalizing their mediators, and selecting the main stimulus by mothers).
Session 5: The beginning of desensitization: the client sitting relaxed or lying down begins to visualize and deal with anxiety-provoking cases (from the least to the most anxiety-causing cases).
Sessions 6, 7 and 8: Desensitization continues until the person reaches the lowest level of anxiety based on her anxiety hierarchy.

Two weeks after the end of the counseling sessions, the researcher again completed the PSAS, ICS, and MIAQ by interviewing the participants. The control group received routine postpartum training, including breastfeeding and its benefits, self-care after delivery, baby care, etc. and 6 weeks after completing the initial questionnaires, the post-test questionnaires were completed for them too.

Data collection tools

The data were collected using the socio-demographic questionnaire, PSAS, ICS, and MIAQ. The socio-demographic questionnaire included questions about parents' age, educational level, and job, family income level, place of residence, and life satisfaction. The content validity of this researcher-made questionnaire was confirmed by 10 faculty members of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences.

### ABM clinical protocol # 37: physiological infant care-managing nighttime breastfeeding in young infants [^115ZnrTa]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2023). High credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #37 — Recommendations 6–11 for nighttime caregiving and sleep training in young infants include: Encourage the mother and infant to return to sleep without interruption after nighttime breastfeeding while bedsharing; avoid burping the infant after breastfeeding, and avoid unnecessary diaper changes during the night; a barrier cream applied to the diaper area can help prevent diaper dermatitis (Level of evidence: 2–3. Strength of recommendation: C.). Sleep training in approximately the first 6 months of life is contraindicated, and sleep training in the first year is not recommended; a cued care program for infant sleep may be a physiological-based alternative for parents who desire a sleep intervention (Level of evidence: 3. Strength of recommendation: B.). Encourage the mother to sleep when the infant sleeps, when this is possible, and remind parents that not all sleep must occur during the nighttime hours (Level of evidence: 2. Strength of recommendation: B.). Encourage the mother to get help with other household tasks so that she can focus on breastfeeding and caring for the infant (Level of evidence: 2. Strength of recommendation: B.). Encourage the safe use of baby carriers during the day to promote physical contact with the infant; Baby-wearing can help mothers manage daytime tasks while keeping the infant calm (Level of evidence: 1. Strength of recommendation: A.). Including some supervised "tummy time" may be important to help achieve developmental motor goals (Level of evidence: 2. Strength of recommendation: B.).

### The impact of antenatal cluster management on maternal delivery and postpartum rehabilitation [^116HNTf2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Breastfeeding

The team explained the benefits of breastfeeding to expectant mothers and their families. The focus was on breast milk as the natural food for infants and its superiority to formula milk in enhancing their immune system.
The expectant mothers were taught breastfeeding techniques by demonstrations and other means. The nursing staff used a baby model to demonstrate breastfeeding posture, breastfeeding duration, and frequency, as well as other precautions to be followed. The team also taught the mothers how to burp their newborns correctly.
The expectant mothers were taught to recognize the baby's hunger cues and breastfeed on demand, as well as to avoid excessive massaging of the breasts, which could cause mastitis. They were advised to avoid high-calorie and high-fat diets and eat light and easy-to-digest food. They were encouraged to have frequent and small meals, drink about 2000 mL of warm, boiled water per day, and avoid long gaps between meals and excessive water intake.

Preparing for labor

The expectant mothers were taught to keep ready items for the delivery, including menstrual pads, towels, drinking cups, straws, newborn diapers, and clothing. They were taught to recognize signs such as vaginal bleeding or premature rupture of the fetal membrane in the postpartum period that indicated that delivery was nearing. The expectant mothers and their family members were taught to identify the warning signs of labor and reach the hospital on time.

The team explained the normal process of delivery and encouraged the family members to assist the expectant mothers in using Lamaze childbirth breathing techniques to relieve labor pain. They were also taught to distract the expectant mother with music, conversation, and other methods to help divert attention from the pain and alleviate their discomfort. The expectant mothers were taught to use a bedpan for passing urine in the bed so as to prevent the bladder from filling up and slowing the descent of the fetal head.

Non-pharmacological pain management during labor

The team used video teaching and simulation scenarios to explain non-pharmacological methods of managing labor pain and the principles they are based on, including doula delivery, psychotherapy, seated labor, and airbag-assisted delivery.

### Sucking behaviour using feeding teats with and without an anticolic system: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^1153EVa2]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Even though the drinking process is different between the VT and NVT group, we found no differences concerning cardiorespiratory measurements. Our results support the findings of Fadavi et al. who observed no differences in oxygen saturation when term neonates were bottle-fed with different nipples. This is in contrast to other studies that found decreased oxygenation saturation during feeding of term neonates. One possible explanation for our results may be that we included older infants who maintained stable oxygen saturation.

Preterm infants have significant desaturation during bottle-feeding, but it could be shown that oxygen saturation increases significantly if a vented BNS is used. Interestingly, some authors reported significantly lower SpO2 after feeding and attribute this to aerophagia in terms of burping and gastric distress. In general, higher oxygen levels during bottle-feeding is seen as a more coordinated sucking, swallowing, and breathing pattern. The authors stated, "If a system can be designed that promotes less swallowing, babies can feed more like the natural physiologic norm of breast-feeding".

Results from the literature and our own findings suggest that nonvented teats have a higher risk for aerophagia. The mechanism behind nonvented teats is the vacuum that builds up within the bottle and results in a net decrease of milk flow. The infant tries to compensate for the negative pressure by increasing sucking frequency or amplitude until nipple release after air reflux from the oral cavity. Vented teats allow the nipple to deliver formula in an uninterrupted process.

The hypothesis that aerophagia causes colic symptoms is unproven, and the evidence of vented BNS on infant colic is very low. Subjective assessments like expert opinion and questionnaires attribute a positive effect of vented BNS on infant colic. Other studies found that aerophagia could be seen as a consequence of increased sucking frequency, which may cause gastric upset. Our own results also support the findings that increased sucking implies the risk of aerophagia which could be reduced by using vented BNSs. In our investigation, the used questionnaire by itself did not show any differences between the two types of feeding teats in connection with colic symptoms. However, valid tools to assess infant colic are not available and further studies are needed to prove the relation between aerophagia and infant colic.

### Effect evaluation of kangaroo mother care in liping area, guizhou province, China [^112TSns4]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

The influence of KMC on newborn health indicators In this study, newborns' sleep time, vomiting frequency, crying time and frequency were selected as the observation indicators of neonatal health. During the research process, it was found that the number of sleep times and total sleep time in the KMC group were significantly longer than those in the control group. The analysis reasons were as follows: 1. KMC helps stabilize the newborn's vital signs, keep the newborn's sleep in a stable and comfortable state, which is conducive to long sleep 2. KMC gives newborns a sense of security, which makes it easier for newborns to fall asleep; 3. KMC can reduce the spontaneous or blind movement of the limbs caused by external stimuli after birth, and help to improve the quality of newborns' sleep. 4. The transmission of mother's temperature, heartbeat, breathing, etc. helps to reduce the incompatibility of newborns to the outside world after birth, increase comfort and form a good sleep. Good sleep helps the development of the central nervous system and promotes the growth of newborns. development. Vomiting and overflowing milk are a common phenomenon in newborns. The common causes are that the newborn's stomach volume is small, the structure and function development is not perfect, or the inhalation of more amniotic fluid causes swallowing syndrome. The increase in frequency and degree can lead to a series of Complications affect the health of newborns. This study found that after newborns were fed and burped, the vomiting rate of newborns who carried KMC was lower than that of newborns in the side lying state in the control group. Studies have reported that the effective alveolar ventilation of newborns in the prone position increases. The intestinal blood flow and gastrointestinal blood oxygen content increase, promote the development of neonatal gastrointestinal function. In the first half an hour after feeding, he was in the prone position, and the residual gastric volume was reduced, thereby reducing the feeding intolerance caused by the immature gastrointestinal function of the newborn. Kangaroo care can also reduce neonatal nervousness, promote the secretion of neurotransmitters, regulate growth hormone, thyroxine and insulin levels, promote metabolism, and increase neonatal intake through early and continuous skin contact between mother and baby.

### ABM clinical protocol # 23: nonpharmacological management of procedure-related pain in the breastfeeding infant, revised 2016 [^112P8GNC]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Soothing the newborn infant — technique overview — notes that there are several techniques that have been shown to provide pain relief for newborns (0–28 days of age) undergoing painful procedures, and that in breastfed newborns, breastfeeding itself is the preferred method to alleviate procedural pain; it adds that this approach is safe, effective, natural and, without added cost, and that the individual components of breastfeeding (sucking, sweet taste, and warm contact) may be used separately or in combination when breastfeeding itself is not possible.

### Swaddling: will it get babies onto their backs for sleep? [^112tdTFP]. Clinical Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The supine sleep position is recommended to reduce sudden infant death syndrome risk. Swaddling may improve adherence with supine placement.

Aim

To assess knowledge, attitudes, and practice regarding swaddling among adult caregivers of 0- to 3-month-old infants.

Methods

Cross-sectional descriptive survey.

Results

All 103 adults interviewed had swaddled their infant. Common reasons for swaddling included infant comfort and warmth. Almost 80% of those who swaddled their infant found it effective, 80% believed it to be comfortable, and ~90% believed swaddling to be safe. Parents who routinely used swaddling were more likely to find it effective and to place their infant supine when swaddled (P < .01).

Conclusions

Parents often use swaddling to comfort the infant, and most find it effective. Parents who routinely use swaddling are more likely to place their infant supine if swaddled. Swaddling may be a strategy for parents of infants who have difficulty sleeping in the supine position.

### ABM clinical protocol # 37: physiological infant care-managing nighttime breastfeeding in young infants [^113a7YG3]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Nonphysiological coping strategies in breastfeeding dyads — strategies used to avoid bedsharing include nighttime nonnutritive pumping with bottle feeding, sleep training, formula feeding or early solids, and infant tracking apps, each with potential drawbacks and often involving lighting that disrupts circadian rhythms. Nighttime pumping while feeding an infant a bottle of expressed milk would be expected to markedly disrupt maternal sleep, and milk pumped at a different time of day would not provide the appropriate level of melatonin; circadian rhythms are disrupted not only by lights but by sitting up and engaging in any active activity. Additional considerations include burping needs for bottle-fed infants and that exclusively pumping is associated with shorter breast milk feeding duration and earlier introduction of formula compared with feeding at the breast with or without pumping.

### Sleep-related infant deaths: updated 2022 recommendations for reducing infant deaths in the sleep environment [^116g5XJU]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for sudden infant death syndrome, more specifically with respect to sleep location, AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to advise placing infants for sleep in the parent's room, close to the parent's bed, but on a separate surface designed for infants, ideally for at least the first 6 months, in order to reduce the risk of SIDS (by as much as 50%), and to prevent suffocation, strangulation, and entrapment that may occur when the infant is sleeping in the adult bed.

### Non-pharmacological management of infant and young child procedural pain [^112xKEca]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Infant acute pain and distress is commonplace. Infancy is a period of exponential development. Unrelieved pain and distress can have implications across the lifespan.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions for infant and child (up to three years) acute pain, excluding breastmilk, sucrose, and music. Analyses accounted for infant age (preterm, neonate, older) and pain response (pain reactivity, pain-related regulation).

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2011, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2011), EMBASE (1980 to April 2011), PsycINFO (1967 to April 2011), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (1982 to 2011), Dissertation Abstracts International (1980 to 2011) and www.clinicaltrials.gov. We also searched reference lists and contacted researchers via electronic list-serves.

Selection Criteria

Participants included infants from birth to three years. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or RCT cross-overs that had a no-treatment control comparison were eligible for inclusion in the analyses. We examined studies that met all inclusion criteria except for study design (e.g. had an active control) to qualitatively contextualize results.

Data Collection and Analysis

We refined search strategies with three Cochrane-affiliated librarians. At least two review authors extracted and rated 51 articles. Study quality ratings were based on a scale by Yates and colleagues. We analyzed the standardized mean difference (SMD) using the generic inverse variance method. We also provided qualitative descriptions of 20 relevant but excluded studies.

Main Results

Fifty-one studies, with 3396 participants, were analyzed. The most commonly studied acute procedures were heel-sticks (29 studies) and needles (n = 10 studies). The largest SMD for treatment improvement over control conditions on pain reactivity were: non-nutritive sucking-related interventions (preterm: SMD -0.42; 95% CI -0.68 to -0.15; neonate: SMD -1.45, 95% CI -2.34 to -0.57), kangaroo care (preterm: SMD -1.12, 95% CI -2.04 to -0.21), and swaddling/facilitated tucking (preterm: SMD -0.97; 95% CI -1.63 to -0.31). For immediate pain-related regulation, the largest SMDs were: non-nutritive sucking-related interventions (preterm: SMD -0.38; 95% CI -0.59 to -0.17; neonate: SMD -0.90, 95% CI -1.54 to -0.25), kangaroo care (SMD -0.77, 95% CI -1.50 to -0.03), swaddling/facilitated tucking (preterm: SMD -0.75; 95% CI -1.14 to -0.36), and rocking/holding (neonate: SMD -0.75; 95% CI -1.20 to -0.30). The presence of significant heterogeneity limited our confidence in the lack of findings for certain analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that different non-pharmacological interventions can be used with preterms, neonates, and older infants to significantly manage pain behaviors associated with acutely painful procedures.

### Carbon dioxide rebreathing induced by crib bumpers and mesh liners using an infant manikin [^117KJFKn]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Bedding, pillows, bumpers and toys have been identified as suffocation risks to children in cribs. The tendency of crib mattresses and mattress covers to induce carbon dioxide (CO 2) rebreathing has been characterised experimentally in the literature.
The firmness of the mattress and the ability of the mattress to form a seal around the baby's face as important factors in generating CO 2 rebreathing.

What this study hopes to add?

This study characterises CO 2 rebreathing in crib bumpers, mesh liners and other products used to mitigate the crib-to-baby interaction. Product permeability, which has been proposed as a regulatory metric, is not an adequate predictor of CO 2 rebreathing.
The seal and penetration force are important factors as found in mattresses and other bedding materials by previous authors.

### Carbon dioxide rebreathing induced by crib bumpers and mesh liners using an infant manikin [^112uMztk]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Patel and colleaguesstudied the inspired CO 2 in infants face-down on bedding and demonstrated that CO 2 rebreathing was predicated on the seal made between the face and the bedding material. Thus, as in the case of bedding, we posit that CO 2 RB in MLs, ALTs and CBs is predicated on both the permeability of material, which dictates the rate at which gas diffuses out of the sample, and the seal that the nares make with the sample, which dictates how much of the exhaled gas is directed into the sample. To be clear, by a 'seal' we mean that the skin of the face surrounding the nares makes nearly continuous contact circumferentially around the nares, such that exhaled gas is primarily directed into the sample and not into the atmosphere. During our testing, we noted that wrinkles or valleys sometimes developed in the sample when the baby was placed face down in the sample, and these wrinkles and valleys created air channels that break the aforementioned seal. We anecdotally observed that wrinkles and valleys sometimes occur more frequently in the thicker samples, likely leading to the variability observed in the CO 2 RB of the CBs as compared with the ALTs and MLs (figure 3).

To examine this further, we tested CO 2 RB with the manikin face down on a sample with varied weight added to the head to modulate penetration force. The CB CO 2 RB increased by 50%–80% with increasing penetration force, whereas the ML CO 2 RB was nominally unchanged across the range of penetration force. This latter point suggests that the ML has an invariant and thus more predictable performance across a wide range of environmental force conditions. This has implications for crib-sharing situations, which are discouraged by the 2016 American Academy of Pediatrics guidelinesbut which occur in the field, and sleeping situations with other objects or bedding. That is, the ML shows a stable CO 2 RB that is independent of applied force, and thus should a baby's head be pressed against the ML by a crib-sharing partner or other object the CO 2 RB will remain at unweighted head levels (figure 5). In contrast, CB CO 2 RB increases with applied force, indicating that increased exogenous force to the back of the head (such as in crib sharing or wedging) may lead to unpredictable and elevated CO 2 RB levels in CBs.

### ABM clinical protocol # 23: nonpharmacological management of procedure-related pain in the breastfeeding infant, revised 2016 [^116zR9xz]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #23 — purpose and parental education — states that the aim is to provide healthcare professionals with evidence-based guidance on how to incorporate nonpharmacological or behavioral interventions to relieve procedure-induced pain in the breastfeeding infant, and that parents should be educated about the benefits of using breastfeeding and human milk in these situations.

### Non-pharmacological management of infant and young child procedural pain [^114o9Y2b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Infant acute pain and distress is commonplace. Infancy is a period of exponential development. Unrelieved pain and distress can have implications across the lifespan. This is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Issue 10 2011 entitled 'Non-pharmacological management of infant and young child procedural pain'.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions for infant and child (up to three years) acute pain, excluding kangaroo care, and music. Analyses were run separately for infant age (preterm, neonate, older) and pain response (pain reactivity, immediate pain regulation).

Search Methods

For this update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (Issue 2 of 12, 2015), MEDLINE-Ovid platform (March 2015), EMBASE-OVID platform (April 2011 to March 2015), PsycINFO-OVID platform (April 2011 to February 2015), and CINAHL-EBSCO platform (April 2011 to March 2015). We also searched reference lists and contacted researchers via electronic list-serves. New studies were incorporated into the review. We refined search strategies with a Cochrane-affiliated librarian. For this update, nine articles from the original 2011 review pertaining to Kangaroo Care were excluded, but 21 additional studies were added.

Selection Criteria

Participants included infants from birth to three years. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or RCT cross-overs that had a no-treatment control comparison were eligible for inclusion in the analyses. However, when the additive effects of a non-pharmacological intervention could be assessed, these studies were also included. We examined studies that met all inclusion criteria except for study design (e.g. had an active control) to qualitatively contextualize results. There were 63 included articles in the current update.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study quality ratings and risk of bias were based on the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and GRADE approach. We analysed the standardized mean difference (SMD) using the generic inverse variance method.

Main Results

Sixty-three studies, with 4905 participants, were analysed. The most commonly studied acute procedures were heel-sticks (32 studies) and needles (17 studies). The largest SMD for treatment improvement over control conditions on pain reactivity were: non-nutritive sucking-related interventions (neonate: SMD -1.20, 95% CI -2.01 to -0.38) and swaddling/facilitated tucking (preterm: SMD -0.89; 95% CI -1.37 to -0.40). For immediate pain regulation, the largest SMDs were: non-nutritive sucking-related interventions (preterm: SMD -0.43; 95% CI -0.63 to -0.23; neonate: SMD -0.90; 95% CI -1.54 to -0.25; older infant: SMD -1.34; 95% CI -2.14 to -0.54), swaddling/facilitated tucking (preterm: SMD -0.71; 95% CI -1.00 to -0.43), and rocking/holding (neonate: SMD -0.75; 95% CI -1.20 to -0.30). Fifty two of our 63 trials did not report adverse events. The presence of significant heterogeneity limited our confidence in the findings for certain analyses, as did the preponderance of very low quality evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that different non-pharmacological interventions can be used with preterms, neonates, and older infants to significantly manage pain behaviors associated with acutely painful procedures. The most established evidence was for non-nutritive sucking, swaddling/facilitated tucking, and rocking/holding. All analyses reflected that more research is needed to bolster our confidence in the direction of the findings. There are significant gaps in the existing literature on non-pharmacological management of acute pain in infancy.

### Sucking behaviour using feeding teats with and without an anticolic system: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^111qr3PD]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Infantile colic portrays a widespread problem with an uncertain prevalence of 5%–40% within the first 4 or 6 months of an infant's life. The occurrence is difficult to identify due to differences in classification, methods of data collection, study design, and parents' perception of defining colic.

Although the history of research now reaches over 115 years, based on the paper of Zahorsky, the etiology of infantile colic still remains unknown. As a result, therapeutic interventions to reduce the severity of symptoms and crying episodes are lacking their effectiveness and stressed parents seeking alternative methods to cope with their suffering infants. In this situation parents are susceptible to promises made by manufacturers of feeding bottles. Numerous bottle-nipple systems (BNSs) are available on the market, advertised to reduce infantile colic. The idea behind those so-called "anticolic" teats is to prevent excessive air swallowing (aerophagia) during feeding. It is estimated that 70% of the gastrointestinal gas is swallowed and it was hypothesized that a substantial proportion of air could accumulate, leading to symptoms of distension, discomfort, or colic.

Studies on the relationship between vented BNS and reduction of infant colic symptoms are limited. Available information is based on subjective assessments like expert opinion, parents' recordings of infant's level of arousal, sleep states and questionnaires to rank infant's symptoms on a Likert-type scale.

Studies on direct measurement of air swallowing during bottle-feeding are not available. However, BNSs were assessed concerning suck-swallow-breath coordination in relation to breastfeeding. It was speculated that increased air swallowing leads to air accumulation in the stomach which may cause gastric upset and that pulse oximetry measures may help to clarify post feeding distress.

To examine the effect of a vented "anticolic" teat on suck-swallow-breath coordination we investigated the sucking behaviour of infants bottle-fed with vented teats (VTs) and nonvented teats (NVTs). We hypothesize that an uncoordinated random-like sucking behaviour implies more stress in terms of increased sucking frequency, oxygen desaturation, increased cardiorespiratory parameters, leading to a higher risk of aerophagia.

### Parent training programmes for managing infantile colic [^113n932G]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Infantile colic has an effect on both infants and their parents, who become exhausted and concerned as they attempt to comfort their child. Common approaches have focused upon physical treatments to reduce symptoms, with inconclusive evidence as to their effectiveness. An alternative approach seeks to provide training, support and psychological interventions for parents. This approach is known as parent training programmes. Programmes can include soothing techniques, advice on feeding or normalisation material in any form. The teaching format can vary including face-to-face courses, online learning, printed materials, home visits and remote support and counselling. Here, we aim to collate the evidence on the effectiveness of these interventions and examine their effectiveness at reducing infantile colic symptoms and parental anxiety levels, and their safety.

Objectives

1. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of parent training programmes for managing colic in infants under four months of age. 2. To identify the educational content and attributes of such published programmes.

Search Methods

In June 2019 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 13 other databases and two trials registers. We also handsearched conference abstracts, inspected the references of included studies and contacted leaders in the field for more trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs investigating the effectiveness of any form of parental training programmes, alone or in combination, versus another intervention(s) or control, on infantile colic.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias within the included studies. We used Review Manager 5 to analyse the data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE methodology.

Main Results

Our search found 6064 records from which we selected 20 for full-text review. From these, we identified seven studies with 1187 participants that met our inclusion criteria. All of the studies included infants under the age of four months suffering from infantile colic. Four studies were conducted in the United States, one in Canada, one in the Netherlands and one in Iran. Four studies stated their funding sources, which included national research institutes, foundations and nutritional companies. Five studies assessed parent training versus a control group that received reassurance or routine care; and of these, one study was three-armed and also examined the effectiveness of using a specialised baby seat. One study examined parent training programmes against a milk-exclusion diet and one study assessed a parent training programme versus the same parent training programme plus swaddling. The duration of the interventions varied, with the shortest being six days and the longest being three months. Generally, most studies had low participant numbers and were at high risk of bias, prone to selection bias, performance bias, and the placebo effect. We could not complete the planned qualitative analysis (objective 2) due to lack of data in study reports and no further information being supplied by authors on request. Instead, we completed a descriptive content analysis with the limited information available. The parent training interventions were found to focus on one or a combination of the following: soothing techniques for crying infants (six studies); general care advice, including sleep (four studies); feeding advice (two studies); stress reduction and empathic programme for parents (two studies); and positive play interaction advice (one study). One study taught 'kangaroo care', a specific form of skin-to-skin cuddling. The control groups consisted of reassurance (two studies), advice to rock the infant in the crib (one study), or no intervention (two studies). Parent training versus control We conducted a meta-analysis using data from three studies (157 infants) that assessed the primary outcome of 'crying time at completion of study period'. Parent training was more effective than control: mean difference (MD) -113.58 m/d, 95% confidence interval (CI) -144.19 m/d to -82.96 m/d; low-certainty evidence (downgraded due to imprecision and some concerns with risk of bias). Parent training versus specialised baby seat One study (38 participants) found no difference in mean crying time at completion between the parent training group and the specialised baby seat group, but did not report specific figures. Parent training versus a milk-exclusion/soy milk formula One study (20 participants) comparing parent training with a milk-exclusion/soy milk formula found crying time at completion of the study to be 2.03 hours versus 1.08 hours, respectively. Parent training versus parent training plus swaddling One study (398 participants) comparing parental training with the same intervention plus training on how to swaddle an infant did not report separate data for each group. No adverse effects were reported, but these were not explicitly reported in any study.

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited evidence on the effectiveness and safety of parent training programmes for managing infantile colic. Despite a single meta-analysis showing that parent training may reduce crying times for infants, compared to control, the certainty of the evidence was low. Evidence for other comparisons was sparse. We were unable to identify comprehensively the educational content and attributes of the included programmes due to a lack of information in study reports. Further RCTs are needed: they should define interventions clearly to ensure replicability, address all appropriate outcome measures, and minimise risk of bias in order to assess definitively the role of parent training programmes in managing infantile colic.

### Effect of a portable therapeutic baby nest designed for neonates on physiological parameters, comfort and pain levels during venous blood sampling: a randomised controlled trial [^116nDrvQ]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The neonatal period is marked by heightened sensitivity to environmental factors and increased susceptibility to infections. Common conditions like jaundice, respiratory distress and vomiting frequently require visits to paediatric emergency departments (EDs). However, ED environments often intensify neonatal distress due to bright lights, loud sounds and unfamiliar stimuli, particularly during invasive procedures such as venous sampling, injections and catheterisation. These interventions trigger physiological, behavioural and metabolic responses, including increased heart rate, blood pressure and cortisol levels, alongside visible discomfort. Prolonged stress exposure may alter pain perception and stress regulation, leading to long-term neurological and behavioural consequences.

In response to these challenges, Heidelise Alsdeveloped the Neonatal Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program, which aims to reduce stress and promote comfort by aligning care with neonates' developmental needs. According to this framework, optimal sensory conditions include sound levels ≤ 45 dBA during the day and ≤ 35 dBA at night, and lighting between 10 and 600 lux. However, in Turkey, and likely many departments worldwide, structural and operational constraints prevent paediatric EDs from meeting these standards. This situation suggests the need for practical and cost-effective strategies to improve neonatal care in EDs — without requiring major infrastructural modifications.

Several non-pharmacological interventions, including oral sucrose, non-nutritive sucking, swaddling, facilitated tucking, kangaroo care and music therapy, have been shown to reduce neonatal pain and improve physiological stability. A systematic review by Shen et al confirmed their effectiveness. However, their integration into paediatric EDs is often limited by factors such as infrastructure constraints, staff training requirements and varying clinical practices. While interventions like oral sucrose and swaddling primarily focus on pain relief, they provide limited support in managing environmental stressors that contribute to neonatal distress.

We developed a portable therapeutic baby nest (PTBN) for neonates undergoing venous blood sampling. Given that neonatal distress is influenced by both procedural pain and sensory factors, PTBN was designed to provide multidimensional support in the ED setting, minimising sensory overload and promoting postural support. It is a portable lightweight, disinfectable structure which features a single-use sterile roll cover for hygiene, cotton-filled support pads that maintain a fetal position and passive noise-reducing headphones to shield neonates from excessive environmental noise. A semi-open shade reduces bright light exposure while ensuring visibility for clinical procedures.

### Operating room or in-office injection for retrograde cricopharyngeal dysfunction botulinum toxin injection [^114WfmBF]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Retrograde Cricopharyngeal Dysfunction (RCPD), also known as "No Burp Syndrome", is a rare condition characterized by the inability to burp due to cricopharyngeus muscle dysfunction. Patients experience bloating, chest and abdominal discomfort, gurgling sounds, and excessive flatulence, which significantly impact quality of life.

Objective

To compare the clinical outcomes and side effect profiles of botulinum toxin injection for RCPD when performed in‐office versus in the operating room.

Methods

A clinical review of patients with RCPD was conducted, focusing on diagnosis based on history and physical examination. Botulinum toxin was administered to the cricopharyngeus muscle either in‐office or in the operating room. Success rates, complications, and patient tolerance were analyzed and compared across both procedural settings.

Results

Botulinum toxin injection proved effective in both settings, with similar success rates in restoring the ability to burp and relieving associated symptoms. In‐office procedures offered advantages in convenience and recovery time, while operating room procedures allowed for greater procedural control under general anesthesia. Side effect profiles differed slightly, with transient throat discomfort more commonly reported in in‐office cases.

Conclusion

Both in‐office and operating room botulinum toxin injections are effective treatment options for RCPD. The choice of setting should be guided by patient preference, comorbidities, and resource availability, as each approach offers distinct advantages and risk considerations.

Level of Evidence

The retrospective case series by Bastian et al. Wajsberg et al. Hoesli et al. and Doruk and Pitman are level III evidence. The prospective cohort study of Doruk et al. is level II evidence.

### Prevalence of overlap syndromes and symptoms in pediatric functional dyspepsia [^115VX5uB]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms

All patients seen for initial evaluation in the abdominal pain clinic from which the sample was selected had completed a standardized medical history. This medical history included questions regarding the presence of upper abdominal pain or discomfort, as well as any relation to a change in stool frequency or consistency or a history of relief from stooling. In addition, specific locations of the pain were obtained by asking the patient to mark pain locations on a diagram of the abdomen. The nature of the pain (e.g. burning, crampy) was asked of each patient. Patients were specifically asked whether pain wakes them at night and whether pain increases after a meal. Patients also were asked about the presence of nausea and/or vomiting and whether nausea increases after a meal. Relevant to the issue of FD subtyping, patients were asked specifically about the presence of early satiety and postprandial bloating.

Patients also are asked about the presence of a number of other gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms that are assessed include the presence of stool symptoms such as loose stools, hard stools, mucus in stools, blood in stools, and waking at night to have a stool, as well as the presence of excessive gas. Systemic symptoms that are assessed include hayfever, fatigue, headache, fainting, dizziness, chest pain, muscle pain, joint pain, mouth sores, weight loss, and fever. In addition to the above, patients are asked about the presence of 4 symptoms related to gastroesophageal reflux (bitter, salty, or sour taste in mouth; excessive belching or burping; regurgitation; heartburn) and 3 symptoms related to overactive bladder syndrome (increased frequency of urination; waking during the night to urinate; sudden urge to urinate).

Information from the medical history, once abstracted and entered into the research database, was used to evaluate dyspeptic symptoms and assign an FD subtype based on adult Rome III criteria. Patients were defined as having postprandial distress syndrome if they endorsed early satiety or postprandial bloating. Patients were defined as having epigastric pain syndrome if they endorsed burning or pain localized only to the epigastric region. Diagnoses of potentially overlapping symptoms and conditions (i.e. IBS, GERD, OBS) also were assigned based on symptom information abstracted from the patient's medical history.

### Sweet-tasting solutions for needle-related procedural pain in infants one month to one year of age [^114KApzZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Administration of oral sucrose or glucose with and without non-nutritive sucking is frequently used as a non-pharmacological intervention for needle-related procedural pain relief in infants.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of sweet-tasting solutions for needle-related procedural pain in infants one month to one year of age compared with no treatment, placebo, other sweet-tasting solutions, or pharmacological or other non-pharmacological pain-relieving methods.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012); MEDLINE via Ovid (1966 to 2012); CINAHL via OVID (1982 to 2012). The World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform was also searched for any ongoing trials. Clinical trial registries, conference proceedings and references for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were also searched. An updated search was run to capture any new publications before finalising the review in April 2012 and no new included studies were identified. Two review authors (MK & JF) independently abstracted data and assessed quality using a standard form. Authors have been contacted for missing data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised-controlled trials using a sweet-tasting solution to treat pain in healthy term infants (gestational age 37 weeks and over), between one month and 12 months of age who required needle-related procedures. These procedures included but were not limited to: subcutaneous or intramuscular injections, venepuncture, and heel lance. Studies in which the painful procedure was circumcision, lumbar puncture or supra-pubic bladder aspiration were not included as they are more severe and painful than needle-related procedures. Control conditions included no treatment or placebo (water) or any other identical intervention (same appearance and consistency) without active ingredient, another sweet-tasting solution, a pharmacological pain-relieving method (e.g. paracetamol, topical anaesthetic cream), non-pharmacological pain-relieving method (e.g. distraction method, non-nutritive sucking).

Data Collection and Analysis

Assessment of trial quality, data extraction and synthesis of data were performed using standard methods of the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Group. We report mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using fixed-effect models as appropriate for continuous outcome measures. We planned to report risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) for dichotomous outcomes. The Chi(2) test and I(2) statistic were used to assess between-study heterogeneity.

Main Results

Sixty-five (65) studies were identified for possible inclusion in this review. Fourteen published RCTs with a total of 1551 participants met the inclusion criteria. Duration of cry was significantly reduced in infants who were administered a sweet-tasting solution [MD -13.47 (95% CI -16.80 to -10.15)], P < 0.00001 compared with water. However, there was considerable heterogeneity between the studies (I(2) = 94%) that we were unable to explain. Meta-analysis was not able to be undertaken for any of the other outcome measures, except for cry duration, because of differences in study design. However, most of the individual studies that measured pain found sucrose to significantly reduce pain compared with the control group. One study compared sucrose and Lidocaine-prilocaine cream and no significant difference was found between the two treatments for the outcomes pain and cry duration. Due to the differences between the studies, we were unable to identify the optimal concentration, volume or method of administration of sweet-tasting solutions in infants aged one to 12 months. Further large RCTs are needed.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to confidently judge the effectiveness of sweet-tasting solutions in reducing needle-related pain in infants (one month to 12 months of age). The treatments do, however, appear promising. Data from a series of individual trials are promising, as are the results from a subset meta-analysis of studies measuring duration of crying. Further well controlled RCTs are warranted in this population to determine the optimal concentration, volume, method of administration, and possible adverse effects.

### Gastro-oesophageal reflux in young babies: who should be treated? [^1176r1NX]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines focus on a non-interventionist approach to management of gastro-oesophageal reflux in infancy and emphasise the importance of explanation, reassurance and simple measures such as attention to feeding. Relying on clinical history alone leads to over diagnosis of disease, and widely used medications are often ineffective for symptom relief and carry significant risk of harm. The association between vomiting in infancy and other problems such as crying and poor feeding should not be interpreted as implying causality. When there are strong pointers to underlying gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, invasive investigations are required in order to formulate appropriate intervention.

### Inhaled analgesia for pain management in labour [^111duT3U]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Many women would like to have a choice in pain relief during labour and also would like to avoid invasive methods of pain management in labour. Inhaled analgesia during labour involves the self-administered inhalation of sub-anaesthetic concentrations of agents while the mother remains awake and her protective laryngeal reflexes remain intact. Most of the agents are easy to administer, can be started in less than a minute and become effective within a minute.

Objectives

To examine the effects of all modalities of inhaled analgesia on the mother and the newborn for mothers who planned to have a vaginal delivery.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2012), ClinicalTrials.gov, and Current Controlled Trials (2 June 2012), handsearched conference proceedings from the American Society of Clinical Anesthesia (from 1990 to 2011), contacted content experts and trialists and searched reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing inhaled analgesia with other inhaled analgesia or placebo or no treatment or other methods of non-pharmacological pain management in labour.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility, methodological quality and extracted all data. Data were double checked for accuracy.

Main Results

Twenty-six studies, randomising 2959 women, were included in this review. Inhaled analgesia versus a different type of inhaled analgesia Pain relief was measured using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) from 0 to 100 mm where 100 corresponds to the most relief. Pain intensity was measured using a VAS from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 corresponds to no pain at all and 100 corresponds to the worst pain. The highest score for pain relief is the most positive in contrast to 'pain intensity' in which the higher score is more negative. Flurane derivatives were found to offer better pain relief than nitrous oxide in first stage of labour as measured by a lower pain intensity score (average mean difference (MD) 14.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.41 to 24.37, three studies, 70 women), also a higher pain relief score for flurane derivatives compared with nitrous oxide (average MD -16.32, 95% CI -26.85 to -5.79, two studies, 70 women). Substantial heterogeneity was found in the analyses of pain intensity (P = 0.003) and in the analysis of pain relief (P = 0.002). These findings should be considered with caution because of the questionable design of the included cross-over trials. More nausea was found in the nitrous oxide group compared with the flurane derivatives group (risk ratio (RR) 6.60 95% CI 1.85 to 23.52, two studies, 98 women). Inhaled analgesia versus placebo or no treatment Placebo or no treatment was found to offer less pain relief compared to nitrous oxide (average RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.34, two studies, 310 women; MD -3.50, 95% CI -3.75 to -3.25, one study, 509 women). However, nitrous oxide resulted in more side effects for women such as nausea (RR 43.10, 95% CI 2.63 to 706.74, one study, 509 women), vomiting (RR 9.05, 95% CI 1.18 to 69.32, two studies, 619 women), dizziness (RR 113.98, 95% CI 7.09 to 1833.69, one study, 509 women) and drowsiness (RR 77.59, 95% CI 4.80 to 1254.96, one study, 509 women) when compared with placebo or no treatment. There were no significant differences found for any of the outcomes in the studies comparing one strength versus a different strength of inhaled analgesia, in studies comparing different delivery systems or in the study comparing inhaled analgesia with TENS. Due to lack of data, the following outcomes were not analysed within the review: sense of control; satisfaction with childbirth experience; effect on mother/baby interaction; breastfeeding; admission to special care baby unit; poor infant outcomes at long-term follow-up; or costs.

Authors' Conclusions

Inhaled analgesia appears to be effective in reducing pain intensity and in giving pain relief in labour. However, substantial heterogeneity was detected for pain intensity. Furthermore, nitrous oxide appears to result in more side effects compared with flurane derivatives. Flurane derivatives result in more drowsiness when compared with nitrous oxide. When inhaled analgesia is compared with no treatment or placebo, nitrous oxide appears to result in even more side effects such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness and drowsiness. There is no evidence for differences for any of the outcomes comparing one strength verus a different strength of inhaled analgesia, comparing different delivery systems or comparing inhaled analgesia with TENS.

Counseling and screening — clinicians are told that all families should be counseled about safe sleep, that information and counseling about safe bedsharing should be provided even to parents for whom bedsharing should be discouraged because parents may bedshare anyway (even unintentionally), and that conversations should be nonjudgmental; open‑ended questions that have been found to be successful include "What are your plans for where your baby will sleep?", "What does that sleep area look like?", and "Does your baby ever end up in bed with you?"; ending stigma around bedsharing and educating all parents about safe bedsharing are described as having the potential to reduce infant deaths.

### Neonatal care in rural karnataka: healthy and harmful practices, the potential for change [^113ezzGz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Asphyxia

A small proportion of babies are born asphyxiated (6% (24) of live births in the Obstetric survey), and qualitative findings show that asphyxia is a problem about which there remains a real lack of knowledge amongst mothers. Older women described various methods of dealing with it, removing phlegm from the mouth, holding the baby upside down and patting or massaging it, blowing in the ears, sprinkling and dipping it in water and making loud noises.

I take the cow dung; put it on the chest, and then sprinkle the water and the baby will start to cry. This is the only method I use; if it will not breathe, I think it is dead (Untrained TBA, IDI).

ANMs were found to use similar procedures, although injections are also given. Local attendants do not use mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, and while ANMs could describe the process, evidence suggests they are not all comfortable carrying it out and poor quality of care is common.

The baby was not breathing, the ANM wrapped the baby inside my saree thinking the baby would die but the doctor scolded the ANM and asked her to try out getting it to breathe. The baby was lifted upright and patted at the back; she dipped her hand in water and patted it on the back (Mother, IDI).

There was a mixture of reactions to recommended practices for dealing with asphyxia. Removing phlegm was already familiar to some women and patting and massaging is commonly used; however, few were familiar with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. There was interest in the concept but some scepticism amongst older women that it could help. Some even feared it would inhibit breathing and insisted that you had to blow on the ears or head. There were also concerns about saliva transfer, due to strong traditional reservations. However, the idea of using gauze between the mouths to prevent this was acceptable.

Yes, it is possible you can do it but don't you think your saliva will go into the baby's mouth (Mother, IDI)

### Knowledge, attitudes, and practices of pediatricians on infantile colic in the middle east and north Africa region [^111AM5zR]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

The persistent crying and discomfort suffered by infants may adversely affect the quality of life of parents, with reports of increased maternal depression and a general deterioration of parents' psychological status. Considering the favorable clinical course of infantile colic, conservative treatments strategies, such as avoiding overfeeding, should be adopted in the appropriate clinical setting. Non-analgesic, non-nutritive soothing maneuvers, such as rhythmic rocking and patting 2–3 times per second in a quiet environment, may temporarily soothe a baby who may resume crying when placed in their cot. Rhythmic motion is a common maneuver that does not eliminate pain but may stop crying (e.g. a car ride); however, although this has diagnostic and therapeutic value, it should not be overdone. Other harmful practices like cautery, which is still prevalent in some countries, must be stopped. A study of 150 age- and gender-matched infants in Saudi Arabia revealed that 14% of these infants underwent cautery, performed by a traditional healer, because of excessive crying. Assessments should measure parents' coping skills and anxiety level to prevent potential child abuse in the form of shaking baby syndrome. Management consists of helping parents cope, and any measure that parents perceive as helpful is worth continuing provided it does not cause harm.

### Traditional practices during the first 1, 000 days of life in southest region of Türkiye: a qualitative study [^111nsyZx]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

P28: "We place an iron under the baby's head in the cradle for forty days".

H2: "Mothers avoid bathing their babies for 40 days. They leave a knife and the baby's father's jacket to prevent the baby from developing a red flush".

Giving strengthen to the baby: One pregnant woman mentioned that her baby's belly was burned with a cigarette to increase the baby's strength. Similarly, three healthcare professional stated that melted nylon was applied to the baby's abdomen, a hot skewer was brought into contact with the skin, and a cigarette flame was applied to the baby's back for the same purpose.

P5: "My mother-in-law wanted to burn the baby's belly with a cigarette because the baby had gas. I did not allow it".

H1: "They melt nylon and put drops on their stomachs because the baby is sick and has no appetite".

Other traditional practices reported by mothers: Olive oil is commonly applied to the baby's body to treat diaper rash and reduce fever. It is also given to children for constipation and used as a vitamin supplement. In cases of diarrheal diseases, dried pomegranate peel tea is administered. To reduce fever, lemon juice is squeezed into the baby's sock. For treating wounds, camel urine is applied. During infancy, mothers rub the baby's swollen breasts to reduce their size. Additionally, when their babies fall ill, mothers often seek advice from a religiously knowledgeable and trusted individual, typically a teacher.

Other traditional practices reported by healthcare professionals: These include tying a beret around the baby's head to keep it tidy and having the grandmother or an elder spit into the baby's mouth to supposedly make the baby resemble them. It is also a common practice to read the baby's name during the call to prayer into their ear, as it is believed to foster good behavior. Lifting the baby's palate to increase their appetite is another traditional method mentioned. Additionally, vaccine hesitancy was noted as a prevalent issue.

### 2022 interim guidance to health care providers for basic and advanced cardiac life support in adults, children, and neonates with suspected or confirmed COVID-19: from the emergency cardiovascular care committee and get with the guidelines-resuscitation adult and pediatric task forces of the American Heart Association in collaboration with the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Association for Respiratory Care, the society of critical care anesthesiologists, and American society of anesthesiologists [^115tpd4a]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2022). High credibility.

Neonatal resuscitation — care for newborns of mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19: Every newborn baby should have a skilled attendant prepared to resuscitate regardless of COVID-19 status, and health care providers should don appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs). Routine initial steps are unlikely to be aerosol generating and include drying, tactile stimulation, placement into a plastic bag or wrap, assessment of heart rate, and placement of pulse oximetry and electrocardiographic leads. Suction of the airway after delivery should not be performed routinely for clear or meconium-stained amniotic fluid; suctioning is an AGP and is not indicated for uncomplicated deliveries, regardless of COVID-19 status. Endotracheal instillation of medications such as surfactant or epinephrine is an AGP (especially via an uncuffed tube), and intravenous epinephrine via a low-lying umbilical venous catheter is the preferred route of administration during neonatal resuscitation, regardless of COVID-19 status. Positive pressure ventilation remains the main resuscitation strategy for newborns with apnea, ineffective breathing (gasping), and bradycardia, with chest compressions occurring later in the algorithm. Delayed cord clamping and skin-to-skin contact may be practiced in stable neonates of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 positive mothers if the mother is appropriately masked, and until confirmed COVID-19 negative, such mothers should practice hand and breast hygiene and wear a mask during care and feeding. For neonatal intensive care patients, closed incubator transfer and care (with appropriate distancing) should be used when possible, but incubators do not protect against aerosolized particles.

Brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) — lower-risk infants, blood gas testing: Clinicians Should Not Obtain Measurement of Venous or Arterial Blood Gases in Infants Presenting With a Lower-Risk BRUE (Grade B, Moderate Recommendation). Benefits are to reduce costs, unnecessary testing, pain, risk of thrombosis, and caregiver/infant anxiety, while risks include avoiding consequences of false-positive results and that testing may miss rare instances of hypercapnia and acid-base imbalances; the benefit-harm assessment states that the benefits of reducing unnecessary testing and false-positive results, as well as alleviating caregiver and infant anxiety, outweigh the rare missed diagnostic opportunity for hypercapnia and acid-base imbalances.

### Repositioning for preventing pressure injuries [^1154phNR]. NPIAP (2025). High credibility.

Implementation considerations for critically ill neonates and children include the following directives: Cease attempts to fully reposition infants (aged < 3 years) in the presence of new arrhythmia, active fluid resuscitation with unstable blood pressure, active hemorrhage, and change in baseline hemodynamic and oxygenation status that does not recover within 10 minutes of repositioning, and develop a local protocol that identifies the percent change in hemodynamic and oxygenation status that indicates intolerance of repositioning. In critically ill infants who cannot tolerate slow, incremental turns, consider using frequent, small weight redistributions (micromovements), passive range of motion, repositioning the extremities, head rotation and heel elevation, implement incremental shifts in body position, commence with 15-degree body rotation and monitor clinical status, and, if tolerated, increase rotation to 30-degree. Implement an interdisciplinary turning team to collaboratively ensure the infant's airway is maintained, clinical needs are addressed, and harms are minimized. Use repositioning as an opportunity to assess the infant's skin (including under medical devices), manage moisture, and perform daily range of motion exercises.

### Non-pharmacological management of infant and young child procedural pain [^114drv7H]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite evidence of the long-term implications of unrelieved pain during infancy, it is evident that infant pain is still under-managed and unmanaged. Inadequately managed pain in infancy, a period of exponential development, can have implications across the lifespan. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic review of pain management strategies is integral to appropriate infant pain management. This is an update of a previously published review update in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015, Issue 12) of the same title.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and adverse events of non-pharmacological interventions for infant and child (aged up to three years) acute pain, excluding kangaroo care, sucrose, breastfeeding/breast milk, and music.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE-Ovid platform, EMBASE-OVID platform, PsycINFO-OVID platform, CINAHL-EBSCO platform and trial registration websites (ClinicalTrials.gov; International Clinical Trials Registry Platform) (March 2015 to October 2020). An update search was completed in July 2022, but studies identified at this point were added to 'Awaiting classification' for a future update. We also searched reference lists and contacted researchers via electronic list-serves. We incorporated 76 new studies into the review. SELECTION CRITERIA: Participants included infants from birth to three years in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or cross-over RCTs that had a no-treatment control comparison. Studies were eligible for inclusion in the analysis if they compared a non-pharmacological pain management strategy to a no-treatment control group (15 different strategies). In addition, we also analysed studies when the unique effect of adding a non-pharmacological pain management strategy onto another pain management strategy could be assessed (i.e. additive effects on a sweet solution, non-nutritive sucking, or swaddling) (three strategies). The eligible control groups for these additive studies were sweet solution only, non-nutritive sucking only, or swaddling only, respectively. Finally, we qualitatively described six interventions that met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review, but not in the analysis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The outcomes assessed in the review were pain response (reactivity and regulation) and adverse events. The level of certainty in the evidence and risk of bias were based on the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the GRADE approach. We analysed the standardised mean difference (SMD) using the generic inverse variance method to determine effect sizes. MAIN RESULTS: We included total of 138 studies (11,058 participants), which includes an additional 76 new studies for this update. Of these 138 studies, we analysed 115 (9048 participants) and described 23 (2010 participants) qualitatively. We described qualitatively studies that could not be meta-analysed due to being the only studies in their category or statistical reporting issues. We report the results of the 138 included studies here. An SMD effect size of 0.2 represents a small effect, 0.5 a moderate effect, and 0.8 a large effect. The thresholds for the I 2 interpretation were established as follows: not important (0% to 40%); moderate heterogeneity (30% to 60%); substantial heterogeneity (50% to 90%); considerable heterogeneity (75% to 100%). The most commonly studied acute procedures were heel sticks (63 studies) and needlestick procedures for the purposes of vaccines/vitamins (35 studies). We judged most studies to have high risk of bias (103 out of 138), with the most common methodological concerns relating to blinding of personnel and outcome assessors. Pain responses were examined during two separate pain phases: pain reactivity (within the first 30 seconds after the acutely painful stimulus) and immediate pain regulation (after the first 30 seconds following the acutely painful stimulus). We report below the strategies with the strongest evidence base for each age group. In preterm born neonates, non-nutritive sucking may reduce pain reactivity (SMD -0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.03 to -0.11, moderate effect; I² = 93%, considerable heterogeneity) and improve immediate pain regulation (SMD -0.61, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.27, moderate effect; I² = 81%, considerable heterogeneity), based on very low-certainty evidence. Facilitated tucking may also reduce pain reactivity (SMD -1.01, 95% CI -1.44 to -0.58, large effect; I² = 93%, considerable heterogeneity) and improve immediate pain regulation (SMD -0.59, 95% CI -0.92 to -0.26, moderate effect; I² = 87%, considerable heterogeneity); however, this is also based on very low-certainty evidence. While swaddling likely does not reduce pain reactivity in preterm neonates (SMD -0.60, 95% CI -1.23 to 0.04, no effect; I² = 91%, considerable heterogeneity), it has been shown to possibly improve immediate pain regulation (SMD -1.21, 95% CI -2.05 to -0.38, large effect; I² = 89%, considerable heterogeneity), based on very low-certainty evidence. In full-term born neonates, non-nutritive sucking may reduce pain reactivity (SMD -1.13, 95% CI -1.57 to -0.68, large effect; I² = 82%, considerable heterogeneity) and improve immediate pain regulation (SMD -1.49, 95% CI -2.20 to -0.78, large effect; I² = 92%, considerable heterogeneity), based on very low-certainty evidence. In full-term born older infants, structured parent involvement was the intervention most studied. Results showed that this intervention has little to no effect in reducing pain reactivity (SMD -0.18, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.03, no effect; I² = 46%, moderate heterogeneity) or improving immediate pain regulation (SMD -0.09, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.21, no effect; I² = 74%, substantial heterogeneity), based on low- to moderate-certainty evidence. Of these five interventions most studied, only two studies observed adverse events, specifically vomiting (one preterm neonate) and desaturation (one full-term neonate hospitalised in the NICU) following the non-nutritive sucking intervention. The presence of considerable heterogeneity limited our confidence in the findings for certain analyses, as did the preponderance of evidence of very low to low certainty based on GRADE judgements.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, non-nutritive sucking, facilitated tucking, and swaddling may reduce pain behaviours in preterm born neonates. Non-nutritive sucking may also reduce pain behaviours in full-term neonates. No interventions based on a substantial body of evidence showed promise in reducing pain behaviours in older infants. Most analyses were based on very low- or low-certainty grades of evidence and none were based on high-certainty evidence. Therefore, the lack of confidence in the evidence would require further research before we could draw a definitive conclusion.

### The "Superhero cape burrito": a simple and comfortable method of short-term procedural restraint [^1124Z4RQ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Restraint is sometimes necessary to successfully perform procedures on pediatric patients in the emergency department. A papoose may be intimidating and uncomfortable, and a wrapped sheet may not keep the child's arms from wiggling free.

Discussion

We present an adaptation of the wrapped sheet (burrito) technique, using a pillowcase to better immobilize the child's arms. The arms are inserted in the pillowcase behind the child's back, and then the child is placed supine over a horizontally placed sheet and turned to each side so the sheet is tucked behind the back. The child is thereby easily and comfortably restrained.

Conclusions

We believe this technique more successfully restrains the child than the wrapped sheet alone, and is easier to execute than other wrapped sheet techniques aimed at improving arm immobilization.

### ABM clinical protocol # 23: nonpharmacological management of procedure-related pain in the breastfeeding infant, revised 2016 [^115PbE8W]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Skin-to-skin contact — Coordinating a breastfeeding session with the timing of the procedure is best, but, if this is not possible, skin-to-skin contact with the mother or other caregiver can comfort infants undergoing a procedure such as a heel lance (IA). At least one study has found that breastfeeding performed in conjunction with skin-to-skin contact provided superior analgesia during a painful procedure than with sucrose alone or with only skin-to-skin contact. Parental contact and sucrose may act synergistically to reduce pain in neonates and, if feasible, this combination can be employed (IB).

Asphyxia mechanisms and early time course — Asphyxia during avalanche burial occurs primarily by 3 mechanisms: complete or partial upper airway obstruction from inhaled snow or debris causing hypoxia and hypercapnia within 10 min and cause death from asphyxia within 35 min of avalanche burial; high density snow or lack of an air pocket leading to asphyxia from rebreathing expired air; and the weight and compaction of snow limiting chest expansion and impairing ventilation. Inspired air contains 21% oxygen and less than 0.03% CO2, whereas expired air contains about 16% oxygen and 5% CO2.

### Operating room or in-office injection for retrograde cricopharyngeal dysfunction botulinum toxin injection [^117J7z7u]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Retrograde Cricopharyngeal Dysfunction (RCPD), also known as "No Burp Syndrome", is a rare condition characterized by the inability to burp due to cricopharyngeus muscle dysfunction. Patients experience bloating, chest and abdominal discomfort, gurgling sounds, and excessive flatulence, which significantly impact quality of life.

Objective

To compare the clinical outcomes and side effect profiles of botulinum toxin injection for RCPD when performed in-office versus in the operating room.

Methods

A clinical review of patients with RCPD was conducted, focusing on diagnosis based on history and physical examination. Botulinum toxin was administered to the cricopharyngeus muscle either in-office or in the operating room. Success rates, complications, and patient tolerance were analyzed and compared across both procedural settings.

Results

Botulinum toxin injection proved effective in both settings, with similar success rates in restoring the ability to burp and relieving associated symptoms. In-office procedures offered advantages in convenience and recovery time, while operating room procedures allowed for greater procedural control under general anesthesia. Side effect profiles differed slightly, with transient throat discomfort more commonly reported in in-office cases.

Conclusion

Both in-office and operating room botulinum toxin injections are effective treatment options for RCPD. The choice of setting should be guided by patient preference, comorbidities, and resource availability, as each approach offers distinct advantages and risk considerations.

Level Of Evidence

The retrospective case series by Bastian et al. Wajsberg et al. Hoesli et al. and Doruk and Pitman are level III evidence. The prospective cohort study of Doruk et al. is level II evidence.

### Is carbon dioxide as an insufflation agent for double contrast barium enema still worthwhile after a same-day flexible sigmoidoscopy? [^1152RVtz]. Clinical Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of a double-contrast barium enema (DCBE) with CO(2) as a distending gas after a screening flexible sigmoidoscopy for reducing abdominal distension after an examination.

Patients and Methods

A total of 165 DCBEs for patients with positive faecal occult blood tests were randomly allocated to a CO(2) group (n = 83) and a control group (n = 82) using air. Abdominal radiograph were taken before the DCBE, immediately following it, and 30 minutes later to determine residual bowel gas. The degree of abdominal discomfort was recorded using a scoring system.

Results

The patients in the CO(2) group had significantly smaller amounts of residual gas 30 minutes after the DCBE than did the control group, both in the colon (P < 0.02) and in the small intestine (P < 0.001). There was significantly less abdominal distension after the DCBE in the CO(2) group compared to the control group (P < 0.001). The abdominal discomfort score at 30 minutes after CO(2) correlated with the residual gas in the small intestine (r = 0.390, P = 0.003) but not in the colon (r = 0.155, P = 0.15). The quality of the images and the number of polyps detected did not differ between two groups.

Conclusions

We concluded that using CO(2) when administering a DCBE after a screening sigmoidoscopy was useful for relieving abdominal discomfort following the examination; furthermore, it did not impair the diagnostic ability of the DCBE.

### Sudden infant death syndrome prevention [^111A7Cdv]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Supervised awake tummy time

Recommendations

"When awake, infants can be placed in prone position with supervision". (Recommended but not graded).

"Supervised, awake tummy time is recommended to facilitate development and to minimize development of positional plagiocephaly". (Grade B recommendation).

Evidence

Sustained supine position combined with restricted motor abilities lead to postural plagiocephaly. In addition, prone position facilitates the development of the upper shoulder girdle strength. Therefore, although there is no data to support this recommendation and to establish the frequency and duration of it, experts recommend "a certain amount of prone positioning, or 'tummy time', while the infant is awake and being observed".

Firm surface for sleeping

Recommendations

"Firm surfaces should always be used: the mattresses must be firm and maintain their shape even when covered with the sheets, so that there are no gaps left between the mattress and the crib railing. Adjustable sheets and specific bedding should be used".

"Infants should be placed on a firm sleep surface (eg, mattress in a safety-approved crib) covered by a fitted sheet with no other bedding or soft objects to reduce the risk of SIDS and suffocation". (Grade A recommendation).

Evidence

Soft sleep surface has consistently been reported as a risk factor for SIDS. A case-control study conducted in the US among 260 SIDS cases and 260 matched living controls, showed an association between soft sleep surface and a higher risk of SIDS (AOR 5.1 [95% CI: 2.9 to 9.2]). The risk was significantly higher when prone position and soft sleep surface were combined (AOR 21.0 [95% CI: 7.8 to 56.2]). Soft mattresses could create a pocket around the infant within which the CO2 dispersal is limited, increasing the risk of rebreathing or suffocation in infants placed in prone position.

### Acupuncture for the treatment of infantile colic [^115CnWpZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Certainty of the evidence assessment

We will use the GRADE approach, as outlined in the GRADE Handbook, to assess the certainty of the evidence for the following outcomes:

duration of crying and/or fussing of the infant (e.g. hours or minutes during 24 hours (primary endpoint));
resolution of colic symptoms, as defined by the authors;
adverse effects, including: infection after the procedure; bleeding, ecchymosis, or bruising during the procedure; needle‐related tissue damage during the procedure; needle‐related pain during the procedure; stuck needle during the procedure.

Two review authors (EL; BHS) will independently assess the certainty of the evidence for each of the outcomes above, and resolve disagreements by discussion and consensus. In the event we are unable to reach consensus, we will seek input from a third review author (MB). We will consider evidence from randomized controlled trials as high certainty, downgrading the evidence one level for serious limitations (or two levels for very serious limitations), based upon the following: design (overall RoB 2 judgment), consistency across studies, directness of the evidence, precision of estimates (three levels for extremely serious imprecision), and presence of publication bias. We will use GRADEpro GDT software to create summary of findings tables. The tables will report the certainty of the evidence for the following comparisons.

Acupuncture (invasive or non‐invasive) versus control. Control may include: no treatment; placebo/sham procedure; basic advisory family support.
Acupuncture (invasive or non‐invasive) versus another active intervention. Active interventions may include: pharmacologic interventions; dietary interventions (e.g. probiotics, fennel extract); other complementary therapies (e.g. spinal manipulation, massage).
Acupuncture of one form (e.g. penetration of the skin with a needle) versus acupuncture of another form (e.g. acupressure).

The GRADE approach results in an assessment of the certainty of a body of evidence in one of the following four grades.

High certainty: further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Moderate certainty: further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
Low certainty: further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
Very low certainty: we are very uncertain about the estimate.

### Prevention and management of pain in the neonate: an update [^1165Tbbn]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

The prevention of pain in neonates should be the goal of all caregivers, because repeated painful exposures have the potential for deleterious consequences. Neonates at greatest risk of neurodevelopmental impairment as a result of preterm birth (ie, the smallest and sickest) are also those most likely to be exposed to the greatest number of painful stimuli in the NICU. Although there are major gaps in our knowledge regarding the most effective way to prevent and relieve pain in neonates, proven and safe therapies are currently underused for routine minor yet painful procedures. Every health care facility caring for neonates should implement an effective pain-prevention program, which includes strategies for routinely assessing pain, minimizing the number of painful procedures performed, effectively using pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies for the prevention of pain associated with routine minor procedures, and eliminating pain associated with surgery and other major procedures.

### Must we press on until a young mother dies? Remifentanil patient controlled analgesia in labour may not be suited as a "poor man's epidural" [^11795b7f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

It goes without saying that even this 'innocent', because less invasive, intervention is associated with more side effects for women such as nausea (RR 43.10, 95% CI 2.63 to 706.74, one study, 509 women), vomiting (RR 9.05, 95% CI 1.18 to 69.32, two studies, 619 women), dizziness (RR 113.98, 95% CI 7.09 to 1833.69, one study, 509 women) and drowsiness (RR 77.59, 95% CI 4.80 to 1254.96, one study, 509 women) when compared with placebo or no treatment. These findings support the notion, that it cannot be argued that such an intervention should be tried first, with the argument that no relevant adverse effects will occur. In addition it might be important to note that nitrous oxide is a greenhouse gas and reacts with ozone. More recently there is increasing evidence of neuroapoptosis induced by anesthetic agents in the developing brain. The role of nitrous oxide in this context is unclear.

In a study hypothesizing that remifentanil would provide better analgesia during labour than nitrous oxide, the authors compared intravenous remifentanil in 0.4 μg/kg PCA doses with 1-min infusion and lock-out times with intermittent inhaled 50% nitrous oxide during a 20-min study period with a subsequent 20-min wash-out sequence after each period. The main result had been that the "median decrease in pain score for remifentanil was 1.5 and that for nitrous oxide 0.5 (P = 0.01)" on a verbal numeric rating scale from 0 to 10. Furthermore, "the parturients gave better pain relief scores with remifentanil than with nitrous oxide" with a median of 2.5 (remifentanil) vs. 0.5 (nitrous oxide), respectively. In contrast to these more beneficial effects "sedation was reported more often, and SaO 2 was slightly lower during remifentanil administration" Although blinding was ensured, most patients preferred the analgesia provided by remifentanil to that provided by nitrous oxide (14 vs 1, out of 15 parturients who completed the study).

Lower-risk BRUE — venous or arterial blood gas testing for IEM: Clinicians "Should Not Obtain a Measurement of Venous or Arterial Blood Gases To Detect an IEM in Infants Presenting With a Lower-Risk BRUE (Grade C, Moderate Recommendation)". Stated benefits are to "Reduce costs, unnecessary testing, pain, risk of thrombosis, and caregiver/infant anxiety" and to "Avoid consequences of false-positive results", with the risk that testing "May miss detection of an IEM". The benefit–harm assessment notes that reducing testing, cost, and false positives "outweigh the rare missed diagnostic opportunity for an IEM", and the strength is "Moderate recommendation".

### This baby is not for turning: women's experiences of attempted external cephalic version [^114w5jY6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study describes Australian women's experiences who underwent an ECV which resulted in a baby who remained a breech presentation. Other studies have described women's experiences of having a breech presenting baby and ECV. Our findings add to the understanding of women's experiences with a breech-presenting baby in the late third trimester of pregnancy as many women are offered an ECV,

It was common for women to seek out a variety of complementary therapies for the relief of pregnancy-related complaints and symptoms, and this included turning babies. This study showed that women used alternative therapies to attempt spontaneous cephalic version. However, few were reported in the literature as having any major effect on turning babies, although moxibustion (a Chinese herbal medical intervention that stimulates acupuncture points) may have some effect in reducing CS rates when used in conjunction with positional therapies.

Alternative therapies can also be used to reduce the discomfort of an ECV. Women were not given analgesia during the ECV in this study, although methods to reduce discomfort can include hypnosis, inhalation analgesia, injectable analgesia, and regional anaesthesia. However, pain levels vary in women and women's perception and recollection of pain are important. Vlemmix et al. concluded that a woman's willingness to agree to undergo an ECV is influenced by her perception of the pain and the likely success of converting her baby to a cephalic presentation. Women's recollection of pain can also be diminished if their ECV was successful. This may explain why the majority of women in this study reported it as a painful experience, as they all had an unsuccessful ECV, although this memory may have been compounded by the distress three quarters of them felt when they were told to expect a CS.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: troublesome crying in infancy [^114tcfGM]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2013). Low credibility.

There is much written in the medical and lay literature about managing babies who cry too much. Healthcare professional often feel bewildered about how to go about trying to help a baby and their carer, usually the mother. They often undertake investigations, prescribe medication or alter the baby's diet. The assumption made by this approach is that the crying reflects pain or discomfort. In a normal infant who is growing well, it is rare to be able to identify any quickly treatable medical underlying disorder. Those who are inexperienced may find the idea of a behavioural approach very challenging but perhaps this would be a better alternative.

### Carbon dioxide rebreathing induced by crib bumpers and mesh liners using an infant manikin [^111auerJ]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

ARS head mass was 2 kg, which is in the range of a 1 to 6 month old. We recognise that 2 kg is on the higher end of the range of the head masses, but this simulates the potential worst case scenario where exogenous forces (wedging, crib-sharing partner or other objects) push the face into the sample. We used a slatted crib with flat slats 40 mm wide and a 56 mm gap between edges of adjacent slats; in all tests, we placed the tip of the nose of ARS centred in the gap between the slats.

For each sample, a baseline measurement was taken with the ARS free-breathing and in the centre of the crib away from the sample. Then, the baby was placed prone on the sample, and the manikin remained in this position until the CO 2 RB reached a stable value, after which the CO 2 RB measurement was recorded and the manikin returned to the free-breathing position in the centre of the crib. After the CO 2 RB returned to baseline conditions, the experiment was repeated an additional two times for a total of three measurements per sample. The time between measurements was 2–3 min.

For comparison with the ML, ALT and CB samples, we tested several typical conditions found in unattended sleeping children that have been previously studied in vivo or with an ARS, as well as discovered in retrospective death case studies. The first was an infant put to bed supine in the centre of the crib with a pacifier in their mouth. The second was the condition where a receiving blanket, which could become unwrapped from a swaddled baby placed to bed, was draped over the entire face and torso (online supplementary figure 2). In addition to these aforementioned conditions that are plausible when compliant with the safe sleeping recommendations, we also tested the condition where a stuffed animal was placed in the crib with the child, which would be considered unsafe by the safe sleeping recommendations (online supplementary figure 3). It is important to note that blankets and stuffed animals have been associated with infant death cases.

### Views of people who have given birth on the environmental and occupational exposure risks of nitrous oxide for labour analgesia: an interview-based qualitative study [^114CCvst]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Participants felt that Trusts have a responsibility to people giving birth, with a sense that " money isn't invested as well as it could be to look after women and babies " (Participant 6). Participants described concern that " women are being punished for [nitrous oxide emissions] " (Participant 10) and "… just to target childbirth and women's health, again feels a little bit personal… " (Participant 3). Related to the limited analgesia options discussed above, a complementary way of approaching nitrous oxide mitigation is supporting research into alternative labour analgesia, to have " some different pain relief options " (Participant 4).

Participants felt that Trusts have a responsibility to reduce nitrous oxide emissions in the context of NHS emissions as a whole, with participants interested to know " Is it [nitrous oxide for labour analgesia] the biggest contributor or is it having the biggest negative impact on the environment out of everything that the healthcare profession provides? " (Participant 12). Though the cumulative effect of nitrous oxide use was recognised as it has " been used for a long time… there are a lot of births happening at a lot of time " (Participant 11), others felt that " there are other situations which we could reduce emissions apart from giving birth " (Participant 10).

Participants felt that Trusts are responsible for balancing nitrous oxide mitigation investment against other financial priorities, such as " the staff… I think that should be foremost what gets sorted and then you can look at the environmental stuff " (Participant 5). At the same time, " ensuring that the NHS is sort of sustainable, minimising its environmental impact like in the long term, that is what's best for everyone " (Participant 7). Occupational exposure risks of nitrous oxide should be factored in when discussing investment into nitrous oxide emission mitigation technologies because " when it [the environmental risk of nitrous oxide] is coupled with risk to staff as well… the two together feel like quite [an] immediate concern " (Participant 3).

We asked participants how much money they thought was reasonable to spend on nitrous oxide mitigation in relation to the cost of perinatal care. This was universally difficult to answer with responses such as " it's hard to tell, to be honest, it's really hard " (Participant 9) and, despite reflecting between interviews on how to probe this from a different angle, we did not collect rich data in this area.

### The provision of the baby box was associated with safe sleep practices in a low-resource community: a randomized control trial in Ecuador [^113V7qBS]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction/background

Sudden Unexpected Infant Deaths (SUIDs) that are sleep-environment related are diagnosed as suffocation, entrapment, or unknown etiology. Those where the causes of death are investigated and remain of unknown etiology, make up the majority of SUIDs and are categorized as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and 90% of these deaths occur prior to 6 months of age. In high income countries SUIDs tend to be inequitably distributed, where the burden is greater in populations with numerous health disparities; specifically those with socioeconomic, racial/ethnic, and educational disparities are most at risk of SUIDs.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s researchers in several European countries and New Zealand found many SUIDs were linked to the prone sleep position, which was followed by mass public health campaigns promoting "Back to Sleep", whereby parents and care givers were instructed to place their infants in a supine or face up position to sleep. These strategies led to a dramatic reduction in infant deaths and increased scrutiny of the sleep environment in other countries. Supine sleeping was later widely promoted globally and adopted in the United States (US) as were other sleep environment recommendations to reduce SUID, but less is known about SUID rates and safe infant sleep practices in other parts of the Americas.

### Betamethasone sodium phosphate and betamethasone acetate, bupivacaine hydrochloride, povidine iodine (marbeta 25 kit) [^113ArFzE]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Benzyl alcohol as a preservative has been associated with a fatal "Gasping Syndrome" in premature infants and infants of low birth weight. Solutions used for further dilution of this product should be preservative-free when used in the neonate, especially the premature infant. The initial dosage of parenterally administered Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate Injectable Suspension may vary from 0.25 to 9 mg per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administrations in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages.

It Should Be Emphasized That Dosage Requirements Are Variable and Must Be Individualized on the Basis of the Disease Under Treatment and the Response of the Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. Situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

### The effect of the swaddling method on stress levels in newborns administered nasal CPAP [^114htkA1]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

nCPAP Application Method

nCPAP application was performed using a Hamilton c1 neo device. Air leakage, circuit, and oxygen sensor control tests were performed before the application. Before the baby was connected to the ventilator, an interface (nasal tube 50, 70, 100 mm) and a binasal cannula or nasal mask (S, M, L) in sizes suitable for the baby's weight were selected at the end of the ventilator set and connected to each other and worn on the newborn's head. A sponge was placed in the area where the hat [appropriate size for the head circumference (17–22, 22–25, and 25–29 cm)] meets the nasal tube to reduce the risk of compression on the baby's head, and the circuit connection was established. An orogastric catheter was inserted into the newborn to prevent gastric distension, and gastric decompression was provided by leaving the tip of the catheter open.

Swaddling Method

The newborn was placed in the supine position on a fabric blanket, naked except for a diaper; the upper edge of the fabric blanket was aligned with the newborn's shoulder, the newborn's arms were placed in the flexion-adduction position, and the horizontal ends of the fabric blanket were folded in the opposite direction to cover the upper trunk. The baby's head was allowed to move freely. The upper torso was completely wrapped with the fabric blanket. Then newborns were wrapped with the fabric blanket legs in flexion and abduction a suitable space was left at the bottom of the fabric blanket for the comfort of the newborn's feet, and it was ensured that it was not too tight (17, 18). This whole swaddling process was completed in approximately one minute. A heat probe was placed in the axillary region before swaddling and for preventing hyperthermia the body temperature of the newborns was kept between 36.6 and 37.5 ºC. In the NICU, the incubator temperature is kept at 33.3 ± 1.0 °C in 1,500–2,500-gram babies and 32.8 ± 1.5 °C in 2,500-gram and above babies. Cotton, a soft textured fabric that does not irritate the skin of the newborn, was used for swaddling. The fabric blanket was square, 1800 cm 2 (90 × 90 cm), and 75 g.

### Sweet tasting solutions for reduction of needle-related procedural pain in children aged one to 16 years [^114goTcH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Extensive evidence exists showing analgesic effects of sweet solutions for newborns and infants. It is less certain if the same analgesic effects exist for children one year to 16 years of age. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 10, 2011 (Harrison 2011) titled Sweet tasting solutions for reduction of needle-related procedural pain in children aged one to 16 years.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of sweet tasting solutions or substances for reducing needle-related procedural pain in children beyond one year of age.

Search Methods

Searches were run to the end of June 2014. We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Cochrane Methodology Register, Health Technology Assessment, the NHS Economic Evaluation Database, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and ACP Journal Club (all via OvidSP), and CINAH (via EBSCOhost). We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCT) in which children aged one year to 16 years, received a sweet tasting solution or substance for needle-related procedural pain. Control conditions included water, non-sweet tasting substances, pacifier, distraction, positioning/containment, breastfeeding, or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Outcome measures included crying duration, composite pain scores, physiological or behavioral pain indicators, self-report of pain or parental or healthcare professional-report of the child's pain. We reported mean differences (MD), weighted mean difference (WMD), or standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using fixed-effect or random-effects models as appropriate for continuous outcome measures. We reported risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD), and the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) for dichotomous outcomes. We used the I(2) statistic to assess between-study heterogeneity.

Main Results

We included one unpublished and seven published studies (total of 808 participants); four more studies and 478 more participants than the 2011 review. Six trials included young children aged one to four years receiving sucrose or candy lollypops for immunisation pain compared with water or no treatment. Usual care included topical anaesthetics, upright parental holding, and distraction. All studies were well designed blinded RCTs, however, five of the six studies had a high risk of bias based on small sample sizes. Two studies included school-aged children receiving sweet or unsweetened chewing gum before, or before and during, immunisation and blood collection. Both studies, conducted by the same author, had a high risk of bias based on small sample sizes. Results for the toddlers/pre-school children were conflicting. Duration of cry, using a random-effects model, was not significantly reduced by sweet taste (six trials, 520 children, WMD -15 seconds, 95% CI -54 to 24, I(2) = 94%). Composite pain score at time of first needle was reported in four studies (n = 121 children). The scores were not significantly different between the sucrose and control group (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -1.27 to 0.75, I(2) = 86%). A Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale score > 4 was significantly less common in the sucrose group compared to the control group in one study (n = 472, RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.67; RD -0.29, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.20; NNTB 3, 95% CI 3 to 5; tests for heterogeneity not applicable. For school-aged children, chewing sweet gum before needle-related painful procedures (two studies, n = 111 children) or during the procedures (two studies, n = 103 children) did not significantly reduce pain scores. A comparison of the Faces Pain Scale scores in children chewing sweet gum before the procedures compared with scores of children chewing unsweetened gum revealed a WMD of -0.15 (95% CI -0.61 to 0.30). Similar results were found when comparing the chewing of sweet gum with unsweetened gum during the procedure (WMD 0.23, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.74). The Colored Analogue Scale for children chewing sweet gum compared to unsweetened gum before the procedure was not significantly different (WMD 0.24 (-0.69 to 1.18)) nor was it different when children chewed the gum during the procedure (WMD 0.86 (95% CI -0.12 to 1.83)). There was no heterogeneity for any of these analyses in school-aged children (I(2) = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the eight studies included in this systematic review update, two of which were subgroups of small numbers of eligible toddlers from larger studies, and three of which were pilot RCTs with small numbers of participants, there is insufficient evidence of the analgesic effects of sweet tasting solutions or substances during acutely painful procedures in young children between one and four years of age. Further rigorously conducted, adequately powered RCTs are warranted in this population. Based on the two studies by the same author, there was no evidence of analgesic effects of sweet taste in school-aged children. As there are other effective evidence-based strategies available to use in this age group, further trials are not warranted. Despite the addition of four studies in this review, conclusions have not changed since the last version of the review.

### Alprostadil (Caverject) [^116wsa6b]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.6	Risks of Use in Combination with Other Vasoactive Medications Injected Intracavernosally

The safety and efficacy of combinations of CAVERJECT and other vasoactive agents injected intracavernosally have not been established in clinical studies. The risks of prolonged erection, priapism, and hypotension may be increased.

5.7	Needle Breakage

Separate needles should be used for reconstitution and administration. A superfine needle is used for administration of CAVERJECT. As with all superfine needles, the possibility of needle breakage exists. Needle breakage, with a portion of the needle remaining in the penis, has been reported and, in some cases, has required hospitalization and surgical removal. Careful instruction in proper patient handling and injection techniques may minimize the potential for needle breakage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.8	Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions in Infants due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative

When reconstituted using the recommended diluent, the solution contains benzyl alcohol. Serious and fatal adverse reactions including "gasping syndrome" can occur in neonates and low birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved formulations in infusion solutions, including CAVERJECT. The "gasping syndrome" is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations. CAVERJECT is not indicated for use in pediatric patients.

5.9 	Counsel Patients about Sexually Transmitted Diseases

The use of CAVERJECT offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Counsel patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

### Topical anaesthesia for needle-related pain in newborn infants [^111QVfxn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hospitalised newborn neonates frequently undergo painful invasive procedures that involve penetration of the skin and other tissues by a needle. One intervention that can be used prior to a needle insertion procedure is application of a topical local anaesthetic.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical anaesthetics such as amethocaine and EMLA in newborn term or preterm infants requiring an invasive procedure involving puncture of skin and other tissues with a needle.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase and CINAHL up to 15 May 2016; previous reviews including cross-references, abstracts, and conference proceedings. We contacted expert informants. We contacted authors directly to obtain additional data. We imposed no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, quasi-randomised controlled trials, and cluster and cross-over randomised trials that compared the topical anaesthetics amethocaine and eutectic mixture of local anaesthetics (EMLA) in terms of anaesthetic efficacy and safety in newborn term or preterm infants requiring an invasive procedure involving puncture of skin and other tissues with a needle DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: From the reports of the clinical trials we extracted data regarding clinical outcomes including pain, number of infants with methaemoglobin level 5% and above, number of needle prick attempts prior to successful needle-related procedure, crying, time taken to complete the procedure, episodes of apnoea, episodes of bradycardia, episodes of oxygen desaturation, neurodevelopmental disability and other adverse events.

Main Results

Eight small randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria (n = 506). These studies compared either EMLA and placebo or amethocaine and placebo. No studies compared EMLA and amethocaine. We were unable to meta-analyse the outcome of pain due to differing outcome measures and methods of reporting. For EMLA, two individual studies reported a statistically significant reduction in pain compared to placebo during lumbar puncture and venepuncture. Three studies found no statistical difference between the groups during heel lancing. For amethocaine, three studies reported a statistically significant reduction in pain compared to placebo during venepuncture and one study reported a statistically significant reduction in pain compared to placebo during cannulation. One study reported no statistical difference between the two groups during intramuscular injection. One study reported no statistical difference between EMLA and the placebo group for successful venepuncture at first attempt. One study similarly reported no statistically significant difference between Amethocaine and the placebo group for successful cannulation at first attempt. Risk for local redness, swelling or blanching was significantly higher with EMLA (typical risk ratio (RR) 1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24 to 2.19; typical risk difference (RD) 0.17, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.26; n = 272; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 6, 95% CI 4 to 11; I² = 92% indicating considerable heterogeneity) although not for amethocaine (typical RR 2.11, 95% CI 0.72 to 6.16; typical RD 0.05, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.11, n = 221). These local skin reactions for EMLA and amethocaine were reported as short-lasting. Two studies reported no methaemoglobinaemia with single application of EMLA. The quality of the evidence on outcomes assessed according to GRADE was low to moderate.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, all the trials were small, and the effects of uncertain clinical significance. The evidence regarding the effectiveness or safety of the interventions studied is inadequate to support clinical recommendations. There has been no evaluation regarding any long-term effects of topical anaesthetics in newborn infants. High quality studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of topical anaesthetics such as amethocaine and EMLA for needle-related pain in newborn term or preterm infants are required. These studies should aim to determine efficacy of these topical anaesthetics and on homogenous groups of infants for gestational age. While there was no methaemoglobinaemia in the studies that reported methaemoglobin, the efficacy and safety of EMLA, especially in very preterm infants, and for repeated application, need to be further evaluated in future studies.

Regarding medical management for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, more specifically with respect to initial stabilization, ECG-RDS 2023 guidelines recommend to use plastic bags or occlusive wrapping under radiant warmers and humidified gas during stabilization to reduce the risk of hypothermia in infants < 32 weeks of gestation. Avoid hyperthermia too.

### Carbon dioxide rebreathing induced by crib bumpers and mesh liners using an infant manikin [^113y9JL6]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Though the study of rebreathing in CBs is limited to the data presented herein, there is enough similarity to rebreathing with crib mattresses that the methods and data from crib mattress rebreathing experiments can be used as basis for the current study. Most notably, Kemp et al measured CO 2 RB and mattress softness. CO 2 RB was assessed using a manikin with CO 2 measurement capability, with the manikin prone on the mattress. The manikin head was weighted to physiological range. Mattress softness was measured by estimating the contact area between the face and manikin. Of note, the authors found a correlation between softness and CO 2 RB. Similarly, Kanetake and colleaguesdeveloped a spherical head-form that accurately and repeatably assessed softness via measurement of contact area. Using a CO 2 RB manikin, the authors concluded that it was difficult to estimate the rebreathing potential of the bedding on the basis of its softness. Based on these studies and the aforementioned clinical studies of infant response to CO 2 RB, we theorise that two conditions are necessary for storage and rebreathing of exhaled gases in bedding:
An adequate seal is made around the mouth and nose such that exhaled gas is directed into, and gas can be inhaled from, the storage medium (the CB, ML or ALT).
The storage medium has sufficient thickness and density and insufficient permeability to make previously exhaled gas available for inhalation.

### Blowing away the pain: a technique for pediatric pain management [^113dZuAL]. Pediatric Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Painful medical procedures in childhood may have long-term negative effects on development and future tolerance of pain. We describe a distraction technique for pediatric pain management that involves "blowing away the pain". This technique may be used for acute pediatric procedures as well as for patients with chronic pain.

### Moments that matter: childhood pain treatment shapes pain for life-we can do better every time in every child [^112MHdmJ]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Needle procedures, such as vaccinations, blood draws, and intravenous cannulation, are the most frequent source of childhood pain, causing fear and reducing the uptake of medical procedures. Every child has the right to expect pain relief, and we have evidence-based tools to reduce needle procedure-related pain. Therefore, the lack of analgesic provision for needle pain is not justified. We argue that better informed and motivated healthcare professionals and families can advocate for appropriate pain relief in every child, every time.

Observations

Engaging communication campaigns are needed to educate our healthcare professionals. Evidence-based modalities such as topical anaesthesia, sucrose or breastfeeding, comfort positioning, and age-appropriate distractions should be available for every child during needle procedures. However, high-quality information is not enough to change behaviour — healthcare professionals need to be motivated, encouraged, and inspired. Parents and carers should be empowered to advocate for their children and be aware that their child has the right to receive pain relief during these procedures.

Conclusions and relevance

This is a call to action — we need collaboration between academics, healthcare professionals, industry and charities, to expedite behavioural change and parental advocacy through high-quality communication strategies. Effective pain management in infants and children can play a crucial role in promoting the uptake of vaccinations and medical procedures and can influence future attitudes to pain.

### Sucrose for analgesia in newborn infants undergoing painful procedures [^1113awSR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Management of pain for neonates is less than optimal. The administration of sucrose with and without non-nutritive sucking (pacifiers) has been the most frequently studied non-pharmacological intervention for relief of procedural pain in neonates.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy, effect of dose, and safety of sucrose for relieving procedural pain as assessed by validated individual pain indicators and composite pain scores.

Search Strategy

Standard methods as per the Neonatal Collaborative Review Group. A MEDLINE search was carried out for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published from January 1966 - March 2004, EMBASE from 1980–2004 and search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2004). Key words and (MeSH) terms included infant/newborn, pain, analgesia and sucrose. Language restrictions were not imposed. Bibliographies, personal files, the most recent relevant neonatal and pain journals and recent major pediatric pain conference proceedings were searched manually. Unpublished studies, or studies reported only as abstracts, were not included. Additional information from published studies was obtained.

Selection Criteria

RCTs in which term and/or preterm neonates (postnatal age maximum of 28 days after reaching 40 weeks corrected gestational age) received sucrose via oral syringe, NG-tube, dropper or pacifier for procedural pain from heel lance or venepuncture. In the control group, water, pacifier or positioning/containing were used. Studies in which the painful stimulus was circumcision were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial quality was assessed according to the methods of the Neonatal Collaborative Review Group. Quality measures included blinding of randomization, blinding of intervention, completeness of follow up and blinding of outcome measurement. Data were abstracted and independently checked for accuracy by the three investigators.

Statistical Analysis

The statistical package (RevMan 4.2) of the Cochrane Collaboration was used. For meta-analysis, a weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the fixed effects model was reported for continuous outcome measures.

Main Results

Forty-four studies were identified for possible inclusion in this review. Seven studies reported only as abstracts, and sixteen additional studies were excluded, leaving 21 studies (1,616 infants) included in this review. Sucrose in a wide variety of dosages was generally found to decrease physiologic (heart rate) and behavioural (the mean percent time crying, total cry duration, duration of first cry, and facial action) pain indicators and composite pain scores in neonates undergoing heel stick or venepuncture. When pain scores (Premature Infant Pain Profiles) were pooled across 3 studies (Gibbins 2001; Johnston 1999a; Stevens 1999), they were significantly reduced in infants who were given sucrose (dose range 0.012 g to 0.12 g) compared to the control group, [WMD -1.64 (95% CI -2.47,- 0.81); p = 0.0001] at 30 seconds and [WMD -2.05, (95% CI -3.08, -1.02); p = 0.00010] at 60 seconds after heel lance. When results for change in heart rate were pooled for two studies (Haouari 1995, Isik 2000), there were no significant differences between changes in heart rate for infants given sucrose (dose range 0.5 g to 0.6 g) compared to the control group, [WMD 0.90 (95% CI -5.81, 7.61); p = 0.8] at one minute and [WMD -6.20 (95% CI -15.27, 2.88); p = 0.18] at three minutes after heel lance.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Sucrose is safe and effective for reducing procedural pain from single painful events (heel lance, venepuncture). There was inconsistency in the dose of sucrose that was effective (dose range of 0.012 g to 0.12 g), and therefore an optimal dose to be used in preterm and/or term infants could not be identified. The use of repeated administrations of sucrose in neonates needs to be investigated as does the use of sucrose in combination with other behavioural (e.g., facilitated tucking, kangaroo care) and pharmacologic (e.g., morphine, fentanyl) interventions. Use of sucrose in neonates who are of very low birth weight, unstable and/or ventilated also needs to be addressed.

### Effect of topical local anaesthesia on injection pain associated with administration of sterile water injections-a randomized controlled trial [^112A26ex]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

It is essential, for several reasons, to develop safe and effective non-pharmacological pain relief methods offered to women during childbirth. Many women wish to avoid methods that use drugs because of known or unknown side effects for the mother and the unborn baby. It is also essential to identify techniques that provide minimal side effects and discomfort with the highest possible pain relief. SWI has been shown to provide adequate relief of back pain in labor, however, the associated injection pain acts as a deterrent to widespread use. As the study was conducted on non-pregnant women, it is not known if reducing the injection pain will impact the degree or duration of analgesia usually associated with SWI. The next step is, therefore, to evaluate if the pain relief effect for childbirth back pain remains after local anesthesia of the skin before treatment with intracutaneous sterile water injections. The method might also be an option for women in parts of the world where there is limited access to pain relief methods during childbirth. The reduction in injection pain found in this trial may increase the utility of SWI as an option for other severe pain conditions such as ureterolithiasis or other different kinds of chronic pain.

### Safety and tolerance assessment of milk fat globule membrane-enriched infant formulas in healthy term Chinese infants: a randomised multicenter controlled trial [^116nNdVV]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

The analysis of infant milk spit up/vomiting showed that although the prevalence of milk spit up/vomiting in the BFR group was higher than the two formula-fed group at 42 days, the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The possible reason is total volume of breast milk ingested during each feeding may be greater for breastfed infants, thus the higher volume may be responsible for the higher frequency of spit-up/vomiting in the BFR group during first months of life. Although infant regurgitation has been reported as the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders across the world, this phenomenon had dissipated after 4 months of age in all 3 groups. Similar observations were made in recent publication of Chinese infants. Infant milk spit up/vomiting may be caused by the infant drinking milk too quickly or over-consuming within each feed, as the ring of muscle between the esophagus and the stomach (the lower esophageal sphincter) is not yet fully mature in infants. As long as the infant is healthy, content and growing well, the temporary reflux does not need any medication. Interestingly, there was a trend towards an increase in the frequency of night crying in infants at 6 months compared with 4 months of age, around the age when more complementary food is generally introduced to the infants. It is well known that infant night crying can be caused by discomfort or irritation from a wet or dirty diaper, excessive gas, or pain, e.g. colic. It is perfectly normal for an infant to cry at night when hungry, e.g. infants' habit of preferring night milk intake can also cause them to cry more frequently at night (data not shown). At 12 months of age, the SF group showed a significantly higher frequency of night crying than MF group (P < 0.05). Therefore, the night crying might be related to the night milk feeding habit and was associated with a higher frequency of stool mucus at 12 months in the SF group compared to BFR and MF group, as any organic cause of night crying was ruled out by pedistric evaluation. There was no statistical difference in the frequency of all AEs among the three groups on the 42-day, 4-month and 12-month visits (P > 0.05). However, the incidence of diarrhea events in the MF and BFR group was significantly lower than the SF group at the 8-month visit (Table 4). Timby et al. described the beneficial effect of MFGM supplementation on diarrhea prevention in infants aged 6–11 months. This period of time is basically consistent with our findings. Our study also demonstrated that the BFR infants had a significantly lower incidence of lower respiratory infections than the two formula-fed group infants at the 6 and 8-month visits (Table 4). Our findings confirm that breastfed infants have fewer infections. Severe AEs occurred in only one case, in the BFR group, during the CLING study, and was thought to be unrelated to formula consumption or breastfeeding.

### ABM clinical protocol # 25: recommendations for preprocedural fasting for the breastfed infant: "NPO" guidelines [^114UY9Z6]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Infant comfort and prolonged fasting times are highlighted: when an infant is not required to fast, breastfeeding can provide comfort during a painful procedure, whereas inability to access the breast for 4 hours may lead to separation anxiety, hunger, and crying; extensive crying in full-term healthy neonates causes oxygen desaturation, which can occasionally lead to cyanosis and bradycardia, and non‑nutritive sucking on a pacifier can reduce crying; fasting times are often prolonged beyond recommendations, including a study of 1,250 healthy children 2–16 years old in which children were fasting 12 hours from solids instead of 6–8 hours and fasting from fluids for 7 hours instead of 2–4 hours, and fasting times for newborn breastfeeding infants may also exceed the recommended 4-hour period causing unnecessary hypoglycemia, discomfort, and anxiety.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^112ymZMB]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Neonatal resuscitation patient safety considerations emphasize preventing hypothermia and securing the patient, noting that "Hypothermia is common in newborns and worsens outcomes of nearly all post-natal complications", that teams should "Ensure heat retention by drying the infant thoroughly, covering the head, and wrapping the baby in dry cloth", and that when feasible, "kangaroo care… is an effective warming technique". It adds, "Newborn infants are prone to hypothermia which may lead to hypoglycemia, hypoxia, and lethargy", that "Aggressive warming techniques should be initiated including drying, swaddling, and warm blankets covering body and head", and "When available, radiant warmers or other warming adjuncts are suggested for babies who require resuscitation, especially for preterm babies". It further instructs, "Check blood glucose and follow Hypoglycemia Guideline as appropriate", and "During transport, neonate should be appropriately secured (e.g., secured to mother with approved neonatal restraint system, car seat or isolette) and mother should be appropriately secured".

### Bowel habits in preterm infants: observations from the first 2 weeks of life [^1129nH1v]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

3.3 Defecation aid and laxative treatment

In 34 infants, defecation was stimulated with saline enemas from 1 to 11 times (median: 1) during Week 1. During Week 2, 13 infants were stimulated with saline enemas from 1 to 7 times (median: 2). Further, gas relief and rectal stimulation were documented in 9 and 12 infants during Week 1, respectively (gas relief: median: 1, min–max: 1–4 times, rectal stimulation: median: 1, min–max: 1–3 times) and in 12 and 17 infants during Week 2, respectively (gas relief: median: 1, min–max: 1–13 times, rectal stimulation: median: 1, min–max: 1–4 times).

During the observation period, 27 infants were treated with laxatives. The median postnatal age at the prescription of laxatives was 11 days for VPI and 12 days for EPI infants (p = 0.02, Table 3). Prescription of laxatives was lactulose in 85% and macrogol in 15% of cases, and in addition, 11% of lactulose prescriptions were later substituted by macrogol. Prescribed laxatives were not ceased within the observation period. In 24 infants, the justification for initiation of laxative treatment was documented as formed or hard stools (n = 16), defecation difficulties including pushing and grunting (n = 6), fortification of human milk (n = 3), and delayed meconium passage (n = 1). In two cases, there was more than one cause for laxative treatment.

3.4 SIP and NEC

During the study period, five EPI were diagnosed with SIP and one with NEC; no VPI were diagnosed with either. All six infants had GI surgery during the first 14 days of life. For one infant, surgery was performed before the first meconium passage. Five infants received intrapartum indomethacin within 2 days before birth; one of these was diagnosed with SIP within 2 weeks of age.

### Sudden infant death syndrome: an update [^113cG6Mp]. Pediatrics in Review (2012). Low credibility.

Based on strong research evidence: All infants should be placed in the supine position for every sleep. Tobacco exposure pre- and postnatally should be avoided. Room sharing without bed sharing is recommended. It is recommended that blankets, pillows, and other soft bedding be removed from the infant sleep area. Overheating should be avoided. Breastfeeding should be encouraged for SIDS risk reduction. Pacifier use should be encouraged for SIDS risk reduction. Immunizations should be encouraged for SIDS risk reduction. The evidence for fan use or swaddling as strategies to reduce the risk of SIDS is inconclusive.

### Repositioning for preventing pressure injuries [^112KvJMf]. NPIAP (2025). High credibility.

Repositioning — additional considerations for children and neonates include the following. Ensure that equipment used in repositioning neonates and children is appropriate for use in pediatric populations. Be aware that weight distribution varies as children grow. Infants and toddlers have proportionally heavier heads and are at increased risk of occipital PI. Body weight distribution slowly shifts toward adult proportions as the child grows. Pay particular attention to the head of infants and neonates as this is one of the most common anatomical locations in which they experience PIs. Frequently reposition the head where possible and safe (in neonates, discuss safe head positioning with the medical team). Use regular repositioning and pressure redistribution devices (e.g., fluidized positioners) to offload pressure from the occipital ridge.

### ABM clinical protocol # 37: physiological infant care-managing nighttime breastfeeding in young infants [^11179gVE]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Physiological infant care — risk minimization for bedsharing is outlined as follows: ABM has reviewed the evidence to date that bedsharing does not cause SIDS in the absence of hazardous circumstances, despite its association with SIDS, and a well-done case–control study found bedsharing in the absence of hazards to be protective in infants older than 3 months; ABM advises a risk-minimization approach to bedsharing and breastfeeding, stating that hazardous circumstances include, in order of importance: sofa sharing, sleeping with a parent who is impaired by alcohol or drugs, sleeping next to a smoker, sleeping in the prone position, never having initiated (direct) breastfeeding, sleeping in a chair with an adult, sleeping on soft bedding, or sleeping with an infant who is preterm or low birthweight; when hazardous circumstances exist, alternatives such as a sidecar may be an option for some families; the risk of bedsharing is unknown in dyads who are fed by exclusive pumping.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prevention of drowning: 2019 update [^116UEGGS]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Cold water survival — heat loss mitigation, activity limits, and self-rescue guidance are outlined. "A position that has been proven in a laboratory setting to decrease heat loss is the heat escape lessening position", which "is achieved by pressing the arms against the sides of the chest and squeezing the legs together", and during group immersion "the huddle formation has been recommended to lessen heat loss, assist injured or weak persons, and improve group morale". "Swimming or treading water should be limited to minimize heat loss", and "Life jackets should be worn to aid insulation and flotation". "If possible, the ideal location to await rescue is out of the water, even if only partially, to reduce heat loss and delay onset of hypothermia", as motor disabilities "can appear within 10 min of immersion". If exit is not possible, "it may be beneficial to affix one's body or clothing to a floating object". During attempts to swim, "The initial cold shock, which lasts seconds to a few minutes, may prompt gasping and hyperventilation", so "a person should focus on remaining calm and controlling breathing by taking slow, deep breaths", and may have "far less than 10 m of effective swimming, and up to 1 h of consciousness, before succumbing to hypothermia". "All of these statements assume the person is wearing an appropriate lifejacket".

### Viscoelastic tamponade applied to the ocular surface for enhanced control of gaseous egress from the anterior chamber during final bubble titration in DMEK surgery: the "Polite" burp [^114SKJFp]. Cornea (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To present a novel technique for enhancing the surgeon's control over the volume of air or gas that is "burped" from the anterior chamber during final bubble and intraocular pressure (IOP) titration in Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty.

Methods

After ascertaining that the intracameral bubble is either too large and/or has rendered IOP too high, a bead of ophthalmic viscoelastic is applied to the ocular surface over a paracentesis incision, which is then depressed in the usual fashion to burp gas from the anterior chamber.

Results

The weight and viscosity of the viscoelastic create a tamponade that slows the egress of gas from the anterior chamber, thereby making it more controllable.

Conclusions

If the bubble size or IOP needs to be reduced at the conclusion of the Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty procedure, application of ophthalmic viscoelastic over the paracentesis can enhance the surgeon's control over the volume of gas burped from the anterior chamber, thereby reducing the tendency to swing between a bubble that is too large or too small.

### How should we manage pain in ventilated neonates? [^1134L6xu]. Neonatology (2008). Low credibility.

Newborn babies, even if extremely preterm, show responses to pain. The major stress responses seen with surgical pain are associated with serious adverse medical outcomes. There is an ethical imperative to consider pain relief in babies, despite the fact that they cannot verbalise their experience. Ventilator support, and accompanying treatments are described as distressing in adults, and are associated with an endocrine stress response in babies. Opiates have been shown to reduce physiological instability in sick newborn babies. Despite this, they have not been shown to reduce morbidity when given by infusion in ventilated infants, and in view of their serious side effects probably should not be used routinely in this way. It is logical and may be appropriate to give opiates peri-operatively and in babies likely to have severe pain (either from an underlying disease process such as necrotising enterocolitis, or during certain procedures). It is now accepted practice to use a potent analgesic/sedative for elective intubation and as cover for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity. Topical anaesthetic creams reduce the pain response when used in anticipation of phlebotomy or vascular cannulation. Intra-oral sucrose is effective cover for procedures associated with mild to moderate distress, but its role in preterm infants is uncertain. Nursing interventions to reduce environmental stress, although commonly used, have not consistently been shown to be of benefit.

### Elamipretide [^111go1FT]. FDA. Low credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of elamipretide SC:

- Drug hypersensitivity reaction: maintain a high level of suspicion, as hypersensitivity reactions, including serious allergic reactions, have been reported in patients receiving elamipretide.
- Gasping syndrome: maintain a high level of suspicion, as the preservative benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse reactions, including fatal reactions, of new onset or worsening metabolic acidosis that progressed to neurotoxicity, and in some cases gasping syndrome, in low-birth weight and preterm neonates. Elamipretide is not approved for use in neonates.

### Breastfeeding for procedural pain in infants beyond the neonatal period [^113XCtct]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) show that breastfeeding newborn infants during painful procedures reduces pain. Mechanisms are considered to be multifactorial and include sucking, skin-to-skin contact, warmth, rocking, sound and smell of the mother, and possibly endogenous opiates present in the breast milk.

Objectives

To determine the effect of breastfeeding on procedural pain in infants beyond the neonatal period (first 28 days of life) up to one year of age compared to no intervention, placebo, parental holding, skin-to-skin contact, expressed breast milk, formula milk, bottle feeding, sweet-tasting solutions (e.g. sucrose or glucose), distraction, or other interventions.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases to 18 February 2016: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (OVID), Embase (OVID), PsycINFO (OVID), and CINAHL (EBSCO); the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT), ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (apps.who.int/trialsearch/) for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs and quasi-RCTs involving infants aged 28 days postnatal to 12 months and receiving breastfeeding while undergoing a painful procedure. Comparators included, but were not limited to, oral administration of water, sweet-tasting solutions, expressed breast or formula milk, no intervention, use of pacifiers, positioning, cuddling, distraction, topical anaesthetics, and skin-to-skin care. Procedures included, but were not limited to: subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, venipuncture, intravenous line insertion, heel lance, and finger lance. We applied no language restrictions.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently considered trials for inclusion in the review, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. The main outcome measures were behavioural or physiological indicators and composite pain scores, as well as other clinically important outcomes reported by the authors of included studies. We pooled data for the most comparable outcomes and where data from at least two studies could be included. We used mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI), employing a random-effects model for continuous outcomes measured on the same scales. For continuous outcomes measured on different scales, we pooled standardised mean differences (SMDs) and associated 95% CIs. For dichotomous outcomes, we planned to pool events between groups across studies using risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs. However, as insufficient studies reported dichotomous outcomes, we did not pool such events. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

We included 10 studies with a total of 1066 infants. All studies were conducted during early childhood immunisation. As the breastfeeding intervention cannot be blinded, we rated all studies as being at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel. We assessed nine studies as being at low risk of bias for incomplete outcome data. In addition, we rated nine studies as high risk for blinding of outcome assessment. We scored risk of bias related to random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and selective reporting as unclear for the majority of the studies due to lack of information. Our primary outcome was pain. Breastfeeding reduced behavioural pain responses (cry time and pain scores) during vaccination compared to no treatment, oral water, and other interventions such as cuddling, oral glucose, topical anaesthetic, massage, and vapocoolant. Breastfeeding did not consistently reduce changes in physiological indicators, such as heart rate. We pooled data for duration of cry from six studies (n = 547 infants). Breastfeeding compared to water or no treatment resulted in a 38-second reduction in cry time (MD -38, 95% CI -50 to -26; P < 0.00001). The quality of the evidence according to GRADE for this outcome was moderate, as most infants were 6 months or younger, and outcomes may be different for infants during their 12-month immunisation. We pooled data for pain scores from five studies (n = 310 infants). Breastfeeding was associated with a 1.7-point reduction in standardised pain scores (SMD -1.7, 95% CI -2.2 to -1.3); we considered this evidence to be of moderate quality as data were primarily from infants younger than 6 months of age. We could pool heart rate data following injections for only two studies (n = 186); we considered this evidence to be of low quality due to insufficient data. There were no differences between breastfeeding and control (MD -3.6, -23 to 16). Four of the 10 studies had more than two study arms. Breastfeeding was more effective in reducing crying duration or pain scores during vaccination compared to: 25% dextrose and topical anaesthetic cream (EMLA), vapocoolant, maternal cuddling, and massage. No included studies reported adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

We conclude, based on the 10 studies included in this review, that breastfeeding may help reduce pain during vaccination for infants beyond the neonatal period. Breastfeeding consistently reduced behavioural responses of cry duration and composite pain scores during and following vaccinations. However, there was no evidence that breastfeeding had an effect on physiological responses. No studies included in this review involved populations of hospitalised infants undergoing other skin-breaking procedures. Although it may be possible to extrapolate the review results to this population, further studies of efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability in this population are warranted.

Use of local and/or topical pharmacological therapies — Recommendation 21 states that "The panel recommends that clinicians use topical local anesthetics in combination with nerve blocks before circumcision (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)". Supporting text notes effectiveness of the combination and cautions that "eutectic mixture of local anesthetics is associated with risk of methemoglobinemia in infants younger than 3 months of age, with excessive applications, or when using other drugs associated with methemoglobinemia".

Initial resuscitation and airway prioritization in drowning — Because of the central role of hypoxemia in the pathophysiology of drowning, initial resuscitation should focus on establishing and maintaining a patent airway and providing oxygen at the highest concentration available, which may include positive pressure ventilations. Compression-only CPR is likely to be of little to no benefit in drowning resuscitation, and its use should be limited to bystanders not trained to provide full (rescue breath and compression) CPR; bystander CPR for infants and children includes compressions and ventilations, regardless of which is started first. Professional rescuer CPR should emphasize prioritization of airway and breathing with positive pressure ventilation before initiation of chest compressions, because if the airway is overlooked in initial resuscitation, ongoing hypoxemia leads to decreased survival and worse neurologic outcomes. Incorrect administration of rescue breaths can delay care and cause gastric insufflation and pulmonary aspiration. For persons who are not trained, able, and/or willing to give rescue breaths, compression-only CPR is still the recommended method of resuscitation, and all persons who might respond to a drowning person (eg, parents, trip leaders, lifeguards) should take CPR classes that include training on the proper use of chest compressions and rescue breathing.
