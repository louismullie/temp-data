## Question

Any medication to calm anxiety associated with nom invasive ventilation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about medications to calm anxiety associated with non-invasive ventilation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether anxiety during NIV is typically secondary to hypoxemia or ventilatory factors. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines say about routine sedation for NIV-related anxiety. Next, I will examine exceptions where medications may be appropriate, including dexmedetomidine, benzodiazepines, and opioids, and weigh benefits versus risks. After that, I should review non-pharmacologic strategies that are evidence-based. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and state a clear bottom line with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Anxiety during NIV is common and often reflects inadequate ventilatory support, hypoxemia, mask discomfort, or patient-ventilator asynchrony, so the first priority is to optimize the ventilator and oxygenation rather than sedate reflexively, and routine sedation is not recommended in this setting [^1146taCs] [^114DpZT7].

> Wait, let me verify guideline positions before jumping to medications. High-credibility guidance emphasizes that anxiety on NIV should be presumed due to hypoxia or inadequate ventilation and treated primarily with ventilatory adjustments, coaching, and reassurance; routine sedation is discouraged because of risks including respiratory depression, delayed weaning, and delirium, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend benzodiazepines for ICU anxiety in general [^1146taCs] [^1123p8hW] [^1112UMPE].

> Hold on, I should review exceptions where medications may be considered. In selected cases of persistent, severe anxiety despite optimized NIV, short-term anxiolysis can be considered, but the agent of choice should minimize respiratory depression; dexmedetomidine is the most defensible option because it provides anxiolysis and light sedation without clinically meaningful respiratory depression, though bradycardia and hypotension can occur and require monitoring [^111uLBaV] [^1168g1qk] [^1123Gbp6].

> I need to check benzodiazepines carefully. Although lorazepam or midazolam can reduce anxiety, guidelines judge the evidence insufficient to recommend benzodiazepines for ICU anxiety, and they carry higher risks of delirium and oversedation; if used at all, they should be reserved for refractory cases and used at the lowest effective dose with close monitoring, and some palliative contexts allow cautious benzodiazepine use for dyspnea-related anxiety when opioids are inadequate, but that is not a blanket endorsement for NIV anxiety [^1123p8hW] [^1112UMPE] [^113zmPxz] [^11346KjS].

> Let me consider opioids briefly. Low-dose morphine can relieve dyspnea, which often coexists with anxiety, but randomized data in acute respiratory failure are mixed and suggest potential harm, including increased intubation risk in one ICU RCT; thus, opioids should not be used for anxiety per se during NIV and, if considered for refractory dyspnea, require careful titration and monitoring for respiratory depression and sedation [^112BgLtn] [^111HYvgp] [^116QgPGA].

> Next, I should review non-pharmacologic strategies that are evidence-based. Patient-directed music reduces anxiety and sedative exposure in mechanically ventilated patients, and while most data are from invasive ventilation, the mechanism and safety profile make it reasonable to adapt during NIV when feasible; coaching, mask fitting optimization, and family presence are also recommended to reduce distress and improve tolerance [^116Pi3M6] [^11782N8h] [^1146taCs] [^113fyyDH].

> I will now examine a practical, stepwise approach. First, reassess the ventilator settings, mask fit, and oxygenation to correct underlying drivers of anxiety; second, provide coaching and reassurance with clear explanations and a trusted staff member at the bedside; third, implement non-pharmacologic measures such as music or relaxation techniques; fourth, if anxiety remains severe and is compromising NIV success, consider short-term dexmedetomidine with continuous monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure; fifth, reserve benzodiazepines for refractory cases and use the lowest effective dose with delirium screening; sixth, avoid opioids for anxiety and use only for refractory dyspnea with extreme caution and monitoring [^1146taCs] [^116Pi3M6] [^111uLBaV] [^1123p8hW] [^112BgLtn].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a palliative context or declining intubation? In those scenarios, symptom control may prioritize comfort over ventilatory metrics, and cautious use of benzodiazepines for dyspnea-related anxiety may be acceptable, yet even then, clinicians should start low, go slow, and monitor closely for oversedation and respiratory effects, recognizing that this is a different clinical frame than routine NIV for acute respiratory failure [^111gZoxm] [^113zmPxz] [^11346KjS].

> Bottom line, I should confirm the synthesis. Routine sedation for anxiety during NIV is not recommended; optimize ventilatory support and use non-pharmacologic measures first. If medication is absolutely necessary, dexmedetomidine is the preferred pharmacologic option due to minimal respiratory depression, whereas benzodiazepines lack supportive ICU anxiety evidence and carry delirium risk; opioids are not for anxiety and should be reserved for refractory dyspnea with caution. Throughout, reassess frequently and de-escalate as soon as possible to avoid iatrogenic harm [^1146taCs] [^1123p8hW] [^111uLBaV] [^112BgLtn].

---

For anxiety during non-invasive ventilation (NIV), **non-pharmacologic measures are first-line** (coaching, mask fitting, relaxation, music) [^1146taCs] [^116Pi3M6] [^116cYFM9]. If anxiety persists, **low-dose dexmedetomidine** is preferred for its anxiolysis without respiratory depression [^111uLBaV] [^1168g1qk]; monitor for bradycardia and hypotension [^1168g1qk]. Benzodiazepines are not routinely recommended due to delirium and respiratory depression risks; reserve for refractory cases with close monitoring [^1123p8hW] [^1112UMPE]. Avoid opioids unless treating refractory dyspnea, and titrate all sedatives to the lowest effective dose with frequent reassessment [^112BgLtn] [^111HYvgp].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions (first-line)

Non-pharmacological measures are **strongly recommended as first-line** strategies to manage anxiety during NIV:

- **Coaching and reassurance**: Explain the procedure, set expectations, and provide continuous reassurance to reduce anxiety and improve tolerance [^1146taCs].

- **Mask fitting and comfort measures**: Ensure proper mask fit, adjust straps, and use soft interfaces to minimize discomfort and claustrophobia [^113W3ugY].

- **Relaxation techniques**: Teach breathing exercises, mindfulness, and progressive muscle relaxation to reduce anxiety [^116YGLFQ].

- **Music therapy**: Patient-directed music has been shown to significantly reduce anxiety and sedative exposure in mechanically ventilated patients [^116Pi3M6] [^11782N8h].

---

## Pharmacological interventions (second-line)

If non-pharmacological measures fail, **carefully selected pharmacological agents** may be considered:

| **Medication** | **Rationale** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Dexmedetomidine | - Alpha-2 agonist providing anxiolysis and sedation without respiratory depression <br/> - Preferred agent for NIV-related anxiety | - Monitor for bradycardia and hypotension <br/> - Titrate to effect [^1168g1qk] [^111uLBaV] |
| Benzodiazepines (e.g. lorazepam, midazolam) | - Short-acting anxiolytics <br/> - Useful for acute anxiety episodes | - Risk of delirium, respiratory depression, and prolonged sedation <br/> - Use cautiously and monitor closely [^1123p8hW] [^1112UMPE] |
| Opioids (e.g. morphine, fentanyl) | Effective for dyspnea-related anxiety in palliative care settings | - Risk of respiratory depression <br/> - Use only for refractory dyspnea-related anxiety with careful monitoring [^112BgLtn] [^111HYvgp] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus **recommend minimizing sedation** during NIV:

- **Routine sedation is not recommended**: Sedation should not be routinely administered for anxiety during NIV [^1146taCs].

- **Analgesia-first approach**: Prioritize treating pain and discomfort before adding sedatives [^116C4PgQ].

- **Light sedation target**: If sedation is necessary, aim for light sedation to maintain patient cooperation and spontaneous breathing [^114sFz1Y].

- **Regular assessment**: Continuously reassess anxiety, sedation level, and respiratory status to adjust therapy promptly [^113fyyDH].

---

## Risks and benefits of pharmacological interventions

Pharmacological interventions carry both **benefits and risks**:

Benefits include reduced anxiety, improved patient-ventilator synchrony, and enhanced tolerance of NIV, whereas risks include respiratory depression, delirium, prolonged ventilation, and delayed weaning. Therefore, **individualized risk-benefit assessment** is essential before initiating pharmacological therapy [^112bHBBz].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Non-pharmacological interventions are the cornerstone of anxiety management during NIV. If these fail, **low-dose dexmedetomidine** is the preferred pharmacologic option due to its favorable respiratory profile. Benzodiazepines should be reserved for refractory cases with close monitoring, and opioids should be limited to dyspnea-related anxiety in palliative contexts. Regular reassessment and individualized care are critical to optimize outcomes.

### Recommendations on palliative care aspects in intensive care medicine [^111gZoxm]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Palliative care aspects in ventilation therapy

Invasive, as well as non-invasive ventilation (NIV) therapies, are essential components of intensive care. Both ventilation therapies are used in critical care. Most patients can be weaned off ventilation after the acute situation, but in about 20% this is continued. This is called prolonged weaning. Advanced age, especially frailty, and comorbidities can contribute to this. For some of the patients, weaning in special weaning centers is possible, but for others this also fails. In these patients, permanent non-clinical invasive ventilation becomes necessary. The usefulness of ventilation therapy should therefore be clarified at the time of initiating the therapy.

Ventilation therapies thus basically represent a bridging of an acute or acutely worsening disease situation. However, treatment goals and a quality of life corresponding to the patient's wishes cannot always be achieved. Therefore, a regular assessment of the medical indication should be carried out in the case of prolonged ventilation. In addition, after a certain duration of ventilation, the specialized palliative care team should always be consulted in the sense of timely integration. If the intended therapy goals cannot be achieved or if the treatment does not correspond to the patient's wishes, a change of therapy goals should be discussed with the patient. Termination of ventilation may also be possible here.

If the decision is made to end ventilation, relatives should be accompanied and well informed about possible physical reactions. Symptoms such as anxiety or dyspnea may occur and are the focus of symptom relief. Opioids can be used to reduce dyspnea sometimes in combination with benzodiazepines to reduce anxiety. If symptom control is not achieved, targeted sedation reduces symptoms of dyspnea and anxiety. Dose finding is done with regular monitoring of symptom burden.

Ventilation therapy by patients with advanced non-oncological diseases

In patients with advanced pulmonary, cardiac or neurological diseases, acute or acutely decompensating chronic respiratory insufficiencies may occur, which can generally be treated with ventilation therapy. The start of invasive ventilation therapy should be critically evaluated in these patients with regard to the possible medical prospects of success, the threat of intensive long-term therapy and the patient's will. The use of temporary NIV can be a sensible option in terms of a curative approach.

NIV can also be continued or initiated in patients in whom intubation is not medically indicated because of advanced disease or who refuse intubation. Here, it should be ensured that NIV does not lead to more side effects and that a dying process is not unnecessarily prolonged.

### When should sedation or neuromuscular blockade be used during mechanical ventilation? [^114sFz1Y]. Respiratory Care (2011). Low credibility.

Sedation has become an important part of critical care practice in minimizing patient discomfort and agitation during mechanical ventilation. Pain, anxiety, and delirium form a triad of factors that can lead to agitation. Achieving and maintaining an optimal level of comfort and safety in the intensive care unit plays an essential part in caring for critically ill patients. Sedatives, opioids, and neuromuscular blocking agents are commonly used in the intensive care unit. The goal of therapy should be directed toward a specific indication, not simply to provide restraint. Standard rating scales and unit-based guidelines facilitate the proper use of sedation and neuromuscular blocking agents. The goal of sedation is a calm, comfortable patient who can easily be aroused and who can tolerate mechanical ventilation and procedures required for their care.

### Symptom assessment for mechanically ventilated patients: principles and priorities: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^116C4PgQ]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Mechanical ventilation symptom burden and assessment gaps in adult intensive care unit patients are outlined with epidemiology and guideline context: Over 1 million patients receive mechanical ventilation (MV) annually in a U.S. ICU, and patients receiving MV occupy 24–41% of ICU beds in the United States and Canada at any time. Critically ill MV patients experience substantial psychological distress, with over half reporting moderate-to-severe anxiety and more than one-third feeling afraid despite pharmacological therapies. ICU evidence-based guidelines "recommend minimizing sedation for patients receiving MV and an analgesia-first, symptom-based approach", yet "clinical assessment of symptoms other than pain, agitation, and the presence or absence of delirium is not included in the recommendations", and relying solely on unprompted self-report may miss symptoms in this nonvocal population. The report states "it is imperative that clinicians incorporate into clinical practice a comprehensive and holistic assessment of patient symptoms that extends beyond the current focus on pain, agitation, and the presence or absence of delirium", noting that attention to additional symptoms such as dyspnea and anxiety could support individualized management that further minimizes sedative and opioid use.

### Sedation and paralysis during mechanical ventilation [^113KUVwz]. Respiratory Care (2002). Low credibility.

Treatment of anxiety and delirium, provision of adequate analgesia, and, when necessary, amnesia in critically ill patients is humane and may reduce the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorders. Injudicious use of sedatives and paralytics to produce a passive and motionless patient, however, may prolong weaning and length of stay in the intensive care unit. This report reviews indications and choices for pharmacologic treatment of anxiety, delirium, agitation, and provision of anesthesia in critically ill patients. The choice of pharmacologic agents is made difficult by complex or poorly understood pharmacokinetics, drug actions, and adverse effects in critically ill patients. Advantages, adverse effects, and limitations of drug treatment, including use of neuromuscular blocking drugs and use of sedatives and analgesia during the withdrawal of life-sustaining measures are reviewed.

### Low dose of morphine to relieve dyspnea in acute respiratory failure: the opiDys double-blind randomized controlled trial [^112BgLtn]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dyspnea is one of the most distressing experiences a human being can endure. Approximately half of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for acute respiratory failure (ARF) report moderate to severe dyspnea. Average dyspnea intensity in this population is 40 mm on a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from zero (no dyspnea) to 100 mm (worst imaginable dyspnea). Patients undergoing non-invasive ventilation report dyspnea as one of the worst experiences of their ICU stay. In this population, there is a strong association between dyspnea and anxiety. Finally, dyspnea is associated with a higher intubation rate and a higher mortality. It should be noted that in intubated patients, dyspnea is associated with an increased prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder. For all these reasons, controlling dyspnea in ARF patients is a major goal of care.

Unfortunately, dyspnea can persist in spite of the optimal treatment of the condition causing ARF, oxygen supplementation and non-invasive ventilatory support or the correction of metabolic abnormalities. Opioids, well known to relieve dyspnea, could help in controlling dyspnea in ARF patients. The fear of overdose with respiratory depression has historically been the main obstacle to the widespread use of morphine for the relief of dyspnea. However, several meta-analyses have shown the benefit of morphine on long-term persistent dyspnea, but also its safety in patients with end-stage onco-hematological disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or advanced heart failure. In addition, recent guidelines from the American Thoracic Society advocate oral or parenteral administration of opioids for persistent dyspnea.

The objective of this trial was to determine whether the administration of low-dose titrated morphine, compared to placebo, in patients admitted to the ICU for ARF with moderate to severe dyspnea decrease dyspnea without increasing adverse events.

### Effects of patient-directed music intervention on anxiety and sedative exposure in critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilatory support: a randomized clinical trial [^116Pi3M6]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Alternatives to sedative medications, such as music, may alleviate the anxiety associated with ventilatory support.

Objective

To test whether listening to self-initiated patient-directed music (PDM) can reduce anxiety and sedative exposure during ventilatory support in critically ill patients.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Randomized clinical trial that enrolled 373 patients from 12 intensive care units (ICUs) at 5 hospitals in the Minneapolis-St Paul, Minnesota, area receiving acute mechanical ventilatory support for respiratory failure between September 2006 and March 2011. Of the patients included in the study, 86% were white, 52% were female, and the mean (SD) age was 59 (14) years. The patients had a mean (SD) Acute Physiology, Age and Chronic Health Evaluation III score of 63 (21.6) and a mean (SD) of 5.7 (6.4) study days.

Interventions

Self-initiated PDM (n = 126) with preferred selections tailored by a music therapist whenever desired while receiving ventilatory support, self-initiated use of noise-canceling headphones (NCH; n = 122), or usual care (n = 125).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Daily assessments of anxiety (on 100-mm visual analog scale) and 2 aggregate measures of sedative exposure (intensity and frequency).

Results

Patients in the PDM group listened to music for a mean (SD) of 79.8 (126) (median [range], 12 [0–796]) minutes/day. Patients in the NCH group wore the noise-abating headphones for a mean (SD) of 34.0 (89.6) (median [range], 0 [0–916]) minutes/day. The mixed-models analysis showed that at any time point, patients in the PDM group had an anxiety score that was 19.5 points lower (95% CI, -32.2 to -6.8) than patients in the usual care group (P = 0.003). By the fifth study day, anxiety was reduced by 36.5% in PDM patients. The treatment × time interaction showed that PDM significantly reduced both measures of sedative exposure. Compared with usual care, the PDM group had reduced sedation intensity by -0.18 (95% CI, -0.36 to -0.004) points/day (P = 0.05) and had reduced frequency by -0.21 (95% CI, -0.37 to -0.05) points/day (P = 0.01). The PDM group had reduced sedation frequency by -0.18 (95% CI, -0.36 to -0.004) points/day vs the NCH group (P = 0.04). By the fifth study day, the PDM patients received 2 fewer sedative doses (reduction of 38%) and had a reduction of 36% in sedation intensity.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among ICU patients receiving acute ventilatory support for respiratory failure, PDM resulted in greater reduction in anxiety compared with usual care, but not compared with NCH. Concurrently, PDM resulted in greater reduction in sedation frequency compared with usual care or NCH, and greater reduction in sedation intensity compared with usual care, but not compared with NCH.

### What can we learn from patients to improve their non-invasive ventilation experience?' It was unpleasant; if I was offered it again, I would do what I was told' [^113W3ugY]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

This study sampled a representative cohort of patients with severe COPD, who underwent NIV and explored their experience and perceptions. The inductive analysis and descriptive coding allowed us to identify participant themes. After data saturation, four main themes emerged: levels of discomfort with NIV; cognitive experiences with NIV; NIV as a life saver and concern for others. The discomfort with the mask itself and blood gas sampling was not surprising and needs to be taken into consideration when offering NIV treatment. A strong theme was the impaired recall and memory lapses while receiving NIV. It was interesting to see the rationalisation that participants used to navigate the NIV experience. Also of note was the high level of trust placed in healthcare professionals, particularly around decision-making.

NIV in patients presenting with respiratory failure during an acute exacerbation of COPD is one of the few interventions which has shown to improve survival. The participants describe various unpleasant aspects of the treatment such as the tight-fitting mask, the feeling of claustrophobia and suffocation. In addition, several participants recalled blood gas sampling as worse than the BiPAP mask. Others comment on the effect of high airflow, probably due to air leak, and difficulties synchronising with the NIV machine. When discussing the treatment options with patients and their families, the healthcare team needs to be mindful of the considerable discomfort experienced during this treatment. Healthcare teams may wish to consider mitigating some of these adverse experiences by adjusting titration protocols, providing guidance around mask fitting and offering anxiolytics.

A significant finding is the severely impaired recall participants describe following treatment with NIV. Matthewsdescribed widespread hallucinations in patients using NIV. Although few of our participants reported hallucinations, most reported a lack of recall. The prominent feature was the distortion of their memory of the entire experience. This has implications for care during the administration of BiPAP during an acute episode. The patient's distorted view of events prevents them from understanding the life-threatening nature of the episode. This leads to the inability for them to plan for the future using this experience, which has also been identified by Seamark et al. Patients are very vulnerable during this episode and rely heavily on guidance by health professionals. For future planning, it is the responsibility of the clinician to elaborate on the seriousness of the episode of respiratory failure.

### Evidence-based guideline for prehospital airway management [^1146taCs]. Prehospital Emergency Care (2024). High credibility.

Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) anxiety management — routine use of sedation is not recommended for treatment of anxiety in patients on NIPPV, anxiety should be presumed due to hypoxia or inadequate minute ventilation and treated primarily with ventilatory support, and the key to successful use of NIPPV in a patient who has not used it before is coaching, explaining the process, and reassuring the patient.

Mechanically ventilated patients — anxiety assessment and nonpharmacological management: Anxiety is another common symptom that can be routinely assessed by members of a multidisciplinary team using a validated instrument scale in most patients; potentially effective nonpharmacological management strategies include patient-directed music, early psychological interventions targeting self-management, and visits with family members; because symptoms overlap, treating one symptom may reduce others, for example management of anxiety may reduce dyspnea and fatigue.

### Preventing exacerbations in COPD [^116RRhaB]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Patients with frequent exacerbations have high levels of anxiety and depression, significantly impaired health status and faster disease progression. Exacerbations are also the most common cause of emergency respiratory admissions to UK hospitals and are costly to health services. Here we assess whether and how drug and non-drug interventions can help in preventing exacerbations.

### Music interventions for mechanically ventilated patients [^11782N8h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Mechanical ventilation often causes major distress and anxiety in patients. The sensation of breathlessness, frequent suctioning, inability to talk, uncertainty regarding surroundings or condition, discomfort, isolation from others, and fear contribute to high levels of anxiety. Side effects of analgesia and sedation may lead to the prolongation of mechanical ventilation and, subsequently, to a longer length of hospitalization and increased cost. Therefore, non-pharmacological interventions should be considered for anxiety and stress management. Music interventions have been used to reduce anxiety and distress and improve physiological functioning in medical patients; however, their efficacy for mechanically ventilated patients needs to be evaluated. This review was originally published in 2010 and was updated in 2014.

Objectives

To update the previously published review that examined the effects of music therapy or music medicine interventions (as defined by the authors) on anxiety and other outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients. Specifically, the following objectives are addressed in this review.1. To conduct a meta-analysis to compare the effects of participation in standard care combined with music therapy or music medicine interventions with standard care alone.2. To compare the effects of patient-selected music with researcher-selected music.3. To compare the effects of different types of music interventions (e.g., music therapy versus music medicine).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1950 to March 2014), CINAHL (1980 to March 2014), EMBASE (1980 to March 2014), PsycINFO (1967 to March 2014), LILACS (1982 to March 2014), Science Citation Index (1980 to March 2014), www.musictherapyworld.net (1 March 2008) (database is no longer functional), CAIRSS for Music (to March 2014), Proquest Digital Dissertations (1980 to March 2014), ClinicalTrials.gov (2000 to March 2014), Current Controlled Trials (1998 to March 2014), the National Research Register (2000 to September 2007), and NIH CRISP (all to March 2014). We handsearched music therapy journals and reference lists, and contacted relevant experts to identify unpublished manuscripts. There was no language restriction. The original search was performed in January 2010.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials that compared music interventions and standard care with standard care alone for mechanically ventilated patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted the data and assessed the methodological quality of included studies. We contacted authors to obtain missing data where needed. Where possible, results for continuous outcomes were presented in meta-analyses using mean differences and standardized mean differences. Post-test scores were used. In cases of significant baseline difference, we used change scores. For dichotomous outcomes, we presented the results as risk ratios.

Main Results

We identified six new trials for this update. In total, the evidence for this review rests on 14 trials (805 participants). Music listening was the main intervention used, and 13 of the studies did not include a trained music therapist. Results indicated that music listening may be beneficial for anxiety reduction in mechanically ventilated patients. Specifically, music listening resulted, on average, in an anxiety reduction that was 1.11 standard deviation units greater (95% CI -1.75 to -0.47, P = 0.0006) than in the standard care group. This is considered a large and clinically significant effect. Findings indicated that listening to music consistently reduced respiratory rate and systolic blood pressure, suggesting a relaxation response. Furthermore, one large-scale study reported greater reductions in sedative and analgesic intake in the music listening group compared to the control group, and two other studies reported trends for reduction in sedative and analgesic intake for the music group. One study found significantly higher sedation scores in the music listening group compared to the control group. No strong evidence was found for reduction in diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure. Furthermore, inconsistent results were found for reduction in heart rate with seven studies reporting greater heart rate reductions in the music listening group and one study a slightly greater reduction in the control group. Music listening did not improve oxygen saturation levels. Four studies examined the effects of music listening on hormone levels but the results were mixed and no conclusions could be drawn. No strong evidence was found for an effect of music listening on mortality rate but this evidence rested on only two trials. Most trials were assessed to be at high risk of bias because of lack of blinding. Blinding of outcome assessors is often impossible in music therapy and music medicine studies that use subjective outcomes, unless the music intervention is compared to another treatment intervention. Because of the high risk of bias, these results need to be interpreted with caution. No studies could be found that examined the effects of music interventions on quality of life, patient satisfaction, post-discharge outcomes, or cost-effectiveness. No adverse events were identified.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated systematic review indicates that music listening may have a beneficial effect on anxiety in mechanically ventilated patients. These findings are consistent with the findings of three other Cochrane systematic reviews on the use of music interventions for anxiety reduction in medical patients. The review furthermore suggests that music listening consistently reduces respiratory rate and systolic blood pressure. Finally, results indicate a possible beneficial impact on the consumption of sedatives and analgesics. Therefore, we conclude that music interventions may provide a viable anxiety management option to mechanically ventilated patients.

### Narcotic-based sedation regimens for critically ill mechanically ventilated patients [^1165jy5G]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Sedatives and analgesics are routinely used in the intensive care unit to relieve pain and anxiety. These agents have numerous side effects and may contribute to poor outcomes such as increased length of mechanical ventilation, longer ICU stays and acute and long-term cognitive dysfunction. Modifying sedation paradigms utilizing either narcotic-based regimens with remifentanil or fentanyl, or by using alpha2 agonists such as dexmedetomidine may help in improving these outcomes in critically ill patients.

### Drug therapy for symptoms associated with anxiety in adult palliative care patients [^114Y8AZm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2004 (Issue 1) and previously updated in 2012 (Issue 10). Anxiety is common in palliative care patients. It can be a natural response to the complex uncertainty of having a life-limiting illness or impending death, but it may represent a clinically significant issue in its own right.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of drug therapy for treating symptoms of anxiety in adults with a progressive life-limiting illness who are thought to be in their last year of life.

Search Methods

We ran the searches for this update to May 2016. We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), PsychLIT (Silver Platter) and PsycINFO (Ovid). We searched seven trials registers and seven pharmaceutical industry trials registers. We handsearched the conference abstracts of the European Association of Palliative Care.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials which examined the effect of drug therapy for the treatment of symptoms of anxiety in adult palliative care patients, that is, people with a known progressive life-limiting illness that is no longer responsive to curative treatment, including advanced heart, respiratory and neurological diseases (including dementia). Comparator treatments included placebo; another drug therapy or different dose schedule; or a non-drug intervention such as counselling, cognitive behaviour therapies or relaxation therapies.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts to identify potentially relevant papers for inclusion in the review. We sought full-text reports for all papers retained at this stage and two reviews authors independently assessed these for inclusion in the review. We planned to assess risk of bias and extract data including information on adverse events. We planned to assess the evidence using GRADE and to create a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

In this update, we identified 707 potentially relevant papers and of these we sought the full-text reports of 10 papers. On examination of these full-text reports, we excluded eight and two are awaiting classification as we have insufficient information to make a decision. Thus, in this update, we found no studies which met our inclusion criteria. For the original review, we identified, and then excluded, the full-text reports of six potentially relevant studies. For the 2012 update, we sought, and excluded, two full-text reports. Thus, we found no studies that assessed the effectiveness of drugs to treat symptoms of anxiety in palliative care patients.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a lack of evidence to draw a conclusion about the effectiveness of drug therapy for symptoms of anxiety in adult palliative care patients. To date, we have found no studies that meet the inclusion criteria for this review. We are awaiting further information for two studies which may be included in a future update. Randomised controlled trials which assess management of anxiety as a primary endpoint are required to establish the benefits and harms of drug therapy for the treatment of anxiety in palliative care.

### Supportive care of patients on mechanical ventilation [^113fyyDH]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

The paradigm of supportive care of patients who are critically ill has changed significantly over the past 20 years. Patients on mechanical ventilation are no longer heavily sedated; the goal is a comfortable patient who can interact with health-care professionals and with their family members. Systematic, regular assessment of the patient for pain, anxiety, and sleep deprivation allows early recognition of these distressing symptoms. Appropriate treatment of patients' symptoms should be based on a multi-modal pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approach. Early mobilization and avoidance of physical restraint are additional patient-centered goals. The presence of family members during daily rounds and at the bedside can reduce the distress of the patient and enhance communication with the health-care team. All of these changes have created new challenges and opportunities for the multidisciplinary health-care team. This review aimed to describe the main components of evidence-based supportive care of patients on mechanical ventilation, beyond the specific settings of the ventilator.

### The future of intensive care: delirium should no longer be an issue [^117DMb8m]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The implementation of the A–F bundle along with the expansion to A–I bundle is pivotal to achieve the goal of standardized, best practices for sedation. As clinicians gain (G) insight into patient needs, transform to holistic and personalized care with 'home-like' aspects (H) of the environment and redefine ICU architectural design (I) to optimize multidimensional humanitarian care, optimal sedation practices will take a place of importance in clinical care.

Albeit many limitations, recent sedation trials focused at large on pharmacological interventions and did not show a superiority of one agent over another. Nonetheless, current clinical practice guidelines on pain, agitation/sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep, conditionally recommended non-benzodiazepine sedation in ventilated critically ill adults as there are signals that benzodiazepines are associated with increase of delirium onset. Some of these trials, however, demonstrated significant heterogeneity of treatment in older vs younger patients and operative vs medical admission. While the implication of this heterogeneity is yet to be evaluated, it takes us further into individual and personal approach to sedation management. Furthermore, multiple sedative agents have been used in combinations, in most patients. Thus, multimodal sedation should be used to allow easy titration towards light and optimal sedation, and to reduce the adverse events of individual agents. Timely introduction of specific agents that may promote weaning, reduce agitation and delirium will facilitate early weaning and liberation from mechanical ventilation. Moreover, new insights in relation of sedation with personalized care may be provided by trials evaluating the efficacy of patient-controlled sedation to manage symptoms associated with the distress induced by mechanical ventilation. Sedation trials in the future need to incorporate non-pharmacological interventions as part of integrated approach to optimal sedation, anxiolysis and delirium management. Facilitated by the futuristic design of a modern ICU, virtual reality, music therapy, and distraction techniques could all substantially reduce reliance on chemical agents for analgesia, anxiolysis and stress reduction.

Benzodiazepines for anxiety in adult ICU patients — Recommendation 1 states: "There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of benzodiazepines to treat anxiety in adult patients admitted to the ICU", and the panel adds, "Due to a lack of evidence, the panel cannot currently make a recommendation regarding the use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of anxiety in ICU patients", noting that "no studies directly answered our PICO with the exception of one before-and-after cohort study conducted in burn patients which presented limited evidence". Special considerations report that "Severe anxiety is experienced by more than one quarter of intubated patients 6 hours after the interruption of midazolam or propofol, while ten of 16 patients reported anxiety about the endotracheal tube at hospital discharge regardless of sedation", and caution that "abrupt cessation of benzodiazepines prescribed for baseline chronic anxiety may precipitate acute withdrawal; hence, continuation of the chronic benzodiazepines upon admission to the ICU should be considered".

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^111uLBaV]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

NIV is the preferred initial method of mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure during COPD exacerbations. NIV improves hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and work of breathing via the mechanisms discussed above, and it reduces the need for intubation, mortality, and ICU and hospital LOS, while also being associated with lower rates of nosocomial pneumonia. Indications, contraindications, and potential complications of NIV are outlined in Figure 2. Initial settings depend on patient characteristics; however, basic principles include titrating PEEP to improve work of breathing while not worsening hyperinflation (see Invasive Mechanical Ventilation section) and setting pressure support to target a Vₜ of approximately 6 to 8 mL/kg ideal body weight. Patients should be monitored regularly, particularly early in the course, using physical examinations and blood gas assessments to guide settings. For patients with persistent hypercapnia despite initial application of NIV, the pressure support can be uptitrated to increase Vₜ and minute ventilation. Sedative or analgesic medications (eg, opioids or benzodiazepines) are used commonly to manage discomfort or anxiety associated with NIV, and dexmedetomidine, an α₂-adrenergic agonist, is an attractive sedative agent in this setting given its lack of respiratory depression and potential to reduce the risk of intubation and ICU LOS. However, data on the safety of sedative and analgesic medications during NIV are mixed, with a particular risk of harm when combining agents from different medication classes, and these drugs should be used sparingly until additional RCTs clarify their role. –

Although the benefits of NIV in COPD exacerbations are evident, it is important to note that in 20% to 30% of patients, NIV will fail and they will require IMV. Risk factors for NIV failure include older age, higher BMI, higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, and persistent hypoxemia and hypercapnia despite 1 hour of NIV. – Particular attention should be paid to these high-risk patients to identify signs of early treatment failure. In addition a risk score that incorporates heart rate, acidosis, consciousness, oxygenation, and respiratory rate, abbreviated as the HACOR score based on its components, can be used to help predict NIV failure among patients experiencing a COPD exacerbation. Diaphragmatic dysfunction, defined as a change in diaphragm thickness of < 20% on ultrasound during Vₜ, may predict NIV failure, but its usefulness in this setting remains an area of ongoing research.

### Sedation in the mechanically ventilated patient [^113hw4UT]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss the approach to sedation of the mechanically ventilated patient.

Data Synthesis

Mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit frequently require sedation and analgesia for anxiety and pain experienced during the time they are intubated. Multiple drugs are available for this purpose. Strategies that optimize comfort while minimizing the predilection for sedative and analgesic drug accumulation with prolongation of effect have been shown to improve outcomes. In particular, such strategies may decrease mechanical ventilation duration, intensive care unit length of stay, and complications associated with critical illness.

Conclusions

Sedation and analgesia are important in the management of patients who require mechanical ventilation. An evidence-based approach to administering sedatives and analgesics is necessary to optimize short- and long-term outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients.

Remarks:

Every effort must be made to allow the use of NIV, independently of bulbar function.

Invasive ventilation (IV)
Find the right moment to discuss invasive ventilation with the person and their family and carers: This should be part of advance care planning Aim to avoid emergency invasive ventilation (e.g. unplanned hospital admission) Be sensitive about timing, considering the patient's clinical status and the patient's and carer's emotional ability to cope with this conversation.

Diaphragmatic pacing
Do not use diaphragmatic pacing for the treatment of ALS.

Pharmacological interventions*

### Opioids in patients with COPD and refractory dyspnea: literature review and design of a multicenter double blind study of low dosed morphine and fentanyl (moreFoRCOPD) [^114kRF4j]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Refractory dyspnea or breathlessness is a common symptom in patients with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with a prevalence of up to 94% in the last year of life. It is defined as persisting complaints of dyspnea despite optimal standard therapy including, but not limited to smoking cessation, education, inhaled bronchodilators and pulmonary physiotherapy. Refractory dyspnea is known to severely impact quality of life and exercise tolerance, and to increase the risk of depression and anxiety. As the prevalence of COPD is expected to rise during the upcoming decades, it is likely that the number of patients with COPD suffering from refractory dyspnea will also continue to grow.

Advanced treatments such as non-invasive ventilation, bronchoscopic lung volume reduction and lung transplantation can improve dyspnea and quality of life in patients with advanced COPD. But these treatments are only available for a proportion of patients with advanced COPD, due to strict eligibility criteria, high health-care costs and sometimes scarcity. Therefore, there is still a need for more widely available treatments of refractory dyspnea. In this context low dosed opioids have previously been investigated, and some positive effect was demonstrated. However, whether the quality of the evidence is sufficient is still a topic of discussion. Furthermore, despite a positive advice on opioids in palliative care guidelines for COPD, prescription appears to be low in clinical practice.

Outcomes

Primary outcome was the average of the dyspnea ratings gathered every 4 hours over the 24 hours following inclusion or until intubation. The following secondary outcomes were measured over the first 24 hours following randomization: intensity of dyspnea-VAS at the end of the intravenous titration and every 4 hours; average anxiety-VAS, respiratory rate and Glasgow coma scale measured every 4 hours; incidence of moderate-to-severe dyspnea and anxiety, defined by a VAS ≥ 40 mm; intubation rate; incidence of Glasgow coma scale ≤ 12; incidence of delirium defined by the CAM-ICU, duration and quality of sleep during the first night as assessed by the patients themselves (informally) at the end of the first night by a VAS (from 0, worst to 100 mm, best); proportion of patients requiring the transition from one oxygenation technique to another; number of non-invasive ventilation sessions; total duration of standard oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and high-flow nasal oxygen; tolerance of standard oxygen, high-flow nasal and non-invasive ventilation (VAS from 0, worst to 100 mm).

Constipation, nausea and severity of dry eye, dry nose and feeling of gastric distension were evaluated at the end of the 24-hour study period (VAS from 0, worst to 100 mm, best). Nurses' adherence to and satisfaction with the protocol were evaluated at the end of the 24-hour study period (VAS from 0, worst to 100 mm, best).

The following adverse events considered medically significant occurring within the first 48 hours were collected: intubation; nausea ≥ grade 3; constipation ≥ grade 4; bradypnea < 12 cycles per minute; coma defined by a Glasgow coma scale ≤ 9, pruritus grade ≥ 4; worsening of respiratory condition requiring intubation.

### A focused update to the clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of pain, anxiety, agitation / sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in adult patients in the ICU [^1168g1qk]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Mechanically ventilated adults in the ICU — dexmedetomidine versus propofol: Across 29 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 3087 adults, mostly targeting light sedation, dexmedetomidine probably reduced delirium prevalence (RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.37–0.81; absolute risk reduction [ARR], 15 fewer per 100; 95% CI, from 20 fewer to 6 fewer) and may reduce delirium duration (MD, –25.58 hr; 95% CI, –43.49 to –7.66 hr). It may slightly shorten ICU length of stay (MD, –0.19 d; 95% CI, –0.33 to –0.05 d) with little to no difference in mechanical ventilation duration (MD, –1.6 hr; 95% CI, –2.77 to –0.42 hr), may improve time at target sedation and reduce need for supplemental analgesics (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52–0.99), and shows little to no effect on mortality at longest follow-up (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.86–1.13; ARR, 0 fewer per 100; 95% CI, from 3 fewer to 3 more). Dexmedetomidine probably increases bradycardia (RR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.28–2.12; absolute risk increase [ARI], 6 more per 100; 95% CI, from 2 more to 10 more) with little to no difference in hypotension risk (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.92–1.25), may improve quality of life and functional status at 6 months, and effects on post-ICU cognitive impairment and 28-day mortality are unclear (certainty ratings as stated on-page).

### Strategies to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-associated events, and nonventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^111jmhrH]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Minimize sedation

Minimize sedation of ventilated patients whenever possible (Quality of Evidence: HIGH).
Preferentially use multimodal strategies and medications other than benzodiazepines to manage agitation (Quality of Evidence: HIGH). Examples include analgesics for pain, reassurance for anxiety, and antipsychotics, dexmedetomidine, and/or propofol for agitation. Dexmedetomidine and propofol are associated with shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay compared to benzodiazepines. A randomized trial of light sedation with dexmedetomidine versus propofol found no difference in ventilator-free days or mortality. Dexmedetomidine may decrease need for intubation in patients on noninvasive ventilation.
Utilize a protocol to minimize sedation (Quality of Evidence: HIGH). Potential strategies to minimize sedation include nurse-driven protocols for targeted light sedation and daily sedative interruptions (ie, spontaneous awakening trials) for patients without contraindications. A meta-analysis of 6 randomized trials reported that protocols to minimize sedation were associated with significantly shorter ICU length of stay compared to managing patients without protocols. There was no significant association between the use of protocols to minimize sedation and duration of mechanical ventilation or short-term mortality. There was insufficient evidence to recommend one protocol over another. A small, single-center, randomized trialsuggested that patients managed with no sedation (but morphine as needed) versus propofol or midazolam may be extubated sooner and have shorter ICU length of stay, but a subsequent multicenter randomized trial of no sedation versus light sedation with daily sedative interruptions reported no difference in ventilator-free days, ICU-free days, or 90-day mortality.
Implement a ventilator liberation protocol (Quality of Evidence: HIGH) Assess readiness to extubate daily in patients without contraindications (i.e. conduct spontaneous breathing trials). – Ventilator liberation protocols are associated with extubating patients an average of 1 day earlier compared to managing patients without a protocol. Protocols to minimize sedation, mobilize patients, andliberate them from mechanical ventilation may be synergistic.

Maintain and improve physical conditioning

Provide early exercise and mobilization (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE). Early exercise and mobilization programs may shorten duration of mechanical ventilation, reduce ICU length of stay, lower VAP rates, and increase the rate of return to independent function.– There is no consistent association between early mobilization and hospital length of stay or mortality. Financial modeling suggests that early mobility programs may be cost saving.

### Management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease beyond the lungs [^1126Svoi]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an umbrella term that covers many clinical subtypes with clearly different pulmonary and extra-pulmonary characteristics, but with persistent airflow limitation in common. This insight has led to the development of a more personalised approach in bronchodilator therapy, prevention of exacerbations, and advanced treatments (such as non-invasive ventilation and lung volume reduction techniques). However, systemic manifestations and comorbidities of COPD also contribute to different clinical phenotypes and warrant an individualised approach as part of integrated disease management. Alterations in bodyweight and composition, from cachexia to obesity, demand specific management. Psychological symptoms are highly prevalent, and thorough diagnosis and treatment are necessary. Moreover, prevention of exacerbations requires interventions beyond the lungs, including treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, reduction of cardiovascular risks, and management of dyspnoea and anxiety. In this Review, we discuss the management of COPD beyond the respiratory system and propose treatment strategies on the basis of the latest research and best practices.

### NCT04467086 | Propranolol as an anxiolytic to reduce the… [^116ke6Fz]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Propranolol as an Anxiolytic to Reduce the Use of Sedatives From Critically-ill Adults Receiving Mechanical Ventilation ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Propranolol is a plentiful and inexpensive, non-selective beta-adrenergic blocker with good penetration of the blood-brain barrier, which can reduce agitation and arousal. The study team published a single-centre retrospective study of 64 mechanically-ventilated patients which found the initiation of propranolol was associated with an 86% reduction in propofol dose and a roughly 50% reduction in midazolam dose while maintaining the same level of sedation. Propranolol has the potential to mitigate the threat posed by worldwide sedative shortages and improve critical care management of patients who require mechanical ventilation. This study seeks to evaluate whether the addition of propranolol to a standard sedation regimen reduces the dose of sedative needed in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation.

This study is an open-label randomized controlled trial, single-blinded with 1: 1 allocation. Both arms will receive sedation according to usual intensive care unit practice with a sedative agent. Background and Rationale: Critically ill patients often require sedation for comfort and to tolerate mechanical ventilation. There are internationally accepted guidelines for sedation of critically ill patients, and dexmedetomidine and propofol are recommended as sedative agents over alternatives, such as benzodiazepines. There is now a worrying shortage of propofol in Canada, the European Union, and parts of the US. An extensive search of PubMed and Web of Science did not reveal published trials of propranolol as a sedative agent in critical illness or mechanical ventilation. However, propranolol was shown to significantly reduce agitation in a randomized controlled trial in patients with traumatic brain injury.

Observational studies in traumatic brain injury have shown that propranolol use is associated with a shorter length of hospital and ICU stay, and possibly a lower mortality risk, without reports of significant side effects. Does the addition of propranolol to a standard sedation regimen reduce the dose of sedative needed in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Study Design: Open-label, Randomized Controlled Trial, 1: 1 allocation Patient Population: Participants are adult patients admitted to an intensive care unit who are anticipated to require mechanical ventilation > 48h, who are requiring intravenous sedatives to achieve a sedation goal that is anticipated to be stable for > 48h.

Outcome parameters

The primary study outcome was the change in PaCO₂ measured during spontaneous breathing at room air at daytime after 6 months compared with baseline. PaCO₂ was assessed with arterial blood gas analysis by puncture of the radial artery at least 3 hours after cessation of the nocturnal NIV.

Secondary outcomes were safety, symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), measured by the Severe Respiratory Insufficiency Questionnaire (SRI), the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Medical Research Council score to assess dyspnoea; lung function; exercise tolerance, assessed by the 6 min walking distance; compliance with the ventilator, exacerbation and hospitalisation frequency (assessed by checking medical records from the hospital and the general practitioner and by checking pharmacy read-outs for courses or prednisolone and/or antibiotics prescribed for COPD exacerbations) and costs. The direct (medical and non-medical) and indirect costs of NIV initiation at home were compared with in-hospital NIV initiation over a 6-month period using a societal perspective.

### Animal-assisted intervention in the ICU: a tool for humanization [^116DzuL7]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Patient suffering and the humanized ICU: where do non-pharmacological interventions fit?

To aid in conceptualizing non-pharmacologic interventions in the ICU, we propose an adaptation of the Loeser pain and suffering model. This model highlights the inter-relatedness of physiologic and emotional suffering, and the importance of interdisciplinary care in recovery from disease (Fig. 1). In the model, the innermost circle represents physiologic burden where patients sustain physiologic changes, such as hypoxia or hypotension, and require medical interventions, such as mechanical ventilation or vasopressors. The second circle represents suffering, which includes the patient's thoughts (e.g. "I am short of breath. I am dying"; "I am a burden and worthless"; "Walking while critically ill will harm me") and emotions (e.g. anxiety, sadness, and loneliness) about their physiologic and environmental experience. Non-pharmacologic interventions to alleviate suffering can include education, psychological support, and other methods to reduce distress (e.g. cognitive-behavioral therapy, animal-assisted intervention, and music intervention). The third circle represents behavior, wherein worsening of physiologic burden and suffering can change patient engagement in medical and/or rehabilitation care (e.g. disengagement in rehabilitation, avoidance of medical information, declining recommended medical interventions). In the behavior realm, interventions (e.g. early mobility and motivational interviewing) move patients toward action and reinforce their role as participants in their own recovery.

Fig. 1
Application of non-pharmacological intervention in the humanized ICU may lead to reduced physiologic burden, less suffering, and more engaged behavior with reciprocal effects in each domain

Interventions in one circle have the potential to influence outcomes in other domains. Equally important is acknowledging that the patients' experiences at each level are real even if they are difficult to observe and measure. Increased attention to both patient suffering and behavior domains ensures comprehensive care and potentially better long-term outcomes.

### Low dose of morphine to relieve dyspnea in acute respiratory failure: the opiDys double-blind randomized controlled trial [^111HYvgp]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

42Discussion

In patients admitted to the ICU for ARF, this phase 2 pilot randomized controlled trial found no significant benefit of low-dose morphine on average dyspnea over 24 hours, although intravenous morphine titration significantly reduced dyspnea during the first four hours. Of concern was the fact that morphine was associated with an increased risk of intubation.

In recent years, dyspnea has become a matter of concern in ICU patients. Indeed, dyspnea is frequent and severe in patients admitted for ARF. Dyspnea is associated with anxiety. It is also associated with a higher prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorders. Relieving dyspnea should be a major target, such as controlling pain. When significant dyspnea persists despite treating the cause of ARF and administering a non-invasive respiratory support, it is permissible to consider the administration of opioids, in the absence of any other pharmacological approach, and based on their known effect on dyspnea in other clinical contexts. Original research and subsequent meta-analyses have shown that morphine successfully relieves dyspnea in patients with terminal cancer, cardiac failure, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease In the ICU, recent data suggest that morphine successfully relives dyspnea in intubated patients, but no randomized trial had been conducted in ICU patients exhibiting moderate to severe dyspnea upon admission. This is the reason why we decided to conduct the present study. Morphine did improve dyspnea transiently, but failed to show any significant effect on the 24-hour average dyspnea as we defined it. One of the potential explanations is that the subcutaneous dosage of the repeated administrations was not high enough. Another explanation is that in both groups, patients received etiological and symptomatic treatment of dyspnea with bronchodilators, hydro-sodium depletion, anti-infectious therapies and ventilatory support with NIV, high-flow oxygen through nasal cannula or standard oxygen therapy. These therapies have a known effect in relieving dyspnea which, although inconstant, can lead to a floor effect, with dyspnea decreasing more rapidly in the Morphine group. For instance, from the 8 th hour after inclusion, dyspnea-VAS was less than 40 mm in both groups, with prevalence of severe dyspnea that was less than 50%. With this in mind, we acknowledge that the choice of the 24-hour average dyspnea as the primary outcome of this study might have been a mistake: to draw a crude analogy, morphine is expected to be effective before fracture reduction, and much less so 24 hours afterwards. Therefore, regarding patients' comfort, the "end-of-titration" and "four-hour" dyspnea outcomes might be more relevant than the 24-hour average outcome. Another hypothesis would be that there was too much time between dyspnea ratings, possibly combined with too low a dose of morphine, which meant dyspnea was already increasing again at the time of the rating. It is also interesting to note that there is a wide dispersion (visible in Fig. 3), possibly due to significant variations in volume of distribution or pharmacokinetic effects, since morphine worked for the first hour, so the subcutaneous form dispensed afterwards may not be the most suitable.

### Should benzodiazepines be used for reducing dyspnea in patients with advanced illnesses? [^111UD8uL]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2023). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea is a common and highly distressing symptom in patients with advanced illnesses. Many patients continue to experience chronic dyspnea despite optimal management of underlying disease(s) and various non-pharmacologic interventions, necessitating the consideration of pharmacologic therapies for palliation of dyspnea. One commonly asked question by clinicians is whether benzodiazepines have a role in the palliation of dyspnea. In this "Controversies in Palliative Care" article, three groups of thought leaders independently answer this question. Specifically, each group provides a synopsis of the key studies that inform their thought processes, share practical advice on their clinical approach, and highlight the opportunities for future research. All three groups suggest that benzodiazepines alone do not confer a benefit for dyspnea in advanced illnesses based on existing data. They also expressed concerns about the potential adverse effects such as delirium and drowsiness and recommended against benzodiazepines as first line pharmacologic therapy. Some groups suggest that benzodiazepines may be used in highly selected patients with severe anxiety associated with dyspnea. Some investigators may also consider the adjunctive use of benzodiazepines in patients with severe dyspnea despite opioids, particularly if life expectancy is limited. Benzodiazepines also have a role in palliative sedation for refractory dyspnea in the last days of life. More research is needed to confirm the benefit of benzodiazepines in these populations.

### Withdrawal of ventilatory support outside the intensive care unit: guidance for practice [^117QCFte]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Extubation

Extubation should be carried out in accordance with parameters discussed and agreed by members of the MDT and family pretransfer. The withdrawal of LST other than ventilation and initiation of interventions to control symptoms should always be planned for and carried out according to the assessed need of the individual child. Drugs should be available in case of rapid symptom progression.

Parents may require ongoing explanations of potential and actual symptoms the child may experience including how these are/will be managed as the extubation proceeds.

Immediately following extubation the professionals present need to maintain a careful balance between providing families with privacy and being sufficiently available to reduce anxiety. This may be particularly challenging for families whose recent experience in IC has involved the constant presence of healthcare professionals.

Care postextubation

Guidance and support in the management of symptoms with both pharmacological and non-pharmacological agents must be clear and prompt with attention to a plan for feeding and fluids. ECP should be reviewed to ensure they are in keeping with the family's wishes and to ensure all members of the MDT are aware of the family's wishes and decisions. All members of the team and the family should hold a copy.

Parents need to be aware of who to contact should the child survive longer than expected, as well as who to contact and when postdeath.

### Prevalence and management of chronic breathlessness in COPD in a tertiary care center [^117Fq5wr]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Management of breathlessness and frequent comorbidities, such as symptoms of anxiety and/or depression in COPD is insufficient despite pulmonologist's knowledge and willingness. Promoting pulmonary rehabilitation and symptomatic pharmacological treatments might be a key element in the overall management of COPD with a role for opioids use with a tight surveillance.

### A focused update to the clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of pain, anxiety, agitation / sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in adult patients in the ICU [^115iYJ6j]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

ICU enhanced mobilization/rehabilitation — compared with usual care — reduced ICU-acquired weakness (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64–0.93; ARR, 9 fewer per 100 patients; 95% CI, 14 fewer to 3 fewer; high certainty) in a final evidence base of 58 RCTs and 8038 patients, and may slightly reduce the duration of delirium (MD, −1.34 d; 95% CI, −1.85 to −0.83 d), invasive mechanical ventilation (MD, −1.1 d; 95% CI, −1.69 to −0.51 d), ICU length of stay (MD, −1.01 d; 95% CI, −1.75 to −0.27 d), and hospital length of stay (MD, −1.16 d; 95% CI, −2.94 to −0.62 d). Enhanced mobilization/rehabilitation probably improves functional outcomes and quality of life after discharge and may increase the number of patients discharged home (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.00–1.33). There was little to no effect on mortality at longest follow-up, and there is uncertainty surrounding effects on delirium occurrence and ICU mortality. Adverse events may slightly increase for arrhythmias (RR, 2.27; 95% CI, 0.73–7.08; ARI, one more per 100; 95% CI, 0 fewer to 3 more) but likely show little to no difference for accidental line removal (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.25–6.58; ARI, 0 fewer per 100; 95% CI, from 0 fewer to 1 more), unplanned extubation (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.49–1.75; ARI, 0 fewer per 100; 95% CI, from 0 fewer to 1 more), and hypotension (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.47–3.75; ARI, 1 more per 100, 95% CI, from 2 fewer to 9 more). The evidence suggests that the benefits in adult ICU patients outweigh the marginally increased risk, and "the panel issued a conditional recommendation"; because "there was insufficient data to perform a subgroup analysis of post-cardiac surgery patients", "this recommendation applies to the general medical-surgical patients".

### Virtual reality in intensive care [^11542GVX]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

A non-pharmacological way of treating anxiety, stress, and pain?

Stress and anxiety play a significant role in ICU patients. Since pharmacological interventions can have adverse effects, non-pharmacologic interventions such as VR are becoming increasingly important. Jawed et al. studied the use of VR in 15 ICU patients for 15 min and exposed them to relaxing videos. Most patients tolerated the application well and reported positive effects on anxiety and stress. Rousseaux et al. in a randomised controlled trial of 100 patients, tested the use of "virtual reality hypnosis" in patients one day before and one day after cardiac surgery. In this small study, there were no significant differences with regards to the outcome measures (anxiety, pain, fatigue, relaxation, physiological parameters, and opioid use). A randomised controlled trial of 48 patients evaluated the positive effects of VR on the quality of sleep in ICU patients: VR resulted in a significantly better sleep quality, although total sleep time and light sleep time did not differ between the groups. Laghlam et al. evaluated the use of VR in 200 patients undergoing chest drain removal after cardiac surgery. Compared to inhaled nitrous oxide, VR was associated with a higher pain score immediately after drain removal. However, for pain levels reported ten minutes after removal, VR was non-inferior when compared to pharmacological treatment. In another study by Ong et al. 59 patients received meditative VR which focussed on calmness and relaxation. VR was performed once daily for up to 7 days. VR led to reduced subjective levels of anxiety and depression without significant effects on physiological measures, pain, or sleep. Six patients developed delirium, although the authors found no connection with using VR. Aside from immersive VR, neurocognitive virtual stimulation may improve cognitive and emotional outcomes in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients. Navarra-Ventura et al. randomised 72 critically ill patients. One month after ICU discharge, patients who underwent early neurocognitive VR evidenced higher working memory scores and less anxiety and depression than the control group.

Concern for health professionals

Participants were mindful of how their illness and behaviours impacted on health professionals. This included portraying that they were comfortable with NIV, even when they were not. Participants commented on feeling embarrassed about their behaviours such as panic and distress. One participant reported feeling ashamed as, during the initiation of NIV, she verbally abused nursing staff. However participants were grateful when health professionals continued to provide support and care.

P14: and I admit I was ashamed of myself because I abused the nursing staff.

P14: I felt sorry for the nurse I had abused, but she still kept holding my hand.

### Impact of long-term non-invasive ventilation on severe exacerbations and survival in COPD: a French nationwide cohort study using multistate models [^117DCAfg]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

Our analysis included a large number of mortality events (18 125 in total, of which 7805 occurred during a severe COPD exacerbation). Continuation versus cessation of long-term NIV was associated with a reduction in mortality both in the presence and absence of severe exacerbation. The reduction in mortality rate with NIV continuation versus cessation was about 15% in our study. A 2021 Cochrane review concluded that home NIV was likely to reduce all-cause mortality in stable COPD (adjusted HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.97) but did not significantly reduce mortality in a post-COPD exacerbation population (adjusted HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.28). However, those conclusions were based on data from only three studies with 405 participants (stable COPD; moderate-certainty evidence) or two studies with a total of 317 participants (post-exacerbation COPD; low-certainty evidence). In contrast, the number of individuals and events, and the data source used in the current analysis meant that our data provide a good reflection of the long-term effects of domiciliary NIV in a real-world setting. Outside of NIV continuation versus cessation, other predictors of mortality in our study were consistent with those reported in a recent review and meta-analysis (including cardiovascular comorbidity, age, male sex and use of long-term oxygen therapy).

Overall, our analysis showed that long-term domiciliary NIV was not significantly associated with transitions to severe exacerbation (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.00; p = 0.09). Instead, transitions to exacerbations were primarily driven by well-known factors such as COPD severity and multimorbidity. Consistent with published literature, these factors included sex, comorbidities, anxiety/depression and the need for long-term oxygen therapy. The overall message from our analysis is that use of long-term domiciliary NIV in an unselected population of individuals with COPD does not appear to reduce incident severe disease exacerbations but could protect against death during a severe disease exacerbation. However, it is also important to note that the impact of long-term NIV therapy on the risk of transition to severe exacerbation could have been influenced by the fact that patients who discontinue NIV therapy may also decide not to accept other interventions, including hospital admission during a COPD exacerbation.

### Postoperative pain management in non-traumatic emergency general surgery: WSES-GAIS-SIAARTI-AAST guidelines [^111BeD2H]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea

The assessment of respiratory distress should be done using a standardized assessment tool and the presence of suggestive objective signs. We recommend a stepwise approach to the treatment of dyspnea (high recommendation, intermediate quality evidence)
When death is not imminent, the treatment of the etiology of dyspnea is recommended (high recommendation, intermediate quality evidence).
Noninvasive ventilation to control dyspnea is suggested only until a properly deep sedation is reached or when sedation is inadequate. We recommend noninvasive ventilation only in predisposed settings with trained medical staff (high recommendation, intermediate quality evidence).
Opioid usage as first-line treatment for dyspnea is recommended (high recommendation, intermediate quality evidence)

Dyspnea is the subjective awareness of altered respiratory function which usually results in respiratory distress. Respiratory distress is the totality of behavioral modifications that can be observed and measured (use of respiratory accessory muscles, nasal flaring, tachypnea, tachycardia, paradoxical breathing, fearful facial expression). Dyspnea is usually present in dying patients. When possible, being a subjective symptom, it must be assessed directly with the patient using standardized assessment tools.

The use of non-medical strategies to decrease respiratory distress should be considered like optimal positioning in sitting position, increased ambient air flows, use of fans, cold air. Noninvasive ventilation techniques as oxygen therapy include high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation to relief or mitigating dyspnea by reducing the work of breathing in the absence of formal contraindication (intestinal occlusion and vomiting). Aspiration of airways if rattle is present. Anti-secretory medications may or may not be useful or required to decrease pulmonary secretions.

Sedation with benzodiazepines or propofol can be considered as second line if dyspnea is not resolved with adequate doses of opioids since fear and anxiety can be con causes of the dyspnea in the dying patient.

### Early sedation use in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients: when less is really more [^113QJXxN]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Over the last 10 years, there has been an explosion of literature surrounding sedation management for critically ill patients. The clinical target has moved away from an unconscious and immobile patient toward a goal of light or no sedation and early mobility. The move away from terms such as 'sedation' toward more patient-centered and symptom-based control of pain, anxiety, and agitation makes the management of critically ill patients more individualized and dynamic. Over-sedation has been associated with negative ICU outcomes, including longer durations of mechanical ventilation and lengths of stay, but few studies have been able to associate deep sedation with increased mortality.

### Strategies to optimize analgesia and sedation [^116R8Xom]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Achieving adequate but not excessive sedation in critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients is a complex process. Analgesics and sedatives employed in this context are extremely potent, and drug requirements and metabolism are unpredictable. Clinicians must have heightened awareness of the potential for enduring effects and are encouraged to employ strategies that maximize benefit while minimizing risk. Successful sedation protocols have three basic components: frequent assessments for pain, anxiety, and agitation using a reproducible scale; combination therapy coupling opioids and sedatives; and, most importantly, careful communication between team members, with a particular recognition that the bedside nurse must be empowered to pair assessments with drug manipulation. In recent years, two broad categories of sedation protocols have achieved clinical success in terms of decreasing duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit length of stay by minimizing drug accumulation. Patient-targeted sedation protocols (the first category) rely on structured assessments to guide a careful schema of titrated drug escalation and withdrawal. Variation exists in the assessment tool utilized, but the optimal goal in all strategies is a patient who is awake and can be readily examined. Alternatively, daily interruption of continuous sedative infusions (the second category) may be employed to focus care providers on the goal of achieving a period of awakening in the earliest phases of critical illness possible. Newer literature has focused on the safety of this strategy and its comparison with intermittent drug administration. Ongoing investigations are evaluating the broad applicability of these types of protocols, and currently one may only speculate on whether one strategy is superior to another.

### Alpha-2 agonists for long-term sedation during mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients [^1123Gbp6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Sedation reduces patient levels of anxiety and stress, facilitates the delivery of care and ensures safety. Alpha-2 agonists have a range of effects including sedation, analgesia and antianxiety. They sedate, but allow staff to interact with patients and do not suppress respiration. They are attractive alternatives for long-term sedation during mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients.

Objectives

To assess the safety and efficacy of alpha-2 agonists for sedation of more than 24 hours, compared with traditional sedatives, in mechanically-ventilated critically ill patients.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 10, 2014), MEDLINE (1946 to 9 October 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 9 October 2014), CINAHL (1982 to 9 October 2014), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (1982 to 9 October 2014), ISI Web of Science (1987 to 9 October 2014), Chinese Biological Medical Database (1978 to 9 October 2014) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (1979 to 9 October 2014), the World Health Organization international clinical trials registry platform (to 9 October 2014), Current Controlled Trials metaRegister of controlled trials active registers (to 9 October 2014), the ClinicalTrials.gov database (to 9 October 2014), the conference proceedings citation index (to 9 October 2014) and the reference lists of included studies and previously published meta-analyses and systematic reviews for relevant studies. We imposed no language restriction.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing alpha-2 agonists (clonidine or dexmedetomidine) versus alternative sedatives for long-term sedation (more than 24 hours) during mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We performed meta-analyses when more than three studies were included, and selected a random-effects model due to expected clinical heterogeneity. We calculated the geometric mean difference for continuous outcomes and the risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes. We described the effects by values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We considered two-sided P < 0.05 to be statistically significant.

Main Results

Seven studies, covering 1624 participants, met the inclusion criteria. All included studies investigated adults and compared dexmedetomidine with traditional sedatives, including propofol, midazolam and lorazepam. Compared with traditional sedatives, dexmedetomidine reduced the geometric mean duration of mechanical ventilation by 22% (95% CI 10% to 33%; four studies, 1120 participants, low quality evidence), and consequently the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) by 14% (95% CI 1% to 24%; five studies, 1223 participants, very low quality evidence). There was no evidence that dexmedetomidine decreased the risk of delirium (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.14; seven studies, 1624 participants, very low quality evidence) as results were consistent with both no effect and appreciable benefit. Only one study assessed the risk of coma, but lacked methodological reliability (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.86, very low quality evidence). Of all the adverse events included, the most commonly reported one was bradycardia, and we observed a doubled (111%) increase in the incidence of bradycardia (RR 2.11; 95% CI 1.39 to 3.20; six studies, 1587 participants, very low quality evidence). Our meta-analysis provided no evidence that dexmedetomidine had any impact on mortality (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.24; six studies, 1584 participants, very low quality evidence). We observed high levels of heterogeneity in risk of delirium (I² = 70%), but due to the limited number of studies we were unable to determine the source of heterogeneity through subgroup analyses or meta-regression. We judged six of the seven studies to be at high risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

In this review, we found no eligible studies for children or for clonidine. Compared with traditional sedatives, long-term sedation using dexmedetomidine in critically ill adults reduced the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay. There was no evidence for a beneficial effect on risk of delirium and the heterogeneity was high. The evidence for risk of coma was inadequate. The most common adverse event was bradycardia. No evidence indicated that dexmedetomidine changed mortality. The general quality of evidence ranged from very low to low, due to high risks of bias, serious inconsistency and imprecision, and strongly suspected publication bias. Future studies could pay more attention to children and to using clonidine

### Psychological therapies for the treatment of anxiety disorders in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113GpFYP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (commonly referred to as chronic bronchitis and emphysema) is a chronic lung condition characterised by the inflammation of airways and irreversible destruction of pulmonary tissue leading to progressively worsening dyspnoea. It is a leading international cause of disability and death in adults. Evidence suggests that there is an increased prevalence of anxiety disorders in people with COPD. The severity of anxiety has been shown to correlate with the severity of COPD, however anxiety can occur with all stages of COPD severity. Coexisting anxiety and COPD contribute to poor health outcomes in terms of exercise tolerance, quality of life and COPD exacerbations. The evidence for treatment of anxiety disorders in this population is limited, with a paucity of evidence to support the efficacy of medication-only treatments. It is therefore important to evaluate psychological therapies for the alleviation of these symptoms in people with COPD.

Objectives

To assess the effects of psychological therapies for the treatment of anxiety disorders in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Search Methods

We searched the specialised registers of two Cochrane Review Groups: Cochrane Common Mental Disorders (CCMD) and Cochrane Airways (CAG) (to 14 August 2015). The specialised registers include reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO. We carried out complementary searches on PsycINFO and CENTRAL to ensure no studies had been missed. We applied no date or language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We considered all randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised trials and cross-over trials of psychological therapies for people (aged over 40 years) with COPD and coexisting anxiety disorders (as confirmed by recognised diagnostic criteria or a validated measurement scale), where this was compared with either no intervention or education only. We included studies in which the psychological therapy was delivered in combination with another intervention (co-intervention) only if there was a comparison group that received the co-intervention alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened citations to identify studies for inclusion and extracted data into a pilot-tested standardised template. We resolved any conflicts that arose through discussion. We contacted authors of included studies to obtain missing or raw data. We performed meta-analyses using the fixed-effect model and, if we found substantial heterogeneity, we reanalysed the data using the random-effects model.

Main Results

We identified three prospective RCTs for inclusion in this review (319 participants available to assess the primary outcome of anxiety). The studies included people from the outpatient setting, with the majority of participants being male. All three studies assessed psychological therapy (cognitive behavioural therapy) plus co-intervention versus co-intervention alone. We assessed the quality of evidence contributing to all outcomes as low due to small sample sizes and substantial heterogeneity in the analyses. Two of the three studies had prespecified protocols available for comparison between prespecified methodology and outcomes reported within the final publications. We observed some evidence of improvement in anxiety over 3 to 12 months, as measured by the Beck Anxiety Inventory (range from 0 to 63 points), with psychological therapies performing better than the co-intervention comparator arm (mean difference (MD) -4.41 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.28 to -0.53; P = 0.03). There was however, substantial heterogeneity between the studies (I² = 62%), which limited the ability to draw reliable conclusions. No adverse events were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

We found only low-quality evidence for the efficacy of psychological therapies among people with COPD with anxiety. Based on the small number of included studies identified and the low quality of the evidence, it is difficult to draw any meaningful and reliable conclusions. No adverse events or harms of psychotherapy intervention were reported. A limitation of this review is that all three included studies recruited participants with both anxiety and depression, not just anxiety, which may confound the results. We downgraded the quality of evidence in the 'Summary of findings' table primarily due to the small sample size of included trials. Larger RCTs evaluating psychological interventions with a minimum 12-month follow-up period are needed to assess long-term efficacy.

Advanced measures include high-flow oxygen, especially if severely hypoxemic and goal concordant, and noninvasive ventilation, especially if hypercapnic and goal concordant. Palliative sedation if refractory dyspnea despite all measures, and palliative sedation is a potential option for highly selected patients with refractory dyspnea.

### Sedation in outpatient bronchoscopy [^116jF6UE]. Respiratory Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Bronchoscopy is a procedure that is likely to provoke anxiety as the patient is surrounded by monitoring and bronchoscopy equipment, and care is administered by strangers who perform intimate, invasive, and sometimes, painful procedures. Sedation is needed, therefore, to allay anxiety and reduce stress, improve patient comfort and co-operation, provide amnesia and facilitate the bronchoscopic procedure. In this review we try to summarize the current knowledge on currently used sedation protocols with special reference to the commonly used pharmacological agents. We believe sedation should be used routinely in fiberoptic bronchoscopy in order to achieve a safe and pleasant procedure for both the patient and the pulmonologist.

### Multicenter assessment of sedation and delirium practices in the intensive care units in Poland-is this common practice in Eastern Europe? [^114fs1Up]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Patients undergoing treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) experience many distressing and potentially painful interventions. Sedation and analgesia administered to critically ill patients to enable highly distressing therapies, such as mechanical ventilation and multiple invasive procedures, must focus on ensuring patient comfort, safety, and maximally humane care, therefore sedatives and analgesics are the most commonly administered medications in the ICU. Historical approach delivering deep sedation to paralyzed patient is no longer accepted due to certain advances of ICU care, including improvement in microprocessor-controlled mechanical ventilation synchronizing with patients' own respiratory efforts and new shorter-acting sedative and analgesic medications. Concomitant to technical and pharmacological advancement the concept and recognition of the ICU Triad (pain, agitation delirium) emerged, placing patient's brain and psychological distress at the same level of importance as physiological derangement. The recognition of pain, excessive sedation, and delirium are now recognized as major problematic issues in the ICU that are associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the acute and long-term outcomes of critically ill patients.

Sedation can be used to maintain comfort for the patient and minimize agitation and anxiety. It can represent a whole spectrum of approaches from light sedation (when the patient is able to follow simple commands and is easily arousable) to deep sedation (when the patient is not able to respond to painful stimuli). Both deep sedation and the initiation of sedation within first 48 h of ICU admission is associated with increased in-hospital mortality, prolonged ICU and hospital stay, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and decreased two-year follow-up survival. Current international sedation guidelines concentrate on eliminating benzodiazepines in favor of strategies based on analgesia and use of propofol or dexmedetomidine to improve clinical outcome in critically ill patients, namely decreased ICU and hospital treatment time, decreased likelihood of developing delirium and post-ICU cognitive impairment. Minimizing sedation, engaging strategies targeting light sedation and using validated sedation assessment tools is the goal of modern ICU treatment.

### Negative pressure pulmonary edema resulting from upper airway obstruction during the post-anesthesia recovery period: a case series and literature review [^113RdTdt]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of several therapeutic interventions, including: (1) Airway obstruction relief: This is the critical first step, which may require reintubation or other methods to maintain airway patency. (2) Oxygen therapy: High-flow oxygen or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation are commonly used to manage hypoxemia. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary in severe cases. (3) Diuretics: Furosemide can alleviate pulmonary fluid accumulation, but must be used cautiously to avoid precipitating hypovolemic shock. (4) Sedatives: When necessary, sedatives may be used to manage anxiety and control breathing, thus reducing the risk of further pulmonary injury. (5) Supportive therapy: This includes prone position, fluid management, hemodynamic monitoring, and, if required, vasoactive agents to maintain hemodynamic stability.

Based on the findings of this study, the prevention of NPPE during anesthesia recovery primarily relies on effective airway management to prevent upper airway obstruction. Key strategies include ensuring complete reversal of neuromuscular blockade before extubation, maintaining `an adequate depth of anesthesia during airway manipulation, and avoiding premature extubation to reduce the risk of laryngospasm and glossoptosis. Vigilant monitoring of high-risk patients, particularly those undergoing surgeries associated with airway edema, is essential. Early signs of airway obstruction, such as stridor and paradoxical breathing, should prompt immediate intervention. The use of airway adjuncts, like oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airways, can help maintain airway patency in vulnerable individuals. Additionally, applying continuous positive airway pressure or non-invasive ventilation in cases of partial obstruction can prevent the generation of excessive negative intrathoracic pressures. Timely recognition and prompt relief of airway obstruction, along with supplemental oxygen administration, are critical in mitigating the risk of NPPE. Educating perioperative teams on NPPE risk factors and management protocols further enhances prevention efforts.

A 39-yr-old white female whose severe anxiety prohibited weaning from prolonged mechanical ventilation.

Interventions

Initiation of quetiapine as treatment for severe anxiety that was unresponsive to sedative hypnotics.

Measurements and Main Results

Once a therapeutic dose of quetiapine was reached, ventilator support was removed within 24 hrs.

Conclusions

A second-generation antipsychotic agent was successfully used to facilitate weaning in a very anxious patient, possibly secondary to anxiolysis or direct effect on respiratory drive. Further investigations of pharmacologic intervention should be done to inform practice guidelines in difficult-to-wean patients suffering from severe anxiety.

### Causes, consequences, and treatments of sleep and circadian disruption in the ICU: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^1176q5AZ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Sleep promotion intervention components in the intensive care unit outline actionable strategies and special considerations across care processes. Recommended environmental and zeitgeber actions include "Providers should mitigate light from screens in the room (e.g., televisions, mobile computers)", together with feeding and sedation guidance: "Time-restricted feeding should be structured to deliver food during the day and provide a fast during the night" and "Providers should minimize daytime sedation to optimize daytime mobility and wakefulness". For pain and anxiety management, the table advises "Follow PADIS guideline to optimize nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic analgesic strategies" (PADIS, pain, agitation and sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption) and to "Balance pain and anxiety with the need to minimize analgesics and anxiolytics known to disrupt sleep (e.g., narcotics and benzodiazepines)". Personalization includes, "If patient not able to convey sleep preferences, consider asking surrogate". Environmental controls emphasize, "Investigate sources of noise, which can be diverse and highly unique to each unit or room; talking and equipment alarms are common sources of noise, but many other sound sources exist" and "Discourage nighttime visitors outside of special circumstances (e.g., end of life)". Care delivery timing encourages clustering, with "Involve stakeholders for all changed work flows", noting "Restaffing may be needed to increase tasks during nonesleep times", that a "Dedicated sleep period may not be feasible on the basis of patient acuity, but care can be reduced to urgent tasks", and to "Reassure patients that while they are being allowed to rest, remote monitoring (e.g., telemetry) is ongoing". For ventilation, the statement cautions that "It is unclear if the mode of mechanical ventilation vs. the achievement of physiologic principles (e.g., synchrony, respiratory muscle rest, avoidance of hyperventilation, relief of dyspnea) is most important in preventing ventilator-related sleep disruption". Medication practices include "Multidisciplinary review of medications daily with critical care pharmacist; reduce dose or discontinue when possible", and medication timing guidance to "Leverage electronic medical record defaults to preferentially schedule medication administration in the daytime" and "Strategize continuous infusion bag volumes, concentrations, and start times such that bag and tubing changes do not occur during protected sleep periods".

### Analgesia and sedation in patients with ARDS [^117NpM61]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is one of the most demanding conditions in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Management of analgesia and sedation in ARDS is particularly challenging. An expert panel was convened to produce a "state-of-the-art" article to support clinicians in the optimal management of analgesia/sedation in mechanically ventilated adults with ARDS, including those with COVID-19. Current ICU analgesia/sedation guidelines promote analgesia first and minimization of sedation, wakefulness, delirium prevention and early rehabilitation to facilitate ventilator and ICU liberation. However, these strategies cannot always be applied to patients with ARDS who sometimes require deep sedation and/or paralysis. Patients with severe ARDS may be under-represented in analgesia/sedation studies and currently recommended strategies may not be feasible. With lightened sedation, distress-related symptoms (e.g., pain and discomfort, anxiety, dyspnea) and patient-ventilator asynchrony should be systematically assessed and managed through interprofessional collaboration, prioritizing analgesia and anxiolysis. Adaptation of ventilator settings (e.g., use of a pressure-set mode, spontaneous breathing, sensitive inspiratory trigger) should be systematically considered before additional medications are administered. Managing the mechanical ventilator is of paramount importance to avoid the unnecessary use of deep sedation and/or paralysis. Therefore, applying an "ABCDEF-R" bundle (R = Respiratory-drive-control) may be beneficial in ARDS patients. Further studies are needed, especially regarding the use and long-term effects of fast-offset drugs (e.g., remifentanil, volatile anesthetics) and the electrophysiological assessment of analgesia/sedation (e.g., electroencephalogram devices, heart-rate variability, and video pupillometry). This review is particularly relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic given drug shortages and limited ICU-bed capacity.

### Liberation and animation for ventilated ICU patients: the ABCDE bundle for the back-end of critical care [^113oUHFy]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Critically ill patients are frequently prescribed sedatives and analgesics to ensure patient safety, to relieve pain and anxiety, to reduce stress and oxygen consumption, and to prevent patient ventilator dysynchrony. Recent studies have revealed that these medications themselves contribute to worsening clinical outcomes. An evidence-based organizational approach referred to as the ABCDE bundle (Awakening and Breathing Coordination of daily sedation and ventilator removal trials; Choice of sedative or analgesic exposure; Delirium monitoring and management; and Early mobility and Exercise) is presented in this commentary.

### The future of intensive care: delirium should no longer be an issue [^11424QdK]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Overcoming sedation challenges

Good sedation practice in the future should be complemented by a rethink of design and connectivity of the future ICU to facilitate optimal sedation, anxiolysis and comfort using non-pharmacological means supplemented by balanced pharmacological interventions when necessary. This will represent an evolution from the current landscape, where sedation practices are determined by clinicians' experience, training and individual preferences, institution and ICU case mix, level of teaching, research and education, and health economics in individual countries. The COVID pandemic highlighted these observations and presented new realities, specific to ICU sedation and delirium management. The pandemic has been characterized by deeper sedation, prolonged neuromuscular blockade and immobility, and restricted access to physical rehabilitation and family support, in isolated artificial environment with caregivers in full protective equipment aggravating anxiety, distress and delirium. This has highlighted the fact that there is significant practice variation. Sedative choices are considered as ancillary interventions with little impact on patients centered outcomes, thus critical thinking for the choice of sedative agents and/or sedation depth is currently lacking.

### Hypnotic suggestions of safety improve well-being in non-invasively ventilated patients in the intensive care unit [^1127RXMA]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are facing a threatening environment while their health is at risk. In addition, the non-invasive ventilation procedure causes stress and anxiety which reduce cooperation. We developed an intervention containing hypnotic suggestions to improve patients' well-being during non-invasive ventilation in the ICU. The aim of this study was to test the feasibility, safety, and acceptance of this intervention. Our main hypothesis was that subjective ratings will be improved after the intervention.

We used a pre–post-design with subjective ratings of patients before and after the intervention. During the intervention, patients received non-invasive ventilation and their physiological responses were measured by standard vital sign recordings. The protocol of this study was published previously. Our study was approved by the ethics committee of the Jena University Hospital in Germany (#2019–1463; July 15, 2019).

We included patients who were afraid of non-invasive ventilation due to previous experience. Exclusion criteria were a Glasgow Coma Scale value below 14, delirium, lack of orientation, being deaf or not fluent in German language. All patients signed an informed consent statement.

Two female psychology master students trained by B. S. performed the intervention. Before and after the non-invasive ventilation session, patients rated their subjective valence, arousal and anxiety as well as their subjective breathing mask comfort. To start non-invasive ventilation, a member of the clinical staff put the breathing mask on the patients' face. The trained psychologist sat down next to the patient and explained the following procedure. The intervention was applied via a standardized verbatim text available as supplementary material. The approximate duration of each experimental event is reported in the supplementary material. In total, the intervention lasted about 15 min Fig. 1 a.

### Can dexmedetomidine be a safe and efficacious sedative agent in post-cardiac surgery patients? a meta-analysis [^113VvAUb]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sedation, used to reduce stress response and provide anxiolysis, is an important component of postoperative management following cardiac surgery. The ideal sedative for use after cardiac surgery would have an immediate onset of action, be effective at providing immediate resolution of the agitation and anxiety, allow rapid recovery after discontinuation, lack drug accumulation, have minimal adverse effects, and be cost-effective. However, no single agent or combination of agents has shown a clear superiority to meet these clinical standards.

Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective and potent central α₂-receptor agonist which binds to transmembrane G protein-binding adrenoreceptors, and has no activity on the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system. By decreasing central nervous system sympathetic outflow, dexmedetomidine has analgesic effects known as opioid-sparing. This property is unique among sedatives used in the intensive care unit (ICU) because it produces sedation and analgesia without causing respiratory depression. In addition, the use of α₂-agonists has been associated with lower cardiovascular complications in high-risk non-cardiac surgery.

Approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2008, dexmedetomidine represents only 4% of the drugs used for adult sedation outside of the operating room. Currently, in Europe and the United States, benzodiazepines and propofol are the commonly used sedative agents in the ICU. A recent systematic review stressed the use of dexmedetomidine as an alternative for postoperative sedation in critically ill adult patients. The authors demonstrated that dexmedetomidine reduces the length of ICU stay compared with traditional sedative agents such as propofol, midazolam and morphine. From the clinician's viewpoint, dexmedetomidine has a favorable profile, as it can facilitate weaning from a mechanical ventilator by not depressing spontaneous ventilation. However, hypotension and bradycardia, the most common adverse effects of dexmedetomidine, have limited its use in the ICU. Concerns that these side effects could influence hemodynamic stability and increase hospital mortality have led to controversy regarding the benefits and risks of dexmedetomidine in postoperative sedation. Thus, the primary goal of the current study was to explore the use of dexmedetomidine as a safe and efficacious sedative agent following cardiac surgery.

### Guidelines for monitoring and management of pediatric patients before, during, and after sedation for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures: update 2016 [^1134VaBp]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Minimal sedation — minimal sedation (anxiolysis) is a drug-induced state during which patients respond normally to verbal commands; although cognitive function and coordination may be impaired, ventilatory and cardiovascular functions are unaffected. Children who have received minimal sedation generally will not require more than observation and intermittent assessment of their level of sedation, and some children will become moderately sedated despite the intended level; should this occur, the guidelines for moderate sedation apply.

### Propranolol as an anxiolytic to reduce the use of sedatives from critically-ill adults receiving mechanical ventilation (PROACTIVE) [^111tV28G]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

Propranolol is a plentiful and inexpensive, non-selective beta-adrenergic blocker with good penetration of the blood-brain barrier, which can reduce agitation and arousal. The study team published a single-centre retrospective study of 64 mechanically-ventilated patients which found the initiation of propranolol was associated with an 86% reduction in propofol dose and a roughly 50% reduction in midazolam dose while maintaining the same level of sedation. Propranolol has the potential to mitigate the threat posed by worldwide sedative shortages and improve critical care management of patients who require mechanical ventilation. An extensive search of PubMed and Web of Science did not reveal published trials of propranolol as a sedative agent in critical illness or mechanical ventilation. However, propranolol was shown to significantly reduce agitation in a randomized controlled trial in patients with traumatic brain injury.

Observational studies in traumatic brain injury have shown that propranolol use is associated with a shorter length of hospital and ICU stay, and possibly a lower mortality risk, without reports of significant side effects. If propranolol reduces sedative doses required by mechanically ventilated patients to the degree seen in this team's retrospective study, this would effectively reduce usage of sedatives two- to seven-fold. The cost of the average daily dose of propranolol used in the retrospective study would be $0. 27, and propranolol is in abundant supply in Canada and around the world. Does the addition of propranolol to a standard sedation regimen reduce the dose of sedative needed in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation.

Study Design: Open-label, Randomized Controlled Trial, 1: 1 allocation Patient Population: Participants are adult patients admitted to an intensive care unit who are anticipated to require mechanical ventilation > 48h, who are requiring intravenous sedatives to achieve a sedation goal that is anticipated to be stable for > 48h. Intervention: Patients randomized to the intervention arm will receive propranolol enterally at a starting dose of 20mg every 6 hours for two to four doses, and then re-assessed for upwards titration every 24 hours at 10mg dose increases depending on clinical response. The maximum dose to be used in the intervention group is 60mg every 6 hours.

### Low dose of morphine to relieve dyspnea in acute respiratory failure: the opiDys double-blind randomized controlled trial [^111cdUZf]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The strength of our study is to be the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate the potential benefit of opioids on dyspnea in patients admitted to the ICU with ARF. We used a double-blind design to limit bias, in particular classification bias, with a primary outcome that could suffer from subjective assessment. This study has several major limitations. First, due to the small sample size, the study is clearly underpowered. We designed it as a pilot phase 2 study and therefore our results should be considered as exploratory. We calculated the sample size based on the benefit of morphine in non-critically ill patients. We acknowledge that the small sample size may limit the capacity to account for variables such as underlying diseases, concomitant therapies, or patient anxiety levels. However, the aim of randomization is to balance characteristics between groups. In addition, the exclusion rate was high due to very stringent non-inclusion criteria, with the purpose of enrolling patients corresponding as much as possible to our target population, which we found crucial for a pilot phase 2 trial. Second, although we showed an increased incidence of intubation in the Morphine group, it is important to keep in mind that there were no predefined criteria for intubation. Third, the switch from intravenous titration to subcutaneous administration seemed to be associated with a relapse of dyspnea. Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia might be a promising alternative to subcutaneous administration.

### Sedation, delirium and psychological distress: let's not be deluded [^116A8hZs]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

New ways of approaching sedation and analgesia are being considered in our endeavour to improve our management of the ventilated patient. Long-term psychological problems are not insignificant and before we can assume benefit or harm of any new approach we must not delude ourselves by using sampling methods that can miss those patients most at risk.

### Sedation after cardiac surgery: is one drug better than another? [^1161dteo]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2017). Low credibility.

The classic high-dose narcotic-based cardiac anesthetic has been modified to facilitate a fast-track, rapid recovery in the intensive care unit (ICU). Postoperative sedation is consequently now an essential component in recovery of the patient undergoing cardiac surgery. It must facilitate the patient's unawareness of the environment as well as reduce the discomfort and anxiety caused by surgery, intubation, mechanical ventilation, suction, and physiotherapy. Benzodiazepines seem well suited for this role, but propofol, opioids, and dexmedetomidine are among other agents commonly used for sedation in the ICU. However, what is an ideal sedative for this application? When compared with benzodiazepine-based sedation regimens, nonbenzodiazepines have been associated with shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay. Current sedation guidelines recommend avoiding benzodiazepine use in the ICU. However, there are no recommendations on which alternatives should be used. In postcardiac surgery patients, inotropes and vasoactive medications are often required because of the poor cardiac function. This makes sedation after cardiac surgery unique in comparison with the requirements for most other ICU patient populations. We reviewed the current literature to try to determine if 1 sedative regimen might be better than others; in particular, we compare outcomes of propofol and dexmedetomidine in postoperative sedation in the cardiac surgical ICU.

Research agenda for PADIS and patient-important outcomes — priorities include anxiety studies with further development and testing of instruments to detect and quantify anxiety in critically ill adults; RCTs testing the safety and effectiveness of benzodiazepines and other medications for anxiety in critically ill adults; and RCTs examining nonpharmacologic and/or multimodal approaches. Sedation priorities include the role of dexmedetomidine in alcohol withdrawal; the role of sedative medications in an analgesia-first approach or to supplement analgesia-sedation; studies evaluating the value of patient communication with family members during ICU care and patient perceptions while on propofol vs. dexmedetomidine; the role of dexmedetomidine in patients requiring deep sedation; and RCTs addressing possible heterogeneity of dexmedetomidine treatment effect by age (over or under 65 yr old). Delirium priorities include RCTs examining the use of an antipsychotic in hypoactive delirium, hyperactive delirium, and other subtypes; RCTs examining long-term cognitive effects of antipsychotics in ICU patients with delirium; and RCTs examining the use of antipsychotics in progressive delirium severities.

### Management of dyspnea in advanced cancer: ASCO guideline [^115JjXLk]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — pharmacologic management of dyspnea in advanced cancer specifies that systemic opioids should be offered to patients with dyspnea when nonpharmacologic interventions are insufficient to provide dyspnea relief (type: evidence-based; evidence quality: low; strength of recommendation: moderate). Short-acting benzodiazepines may be offered to patients who experience dyspnea-related anxiety and continue to experience dyspnea despite opioids and other nonpharmacologic measures (type: evidence-based; evidence quality: low; strength of recommendation: weak). Systemic corticosteroids may be offered to select patients with airway obstruction or when inflammation is likely a key contributor of dyspnea (type: evidence-based; evidence quality: low; strength of recommendation: weak). Bronchodilators should be used for palliation of dyspnea when patients have established obstructive pulmonary disorders or evidence of bronchospasm (type: evidence-based; evidence quality: low; strength of recommendation: weak). Evidence remains insufficient for a recommendation for or against the use of antidepressants, neuroleptics, or inhaled furosemide for dyspnea. Continuous palliative sedation should be offered to patients with dyspnea that is refractory to all standard treatment options and all applicable palliative options, and who have an expected life expectancy of days (type: informal consensus; evidence quality: low; strength of recommendation: moderate).

### Anxiety and depression in COPD: current understanding, unanswered questions, and research needs [^111f731u]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 60 million people in the United States live with one of four chronic conditions: heart disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and major depression. Anxiety and depression are very common comorbidities in COPD and have significant impact on patients, their families, society, and the course of the disease.

Methods

We report the proceedings of a multidisciplinary workshop on anxiety and depression in COPD that aimed to shed light on the current understanding of these comorbidities, and outline unanswered questions and areas of future research needs.

Results

Estimates of prevalence of anxiety and depression in COPD vary widely but are generally higher than those reported in some other advanced chronic diseases. Untreated and undetected anxiety and depressive symptoms may increase physical disability, morbidity, and health-care utilization. Several patient, physician, and system barriers contribute to the underdiagnosis of these disorders in patients with COPD. While few published studies demonstrate that these disorders associated with COPD respond well to appropriate pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapy, only a small proportion of COPD patients with these disorders receive effective treatment.

Conclusion

Future research is needed to address the impact, early detection, and management of anxiety and depression in COPD.

### Anticipation of distress after discontinuation of mechanical ventilation in the ICU at the end of life [^1124Zmsg]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Palliative sedation

Palliative sedation is defined as deliberately inducing and maintaining deep sleep for the relief of intractable physical and mental symptoms in the last hours or days of life. In the ICU, palliative sedation is administered continuously until death. ICU patients, particularly those requiring mechanical ventilation, usually are already sedated such that they can tolerate ventilation and ICU-associated noxious stimuli. One of the goals of sedation before and after withdrawal of ventilation is anxiolysis. In ICU patients who are dying following withdrawal of ventilation, death occurs rapidly, even if they are not sedated. Therapeutic sedation thus becomes palliative sedation. Decreased consciousness is a means of achieving symptom relief in patients who are suspected to be dying or whose relatives are witnessing distressing symptoms. Seizures, tremors, confusion, anxiety, agitation, and hallucinations can also occur after benzodiazepine withdrawal. This is one of the reasons sedation should never be stopped at the end of life. There is also some evidence suggesting that sedatives, especially lorazepam, are independently associated with the development of delirium. For this reason, we avoid the use of lorazepam as a sedative for symptom control. In some situations, midazolam can be effective when given as adjunct therapy to morphine in order to alleviate dyspnea. There is no evidence that the use of benzodiazepines to treat discomfort after withdrawal of mechanical ventilation hastens death in palliative or ICU patients. Respiratory rates do not decrease to fatal levels when patients are given palliative sedation.

We recommend midazolam or propofol (Fig. 1). Midazolam has a rapid onset of action and is easily titrated. In patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation, sedation is problematic because tolerance can be an especially difficult problem in the palliative phase. Propofol also has an antiemetic effect, but can be associated with severe myalgia and also cannot be given subcutaneously, which could be a problem in some cases.

### Effect of an analgo-sedation protocol for neurointensive patients: a two-phase interventional non-randomized pilot study [^117An8bP]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Most mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) need sedation and analgesia to maintain comfort, relieve anxiety, facilitate care, and adapt to ventilatory support. Although a variety of indications for sedation exist, recent years have seen a general trend toward lighter sedation for the mechanically ventilated patient. Daily sedation interruption has been used as a way of reducing escalation of medication doses and a new study has demonstrated the feasibility of a protocol of no sedation. Another trend has been the reversal from sedation-analgesia to analgo-sedation, with the primary goal of addressing pain and discomfort, and then if necessary, adding sedation. Variations in the management of sedation, analgesia, and neuromuscular blockade have been demonstrated internationally. Protocols have been introduced to increase consistency, and studies have shown that sedation protocols may decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation, the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and improve the probability of successful extubation in general ICUs.

Guidelines for the sustained use of sedatives and analgesics have been developed for patients in the general ICU, but little attention has been directed toward sedation of patients in the neurointensive care unit (NICU). Although neurointensive patients share many goals with general ICU patients, some indications are unique to the NICU population, such as maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), while controlling intracranial pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Sedation in NICU is complicated due to many specific, and sometimes conflicting, indications. Conditions such as delirium, anxiety and pain may all result in agitation, but need to be treated individually. One particular challenge is the inability to adequately assess the sedation level, and to distinguish between the indications for sedation and for pain relief, due to the reduced level of consciousness. We suspected that over-sedation and inadequate pain management might be evident at our study site. The aim of the present study was to describe sedation practice at a neurointensive care unit and to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a sedation protocol based on the principles of analgo-sedation.

### Unrecognized suffering in the ICU: addressing dyspnea in mechanically ventilated patients [^113vez2F]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Intensive care unit (ICU) patients are exposed to many sources of discomfort. Although increasing attention is being given to the detection and treatment of pain, very little is given to the detection and treatment of dyspnea (defined as "breathing discomfort").

Methods

Published information on the prevalence, mechanisms, and potential negative impacts of dyspnea in mechanically ventilated patients are reviewed. The most appropriate tools to detect and quantify dyspnea in ICU patients are also assessed.

Results/Conclusions

Growing evidence suggests that dyspnea is a frequent issue in mechanically ventilated ICU patients, is highly associated with anxiety and pain, and is improved in many patients by altering the ventilator settings.

Conclusions

Future studies are needed to better delineate the impact of dyspnea in the ICU and to define diagnostic, monitoring and therapeutic protocols.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^114DpZT7]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Respiratory — patient safety considerations during airway management: Suctioning to limit aspiration is a priority, and clinicians should avoid excessive pressures or tidal volumes during BVM ventilation with the goal to avoid barotrauma as well as overventilation and related reduction of venous return/preload/cardiac output. Routine use of sedation is not recommended for treatment of anxiety in patients on NIV. Endotracheal intubation should only be used if less invasive methods do not meet patient care goals, and once a successful SGA placement or intubation has been performed, obstruction or displacement can have negative effects and tubes should be secured with either a commercial tube holder or tape. Meticulous attention should be paid to avoiding hypoxia and hypotension during intubation attempts, and waveform capnography should be placed prior to the first breath through an invasive airway to confirm placement. Drug Assisted Airway Management (DAAM) should be reserved for specialized clinicians within a comprehensive program with adequate resources, ongoing training and quality assurance measures, and close EMS physician oversight. Once CPAP/BiPAP is initiated and tolerated, DO NOT discontinue it until the patient is on the emergency department stretcher with hospital CPAP/BiPAP immediately available or a physician requests discontinuation, and breaking the mask seal can cause a significant decrease in airway pressures and abrupt decompensation due to atelectasis and alveolar collapse. If the patient deteriorates on CPAP/BiPAP, remove CPAP/BiPAP and escalate airway management options as above, and if an endotracheal tube becomes dislodged, SGA should be strongly considered.

ICU anxiety, agitation/sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption — focused guideline update provides conditional directives for adult ICU care as follows: In adult patients admitted to the ICU, the task force issued conditional recommendations to use dexmedetomidine over propofol for sedation, provide enhanced mobilization/rehabilitation over usual mobilization/rehabilitation, and administer melatonin. The task force was unable to issue recommendations on the administration of benzodiazepines to treat anxiety, and the use of antipsychotics to treat delirium. These recommendations are intended for consideration along with the patient's clinical status.

Results

A total of 15 participants were recruited. During the analysis, it was identified that theoretical sufficiency was met and therefore no further participants were sought. All participants had severe or very severe COPD and presented in respiratory failure meeting the criteria for NIV. About two-thirds of the participants were women, living with their family and used long-term oxygen therapy (Table 1).

Table 1
Patient characteristics (N = 15)

Through the analysis four themes emerged which highlighted key perceptions and experiences with NIV. These four themes were inclusive of levels of discomfort with NIV, cognitive experiences with NIV, NIV as a life saver and concern for others. These four themes will now be further described and presented within this section.
Levels of discomfort with NIV

Within this theme participants identified four specific areas of discomfort when having NIV as an intervention. This included their experiences with the mask, blood gases sampling, adjustment to airflow and synchronisation with NIV.

Mask

Participants reported that they disliked their experience with the mask. They noted that it was often too tight and made them claustrophic with feelings of suffocation and loss of control, which made it difficult for them to relax. This led participants to report a negative NIV experience.

P9: it was hideous! I have felt a little bit like the man in the iron mask, because your head feels encased.

P14: That was terrible, I tore it off! I felt I had been suffocated…

Blood gas sampling

Participants associated blood gas sampling as part of NIV. They recalled this as painful and something they dreaded. It was often the most difficult procedure for them to navigate in the NIV process.

P8: Had lots of blood gas tests, it depends who take them. Some people are alright, and other people make hurt like hell!

Airflow

Participants commented that the sensation of air being blown at them made it difficult for them to breathe. This induced a sensation of fear and feeling of wanting to push the mask away. Other participants described a better experience when the NIV was started at lower pressures and was gradually titrated upwards.

P13: When I was in the wards this time, it wasn't as bad because they don't turn save the oxygen up so high, once they get it on you, they increase it then.

### Sedation practices and clinical outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients in a prospective multicenter cohort [^112bHBBz]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Sedation and analgesia are essential components in the care of mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) to provide comfort, improve patient-ventilator synchrony, and reduce anxiety and agitation. However, deep sedation has been associated with negative patient-centered outcomes including delirium, a common complication in the ICU, with a prevalence as high as 82%. This preventable complication is an independent predictor of mortality and is also associated with long-term cognitive impairment and disability. Optimizing sedation practices and delirium screening with the use of protocols is associated with improved patient-centered outcomes such as a lower incidence of delirium, fewer days on mechanical ventilation, and an overall reduction in mortality. Additionally, standardized management of sedation reduces the use of sedatives without negatively affecting patient safety or increasing psychological stress.

Despite these recognized benefits, sedation practices remain variable, with a tendency towards over-sedation and a lack of routine delirium assessment. Less is known about sedation practices and delirium management for the critically ill in resource-limited settings, where mortality is higher in the USA or Europe. We hypothesize that the higher mortality and longer length of stay in ICUs in resource-limited settings could be partly explained by suboptimal sedation and delirium management. In this study, we explore the association between sedation status, use of sedation and antipsychotics medications, and patient centered-outcomes in a cohort of critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients in five ICUs in Lima, Peru.

We obtained data of 31 patients (mean age 63.9 years [SD 11], 14 female and 17 male). Patients rated their subjective valence as significantly more positive, d = 0.69 (95% CI 0.3–1.09), their subjective arousal as significantly lower, d = 0.67 (95% CI 0.28–1.07) and their anxiety as significantly lower, d = 0.85 (95% CI 0.44–1.28) after the intervention compared to before the intervention. Patients rated the breathing mask as significantly more comfortable after the intervention compared to before the intervention, d = 1.08 (95% CI 0.62–1.57) Fig. 1 b. Physiological responses show that breathing rate and heart rate decreased during the intervention, shown by significant main effects of the event for breathing rate, F (8,224) = 7.4, p < 0.001, η²_G = 0.21 (95% CI 0.1–0.28) and heart rate, F (8,224) = 5.7, p < 0.001, η²_G = 0.17 (95% CI 0.07–0.24). Detailed results are available as supplementary material.

This study shows the feasibility, safety, and acceptance of hypnotic suggestions to increase well-being during non-invasive ventilation in the ICU. Future randomized-controlled studies should test the efficacy of the intervention against suitable control groups including a group receiving non-invasive ventilation without hypnotic suggestions. We conclude that hypnotic suggestions can improve well-being during challenging medical procedures like non-invasive ventilation that are also applied in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

### Future of paediatric sedation: towards a unified goal of improving practice [^113PxzwT]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

This review offers a perspective on the future of paediatric sedation. This future will require continued evaluation of adverse events, their risk factors, and predictors. As the introduction of new sedatives with paediatric applications will remain limited, the potential role of mainstay sedatives administered by new routes, for new indications, and with new delivery techniques, should be considered. The role of non-pharmacological strategies for anxiolysis, along with the application of non-mainstay physiologic monitoring, may aid in the improvement of targeted sedation delivery. Understanding the mechanism and location of action of the different sedatives will remain an important focus. Important developments in paediatric sedation will require that large scale studies with global data contribution be conducted in order to support changes in sedation practice, improve the patient experience, and make sedation safer.

### Dexmedetomidine for the management of awake fibreoptic intubation [^113sGK15]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Awake fibreoptic intubation (AFOI) frequently requires sedation, anxiolysis and relief of discomfort without impairing ventilation and depressing cardiovascular function. The goal is to allow the patient to be responsive and co-operative. Medications such as fentanyl, remifentanil, midazolam and propofol have been reported to assist AFOI; however, these agents are associated with cardiovascular or respiratory adverse effects. Dexmedetomidine has been proposed as an alternative to facilitate AFOI.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review is to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine in the management of patients with a difficult or unstable airway undergoing awake fibreoptic intubation (AFOI).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2012, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2012) through Ovid, EMBASE (1980 to May 2012) and Web of Science (1945 to May 2012); we screened the reference lists of all eligible trials and reviews to look for further trials and contacted authors of trials to ask for additional information. We searched for ongoing trials at http://www.controlledtrials.com/ and http://clinicaltrials.gov/. We reran our search of all databases listed above on 21 November 2013.

Selection Criteria

We included published and unpublished randomized controlled trials, regardless of blinding or language of publication, in participants 18 years of age or older who were scheduled for an elective AFOI because of an anticipated difficult airway. Participants received dexmedetomidine or control medications.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently extracted data on study design, participants, interventions and outcomes. We assessed risk of bias using The Cochrane Collaboration's tool. We estimated risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence internals (CIs) for outcomes with sufficient data; for other outcomes, we performed a qualitative analysis.

Main Results

We identified four randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which included 211 participants. The four trials compared dexmedetomidine with midazolam, fentanyl, propofol or a sodium chloride placebo, respectively. The trials showed low or unclear risk of bias primarily because information provided on allocation concealment and other potential sources of bias was inadequate. Owing to clinical heterogeneity and potential methodological heterogeneity, it was impossible to conduct a full meta-analysis. We described findings from individual studies or presented them in tabular form. Limited evidence was available for assessment of the outcomes of interest for this review. Results of the limited included trials showed that dexmedetomidine significantly reduced participants' discomfort with no significant differences in airway obstruction, low oxygen levels or treatment-emergent cardiovascular adverse events noted during AFOI compared with control groups. When the search was rerun (from May 2012 to November 2013), it was noted that four studies are awaiting assessment. We will deal with these studies when we update the review.

Authors' Conclusions

Small, limited trials provide weak evidence to support dexmedetomidine as an option for patients with an anticipated difficult airway who undergo AFOI. The findings of this review should be further corroborated by additional controlled investigations.

### Living conditions and autonomy levels in COPD patients receiving non-invasive ventilation: impact on health related quality of life [^116Sz84T]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The results of this study highlight the heterogeneous healthcare landscape of NIV-treated COPD patients, with particular emphasis on HRQL. The three main results are as follows: Firstly, there is lack of patient care following NIV establishment — at least in some patients — since 24% do not have regular outpatient follow-up by a respiratory specialist, while 63% had never undergone pulmonary rehabilitation. Secondly, impairments in autonomy were evident in many patients, with 46% of all patients having significant, serious or most serious impairments, as defined by standard German assessment criteria. Thirdly, and most importantly, when HRQL was specifically measured by the SRI, it was found to be dramatically reduced in patients with higher levels of autonomy impairment, especially in those patients living in a nursing home.

These findings raise some important clinical considerations. The recent task force of the European Respiratory Society on "Long-term home NIV for the management of COPD" suggests the use of long-term NIV in chronic hypercapnic COPD-patients. This is primarily based on scientifically established improvements in subjective measures, which most importantly include HRQL. Several studies that applied the highly specific SRI reported improvements in the SRI Summary Scale after NIV initiation, ranging from no improvements to up to 11 points. However, the current study shows that lower mean SRI scores were associated with higher levels of autonomy impairments. Here, NIV patients with serious and most serious levels of autonomy impairment had lower SRI scores than patients in all previous trials who had hypercapnic COPD prior to NIV commencement.

Interestingly, a lack of outpatient pulmonary follow-up and rehabilitation did not have an impact on specific aspects of HRQL in COPD patients with long-term NIV. In addition, the patient's family situation did not influence HRQL. Thus, the level of autonomy impairment forms the major determinant of HRQL in these patients. Importantly, both physical and psychological aspects of HRQL were affected by autonomy impairments, particularly in terms of physical functioning and anxiety.

The pertinence of autonomy levels to HRQL has potentially important consequences, whereby we put forward two major suggestions: Firstly, in COPD patients with chronic hypercapnic failure who are subjected to long-term NIV treatment, all efforts should be made to improve the degree of autonomy. However, whether this actually leads to improvements in HRQL should be addressed in future trials. This also holds true for the question of whether pulmonary rehabilitation is capable of ameliorating these impairments and hence HRQL.

Non-invasive options: sedation and analgesia (Supplement 11; see 10.1007/s00134-013-2906-z)

While sedation and analgesia have been incorporated into previous IAH/ACS management algorithms, it remains unclear if they alter outcomes among those with IAH/ACS.

Statement

We SUGGEST that clinicians ensure that critically ill or injured patients receive optimal pain and anxiety relief (Unchanged Management Suggestion 1 [GRADE 2D]).

### Effects of dexmedetomidine and propofol on patient-ventilator interaction in difficult-to-wean, mechanically ventilated patients: a prospective, open-label, randomised, multicentre study [^115PKPyu]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Patients receiving assisted mechanical ventilation (MV) commonly require sedation to optimize tolerance to the endotracheal tube and to better adapt to the ventilator, thus decreasing stress response, anxiety and discomfort. Use of sedation to optimize the patient-ventilator interaction can help avoid prolongation of MV and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay as well as an increased need for tracheostomy.

For several decades, γ-aminobutyric acid receptor agonists (including propofol and benzodiazepines) have been the most commonly used sedatives for critically ill patients, including those receiving assisted MV. During assisted MV, patient-ventilator interaction is influenced both by machine settings and by the patient's respiratory pattern, timing and drive. These are directly affected by sedatives, whose effects vary, depending both on the drug used and on the dose administered. Very recently, research has shown that sedation with propofol was associated with a reduction in respiratory drive causing significant derangements in patient-ventilator synchrony in ICU patients receiving assisted ventilatory support. As part of that research, the electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) signal, determined using a nasogastric feeding tube with a multiple array of electrodes placed at its distal end, was successfully used to assess respiratory drive, neural respiratory rate and neural timing. That technique enabled an easy computation of the asynchrony index (AI), a metric previously reported to be an independent predictor of longer MV and ICU stay.

Because dexmedetomidine is an α₂-adrenoceptor agonist that provides sedation and anxiolysis via receptors in the locus coeruleus, as well as analgesia via receptors at the spinal cord level, it is able to attenuate the stress response without significant respiratory depression. This pharmacological profile may be of particular interest in patients receiving assisted MV because it may possibly reduce the rate of patient-ventilator asynchronies directly generated by the influence of sedatives on the output of the respiratory centres, which can affect the respiratory drive and/or timing.

In two double-blind, prospective, randomised clinical trials, researchers recently compared dexmedetomidine with propofol and midazolam in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients. Both studies showed that dexmedetomidine is an effective sedative agent compared with propofol and midazolam, and that its use is associated with easier communication with patients, better assessment of pain, reduced delirium and decreased time to extubation compared with propofol.

We hypothesized that dexmedetomidine may reduce the incidence of patient-ventilator dyssynchronies compared with propofol. To examine this hypothesis, we conducted a multicentre, prospective, open-label, randomised clinical trial, comparing dexmedetomidine against standard sedation with propofol infusion.
