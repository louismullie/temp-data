## Question

Dizziness and bilateral hand paresthesia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating dizziness with bilateral hand paresthesia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage and red flags that mandate urgent action. Then, I should verify the key elements of history that separate dangerous causes from benign ones. Next, I will examine the focused neurologic exam and bedside tests that distinguish central from peripheral etiologies. After that, I need to construct a prioritized differential diagnosis and map it to an evidence-based diagnostic workup. Finally, I will outline initial management, when to involve specialists, and follow-up, while double-checking where the evidence is strong versus uncertain.

> Let me first confirm the triage priorities, because I need to ensure we do not miss time-sensitive threats like stroke, spinal cord compression, or rapidly progressive neuropathies. Sudden-onset dizziness with bilateral hand paresthesia raises concern for posterior circulation ischemia, vertebral artery dissection, or cervical cord compromise, and any focal neurologic deficit, ataxia, dysarthria, diplopia, or severe headache should trigger emergent neuroimaging and stroke protocols without delay [^112d3ESn] [^111CMnfb] [^115tNcsW].

> Wait, let me verify the history elements that most efficiently narrow the differential. I should confirm onset and tempo, whether symptoms are episodic versus continuous, and any positional or exertional triggers. I need to check for antecedent infections, trauma, medication changes, and vascular risk factors. I should also ask about autonomic symptoms, gait changes, and bladder or bowel involvement, because these can pivot the workup toward small fiber neuropathy, degenerative cervical myelopathy, or posterior circulation disease [^1122wdmM] [^113VSiEE] [^115tNcsW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double-check the focused neurologic examination to separate central from peripheral causes. I will assess mental status, cranial nerves including eye movements and nystagmus, coordination with finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin, gait including tandem walking, and sensory testing for stocking-glove versus segmental patterns. I should confirm reflexes, plantar responses, and look for hyperreflexia or clonus suggesting myelopathy, and I will perform a targeted HINTS exam when vertigo is present to help distinguish peripheral from central vestibular etiologies [^112d3ESn] [^116y9XcM] [^112Ucw6S].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis, but I need to ensure I prioritize by danger and treatability. Posterior circulation ischemia or vertebral artery dissection can present with dizziness and bilateral sensory symptoms and warrants urgent MRI brain and MR angiography of the neck. Degenerative cervical myelopathy can cause hand paresthesias, gait imbalance, and sometimes dizziness from cord compression and merits urgent cervical MRI. Small fiber neuropathy or autonomic dysfunction can produce paresthesias and orthostatic dizziness. Multiple sclerosis can cause multifocal sensory and vestibular symptoms. Functional neurological disorder remains a consideration when objective findings are absent, but I should not anchor on it prematurely [^115tNcsW] [^111vkoEz] [^1137HW4G] [^112f9rXd] [^115XeWRf].

> Let me think about the diagnostic workup and make sure I align it with evidence-based pathways. If there are any central signs or vascular risk factors, I should obtain brain MRI with DWI and vascular imaging of the head and neck. If myelopathy is suspected, I need cervical MRI with and without contrast. If a peripheral neuropathy is suspected, I should check glucose, B12, and consider SPEP with immunofixation, and reserve electrodiagnostic studies for cases where results will change management. If small fiber neuropathy is suspected, I should consider autonomic testing and pursue targeted etiologies such as diabetes, autoimmune disease, or medication effects [^112d3ESn] [^111vkoEz] [^1122wdmM] [^1137HW4G].

> But wait, what if the dizziness is isolated and the paresthesias are mild and symmetric. I should confirm whether clinical algorithms support deferring imaging in low-risk presentations. The GRACE-3 guidance allows selective imaging based on timing, triggers, and bedside oculomotor and gait findings, and the Sudbury Vertigo Risk Score can stratify risk of serious disease. Still, bilateral hand paresthesias push me toward a central or systemic process, so I should maintain a low threshold for MRI when symptoms are new or progressive [^112d3ESn] [^116y9XcM] [^115yAVaW].

> Next, I should review initial management while the workup proceeds. If posterior circulation ischemia or dissection is suspected, I should initiate stroke protocols, antithrombotic therapy per local policy, and arrange vascular consultation. If degenerative cervical myelopathy is diagnosed or strongly suspected, I should expedite neurosurgical or spine consultation because delays worsen outcomes. If small fiber neuropathy is likely, I should address reversible causes and consider symptomatic treatment for neuropathic pain and autonomic symptoms. If functional neurological disorder is suspected after appropriate exclusion of organic disease, I should provide education and refer for specialized rehabilitation [^115tNcsW] [^111vkoEz] [^1137HW4G] [^115XeWRf].

> I should double-check medication contributors and toxic exposures, because they are frequently overlooked. Chemotherapy agents like bortezomib and supportive drugs can cause sensory neuropathy and orthostatic symptoms, and SSRIs or SNRIs can produce paresthesias and dizziness, particularly during withdrawal. I need to reconcile the medication list carefully and ask about supplements, illicit substances, and occupational or environmental exposures that could explain a symmetric sensory neuropathy or autonomic dysfunction [^112fkRih] [^1125REE4] [^1137HW4G].

> Let me reconsider the role of electrodiagnostics, because I should not over-order tests with low yield. In symmetrical distal polyneuropathy, nerve conduction studies and EMG rarely change management when the history and exam are concordant, so I should reserve them for atypical features, asymmetric findings, or suspected radiculopathy or plexopathy. Conversely, if I suspect a central process or myelopathy, MRI is the correct test and electrodiagnostics will not substitute for imaging [^1122wdmM] [^111vkoEz].

> I need to ensure follow-up and safety netting are explicit. For patients discharged pending results, I should provide return precautions for new weakness, speech changes, vision loss, severe headache, incontinence, or rapidly worsening symptoms. I should arrange timely neurology follow-up and communicate the working differential and test strategy to the next provider. For patients with chronic or recurrent symptoms, I should consider vestibular rehabilitation when a peripheral vestibular deficit is identified and coordinate multidisciplinary care for complex cases [^112d3ESn] [^111nPYvE].

> In summary, dizziness with bilateral hand paresthesia is a red flag constellation that demands a structured approach: triage for stroke and cord compression, a focused history and exam to localize central versus peripheral causes, and a tiered diagnostic workup anchored to MRI when central signs or vascular risk are present. I should prioritize treatable causes like posterior circulation ischemia, vertebral dissection, and degenerative cervical myelopathy, while keeping small fiber neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, and functional disorders in view as the evidence evolves [^112d3ESn] [^111vkoEz] [^115tNcsW] [^1137HW4G] [^112f9rXd] [^115XeWRf].

Dizziness with bilateral hand paresthesia is a **red flag** combination that warrants urgent evaluation for posterior circulation ischemia, cervical cord compression, or metabolic-toxic causes. Immediate **MRI of the brain and cervical spine** is indicated to exclude stroke, vertebral artery dissection, or degenerative cervical myelopathy [^111vkoEz]. If MRI is normal, pursue **electrodiagnostics and laboratory testing** for peripheral neuropathy, electrolyte disturbances, or toxic exposures [^1122wdmM]. Delay in imaging or specialist referral risks permanent deficits; **do not wait** for progression.

## Clinical evaluation

### History

Obtain a detailed history, including onset and progression (**sudden vs gradual**), symptom character (vertigo, lightheadedness, imbalance), associated symptoms (headache, nausea, dysarthria, weakness, visual changes), risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, smoking, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation), recent infections, trauma, or surgeries, and medication use, including chemotherapy, anticoagulants, and over-the-counter drugs.

---

### Physical examination

Perform a focused neurologic exam assessing cranial nerves, motor strength, coordination, gait, and sensory modalities (touch, vibration, proprioception). Include a **vestibular exam** (Dix-Hallpike, head impulse test, nystagmus) and a **cardiovascular exam** (orthostatics, arrhythmias, murmurs).

---

## Diagnostic approach

### Initial investigations

Order **CBC, electrolytes, renal and liver function, glucose, TSH, B12, and inflammatory markers (ESR/CRP)**. Obtain an **ECG** to screen for arrhythmia or ischemia.

---

### Imaging

Obtain **urgent MRI of the brain and cervical spine** with contrast to evaluate for posterior circulation stroke, vertebral artery dissection, cervical cord compression, or demyelination [^112d3ESn] [^111vkoEz]. If MRI is contraindicated, use **CT angiography** of the head and neck to assess vasculature.

---

### Electrodiagnostic studies

Use **nerve conduction studies and electromyography** to evaluate for peripheral neuropathy or radiculopathy when MRI is unrevealing [^1122wdmM].

---

## Management strategies

### Acute management

- **Stroke protocol**: Immediate stroke team activation if stroke is suspected; thrombolysis or thrombectomy may be indicated [^notfound].
- **Immobilization**: Cervical collar and spine precautions if cord compression is suspected.
- **Supportive care**: IV fluids, electrolyte correction, and symptomatic treatment for dizziness and paresthesia.

---

### Definitive management

- **Stroke**: Antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation if indicated, and secondary prevention measures [^notfound].
- **Cord compression**: Surgical decompression or radiation therapy depending on etiology [^113VSiEE].
- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Treat underlying cause, pain management, and physical therapy [^notfound].
- **Functional disorders**: Psychological evaluation and rehabilitation [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the **underlying cause**, severity, and timeliness of intervention. Early recognition and treatment of vascular or compressive etiologies improve outcomes, whereas delays can result in permanent neurological deficits [^notfound].

---

Dizziness with bilateral hand paresthesia is a **high-risk presentation** requiring urgent evaluation. Immediate **MRI of the brain and cervical spine** is critical to exclude stroke, dissection, or cord compression, with further workup tailored to findings.

Case report

A 35-year-old Caucasian female presented with headaches and focal neurological symptoms, on a background of migraines with visual aura. Past medical history included depression and a motor vehicle accident aged 17. She had a normal body mass index, no history of recent overseas travel or hypertension.

While at work, 1 month prior to review, she developed fogginess in her head followed by a severe headache and blotchy white spots in her vision. Her symptoms resolved spontaneously during the course of the day. The following day she became unwell again, with subjective cognitive difficulties, low-frequency tinnitus bilaterally and further episodes of paraesthesia, which spread up the right arm into the face and sometimes involved her right leg. She continued to experience severe frontotemporal headaches. She also reported cognitive difficulties and had a CT brain, which was normal.

### Clinical reasoning: a young woman with rapidly progressive weakness and paresthesia [^115rqLrG]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

A 24-year-old Middle Eastern woman presented with a 2-month history of rapidly progressive asymmetric weakness and paresthesia that began in her left lower extremity and progressed to involve both legs and arms. It was associated with overflow urinary incontinence and significant weight loss. In addition, she complained of a constant occipital headache that worsened in the supine position and was associated with photophobia, tinnitus, nausea, vomiting, and horizontal binocular diplopia. She also had signs of meningismus, decreased left facial sensation, and right sensorineural hearing loss. Because multifocal localization suggests a wide variety of possible differential diagnoses, this study expands on the differential of a subacute multifocal process while highlighting the importance of identifying appropriate risk factors and performing a relevant yet focused diagnostic workup.

### Mills' syndrome revisited [^111kKXPA]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Patient 2

In this right-handed female, left leg pain and weakness first became apparent at the age of 63. Her symptoms progressed; after 6 years she could no longer work and she began experiencing pain and weakness in the left arm. After a further 2 years she noted an unsteady gait and difficulty walking, as well as some urinary urgency. There was very little subjective progression in the subsequent 4 years.

Three years after onset, she developed vertigo and was diagnosed with left vestibular failure, and 1 year later she suffered a sixth nerve palsy, which subsequently resolved. Pregabalin effectively controlled pain in her left arm and leg. There was no relevant family history.

Physical examination (4 and 8 years after presentation)

The gait was unsteady and broad-based. There was subtle weakness of the left upper limb (MRC grade 4 +) and the left hand was clumsy, with more obvious pyramidal weakness in the left lower limb (MRC grade 4). Tendon reflexes were symmetrically brisk throughout, with bilateral flexor plantar responses. There was hyperalgesia and allodynia in the left upper and lower limbs. No amyotrophy or fasciculation was evident.

### Phenylephrine hci [^1176NHAV]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Inform patients, families, or caregivers that the primary side effect of phenylephrine is hypertension and rarely, hypertensive crisis. Patients may experience bradycardia (slow heart rate), which in some cases may produce heart block or other cardiac arrhythmias, extra ventricular beats, myocardial ischemia in patients with underlying cardiac disease, and pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs) or rales. Common, less serious symptoms include the following:

chest pain

skin or tissue damage if the drug leaks out of the venous catheter into the surrounding tissue

headache, nervousness, tremor, numbness/tingling (paresthesias) in hands or feet

nausea, vomiting

excitability, dizziness, sweating, flushing

### Spontaneous subclavian artery dissection causing ischemia of the Medulla oblongata and cerebellum [^115ppcog]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Spontaneous subclavian artery dissection is a rare etiology. Spontaneous artery dissection causing brain ischemia is rare in all ischemic strokes. However, in young to middle-aged patients with brain ischemia, spontaneous carotid or vertebral artery dissection causing ischemic stroke accounts for 10–25%.

Case Report

A 58-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented to the Emergency Department with a sudden onset of left-arm paresthesia and numbness followed by symptoms of vertigo and vomiting. A neurological examination showed left-arm paresthesia, horizontal-rotational nystagmus, and left-side dysmetria according to a finger-to-nose test. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed left subclavian artery dissection. Diffusion-weighted imaging demonstrated hyperintensity in the left medulla oblongata and inferior part of the cerebellum. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Spontaneous artery dissection is an important etiology of ischemic stroke among young patients. Cervical magnetic resonance angiography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of arterial dissection. Cervical disc disease is a common etiology in a patient with neck and shoulder pain without cause or neurologic symptoms, when cervical MRI is negative, however, spontaneous subclavian artery dissection should be considered in the differential diagnosis when a patient, especially in a case of younger patient, presents with acute new-onset neck and shoulder pain followed by the onset of neurological symptoms.

### A young woman with blurred vision and distal paresthesias [^117H5feZ]. JAMA Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

A 29-year-old woman presented with blurred vision and distal paresthesias. Her initial evaluation revealed severe bilateral optic disc edema with distal lower-extremity sensory and motor deficits and electrodiagnostic evidence of a length-dependent mixed demyelinating and axonal polyneuropathy. The results of routine diagnostic testing, including laboratory tests, magnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture, were nondiagnostic. A targeted biopsy was ultimately required for diagnosis. In this article, we discuss the differential diagnosis and outline the clinical evaluation indicated for a patient presenting with demyelinating polyneuropathy and concurrent papilledema.

### Transient ischaemic attacks: mimics and chameleons [^115M8TW2]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical features of TIA

The key rule here is that symptoms of TIA should mimic known stroke syndromes, and so depend on the arterial territory involved. Distinguishing the territory is important to guide further investigation and secondary prevention. Some common patterns of presentation (eg, hemiparesis) are not very helpful in distinguishing the arterial territory, as they can occur with both anterior and posterior circulation TIAs. Others can be more localising: for example, aphasia or transient monocular visual loss suggest carotid territory ischaemia, while bilateral limb weakness, vertigo, hearing loss, haemianopia or diplopia are features of vertebrobasilar (brainstem) ischaemia. TIAs due to perforating artery disease should mimic a known lacunar syndrome (most often hemisensory or hemimotor symptoms affecting the face, arm and leg); moreover, such 'lacunar' TIAs may be recurrent and stereotyped over a short period (days) as in the "capsular warning syndrome". Increased awareness of symptoms means that patients can now present with very restricted transient syndromes, including isolated vertigo, dysarthria or hemisensory disturbance: in such cases, clinicians should consider other causes before diagnosing TIA.

Abrupt onset of maximal symptoms predicts a final diagnosis of TIA, but there is no evidence for a statistical difference between duration of symptoms in patients with TIA and mimics. These findings may of course be rather circular, since sudden symptoms are part of the usual criteria for diagnosis of TIA, and part of what makes a mimic is its similar time course to TIA. Nevertheless, other key aspects of the history that are useful to help identify TIA from mimics are as follows:
Age and other demographic data: is there a high a priori probability of a cerebrovascular event?
Nature of the symptoms: 'positive' versus 'negative'?
Onset and progression
Duration
Precipitating factors
Associated symptoms, for example, headache, loss of awareness, during or after the attacks

Age and other demographic data

TIAs are rare in young people without vascular risk factors (eg, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, smoking, haematological disease, etc). In otherwise healthy pregnant women, transient neurological symptoms are a common reason for neurological referral, but are often related to migraine. Seizures and syncope occur at all ages, although the underlying causes may differ. Syncope is more common in women, but seizures have no sex predilection. TIAs are more common in men at younger ages, but the sex difference reduces after the menopause.

### Clinical reasoning: a 62-year-old woman with transient vision loss [^112hVoBu]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Transient visual loss (TVL) is a common complaint in the emergency department, with numerous possible etiologies. Prompt evaluation and management of TVL can potentially prevent progression to permanent visual loss. In this case, a 62-year-old woman presented with acute, painless, unilateral TVL. Two weeks before presentation, the patient reported bitemporal headaches and paresthesia of the distal extremities. A review of systems revealed chronic fatigue, cough, diffuse arthralgias, and decreased appetite for the previous 6 months. This case highlights the diagnostic approach to patients with TVL. Some common and rare causes associated with this clinical manifestation are briefly reviewed.

### Pure sensory stroke due to brainstem lesion [^114ERfbi]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 40-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with acute onset right-sided upper and lower extremity numbness/tingling over the past day. Prior to the paraesthesia onset, the patient experienced transient mild ataxia and left ocular pain with complete resolution at the time of presentation. Neurological exam revealed isolated right-sided sensory changes from his hand-to-elbow as well as foot-to-knee. No other focal neurological deficits were noted. MRI brain revealed a small left posterior infarct at the junction between the pons and midbrain. Dual-antiplatelet therapy was initiated and the patient experienced minimal paraesthesia improvement proximally over his 5-day hospital course. This case report highlights an acute brainstem stroke presenting with predominant hemisensory symptoms. Presentations of brainstem lesions can range from subtle, non-specific features to profound deficits. This case serves to emphasise the importance of performing a thorough clinical exam while maintaining a high index of suspicion for brainstem lesions.

A 24-year-old male Marine presented to a direct-access physical therapy clinic with a chief complaint of bilateral hand paresthesia secondary to a parachuting accident when his neck was forced into lateral flexion. Due to the positive neurologic findings and history of trauma, the physical therapist ordered cervical spine imaging. The odontoid was not adequately visualized on radiographs, but computed tomography revealed an os odontoideum. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2016;46(10):930. doi:10.2519/jospt.2016.0417.

### Acoustic neuroma with orofacial paresthesia: description of an atypical presentation [^1164DxBo]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Acoustic neuroma (AN) usually manifests with asymmetric hearing loss, tinnitus, dizziness and sense of disequilibrium. About 10% of patients complain of atypical symptoms, which include facial numbness or pain and sudden onset of hearing loss. Patients with atypical symptoms also tend to have larger tumours due to the delay in investigation. We report a particularly interesting case of a patient presented to us with numbness over her right hemifacial region after a dental procedure without significant acoustic and vestibular symptoms. Physical examination and pure tone audiometry revealed no significant findings but further imaging revealed a cerebellopontine angle mass. The changing trends with easier access to further imaging indicate that the presentation of patients with AN are also changing. Atypical symptoms which are persistent should raise clinical suspicion of this pathology among clinicians.

### When the penny drops [^1125ATaC]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Comment

The pattern of neurological features does not immediately suggest any single lesion and, with no objective examination findings, might easily be construed as functional or psychosomatic. The initial clinical suspicion was of a psychiatric presentation, given her personal history; however, her mood had recently being more stable and there was no obvious psychosocial precipitant for this acute presentation.

The possibilities of reflex (vasovagal) syncope or hyperventilation syndrome were suggested to account for the loss of consciousness with facial paraesthesia. Vasovagal syncope seemed unlikely with no presyncopal symptoms or triggers, such as prolonged standing, dehydration or stress. Hyperventilation syndrome was also unlikely, as forced hyperventilation did not reproduce the symptoms.

On presentation, the patient herself thought she was having a stroke. Despite the acute onset and nature of her symptoms, her age, examination findings and lack of risk factors made this unlikely. Stroke mimics can occur in young people and form part of the differential diagnoses. These include space-occupying lesions, migraine, focal seizures, multiple sclerosis and periodic paralysis.

Question 2

What would you do next?

Comment

Routine blood tests showed only mild thrombocytopenia. There was no postural hypotension. She continued taking antidepressants and underwent cognitive behavioural therapy, which helped in stabilising her mood.

After she developed widespread arthralgia and dystonic tremor of the left hand, as well as persistent fatigue, slurred speech and episodes of loss of consciousness, her medical team requested a specialist neurological opinion.

The neurologist noted the above findings in addition to horizontal diplopia, worse in primary position, and arranged repeat bloods with 12-lead ECG, EEG and MR scan of brain (table 1).

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — differential diagnosis for suspected asthma varies with age, and the table specifies that "If the symptoms or signs below are present, consider… Condition". For 6–11 years, consider chronic upper airway cough syndrome for "Sneezing, itching, blocked nose, throat-clearing", inhaled foreign body for "Sudden onset of symptoms, unilateral wheeze", bronchiectasis for "Recurrent infections, productive cough", and cystic fibrosis for "Excessive cough and mucus production, gastrointestinal symptoms". For 12–39 years, consider chronic upper airway cough syndrome for "Sneezing, itching, blocked nose, throat-clearing", inducible laryngeal obstruction for "Dyspnea, inspiratory wheezing (stridor)", hyperventilation, dysfunctional breathing for "Dizziness, paresthesia, sighing", and bronchiectasis for "Productive cough, recurrent infections".

### The tauopathy associated with mutation + 3 in intron 10 of tau: characterization of the MSTD family [^116CjzQL]. Brain (2008). Low credibility.

Dizziness and neck stiffness were the predominant early symptoms in subject numbers 11 and 14. Unsteadiness and light-headedness were initially experienced in association with rapid turning of the head; they became more frequent and severe later on and ended up being continuous. To reduce discomfort, both patients required proper adjustment when sitting and could not use a car because of severe motion sickness. They experienced neck muscle spasms, as well as numbness and tingling sensations in hands, arms and shoulders; grip strength and coordination were also reduced. On physical examination, they had increased muscle tone, particularly in the neck, as well as hyperactive deep tendon reflexes. They experienced weakness of hand muscles and, to a lesser extent, upper and lower extremities, in the absence of atrophy and visible fasciculations. The Hoffmann sign was present bilaterally, but no Babinski sign was noted. Electromyography revealed signs of denervation at multiple levels of the cervical spinal cord and scattered fasciculations of hand muscles. Mild intentional tremor and impaired alternating movements were noted during the finger-to-nose test. Both patients exhibited limitation of neck extension, reduced superior gaze, pursed lips and swallowing difficulties. Sensory findings were normal. Subject number 11 died of aspiration pneumonia almost 1 year after disease onset without displaying cognitive alterations. Subject number 14 became unable to walk and developed resting and intentional tremor, mild global cognitive decline, reduced verbal fluency and naming. She died suddenly 6 years after disease onset.

Data from a neurological evaluation were available for 9 of the 14 patients. Parkinsonism was the most commonly reported finding, followed by frontal lobe signs, incontinence, dysphagia, dizziness and signs of upper and/or lower motor neuron dysfunction. Eye movement abnormalities, sleep disturbance and paresthesias were noted less commonly.

### Imaging of dizziness [^116NJ9CR]. Clinical Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Dizziness is a frequent indication for neuroimaging within the outpatient and emergency setting with variable diagnostic yield. The majority of persistent, recurrent, and isolated dizziness can be managed clinically. However, it may be difficult to distinguish a benign peripheral aetiology from a central cause, particularly in the emergency setting. We review the relevant anatomy, differential diagnosis, and key imaging features of central and peripheral causes of dizziness, as well as the literature for the diagnostic yield in acute and outpatient settings.

3.2.1. Symptom history

Sensory plus signs, including paresthesias and neuropathic pain, were most frequently the first manifestation of SFNs in this collective (57%), whereas sensory minus signs such as numbness and thermhypoesthesia occurred in 23% and autonomic symptoms in 10%. Further unspecific complaints such as fatigue or generalized weakness were attributed to the SFN onset in another 65%. In 11% of the cases, patients reported not one but several first symptoms at the same time. A potentially triggering event in timely correlation with symptom onset was reported in 60% of the patients. This included psychological stress (25%), infections (15%), medications (8%), and others (17%). At the time of the clinical visit, 95% of the patients reported neuropathic pain, 88% paresthesia, and 77% numbness. With 96% of the examined cohort, the feet placed first in the ranking of affected localizations, whereas 78% of the patients reported an (additional) hand and 72% a lower leg involvement (Fig. 1 A). The whole arms and legs but not the trunk and face were affected in 29%. The face was affected in 33% and the trunk in 38% (Fig. 1 B). Autonomic symptoms were present in 85% overall, the most frequent of which were reported dizziness, (impending) blackouts (57%), diarrhea (43%), and hyperhidrosis (47%). In 9 of these patients, a postural tachycardia syndrome had previously been diagnosed. A significant weight loss had not been noted in any of the cases. Ninety-two percent of the patients reported a relevant daily life impairment. The most common cause of such was neuropathic pain (72%).

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^113j1NYe]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Cluster headache – triptan adverse effects and patient preferences — Reported adverse events (AEs) included local reaction paresthesia (the most common), sweating, feeling of heaviness, somnolence, nausea and vomiting, injection-site reaction (e.g., pain, swelling, burning, erythema, tingling), neurologic symptoms (e.g., dizziness, tiredness, numbness of hands, tingling, feeling of paralysis in the face, cold and hot sensations), bad taste, discomfort of nasal cavity, and pain or tightness in the throat, chest, or neck; AEs were more common with a triptan versus placebo but were generally mild or moderate in severity. Patient preferences vary little regarding the acute treatment of cluster headache, and despite intranasal and subcutaneous administration methods typically being less preferred than oral medications, patients with cluster headaches have less variability in acceptance of these alternative administration methods because the preference for rapid pain freedom is much stronger.

### The useless hand of oppenheim [^114Z7X8x]. Practical Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Hermann Oppenheim described the 'Useless Hand' in 1911 as a classical but uncommon presentation of multiple sclerosis, in which a hand loses useful function due to proprioceptive loss, with relatively preserved motor function. Light touch perception may be subjectively altered or can be relatively intact. The lesion is (usually) a demyelinating plaque in the posterior columns of the cervical spinal cord. Depending on its location, it may affect one limb, or if more central, may produce a bilateral (if asymmetrical) picture. This article reviews a clinical case, historical background, pathophysiology as well as examination tips to aid its recognition.

### Persistent post-COVID-19 neuromuscular symptoms [^1128546S]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). Medium credibility.

Neuromuscular symptoms may develop or persist after resolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Besides residual sensorimotor symptoms associated with acute neuromuscular complications of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, critical illness neuromyopathy, and rhabdomyolysis, patients may report persistent autonomic symptoms, sensory symptoms, and muscle symptoms in the absence of these acute complications, including palpitations, orthostatic dizziness and intolerance, paresthesia, myalgia, and fatigue. These symptoms may be associated with long COVID, also known as post-COVID-19 conditions or postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may significantly impact quality of life. Managing these symptoms represents a challenge for health-care providers. Recent advances have identified small-fiber neuropathy as a potential etiology that may underlie autonomic dysfunction and paresthesia in some long COVID patients. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying myalgia and fatigue remain elusive and need to be investigated. Herein we review the current state of knowledge regarding the evaluation and management of patients with persistent post-COVID-19 neuromuscular symptoms.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy [^111KCknQ]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Why is it missed?

Non-specific and subtle early features that overlap with other neurological conditions can delay the diagnosis. Incomplete neurological assessment by professionalswith a poor awareness of the diseasefurther contributes to delay. A retrospective study of medical records of 42 patients in Israel who underwent surgery for DCM noted an average delay of 2.2 years (range 1.7 months to 8.9 years) from initiation of symptoms to diagnosis. On average, 5.2 ± 3.6 consultations were required before a diagnosis was made. Forty three per cent of these patients had symptoms of numbness and pain in hands, and were initially diagnosed and sometimes treated for carpal tunnel syndrome. In our clinical experience, the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome, especially when diagnosed bilaterally, is often incorrect and DCM usually accounts for these symptoms.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome presenting as facial diplegia after COVID-19 vaccination: a case report [^116Q2iS1]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is a rapidly progressive immune-mediated polyneuropathy often associated with an antecedent infectious illness or vaccination. The classic presentation of GBS is characterized by ascending limb weakness and numbness with loss of reflexes. However, atypical variants involving the face and arms or with purely sensory symptoms also exist. In up to 30% of cases, GBS progresses to respiratory failure, with patients requiring mechanical ventilation.

Case Report

We report a case of atypical GBS occurring after Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination in an otherwise healthy 38-year-old man. The patient's clinical presentation was characterized by bilateral hand and foot paresthesias, dysarthria, bilateral facial weakness, and an absence of classic ascending limb weakness. Albuminocytological dissociation within the cerebrospinal fluid was suggestive of GBS. The patient received intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, with modest improvement in his symptoms at the time of his discharge from the hospital. Why Should an Emergency PhysicianBe Aware of This? Patients with GBS are at risk for life-threatening complications, including respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. It is critical for emergency physicians to be aware of the manifold presentations of GBS for early recognition and treatment. This may be of particular importance in the context of a worldwide vaccination campaign in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Safety

The proportion of patients with at least 1 AE related to study drug was higher in the MR309 group (25.8% in the MR309 group vs 11.9% in the placebo group; p = 0.051) (Table 2). Nausea, diarrhea, mucositis, decreased appetite, dysgeusia, and oral paresthesia were slightly more frequent in the MR309 group. Among treatment-related AEs, only some concerning the nervous system [dizziness, headache and neurotoxicity (2 patients each)] were more common in the MR309 group (Table 2).

### GPRC5D bispecific antibody talquetamab-induced dizziness-ataxia syndrome, clinical presentation and management-a case series [^112BGtaQ]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

Talquetamab is the first FDA approved drug targeting G-protein-coupled receptor class 5 member D (GPRC5D) receptor with a high efficacy and durability of responses in heavily pretreated multiple myeloma (MM). Common side effects include Cytokine Release syndrome (CRS), Immune Effector Cell Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS), oral, skin and gastrointestinal toxicities are well documented. A lesser-known side effect of GPRC5D is a cerebellar toxicity which is independent of ICANS. This was first described with MCARH109 GPRC5D CART where 2 patients (3%) developed a Grade 3 cerebellar disorder. As an extension of this syndrome dizziness can be the first presenting symptom of this neurological disorder. In a subsequent report of Arlo-cel (GPRC5D CART) notable symptoms include dizziness 9%, ataxia 7%, dysarthria 4%, cerebellar toxicity, paresthesia, gait disturbance, and nystagmus were present in 1%. In the prescribing information of talquetamab with European Medical Agency based on MONUMENTAL-1 trial dizziness was present in 12% of patients and 8% had grade 3 dizziness. Herein, we report a case series documenting the clinical course of this dizziness-ataxia syndrome following talquetamab use.

Case

A 17-year-old woman was first seen in the tertiary Headache Centre at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UK, in August 2011 with complaints of a persistent headache from 14 January 2011 onwards. There were no known precipitants at the onset of the headache. The headache developed gradually during the day. She described a severe continuous bilateral headache localised over the forehead, temple and vertex with pressing and sharp qualities. The headache was associated with photophobia and motion sensitivity, but no other migrainous symptoms. There were no associated cranial autonomic features. She had one episode of 5 days with numbness, tingling and pain in her hands and feet, but had no other symptoms suggestive of aura. The headache had no relation to posture, and there were no features suggestive of cerebrospinal fluid pressure dysregulation, temporomandibular dysfunction or cervicogenic headache. Prior to onset of the daily headache, she described long-standing mild and featureless headaches that lasted 2–3 hours and occurred 5–10 times per year. Neurological examination was unremarkable and there was no evidence of papilloedema.

### Multiple sclerosis prevalence in the United States commercially insured population [^112f9rXd]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on multiple sclerosis:

- **Definition**: MS is a chronic immune-mediated disease, characterized by demyelinating lesions in the brain and spinal cord.
- **Pathophysiology**: Demyelinating lesions are thought to result from migration of autoreactive lymphocytes across the blood-brain barrier, which triggers a cascade of inflammation with T- and B-cell clonal expansion and activation of microglia, leading to the development of characteristic plaque Genetic factors (HLA-DRB1 haplotype) and environmental factors (viruses, low vitamin D, distance from the equator) have been implicated.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of MS varies markedly geographically. In the US, MS has an estimated prevalence of 149.2 persons per 100,000 population. Incidence has been estimated at 17.3 cases per 100,000 person-years in Western Europe.
- **Disease course**: The clinical manifestations of MS are wide ranging. Common presenting features include weakness, paresthesia or focal sensory loss, optic neuritis, diplopia, ataxia and vertigo. Autonomic dysfunction is common, and may manifest as bladder, bowel and sexual symptoms. Other manifestations can include painful muscle spasms, trigeminal neuralgia, fatigue and depression, subtle cognitive difficulties, psychiatric disturbances and seizures.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: MS typically follows a relapsing and remitting course, but it can be progressive from disease onset, or can become progressive after initial remissions. The interval between relapses is variable. The latent phase between the first manifestation of MS and the first relapse can be many years.

### Risk of acute brain lesions in dizzy patients presenting to the emergency room: who needs imaging and who does not? [^112Ucw6S]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

But how shall we manage dizzy patients in the ED who do not reveal any central oculomotor sign or focal abnormality? Conducting brain imaging in those with at least one vascular risk factor would lead to an excessive use of imaging studies in many dizzy patients with an actually benign peripheral-vestibular or non-vestibular cause. On the other hand, applying risk factors as 'conditio sine qua non' may prevent necessary imaging studies in juvenile stroke patients with a dissection or thromboembolic occlusion of the vertebral artery.

We rather suggest a clinical stratification of patients into specific 'dizziness syndromes', based on symptoms (timing, triggers) and signs from a targeted clinical examination. We could show that these previously proposed (and slightly modified) algorithms can be successfully applied to clinical routine in the ED when dizzy patients are assessed by non-experts in neuro-otology. Using their clinical assessment allowed to distinguish dizzy patients with a zero, moderate or high pre-test probability for ABLs on brain imaging. Based on that, we developed a clinical pathway (Fig. 2) that can be used practically by clinicians working in EDs to decide whether an individual dizzy patient should receive brain imaging or not.

### Sensory symptoms in ipsilateral limbs / body due to lateral medullary infarction [^114ypSpY]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To characterize the incidence, topography, and radiologic and pathophysiologic findings of ipsilateral sensory symptoms in the limbs/body in patients with lateral medullary infarction.

Method

Between 1994 and 2001, the author identified 12 patients with lateral medullary infarction (6.7% of all lateral medullary infarction patients) who presented with ipsilateral sensory symptoms in the limbs/body in addition to typical lateral medullary syndrome. Brain MRI, nerve conduction velocity, and electromyographic studies were performed. Twenty-four patients without ipsilateral sensory symptoms were included as a control group. Clinical and radiologic findings were compared between the two groups.

Results

The ipsilateral sensory symptoms were generally described as numbness or tightness, predominantly affecting the upper extremities, especially distal fingers. Vibration and proprioceptive sensation were occasionally impaired. None showed evidence of peripheral neuropathy or radiculopathy. The patients with ipsilateral sensory symptoms significantly more often had vertigo, nausea/vomiting, severe gait ataxia, hiccup, ipsilateral hemiparesis, and caudally located lesions than those without. The caudal lesions producing ipsilateral sensory symptoms tended to extend dorsomedially.

Conclusion

Lateral medullary infarction associated with ipsilateral sensory symptoms in the limbs/body is an uncommon but distinct variant caused by caudal lesions extending dorsomedially that probably involve the ipsilateral dorsal column or decussating lemniscal fibers.

### HaNDL with bilateral central venous occlusions [^114BNKoo]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

The aetiology of HaNDL remains unknown, although pathogenesis may relate to autoimmune, migrainous or post-viral conditions. Approximately 25% to 40% of patients experience a viral infection preceding their development of HaNDL syndrome, and possible associations with other infections should be sought, including human herpesvirus (HHV). Case reports have described separate patients who met diagnostic criteria for HaNDL, who were subsequently found to have serological evidence of recent infection with HHV-6 and HHV-7. In addition, separate paediatric patients with HHV-6 and varicella zoster virus (VZV) infections developed unilateral central retinal vein occlusion.HHV and VZV are not currently on the list of infections to be excluded for a diagnosis of HaNDL.

Patients diagnosed with HaNDL are usually around 30 years old, but cases involving children have been described. Most patients have no history of migraine, although headaches in cases of HaNDL frequently involve migrainous features. HaNDL is characterised by the presence of CSF pleocytosis associated with a typically rapid onset headache and neurological deficits, most commonly dysphasia, hemiparaesthesia and hemiparesis. The heterogenous clinical presentations of HaNDL syndrome can mimic neurological conditions such as stroke, transient ischaemic attack, migraine and encephalitis. The diagnostic criteria of HaNDL as outlined by the International Headache Society are based on typical clinical features, association between CSF pleocytosis and headache, as well as the exclusion of secondary causes.

### Bortezomib for injection (bortezomib) [^112fkRih]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

5.1 Peripheral Neuropathy

Bortezomib treatment causes a peripheral neuropathy that is predominantly sensory; however, cases of severe sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy have been reported. Patients with pre-existing symptoms (numbness, pain or a burning feeling in the feet or hands) and/or signs of peripheral neuropathy may experience worsening peripheral neuropathy (including ≥ Grade 3) during treatment with bortezomib. Patients should be monitored for symptoms of neuropathy, such as a burning sensation, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, neuropathic pain or weakness. In the Phase 3 relapsed multiple myeloma trial comparing bortezomib subcutaneous vs intravenous, the incidence of Grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy was 24% for subcutaneous and 39% for intravenous. Grade ≥ 3 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 6% of patients in the subcutaneous treatment group, compared with 15% in the intravenous treatment group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Starting bortezomib subcutaneously may be considered for patients with pre-existing or at high risk of peripheral neuropathy.

Patients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy during bortezomib therapy may require a decrease in the dose and/or a less dose-intense schedule [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. In the bortezomib vs dexamethasone Phase 3 relapsed multiple myeloma study, improvement in or resolution of peripheral neuropathy was reported in 48% of patients with ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy following dose adjustment or interruption. Improvement in or resolution of peripheral neuropathy was reported in 73% of patients who discontinued due to Grade 2 neuropathy or who had ≥ Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy in the Phase 2 multiple myeloma studies. The long-term outcome of peripheral neuropathy has not been studied in mantle cell lymphoma.

5.2 Hypotension

The incidence of hypotension (postural, orthostatic, and hypotension NOS) was 8% [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. These events are observed throughout therapy. Patients with a history of syncope, patients receiving medications known to be associated with hypotension, and patients who are dehydrated may be at increased risk of hypotension. Management of orthostatic/postural hypotension may include adjustment of antihypertensive medications, hydration, and administration of mineralocorticoids and/or sympathomimetics.

### A 74-year-old woman with leg weakness [^115QfbqV]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient's presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 74-year-old woman who presents to the emergency department with a 3-month history of bilateral leg weakness and paresthesia. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is refined until a final diagnosis is made.

Dizzy patients present a significant diagnostic challenge to the emergency clinician. The discrimination between peripheral and central causes is important and will inform subsequent diagnostic evaluation and treatment. Isolated vertigo can be the only initial symptom of a posterior circulation stroke. The sensation of imbalance especially raises this possibility. Research involving strokes of the posterior circulation has lagged behind that of the anterior cerebral circulation. Investigations of the last 20 years, using new technologies in brain imaging in combination with detailed clinical studies, have revolutionized our understanding of the clinical presentation, causes, treatments, and prognosis of posterior circulation ischemia.

### Are white matter abnormalities associated with "unexplained dizziness"? [^116vK8fs]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2015). Low credibility.

2 Methods

Patients were included if they were aged between 45 and 90 years and were referred with dizziness to tertiary referral neuro-otology centres in London and Pisa. These are national centres of expertise in the diagnosis, investigation and management of dizziness and imbalance and are typically referred a combination of general and complex dizzy patients. "Dizzy" symptoms included true rotational vertigo, light-headedness, giddiness and a sense of non-specific unsteadiness. Patients with no dizziness, psychogenic or functional dizziness, no imaging available or CT scan only (n = 3) and age > 90 were excluded (n = 17). In total, 122 patients (59 males) aged 45–90 were recruited. Patients were referred from general practitioners, neurologists and ear nose and throat specialists from December 2010–2014. All patients (81 in London and 41 in Pisa) had been seen and examined by experienced neuro-otologists. For this study, the case notes were reviewed and patients were divided into two groups based on history, clinical examination findings and laboratory results. Group 1 consisted of patients with 'explained' causes of dizziness. These included benign positional paroxysmal vertigo (BPPV — history of brief, positional, rotational vertigo with positive Dix–Hallpike manoeuvre), vestibular neuritis (history of acute prolonged rotational vertigo, associated with nausea, vomiting and imbalance with spontaneous, horizontal, unidirectional, nystagmus, with torsional component, unilaterally positive head impulse test and no other neurological abnormality. Tests show unilateral reduction of nystagmic response on calorics i.e. > 25% canal paresis and normal audiometry). Also included were vestibular migraine (history of at least five episodes of vestibular symptoms (vertigo/head motion induced dizziness) with temporally associated migrainous headaches lasting from minutes up to 72 h), Meniere's disease (combination of vertigo, cochlear symptoms and low frequency sensorineural hearing loss), bilateral vestibular loss (bilateral absence of nystagmic response; < 10 °/s slow phase velocity on calorics/rotational chair testing) orthostatic hypotension (decrease in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or diastolic 10 mm Hg from lying to immediately on standing and after 3 min) stroke, cerebellar ataxias, Parkinson's disease, hydrocephalus and temporal bone fracture. Group 2 included patients with 'unexplained' dizziness, i.e. no recognised diagnosis which could account for the dizziness. For all patients both main and secondary diagnoses are listed in Table 1.

VELCADE treatment causes a peripheral neuropathy that is predominantly sensory; however, cases of severe sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy have been reported. Patients with pre-existing symptoms (numbness, pain or a burning feeling in the feet or hands) and/or signs of peripheral neuropathy may experience worsening peripheral neuropathy (including ≥ Grade 3) during treatment with VELCADE. Patients should be monitored for symptoms of neuropathy, such as a burning sensation, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, neuropathic pain or weakness. In the Phase 3 relapsed multiple myeloma trial comparing VELCADE subcutaneous vs intravenous, the incidence of Grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy was 24% for subcutaneous and 39% for intravenous. Grade ≥ 3 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 6% of patients in the subcutaneous treatment group, compared with 15% in the intravenous treatment group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

He was then lost to follow-up but later was seen with worsening ataxia. Additional imaging studies showed subtle parenchymal lesions in the posterior fossa. The differential diagnoses included nutritional deficiencies, autoimmune disorders, systemic malignancies, and intracranial tumors. The final diagnosis was confirmed by a biopsy.

### Bortezomib [^114mj4eP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Peripheral Neuropathy

Bortezomib for Injection treatment causes a peripheral neuropathy that is predominantly sensory; however, cases of severe sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy have been reported. Patients with pre-existing symptoms (numbness, pain or a burning feeling in the feet or hands) and/or signs of peripheral neuropathy may experience worsening peripheral neuropathy (including ≥ Grade 3) during treatment with Bortezomib for Injection. Patients should be monitored for symptoms of neuropathy, such as a burning sensation, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, neuropathic pain or weakness. In the Phase 3 relapsed multiple myeloma trial comparing Bortezomib for Injection subcutaneous vs intravenous, the incidence of Grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy was 24% for subcutaneous and 39% for intravenous. Grade ≥ 3 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 6% of patients in the subcutaneous treatment group, compared with 15% in the intravenous treatment group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Starting Bortezomib for Injection subcutaneously may be considered for patients with pre-existing or at high risk of peripheral neuropathy.

Patients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy during Bortezomib for Injection therapy may require a decrease in the dose and/or a less dose-intense schedule [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. In the Bortezomib for Injection vs dexamethasone Phase 3 relapsed multiple myeloma study, improvement in or resolution of peripheral neuropathy was reported in 48% of patients with ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy following dose adjustment or interruption. Improvement in or resolution of peripheral neuropathy was reported in 73% of patients who discontinued due to Grade 2 neuropathy or who had ≥ Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy in the Phase 2 multiple myeloma studies. The long-term outcome of peripheral neuropathy has not been studied in mantle cell lymphoma.

5.2 Hypotension

The incidence of hypotension (postural, orthostatic, and hypotension NOS) was 8% [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. These events are observed throughout therapy. Patients with a history of syncope, patients receiving medications known to be associated with hypotension, and patients who are dehydrated may be at increased risk of hypotension. Management of orthostatic/postural hypotension may include adjustment of antihypertensive medications, hydration, and administration of mineralocorticoids and/or sympathomimetics.

### Incidence and prevalence of functional neurological disorder: a systematic review [^115XeWRf]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Functional neurological disorder (FND) describes symptoms and signs of genuinely experienced alterations in the voluntary motor, somatosensory and perceptual systems, which are distressing or impairing, and manifest one or more patterns or deficits typical of the disorder. FND can manifest as a number of different symptoms, including (functional/non-epileptic) seizures, limb weakness, movement disorders (eg, tics, jerks, tremors, gait), speech, swallowing and communication disorders, dizziness (also known as persistent postural perceptual dizziness), somatosensory or special sensory changes and cognitive symptoms. Data show that individuals with FND comprise 5%–15% of patients presenting to neurology services.FND is often associated with a high degree of physical and psychological symptoms including comorbidity with chronic pain disorders, fatigue and anxiety/affective disorders.

Epidemiological data, including both incidence and prevalence, can help determine how resources should be allocated in managing specific diseases and disorders. Incidence is defined as the number of new cases of a disease/disorder within a defined population, over a period of time. Prevalence is defined as the total number of cases of a disease/disorder within a population, and can be divided into period prevalence and lifetime prevalence. Period prevalence is the total number of active cases captured over a period of time, while lifetime prevalence is defined as the proportion of people within the population who experience the disease/disorder at any point in their lifetime.

A systematic review found mean annual costs related to FND to lie somewhere between US$5000 and US$87 000 per patientor > US$1.2 billion in annual emergency department and inpatient costs in the USA, suggesting that FND is associated with high healthcare utilisation. However, cost estimates and appropriate resource allocation for FND have been hampered by the fact that robust epidemiological data regarding population incidence and prevalence of this disorder are sparse, with no contemporary systematic reviews attempting to synthesise what data are available. Lack of clarity on the epidemiology of FND is likely due to a number of factors, including changes to the definition and method of diagnosis of FND over the past several decades, limited clinician knowledge and documentation bias, research that has generally focused on discrete symptom subtypes of FND (eg, functional seizures or functional motor disorders) and because it is a diagnosis that must usually be made in secondary care.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^1125REE4]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) safety in obsessive-compulsive disorder — SSRIs may be associated with increased intra-operative blood loss in patients also taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and, along with clomipramine, may interact with anesthetics and opiate pain relievers; patients should inform their surgeon and anesthesiologist if they are taking an SRI. A drug discontinuation syndrome with dizziness, nausea/vomiting, headache, lethargy, agitation, insomnia, myoclonic jerks, and paresthesias may occur if medication is suddenly stopped, and it is most often seen after rapid discontinuation or tapering of venlafaxine; for these medications, a slow taper over several weeks or more will minimize discontinuation symptoms, and if symptoms occur, raising the dose and slowing the taper may bring relief.

### A case of CLIPPERS syndrome responsive to tocilizumab [^114tFGF9]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Case report

In early 2007, after an upper respiratory tract infection, a 34-year-old female with no pertinent medical history started to gradually develop brainstem dysfunction (double vision, vertigo, and gait ataxia) and right occipital headache over a 3-month period. She also complained of brachiofacial paresthesias and prominent facial allodynia/hyperalgesia progressing to her upper chest.

Clinical neurologic examination showed diplopia when looking to the left, left-sided facial hypesthesia, positive right Babinski and bilateral Troemner reflexes as well as appendicular and truncal ataxia with a paraspastic and ataxic gait disorder.

MR imaging showed small infratentorial lesions in the pons, bilateral middle cerebral peduncles and medulla oblongata with associated strong "salt and pepper" like Gadolinium uptake, and linear appearance suggestive of a perivascular localization as well as an upper cervical spinal cord lesion (figure, A–E). Prominent extrapontine manifestations developed during the course of the disease (figure, F–H). Brain biopsy (right temporal lesion, figure, I–N) showed extensive perivascular, less marked vascular but also parenchymal infiltration of predominantly CD4 + T-lymphocytes and few B-lymphocytes without features of vasculitis (no destruction of the vessel wall with fibrinoid necrosis, leukocytoclasia, or fibrin thrombi). These bioptic features have been noted as a hallmark in CLIPPERS. Few small necrotic lesions were evident. An extensive workup for known infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic etiologies was negative.

### Envenomation by a wild Guatemalan beaded lizard heloderma horridum charlesbogerti [^114CrAki]. Clinical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The Guatemalan Beaded Lizard (Heloderma horridum charlesbogerti) is an endemic venomous lizard that inhabits southeastern Guatemala. Published reports of bites by Beaded Lizard are scarce. This is the first case report of a bite from Heloderma horridum charlesbogerti.

Case Report

A 24-year-old man was bitten on the left hand by a juvenile Heloderma horridum charlesbogerti. The lizard remained attached for approximately 15 seconds. The patient experienced severe local pain, dizziness, diaphoresis, vomiting, severe paresthesia in his left hand and arm, and hypotension (70/52 mm/Hg). He was treated with intravenous ketorolac, chlorpheniramine, methylprednisolone, antibiotics, ondansentron, and normal saline. Hematology tests revealed leukocytosis (12,600/mm3). Symptoms improved and the patient was discharged from hospital 24 hours after admission.

Conclusion

The case reported here shows that bites by Heloderma produce severe clinical effects shortly after the bite. Management consists of waiting for the lizard to relax its bite pressure and using pliers to open lizard's mouth and pull out the bitten extremity, a careful manual search for teeth remnants, and supportive care. In our case, severe pain, unresponsive to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics, was a major problem. Parethesias resolve quickly but pain may persist for up to 12 hours after the bite. A full recovery is expected.

### Safety data on meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine from the vaccine adverse event reporting system [^116iE9BF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Recent recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices may lead to the increased use of the meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is useful for the detection of previously unrecognized reactions and for the monitoring of known reactions. Limitations of VAERS include underreporting and the inability to establish a causal relationship between vaccination and adverse events in most cases. From July 1990 through 31 October 1999, 110 adverse events were reported after receipt of meningococcal vaccine alone. Thirteen (12%) were serious, including 6 injection site reactions, 3 allergic reactions, 1 case of Guillain-Barré syndrome, and 3 miscellaneous events. Fever (30%), headache (17%), dizziness (15%), injection site hypersensitivity (13%), urticaria (12%), and paresthesia (10%) were among the most common events reported. Fever and injection site and allergic reactions are most likely causally linked to the vaccine. That there were few reports of serious adverse events, with > 6 million doses having been distributed, and no clear signal of a previously unrecognized serious reaction is reassuring with regard to the safety of meningococcal vaccine.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy [^111vkoEz]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

How is it diagnosed?

Detecting early DCM can be challenging. A high index of suspicion, alongside a comprehensive neurological examination is advised. Box 2 outlines common symptoms and examination findings in DCM.

Box 2
Commonly reported symptoms and examination findings in DCM

Clinical

Pain is a common reason to seek treatment. Musculoskeletal pain might be present in the neck, while neuropathic pain can affect upper and lower limbs and occasionally the trunk. Patients often report neck stiffness, at times without pain. A textbook case would describe gait dysfunction and bilateral hand impairment. Frequently not all symptoms are present. For example, pain might be absent and symptoms can be unilateral and vary in severity, even on a daily basis. Atypical symptoms such as headaches and muscle cramps are also reported.

The more consistent feature of DCM is the evolution of symptoms. Most patients describe symptoms that have been ongoing for months and getting worse. The rate of progression varies; in some individuals symptoms remain mild over extended periods of time, while in others disease progression accelerates. Functional decline can be insidious, and patients might mistakenly attribute these symptoms to "getting older". Typical features include loss of dexterity (difficulty doing up buttons, using keys, mobile phones, or writing) or mobility (use of walking aids or frequent falls).

Symptoms might precede objective examination findings. As in focal central nervous system disorders, examination features in DCM have a low sensitivity — that is, a normal finding does not exclude the disease — but high specificity — that is, an abnormal finding is highly suggestive of the disease. Features can be mild and difficult to elicit in the initial stages of disease.

Investigations

Request an MRI scan of the cervical spine to detect cord compression (fig 1) in suspected DCM. An urgent MRI is required for patients with progressive disease and/or symptoms that substantially affect quality of life. In patients with mild symptoms, a non-urgent MRI might be requested. Bear in mind that the extent of spinal cord compression and signal changes in the cord on the MRI scan do not correlate well with the severity of symptoms. Even mild compression can account for severe disease.

The pathway to diagnosis varies depending on local services. In the UK, for example, many primary care physicians do not have direct access to MRI imaging and referral to neurology might be warranted.

### Mitigation and management of adverse events associated with amivantamab therapy [^113U8T8j]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

AEs associated with amivantamab plus lazertinib

The combination of amivantamab with lazertinib aims to provide a synergistic treatment benefit by simultaneously targeting the extracellular and catalytic EGFR domains.

Common AEs

Most AEs seen with amivantamab plus lazertinib have been consistent with the tolerability profile seen with amivantamab monotherapy. However, exceptions include higher incidences of pruritus with combination versus monotherapy (34% vs 17%), paronychia (64% vs 45%), hypoalbuminemia (46% vs 27%), increased ALT (32% vs 15%), dizziness (21% vs 8%), and paresthesia, an AE unique to lazertinib, (25% vs not reported among the most common [≥ 10%]; Figure 4). These higher incidences may be explained by increased drug burden with combination therapy versus monotherapy and by the simultaneous targeting of EGFR extracellular and kinase domains. Treating providers should rule out other causes for AEs, specifically dizziness. Dizziness caused by volume depletion may be managed with IV fluids, while vertigo-induced dizziness and paresthesia may require changes in amivantamab or lazertinib regimens, or referral to neurology or physical/occupational therapy.

Figure 4.
AEs associated with amivantamab combination regimens. AE, adverse event; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; VTE, venous thromboembolism. a When initiating treatment with amivantamab in combination with lazertinib, administration of anticoagulant prophylaxis is recommended for the first 4 months of treatment to prevent VTE events (see Figure 5 for details of recommended anticoagulant regimens). Note: Management of chemotherapy-associated AEs is outside the scope of this review article.

Management strategies for pruritus, paronychia, and hypoalbuminemia are summarized in Table 1.

### Neuroimaging of dizziness and vertigo [^111Vr8G7]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Dizziness and vertigo are common symptoms in the primary care and emergency settings, resulting in a significant decrease in quality of life and a high cost burden to the US health care system. The etiology of these symptoms is difficult to elucidate owing to a wide range of diseases with overlapping manifestations. The broad differential diagnosis based on whether the disease process is central or peripheral is showcased. Each differential will be categorized into neoplastic, infectious or inflammatory, structural, traumatic, and iatrogenic causes. Computed tomography scans, MRI, and vascular imaging are frequently complimentary in providing diagnoses and guidance in management.

### The rare case of an intramedullary cervical spinal cord teratoma in an elderly adult: case report and literature review [^116c9DWn]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

STUDY DESIGN.: Case report and literature review. OBJECTIVES.: To report the very rare case of a mature intramedullary teratoma with exophytic extension localized to the uppermost cervical spinal level in a 65-year-old woman and review the pertinent medical literature. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Cervical intramedullary teratomas are extremely rare in adults, especially in patients older than 50 years. METHODS.: The patient presented with progressive ataxia, mild bilateral kinetic hand tremors, and dizziness. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intramedullary 1.7 x 1.3 x 2.3 cm mass at C1 with exophytic extension. A C1-C2 laminectomy and a partial suboccipital craniotomy were performed, followed by a subtotal microscopic resection of the tumor. Pathology was consistent with a mature teratoma. RESULTS.: After surgery, the patient's ataxia, tremor, and dizziness resolved almost immediately. CONCLUSION.: This report presents the very rare case of a mature intramedullary teratoma located in the upper cervical spine of an elderly patient, possibly the oldest patient documented with this type of lesion. The authors recommend a conservative subtotal surgical resection of cervical intramedullary tumors because it may improve symptoms that relate to direct mechanical cord compression and avoid further harm from a gross resection.

### HaNDL syndrome in a 14-year-old girl [^117NWMxU]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Transient headache and neurological deficits with cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis (HaNDL syndrome) consists of recurrent headaches with focal neurological signs, which can include motor, sensory and aphasic symptoms. Although considered rare, it is becoming increasingly recognised in clinical practice due to the accumulation of case reports. The pathophysiology remains unclear although changes in the neurovascular resemble those found in migraine, which are thought to be triggered by an infectious process. HaNDL can mimic various serious, including life-threatening, diseases, such as stroke and meningoencephalitis, which is why vigorous tests should be sought before this diagnosis of exclusion can be reached. Treatment is symptomatic and the prognosis is excellent. A literature review of the topic is discussed. We report an adolescent girl who presented with recurrent expressive dysphasia and right-sided hypoaesthesia and moderate occipital headaches who was diagnosed with HaNDL syndrome.

He was initially treated with intravenous Decadron 10 mg every 8 hours for 24 hours, for which he reports improvement in hand paresthesia. Given the patient's symptoms of progressive upper extremity weakness with imaging findings of cervical stenosis and spinal cord compression from likely epidural sarcoidosis, he was recommended urgent surgical intervention which he agreed to after discussing the risks, benefits, and expectations. Before surgery, pulmonology, rheumatology, and medicine service were consulted for medical optimization because patient is at risk of cardiopulmonary sarcoidosis as a former smoker with a known history of pulmonary sarcoidosis. He underwent chest CT that showed mediastinal adenopathy and multiple small pulmonary nodules in bilateral upper lobes without parenchymal disease.

### Artificial ventilation for basic life support leads to hyperventilation in first aid providers [^112GUS69]. Resuscitation (2003). Low credibility.

The 'Guidelines 2000 for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care - International Consensus on Science' recommend an artificial ventilation volume of 10 ml/kg bodyweight (equivalent to a tidal volume of 700–1000 ml) without the use of supplemental oxygen in adults with respiratory arrest. For first aid providers using the mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-nose-ventilation technique, respectively, a ventilation volume of approximately 9.6 l/min results. Additionally, a deep breath is recommended before each ventilation to increase the end-expiratory oxygen concentration of the air exhaled by the first aid provider. To investigate the effects of these recommendations in healthy volunteers, test persons were asked to ventilate an artificial lung model for a period of up to 10 min. The tidal volume was set at 800 mL at a breathing rate of 12/min. End-tidal carbon dioxide, oxygen saturation (measured by pulse oximetry), and heart rate were measured continuously. Capillary blood gas samples were collected and non-invasive blood pressure readings were recorded prior to the start of ventilation and immediately after the end of the measuring period. The data reveal a statistically significant and clinically relevant decrease in end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (P < 0.001, median decrease 14 mmHg), and the occurrence of hyperventilation-associated symptoms such as paraesthesia, dizziness, and carpopedal spasms in more than 75% of the participants. Clinically and statistically significant hyperventilation results in first aid providers performing artificial ventilation according to the guidelines. This artificial ventilation is associated with a significant decrease in capillary and end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure as well as with multiple symptoms of an acute hyperventilation syndrome. Ventilation performed according to these guidelines may cause injury to the health of the first aid provider. Rescuers ventilating the victim should be replaced at regular intervals and the recommendation to take a deep breath before each ventilation should not be upheld in order to minimise the risk of hyperventilation.

Of ischaemic stroke patients, about 25% rise from the posterior or vertebrobasilar system. The ischaemia of vertebral arteries may emerge for different vascular pathological reasons, at different localisations and with different clinical findings. Despite its low morbidity and mortality risk, early diagnosis and treatment is of importance. Vertebrobasilar ischaemia symptoms can be observed clinically such as vertigo, tinnitus, double vision, headache, hypokinesis and hearing disorders, etc. In this article, a 42-year-old stroke patient case is presented, who applied to the emergency service with vertigo and then, was diagnosed with bilateral vertebral artery stenosis by means of cranial MR angiography.

### A phase I, open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study of the JAK2 inhibitor NS-018 in patients with myelofibrosis [^1172uE7m]. Leukemia (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results of this phase I dose-escalation portion of the phase I/II study indicate that the JAK2 inhibitor NS-018 can improve palpable splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms in patients with MF, even those previously treated with a different JAK2 inhibitor. Among the doses tested, NS-018 300 mg QD was considered to give the best balance between clinical activity and tolerability, and this regimen has been chosen for further assessment in the ongoing phase II portion. This 300 mg QD dose appeared tolerable over long-term dosing, with up to 45 cycles administered to date in 1 patient.

Evaluation of the safety and tolerability of NS-018 (primary objective) revealed that the most common non-hematologic AEs were neurological or gastrointestinal in nature. Of the neurologic AEs, dizziness and paresthesia were the most frequent, which were predominantly grade 1/2 in intensity. No grade 4 neurologic events were observed during the study. The neurologic toxicities had a major influence on the choice of RP2D, with 400 mg QD/BID considered intolerable by the SRC based on the proportion of these events. The study discontinuation rate was lower at 300 mg QD than at 250 mg BID or 300 mg BID, with 2 cases of treatment cessation owing to nervous system disorders in the latter cohort. Three agents in this drug class (fedratinib, XL109 and AZD1480) have been discontinued owing to neurological eventsand a persistent treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy with momelotinib has been recently reported. Although possible mechanisms underlying the neurotoxicity of fedratinib have been proposed, there are currently insufficient data from which to generate a hypothesis surrounding neurologic events with NS-018. Irrespective, the need for vigilance around neurologic toxicities in patients treated with JAK inhibitors is clear.

### Vertiginous headache and its management [^116E4YMj]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Vertiginous headache encompasses patients with dizziness or vertigo as well as headache, even though the symptoms may not occur in an obvious temporal relationship. The type of dizziness experienced by patients is different from the heavy-headedness experienced during rhinogenic headache. Patients may have a personal or family history of typical or atypical migraine. They should be evaluated for possible Meniere syndrome, migraine headaches, and/or eye movement disorders. Management is directed to treatment of the underlying abnormality. Long-term follow-up of these patients is necessary, because further otologic abnormalities may present later.

Patient 2 has possible MSA: symptom onset at 62 years old, orthostatic decrease of blood pressures was < 30 mm/15 mm Hg with symptoms of unexplained bladder urgency, levodopa non-responsive parkinsonism and a cerebellar syndrome (online supplemental video 2). Her initial symptoms were postural dizziness, gait imbalance and cough with rapid decline developing dysphagia, dysarthria and mild neurogenic bladder over 2 years. Family history was not contributory. On examination at age 66, she had a stooped posture and narrow-based gait with loss of bilateral arm swing. VORs were impaired on bedside testing. In additional to cerebellar ataxia, finger tapping was slow and showed decrements with interruptions. Her overall strength was preserved with absent plantar reflex. Her other reflexes were symmetrical and brisk. Sensory examination revealed loss of vibration to ankles and absent pinprick sensation in lower limbs and distal upper limbs. Routine investigations for ataxia were normal. Genetic tests were negative. Figure 1F and H showed the results of her MRI head and NSC.

Patient 3 has probable MSA: symptom onset at age 53 years old, orthostatic decrease of blood pressures was > 30 mm/15 mm Hg, levodopa non-responsive parkinsonism and a cerebellar syndrome. Her initial clinical manifestations were gait imbalance, dysarthria and increased extrapyramidal tone in her right hand. Her family history was not contributary. On examination at age 56, she had a broad-based gait, head drop and axial flexion deformity. She was bradykinetic with increased tone and reduced tempo in her right hand but no increased tone in her lower limbs. with a slight reduction in her left. She also had finger dysmetria bilaterally with impaired tandem gait. Her reflexes were reduced in the lower limbs with upgoing plantar responses bilaterally. Autonomic testing showed parasympathetic impairment, with postural blood pressure drop, unexplained urinary urgency and incomplete bladder emptying. NCS results were normal (figure 1H). MRI head showed extensive atrophy of the superior and middle cerebellar peduncles, cerebellum and pons (figure 1G). Genetic tests were negative.

Other neuropathic symptoms

Symptoms suggestive of peripheral neuropathy such as numbness, tingling, and a pins-and-needles sensation affect 2% of COVID-19 survivors. In 1 report, a previously healthy 46-year-old man developed bilateral leg pain and hypoesthesia 53 days after COVID-19 infection. The patient experienced painful sensory symptoms followed by precipitous lower motor neuron weakness affecting all limbs, face, and respiratory muscles. However, with a single reported event, it remains unclear whether it is etiologically related to COVID-19. Neuroinflammation and demyelination induced by SARS-CoV-2 in the brain and spinal cord have similarities to those observed in multiple sclerosis and may explain some patient-reported neuropathic symptoms. Whether COVID-19 increases the risk of subsequent multiple sclerosis or other central or peripheral nervous system disorders remains to be seen.

### Peripheral neuropathy: evaluation and differential diagnosis… [^1122wdmM]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

History A detailed history of symptoms is essential. Symptom onset and timing may be most helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis. Location and distribution help distinguish focal, multifocal, and symmetrical patterns. Aggravating and remitting factors can be clues to exogenous causes, and a complete review of systems should be performed to evaluate for autonomic and vasomotor symptoms. Early peripheral neuropathy may present as sensory alterations that are often progressive, including sensory loss, numbness, pain, or burning sensations in a "stocking and glove" distribution of the extremities. 3 Later stages may involve proximal numbness, distal weakness, or atrophy. 3 One-third of patients with peripheral neuropathy have neuropathic pain. 1 Other common presenting symptoms include a stabbing or electric shock sensation, allodynia, hyperalgesia, and hyperesthesia.

1, 4, 13, 14 Patients may also report autonomic symptoms such as orthostatic intolerance, gastroparesis, changes in bowel and bladder function, erectile dysfunction, and blurry vision, or vasomotor symptoms such as dryness of the eyes, mouth, or skin, and burning or flushing.

1. In up to 50% of cases, the cause of peripheral neuropathy may not be identified with a history and physical examination, especially if the symptoms are mild. Additional physical examination testing may be needed for certain high-risk patient populations, such as those with diabetes. Combining vibratory sensation testing with a 128-Hz tuning fork plus sensory testing with a 10-g Semmes-Weinstein monofilament increases the sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy compared with either test alone in patients with diabetes.

Guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology suggest that the highest-yield tests for identifiable symmetrical distal polyneuropathy include blood glucose level, serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation, and vitamin B. Electrodiagnostic Studies and Imaging Peripheral neuropathy is likely if the history and physical examination reveal corresponding neuropathic findings. The diagnosis may be confirmed with electrodiagnostic studies, including nerve conduction tests and electromyography, although the value of such testing is debated. 1 One retrospective study of patients with symmetrical distal polyneuropathy found that electrodiagnostic studies changed the diagnosis or management in only two of 368 patients.

### A rare case of erythema elevatum diutinum presenting as diffuse neuropathy [^1123unkZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Case report

An otherwise healthy 56-year-old white woman presented in 2000 with extreme nausea attacks followed by cold sweats and shivering of 6 months' duration. An extensive gastrointestinal workup had normal results. Several months later, she reported seeing the muscles of her extremities contracting tightly during nausea attacks, with extremity pain on standing and sitting. Over the next few years, she slowly lost mobility in her arms and legs. She visited many doctors without a clear diagnosis.

In 2006, she reported discrete lumps at locations of pressure, mostly her fingers and soles, worse in the evening and associated with shooting pain and numbness of her hands and feet.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 3 (GRACE-3): acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department [^111CMnfb]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Scope and exclusions — these recommendations do not apply to dizzy patients with obvious general medical causes or to those with an obvious stroke or other central nervous system pathology; for patients with general medical causes, the approach will depend on the cause and, for stroke patients, institutional stroke protocols should be followed; the three presenting syndromes are based on timing and triggers of the dizziness.

### Chronic dizziness: a practical approach [^112gaQvQ]. Practical Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic dizziness pose a particular challenge to the clinician, partly because their symptoms correlate poorly with standard vestibular tests; so a 'test and think later' approach is likely to lead to diagnostic confusion rather than clarity. Rather, a meticulous clinical assessment is required. Here our approach to the chronic dizzy patient is described with an emphasis on treating the patient's symptoms.

### Griseofulvin (microsize) (griseofulvin) [^112fKy9E]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Adverse Reactions

When adverse reactions occur, they are most commonly of the hypersensitivity type such as skin rashes, urticaria and rarely, angioneurotic edema or erythema multiforme-like drug reaction, and may necessitate withdrawal of therapy and appropriate countermeasures. Paresthesias of the hands and feet have been reported rarely after extended therapy. Other side effects reported occasionally are oral thrush, nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, dizziness, insomnia, mental confusion and impairment of performance of routine activities.

Proteinuria and leukopenia have been reported rarely. Administration of the drug should be discontinued if granulocytopenia occurs.

When rare, serious reactions occur with griseofulvin, they are usually associated with high dosages, long periods of therapy, or both.

### Development of a clinical risk score to risk stratify for a serious cause of vertigo in patients presenting to the emergency department [^115yAVaW]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Identify high-risk clinical characteristics for a serious cause of vertigo in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED).

Methods

Multicentre prospective cohort study over 3 years at three university-affiliated tertiary care EDs. Participants were patients presenting with vertigo, dizziness or imbalance. Main outcome measurement was an adjudicated serious diagnosis defined as stroke, transient ischemic attack, vertebral artery dissection or brain tumour.

Results

A total of 2,078 of 2,618 potentially eligible patients (79.4%) were enrolled (mean age 77.1 years; 59% women). Serious events occurred in 111 (5.3%) patients. We used logistic regression to create a 7-item prediction model: male, age over 65, hypertension, diabetes, motor/sensory deficits, cerebellar signs/symptoms and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo diagnosis (C-statistic 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92 to 0.98). The risk of a serious diagnosis ranged from 0% for a score of < 5, 2.1% for a score of 5 to 8, and 41% for a score > 8. Sensitivity for a serious diagnosis was 100% (95% CI, 97.1% to 100%) and specificity 72.1% (95% CI, 70.1% to 74%) for a score < 5.

Conclusion

The Sudbury Vertigo Risk Score identifies the risk of a serious diagnosis as a cause of a patient's vertigo and if validated could assist physicians in guiding further investigation, consultation, and treatment decisions, improving resource utilization and reducing missed diagnoses.

### Can morels (morchella sp.) induce a toxic neurological syndrome? [^115mh3td]. Clinical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Several cases of morel poisoning associated with neurological symptoms have been reported. The objective of this study was to describe this new mushroom poisoning syndrome.

Material and Methods

Retrospective study of morel poisonings collected in the French Poison Control Centers from 1976 to 2006. Cases were classified as neurological syndrome (NS; tremor or dizziness/inebriation or unsteadiness/ataxia ± associated with gastrointestinal symptoms) or isolated gastrointestinal syndrome.

Results

146 patients presented gastrointestinal syndrome (median time to onset: 5 h) and 129 presented NS (12 h) after morel consumption. Gastrointestinal (67%) and other neurological symptoms were also present (mainly ocular/vision disorders: 26%, paresthesia: 7%, drowsiness/confusion: 6%, and muscle disorders: 6%). These patients more frequently ingested a large quantity of morels. Confusion with Gyromitra was ruled out.

Discussion

The NS is very different from the common gastrointestinal syndrome occurring after ingestion of poorly cooked morels and is not limited to a cerebellar syndrome.

### Internal carotid artery dissection manifesting as paracentral acute middle maculopathy: a case report and review of literature [^1159Jd9P]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

CAD is a common cause of ischemic stroke in young and middle-aged adults. ICAD represents the most frequent subtype of CAD. DSA remains the gold standard for diagnosing ICAD. The classic triad of ICAD consists of ipsilateral neck, head, and orbital pain; partial Horner's syndrome; and cerebral or retinal ischemia. The internal carotid arteries supply blood to both eyes, making ocular symptoms often the initial — and sometimes the only — manifestation of ICAD. Recent studies have indicated that ICAD can lead to transient vision loss, CRAO/BRAO, ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS), ischemic optic neuropathy, sympathetic ophthalmoplegia, and ocular motor nerve palsies. Muhi et al. [17] reported a case of "Paracentral acute middle maculopathy following carotid artery dissection". The patient experienced transient vision decline along with systemic symptoms such as limb weakness, paresthesia, and dysarthria. After being diagnosed with ICAD, the patient developed sudden scotoma and was subsequently confirmed to have PAMM. In contrast, the present case is distinctive in that PAMM was the initial symptom in the absence of systemic manifestations, yet led to a definitive diagnosis of ICAD.

We searched multiple databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, Wan fang, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and China Biology Medicine disc (CBM) from their inception until September 2025, with no language restrictions. Search terms included "paracentral acute middle maculopathy", "PAMM", "carotid artery dissection", "internal carotid artery dissection", "CAD", and "ICAD". A total of six relevant publications were identified (Table 1). Among these, three described PAMM following surgical intervention for ICAD; one reported PAMM resulting from traumatic ICAD; one presented ICAD with PAMM as the initial symptom, accompanied by systemic manifestations such as contralateral limb weakness and dizziness; and one documented PAMM occurring after a confirmed diagnosis of ICAD, along with systemic symptoms including limb weakness, paresthesia, and dysarthria. To date, no cases have been reported with PAMM as the initial symptom of ICAD in the absence of systemic manifestations.

### Gabapentin responsive audiovestibular paroxysmia [^116yzzQK]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia and hemifacial spasm are well-documented vascular compression syndromes involving the 5th and 7th cranial nerves. Drugs that stabilize the irritated nerves and vascular decompression surgery are accepted treatments. By contrast, the diagnosis and treatment of a comparable syndrome involving the 8th cranial nerve is controversial. We describe two patients with brief, spontaneous, recurrent attacks of tinnitus and vertigo that responded to low dose gabapentin and we argue that this clinical presentation represents the prototypical 8th nerve vascular compression syndrome.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy: recognition and management [^113VSiEE]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy encompasses a collection of pathologic conditions that result in progressive spinal cord dysfunction secondary to cord compression. Patients are typically male (3: 1 male-to-female ratio), and the average age of presentation is 64 years. The exact incidence is unclear because of differences in terminology and because radiographic findings can be present in asymptomatic individuals. Common examination findings include neck pain or stiffness, a wide-based ataxic gait, ascending paresthesia in the upper or lower extremities, lower extremity weakness, decreased hand dexterity, hyperreflexia, clonus, Babinski sign, and bowel or bladder dysfunction in severe disease. Definitive diagnosis requires correlation of physical examination findings with imaging findings. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine with and without contrast media is the preferred imaging modality. Cervical spine computed tomography, computed tomography myelography, and plain radiography are helpful in certain situations. Treatment depends on the presence and severity of symptoms. Surgery is recommended for patients with moderate to severe symptoms or rapidly progressive disease. Conservative treatments with monitoring for progression may be considered in patients with mild to moderate disease. The evidence for the effectiveness of conservative treatments is scarce and of low quality, and outcomes can vary with individual patients. Primary care physicians play a vital role in recognizing the typical presentation of degenerative cervical myelopathy, coordinating treatment as indicated, and managing comorbidities.

### Paresthesias among community members exposed to the world trade center disaster [^112abey6]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Paresthesias may occur as the result of neuropathy or, in the setting of lesions of central sensory pathways, can be due to hyperventilation and other metabolic derangements. Our data demonstrated an association of paresthesia with metabolic derangement of diabetes. However, there is also biologic plausibility for the paresthesias in our patient population being manifestations of peripheral neuropathy following WTC exposure. The dust and fumes contained known neurotoxins, including lead, aluminum, and n-hexanes. – Our findings are also buttressed by recent publications showing neurologic abnormalities among individuals involved in WTC rescue and recovery work, and slowed nerve conduction velocities an in vitro rat sciatic nerve model.

Many participants in our study reported paresthesias of both the upper and lower extremities. There are potentially several explanations for this finding beyond our primary hypothesis of exposure to neurotoxins in WTC dust and fumes. Carpal tunnel syndrome can produce paresthesias in the upper extremities and may have been the result of repetitive motions associated with 9/11-related cleaning. Alternatively, exposures to solvents and other toxic materials during cleaning tasks could have resulted in paresthesias. However, the finding of upper and lower extremity symptoms also raises the possibility that there may be a severe underlying neuropathy or an uncommon etiology. – Given these issues and the highly subjective nature of paresthesias, objective testing with electrodiagnostic techniques and histologic studies will be critical in clarifying the etiology and extent of neuropathic damage in the WTC (9/11) group.

### Severe vertebrobasilar vasospasm after iatrogenic rupture of a posterior fossa epidermoid cyst: a case report of a rare complication managed with endovascular intervention [^115bYxX3]. Neurosurgery Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION

On the day of admission and surgery, the patient provided informed consent for treatment and HIPAA-compliant publication. Our local institutional review board does not require approval for the report of a single case. Additional data that support the findings of this report are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

Patient History and Clinical Findings

A middle-aged woman presented with right-sided headache, ear fullness, facial paresthesia, and dizziness, all of which had been progressively worsening for approximately 1 year. More recently, she had begun to experience intermittent confusion and gait instability. She was neurologically intact on examination and had no remarkable medical history. MRI with and without contrast demonstrated a 5-cm, nonenhancing fourth ventricular mass that was subsequently confirmed on pathological analysis to be an epidermoid cyst (Figure 1 A- 1 D).

Surgical Procedure

A suboccipital craniotomy with C1 laminectomy was performed with the patient in a prone concorde position to allow adequate access to the caudal end of the posterior fossa between the cerebellar hemispheres. Owing to the large size of the tumor, it was resected in a piecemeal fashion, which unfortunately led to spillage of tumor contents into the subarachnoid space. Attempts were made to minimize the spread of the contents outside the surgical field by packing cottonoids and using copious amounts of irrigation; however, admittedly, microscopic debris was still dispersed. Near the posterior pontomedullary junction, no clear plane was found, and a small amount of the tumor capsule remained attached to the brainstem (Figure 2 A and 2 B). Of note, no direct manipulation of the vertebral or basilar arteries occurred during the procedure. After additional copious irrigation using Ringer solution containing dexamethasone, the wound was closed in a standard fashion. The patient was successfully extubated and taken to the neurological intensive care unit; shortly thereafter, she was observed at her preoperative neurologically intact baseline.

### Vestibular paroxysmia: a treatable neurovascular cross-compression syndrome [^1137ykeE]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Surgical treatment

Despite the report of partial successes and a clinically well-documented single case, operative microvascular decompression should only be considered in medically intractable cases. On the one hand, there is the risk of a brainstem infarction due to intra- or post-operative vasospasm (up to 3–5%), and, on the other as stated above, it is difficult to determine the affected side with enough certainty. However, if there are additional causes, such as the above-mentioned arachnoid cyst in the cerebellar pontine angle, the operation is recommended, for drug therapy only rarely leads to the absence of symptoms.

### Evaluation and management of the dysesthetic patient [^114caW1R]. Clinics in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Dysesthesia is symptomatology that includes but is not limited to sensations of pain, burning, crawling, biting, numbness, piercing, pulling, cold, shock-like, pulling, wetness, and heat. These sensations can cause significant emotional distress and functional impairment in affected individuals. Although some cases of dysesthesia are secondary to organic etiologies, most cases exist without an identifiable infectious, inflammatory, autoimmune, metabolic, or neoplastic process. Ongoing vigilance is required for concurrent or evolving processes, including paraneoplastic presentations. Elusive etiologies, unclear treatment regimens, and stigma leave patients and clinicians with a difficult path forward marked by "doctor shopping", lack of treatment, and significant psychosocial distress. We address this symptomatology and the psychosocial burden that often comes with it. Although notoriously labeled as "difficult to treat", dysesthesia patients can be effectively managed, making life-changing relief possible for patients.
