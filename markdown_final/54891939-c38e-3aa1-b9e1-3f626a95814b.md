## Question

Can amlodipine and verapamil be used together?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether amlodipine and verapamil can be used together. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and mechanism overlap. Then, I should verify pharmacokinetic interactions, especially CYP3A4 and P-gp. Next, I will examine clinical risks like bradycardia, heart block, and hypotension. After that, I should review guideline positions and labeling. Finally, I will consider exceptions, safer alternatives, and a practical recommendation with monitoring if absolutely necessary.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that primarily causes peripheral vasodilation with minimal direct myocardial effects at therapeutic doses, whereas verapamil is a non-dihydropyridine that slows AV nodal conduction and has negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. Combining them risks additive negative chronotropy and inotropy, which can precipitate bradycardia, AV block, and hypotension, especially in vulnerable patients [^16585f5e] [^9233356b].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetic interaction risk. Both amlodipine and verapamil are CYP3A4 substrates and verapamil is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, so coadministration can increase amlodipine exposure and amplify its hemodynamic effects. Verapamil also inhibits P-gp, which can further complicate drug–drug interactions in some contexts, though the clinical relevance for amlodipine itself via P-gp is less well defined than for other agents like dabigatran [^6443fa82] [^ebdf88ad] [^90edba6c].

> I should confirm the clinical risk signals. The VA/DoD hypertension guideline explicitly advises against combining beta-blockers with non-dihydropyridine CCBs due to risk of severe bradycardia or heart block; while the warning is framed for beta-blockers, the mechanistic concern is the same for two CCBs with overlapping negative chronotropy, and verapamil labeling highlights bradyarrhythmias and AV block risks when combined with agents that depress conduction or contractility, which is directly applicable here [^9233356b] [^04f0a526].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check whether any major guideline endorses this combination. I do not find hypertension guidelines recommending amlodipine plus verapamil; instead, contemporary guidance emphasizes beneficial combinations such as a dihydropyridine CCB with a RAS inhibitor to mitigate edema and enhance BP control, and they caution about CYP3A4-mediated interactions with nondihydropyridines, reinforcing that adding verapamil to amlodipine lacks supportive evidence and adds risk [^23072dd4] [^3e8ad8f5].

> Let me consider exceptions. In rare, carefully selected cases with refractory hypertension or specific arrhythmia indications, a specialist might attempt cautious coadministration with close ECG and blood pressure monitoring, but this is off-label and should be reserved for scenarios where benefits clearly outweigh risks and alternatives have failed. Even then, I should double-check for concomitant bradycardia, heart block, heart failure, or interacting drugs that would further elevate risk [^notfound].

> I will now examine safer alternatives. If BP control is inadequate on amlodipine, adding a RAS inhibitor (ACE inhibitor or ARB) is guideline-preferred and reduces peripheral edema compared with CCB monotherapy, while avoiding the conduction toxicity seen with nondihydropyridines. If rate control is needed, consider a beta-blocker with caution rather than layering verapamil onto amlodipine, and avoid verapamil in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction where it is contraindicated or discouraged [^23072dd4] [^3e8ad8f5] [^c50793f5].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on both and doing fine? I should confirm that stability does not equal safety; the interaction remains mechanistically plausible and clinically risky, so the prudent course is to deprescribe verapamil when feasible or, if a compelling indication exists for verapamil, to taper amlodipine and monitor for rebound hypertension, rather than maintaining dual CCB therapy long term [^notfound].

> Final recommendation: No, amlodipine and verapamil should not be routinely combined because of overlapping negative chronotropic and inotropic effects, additive hypotension, and CYP3A4-mediated pharmacokinetic interaction, with no guideline support and meaningful risks of bradycardia, AV block, and heart failure exacerbation. If a compelling indication exists, use the lowest effective doses, avoid in patients with conduction disease or HFrEF, and monitor ECG, heart rate, and blood pressure closely, but prefer guideline-endorsed combinations such as amlodipine plus a RAS inhibitor instead [^9233356b] [^23072dd4] [^3e8ad8f5] [^c50793f5].

---

Amlodipine and verapamil are both **calcium channel blockers** with distinct pharmacologic profiles [^16585f5e]; amlodipine is a dihydropyridine with predominant peripheral vasodilation, while verapamil is a non-dihydropyridine with negative chronotropic and inotropic effects [^16585f5e]. Clinically, they are **not routinely co-prescribed** because of the risk of additive bradycardia, AV block, and hypotension, especially in patients with conduction disease or heart failure [^9233356b] [^c50793f5]. If combination therapy is considered, it should be reserved for refractory cases with close ECG and blood pressure monitoring, and avoided in patients with bradycardia, AV block, or heart failure [^9233356b] [^c50793f5].

## Pharmacological differences and mechanisms of action

| **Parameter** | **Amlodipine** | **Verapamil** |
|-|-|-|
| Class | Dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker | Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker |
| Primary effect | Peripheral vasodilation via L-type calcium channel blockade in vascular smooth muscle | Negative chronotropy, dromotropy, and inotropy via L-type calcium channel blockade in cardiac tissue |
| Clinical use | Hypertension, angina | Supraventricular arrhythmias, angina, hypertension |

## Potential benefits of combination therapy

Theoretically, combining amlodipine and verapamil could provide **additive antihypertensive effects** through complementary mechanisms, potentially improving blood pressure control in refractory hypertension. However, this potential benefit must be weighed against the significant risks associated with concurrent use.

---

## Risks and adverse effects of combination therapy

The concurrent use of amlodipine and verapamil carries **significant risks**, including:

- **Bradycardia and AV block**: Both drugs can depress sinus node function and AV conduction, increasing the risk of severe bradycardia and AV block [^9233356b].

- **Hypotension**: Additive vasodilatory effects can cause significant hypotension, particularly in elderly patients or those with autonomic dysfunction [^7f5b2763].

- **Heart failure exacerbation**: Verapamil's negative inotropic effect can worsen heart failure, especially in patients with reduced ejection fraction [^c50793f5].

- **Drug interactions**: Both drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4, and verapamil is a known CYP3A4 inhibitor, potentially increasing amlodipine plasma levels and enhancing adverse effects [^6443fa82].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

There is **limited clinical evidence** supporting the routine combination of amlodipine and verapamil. Major hypertension guidelines do not recommend this combination due to safety concerns. The VA/DoD guideline explicitly advises against combining beta-blockers with non-dihydropyridine CCBs (verapamil, diltiazem) because of the risk of severe bradycardia or heart block, underscoring the additive negative chronotropic risk of combining agents with similar effects [^9233356b]. Similarly, the ESH guideline recommends avoiding the combination of beta-blockers with non-dihydropyridine CCBs, reflecting the same mechanistic concern [^73702955].

---

## Clinical scenarios where combination therapy might be considered

In rare, refractory cases where blood pressure remains uncontrolled despite multiple agents and close monitoring is feasible, **combination therapy may be considered**. This approach should be reserved for patients without conduction disease, bradycardia, or heart failure, and requires careful titration with frequent ECG and blood pressure monitoring.

---

## Monitoring and precautions

If combination therapy is initiated, **close monitoring is essential**:

- **Baseline ECG**: Assess for existing conduction abnormalities.

- **Frequent monitoring**: Regular ECG and blood pressure checks during titration and after dose changes.

- **Patient education**: Inform patients about symptoms of bradycardia, dizziness, and syncope, and instruct them to seek immediate medical attention if these occur.

---

## Alternative antihypertensive combinations

Given the risks, **safer and more effective combinations** are recommended:

- **Amlodipine with ACE inhibitors or ARBs**: Provides synergistic antihypertensive effects and reduces peripheral edema associated with amlodipine [^9378b79f].

- **Amlodipine with thiazide diuretics**: Effective combination for resistant hypertension.

- **Verapamil with ACE inhibitors or ARBs**: Useful in patients with concomitant arrhythmias or angina, but careful monitoring is still required.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Amlodipine and verapamil are **not routinely co-prescribed** because of the risk of additive bradycardia, AV block, and hypotension. If combination therapy is considered, it should be reserved for refractory cases with close monitoring and avoided in patients with conduction disease or heart failure. Safer, guideline-supported combinations — such as amlodipine with ACE inhibitors or ARBs — are preferred for most patients.

Summary of evidence—statin–calcium channel blocker drug–drug interactions (DDIs) indicates the following: Pharmacokinetic data suggest a minor increase in statin exposure with coadministration of amlodipine and lovastatin or simvastatin, and combination therapy may be considered; there is no evidence of significant interaction when amlodipine is coadministered with other statins; combination therapy with atorvastatin and diltiazem results in a minor increase in statin exposure and is reasonable in appropriate patients; interactions between diltiazem and either lovastatin or simvastatin are associated with moderate increases in statin exposure, although combination therapy may be considered in appropriate patients; DDIs with verapamil and lovastatin or simvastatin are also of moderate intensity, and combination therapy may be considered when the potential for benefit outweighs potential risks.

Key Points

Question

What is the association of oral anticoagulants and verapamil hydrochloride or diltiazem hydrochloride with adverse bleeding events in patients with no kidney disease?

Findings

In this comparative effectiveness study using data from 48 442 patients, rates of bleeding were increased for patients receiving dabigatran etexilate with concomitant verapamil or diltiazem compared with those who were receiving concomitant amlodipine or metoprolol therapy. Other direct oral anticoagulants had no evidence of these drug-drug interactions.

Meaning

These findings suggest that prescribers may need to avoid P-glycoprotein–related drug-drug interactions with dabigatran regardless of kidney function.

Our objective was to conduct a targeted comparative safety analysis of the potential drug-drug interaction between verapamil or diltiazem and DOACs using an active comparator study design to reduce the residual confounding present in existing real-world studies. An ideal active comparator should be either of the same medication class or be used for similar purposes as the reference product. Therefore, we selected 2 different comparators: amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocking antihypertensive drug, and metoprolol, a β-blocker antihypertensive that is also recommended for heart rate control in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.These 2 drugs are not classified as P-gp or CYP3A4 inhibitors and provide similar pharmacologic pathways and therapeutic uses compared with verapamil and diltiazem.We aimed to compare the risk of major, moderate, and minor adverse bleeding events among patients with concomitant use of DOACs and verapamil or diltiazem vs concomitant use of DOACs and amlodipine or metoprolol.

General advice about amlodipine

Sometimes, doctors will prescribe a medicine for a condition that is not written in the patient information leaflets. Only use amlodipine the way your doctor told you to. Do not give amlodipine to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them.

You can ask your pharmacist or doctor for information about amlodipine.

Statin–calcium channel blocker combinations—dose limits and agent selection are specified as follows: Combination therapy with atorvastatin and diltiazem results in a minor increase in statin exposure and this combination therapy is reasonable. Diltiazem administered with either lovastatin or simvastatin is associated with moderate increases in statin exposure, although these combination therapies may be considered in appropriate patients. Coadministration of verapamil with lovastatin or simvastatin results in moderate increases in statin exposure. Therefore, these combination therapies may be considered when the potential for benefit outweighs potential risks. Doses of lovastatin or simvastatin >20 mg daily when coadministered with amlodipine are not recommended. A non–CYP3A4-metabolized statin is preferred in combination with diltiazem or verapamil. Doses of simvastatin >10 mg daily and doses of lovastatin >20 mg daily when used with diltiazem or verapamil are not recommended. However, it should be noted that verapamil labeling recommends a higher dose limit of lovastatin of 40 mg daily when coadministered with verapamil. For adult patients on stable therapy with simvastatin 80 mg daily (a dose that is no longer recommended for general use), clinicians should change to a non–CYP3A4 statin such as pravastatin, rosuvastatin, or pitavastatin if therapy with diltiazem or verapamil is initiated. Caution should be exercised with statin-CCB combination therapy in patients of various ethnic backgrounds, particularly those of Asian descent.

Diltiazem and verapamil—effects on simvastatin and lovastatin exposure and product labeling are as follows: Diltiazem and verapamil are moderate to weak inhibitors of CYP3A4, and in 10 healthy volunteers diltiazem increased the Cmax of simvastatin by 3.6-fold and simvastatin acid by 3.7-fold (P<0.05), with the AUC of simvastatin increased by 5-fold (P<0.05) and the elimination t1/2 by 2.3-fold (P<0.05); diltiazem also increased the AUC of lovastatin by 3.6-fold and Cmax from 6±2 to 26±9 ng/mL but did not change the elimination t1/2. Current labeling advises that the dose of simvastatin not exceed 10 mg daily when co-prescribed with diltiazem or verapamil in adult patients and that the dose of lovastatin not exceed 20 mg daily; the approved labeling for diltiazem recommends the use of non–CYP3A4-metabolized statins in combination with diltiazem if possible; the product labeling for atorvastatin does not include dose adjustments for combination therapy with amlodipine, diltiazem, or verapamil, and labeling for verapamil recommends that when coadministration lower doses of atorvastatin may be considered.

### Amlodipine in hypertension: a first-line agent with efficacy for improving blood pressure and patient outcomes [^6c412dbd]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Amlodipine is an excellent first-line choice among the myriad options of antihypertensive agents. In the studies discussed in this manuscript, amlodipine was highly effective for the treatment of HTN and stable angina as evidenced by the fewer hospitalisations for unstable angina and revascularisation in randomised controlled trials. Amlodipine has also shown robust reductions on CV end points (especially stroke) but has not altered the prognosis in HF. Its abilities to prevent activation of counter-regulatory mechanisms, to slow the progression of atherosclerosis, to confer antioxidant properties and to enhance NO production are all unique actions. The management of HTN is shifting more towards dual or even triple combination therapy and requires a patient profiling approach as the number of comorbid states increases. Amlodipine is a superior option in the HTN armamentarium, not only for controlling BP but also for safely improving patient outcomes.

Discussion

In our study of patients with no history of kidney disease receiving DOACs who had received a standard dose of each drug, use of dabigatran with concomitant verapamil or diltiazem was associated with an increased risk of bleeding compared with the combination of DOACs with amlodipine or metoprolol. There were no statistically significant findings for comparisons within groups using rivaroxaban or apixaban with verapamil or diltiazem vs the active comparison groups. To our knowledge, these findings provide the first real-world evidence of the pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between these medications and suggest that caution may be necessary when coprescribing dabigatran with common antihypertensive medications—verapamil and diltiazem—and possibly other moderate to strong P-gp inhibitors regardless of kidney function.

Dabigatran is a prodrug that undergoes efflux by P-gp and subsequent elimination via the intestinal tract or other elimination organs and is not a substrate for CYP450 enzymes. Thus, inhibition of P-gp increases the bioavailability of the prodrug, leading to increased serum concentrations of the active metabolite.Verapamil and diltiazem are moderate to strong P-gp inhibitors along with other common medications, such as amiodarone, proton-pump inhibitors, some antidepressants, and azole antifungals.In US Food and Drug Administration briefing documents, verapamil, used as a reference agent for drug-drug interactions, was reported to increase the area under the curve of dabigatran by over 143% with a single concomitant dose and by 18% when separated by a 2-hour dosing interval. In the phase 3 RE-LY clinical trial, P-gp inhibition led to an increase in major bleeding event rates (4.12% vs 2.96% for 150 mg dose; 3.99% vs 2.38% for 110 mg dose) though these findings were not statistically significant given the sample size in the trial.These figures represented a relative increase in bleeding risk of 39% to 68%, which are consistent with the findings from this study.

Strengths and Limitations

To our knowledge, this is the first real-world observational study that evaluated the drug-drug interaction between DOACs and verapamil or diltiazem vs active comparators. This design may help to reduce indication and healthy user biases, provide some control for disease severity, and also provide useful information for patients and prescribers when they need to consider an alternative treatment.

However, there are still several limitations in our study. First, we only looked at the use of verapamil, diltiazem, amlodipine, and metoprolol before DOAC initiation, and required 90 days of cumulative use of these medications during the previous 6-month period with strict criteria for censoring at discontinuation or switching of any study medication (DOACs or antihypertensives). While this approach substantially reduced our sample size, it helped to create a more homogeneous population of patients receiving long-term therapy with each medication and provided strong exposure definitions. Second, owing to the small sample size, we combined data on verapamil and diltiazem. Although this combination is not ideal from a study design perspective, both verapamil and diltiazem are categorized as combined P-gp inhibitors and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, have similar on-label and off-label indications, and are expected to behave similarly in terms of drug-drug interaction mechanisms.

As in all other observational studies, the potential of unmeasured confounding may not be avoided; however, we minimized this by having an active comparator study design in addition to IPTW methods and a large number of covariates. Owing to the limitations of claims data, we could not observe when patients administered the drugs; thus, our conclusions were based on the assumption that patients followed what had been recommended by physicians. Our exposure definition required continuous adherence with a small gap window (7-day) to ensure exposure. Likewise, the claims database would not include information on when patients acquired prescriptions not paid for by their insurance coverage, such as over-the-counter or sample medications,,, but this information is not expected to be imbalanced between treatment groups and would likely not affect the study results. Our results were consistent in direction and magnitude to several sensitivity analyses including use of standardized mortality ratio weighting in place of IPTW, use of a 15-day gap censor criterion, outcome measurement using all primary and secondary diagnoses, and separating verapamil and diltiazem.

### Amlodipine in hypertension: a first-line agent with efficacy for improving blood pressure and patient outcomes [^380b0e85]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hypertension is well established as a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although there is undeniable evidence to support the beneficial effects of antihypertensive therapy on morbidity and mortality, adequate blood pressure management still remains suboptimal. Research into the treatment of hypertension has produced a multitude of drug classes with different efficacy profiles. These agents include β-blockers, diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and calcium channel blockers. One of the oldest groups of antihypertensives, the calcium channel blockers are a heterogeneous group of medications.

Methods

This review paper will focus on amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, which has been widely used for 2 decades.

Results

Amlodipine has good efficacy and safety, in addition to strong evidence from large randomised controlled trials for cardiovascular event reduction.

Conclusions

Amlodipine should be considered a first-line antihypertensive agent.

### The combination of amlodipine and angiotensin receptor blocker or diuretics in high-risk hypertensive patients: rationale, design and baseline characteristics [^029a8142]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

CHIEF randomized in excess of 13 000 patients between October 2007 and October 2008, of whom 73% were recruited into the lipid-lowering limb.

If CHIEF runs its full course, it should report at the end of 2011. CHIEF will help to define the place of the two different treatment strategies for the lowering of BP, both alone and in combination with lipid-lowering therapy and lifestyle intervention, in the prevention of cardiovascular outcomes.

The recent guidelines on hypertension, and on cardiovascular preventionemphasized that rather than focus on single-risk factors, focus should be on the global cardiovascular risk of an individual patient. The CHIEF study was designed to manage the hypertensive patients on the basis of an extensive intervention of the overall risk, including an initial low dose of combined antihypertensive therapy, low-dose statin-based lipid-lowering treatment and lifestyle intervention. Extensive intervention of overall risks has great potential to control hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors, to enable more patients to reach their target BP, and further reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^9233356b]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Long-acting calcium channel blockers (CCB)—dosing and cautions include: DHP CCBs usual doses are Amlodipine 2.5-10 mg daily, Felodipine 2.5-10 mg daily, and Nifedipine sustained release 30-120 mg daily; Non-DHP CCBs usual doses are Verapamil sustained release 120-480 mg divided daily-bid and Diltiazem sustained release 120-540 mg daily. Monitor AEs (DHP CCBs may cause ankle edema, dizziness, flushing, headache, constipation), and use with caution in patients with hepatic (CCBs) or kidney (non-DHP CCBs) dysfunction. Non-DHP CCBs may be considered for rate control in supraventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation/flutter. Verapamil may cause constipation; verapamil is contraindicated 2nd or 3rd degree AV block, severe LV dysfunction. Diltiazem may decrease sinus rate; diltiazem is contraindicated in 2nd or 3rd degree AV block; use with caution in LV dysfunction. Verapamil or diltiazem should not usually be used with a beta-blocker due to risk of severe bradycardia or heart block.

### Drug-drug interactions in the management of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^85dfda08]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Vasoreactivity: Calcium Channel Blockers

Approximately 10% of patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH are vasoreactive. This is defined by a reduction in mean pulmonary artery pressure of more than 10 mm Hg to an absolute value of < 40 mm Hg with unchanged or improved cardiac output when exposed to a rapidly active pulmonary vasodilator (inhaled NO or IV epoprostenol) during right heart catheterization.These cases of vasoreactive PAH respond well to high doses of oral calcium channel blockers (CCBs) such as amlodipine, nifedipine, or diltiazem. All CCBs are metabolized by CYP3A4, which introduces opportunity for significant drug interactions if coadministered with other CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.Verapamil, diltiazem, amlodipine, and nifedipine also are CYP3A4 inhibitors, with verapamil and diltiazem exhibiting more potent inhibition activity.Potent CYP3A4 inhibition by diltiazem and verapamil may increase the plasma concentrations of medications that rely on this enzyme for metabolism. Verapamil has a higher drug interaction risk profile than all the CCBs as a substrate and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. The nondihydropyridine CCBs, verapamil and diltiazem, can cause excessive bradycardia. Care should be used when these nondihydropyridine CCBs are coadministered with other medications known to cause bradycardia, including noncardiac medications such as lacosamide for seizures, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators for multiple sclerosis or ulcerative colitis, and ceritinib for non-small cell lung cancer.

Design

Our exposure of interest was the concomitant use of DOACs and verapamil or diltiazem. The comparison group was DOACs with concomitant use of amlodipine or metoprolol. Use of verapamil or diltiazem, amlodipine, and metoprolol were identified within the 6 months before DOAC therapy initiation. Patients were considered exposed to one of these drugs if they had an overlap use with DOACs on the index date and at least 90 days of cumulative use of these drugs within the 6-month preindex period. Prescription fills of all studied medications were identified based on the National Drug Codes. Medication use each day during follow-up was assessed using the prescription fill dates and days-supplied values on prescription claims with correction for overlapping refills.

### Therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults: update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^98024c3b]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)—vasoreactivity-guided calcium channel blocker (CCB) therapy: We suggest that patients with PAH who, in the absence of right-sided heart failure or contraindications to CCB therapy, demonstrate acute vasoreactivity according to consensus definition, should be considered candidates for a trial of therapy with an oral CCB (Ungraded consensus-based statement). We suggest that CCBs should not be used empirically to treat PAH in the absence of demonstrated acute vasoreactivity (Ungraded consensus-based statement). Careful follow-up is advised with long-acting nifedipine or diltiazem, or amlodipine; due to its potential negative inotropic effects, verapamil should be avoided, and the daily doses that have shown efficacy in idiopathic PAH are 120–240 mg for nifedipine, 240–720 mg for diltiazem and up to 20 mg for amlodipine, with an initial reassessment after 3 months of therapy and initiation of additional or alternative PAH therapy if there is not improvement to functional class I or II. Even though a small percentage (<5%) of PAH in patients with connective tissue diseases may be vasoreactive, there are no studies to suggest that CCB have been effective; patients at increased risk during acute vasoreactivity testing include those with FC IV symptoms, a low systemic BP, low CO, or PVOD, and vasoreactivity testing should be performed by individuals with appropriate training in test performance and interpretation.

### Association of oral anticoagulants and verapamil or diltiazem with adverse bleeding events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and normal kidney function [^3dfa2e68]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are purported to have fewer drug-drug interactions than warfarin. However, potential interactions with coprescribed medications are still a safety concern. Verapamil hydrochloride and diltiazem hydrochloride are combined P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and CYP3A4 inhibitors and may be associated with increases in the risk of bleeding with DOACs.

Objective

To evaluate the risk of bleeding with DOACs and verapamil or diltiazem using an active comparator design.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A comparative effectiveness active comparator cohort study was conducted using US population-based data (2010-2015) analyzed between January 1 and July 15, 2019. Data were obtained on 48 442 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who had received an index prescription of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban between October 19, 2010, through June 30, 2015, with final follow-up on October 1, 2015. Analysis was restricted to individuals with no history of kidney disease who were receiving standard doses of the DOACs.

Exposures

Patients with initial prescriptions of DOACs who were receiving verapamil or diltiazem were compared with those receiving amlodipine or metoprolol.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Overall and gastrointestinal major, moderate, and minor bleeding using primary or secondary diagnoses. Hazard ratios and 95% CIs were estimated using inverse probability of treatment weights in Cox proportional hazards regression models.

Results

Of the 48 442 patients reviewed, analysis was conducted on 1764 patients receiving DOACs with verapamil or diltiazem compared with3105 receiving amlodipine and 1793 patients receiving DOACs with verapamil or diltiazem compared with 3224 receiving metoprolol. Depending on the comparison, approximately 60% of the cohort were younger than 65 years and male, which differed by treatment group. Rivaroxaban and apixaban were not associated with increased rates of bleeding for patients receiving verapamil or diltiazem compared with those receiving amlodipine or metoprolol. Among patients receiving dabigatran etexilate, the overall bleeding rate was 52% higher (hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.05-2.20) with verapamil or diltiazem vs amlodipine and 43% higher (hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.02-2.00) vs metoprolol. Bleeding rates for dabigatran with verapamil or diltiazem were higher overall for other bleeding types (244.9 vs 158.4 per 1000 person-years; adjusted hazard ratios of overall GI bleeding: 2.16; 95% CI, 1.30-3.60; minor bleeding: 1.56; 95% CI, 1.07-2.27; and minor GI bleeding: 2.16; 95% CI, 1.29-3.63). Sensitivity analyses showed consistent results for dabigatran when used with verapamil and diltiazem, with magnitudes ranging from 50% to 100% increased hazard rates and no significant results for apixaban or rivaroxaban.

Conclusions and Relevance

Current US prescribing information only recommends prescribing changes with dabigatran and P-gp inhibitors with lower kidney function. This study found increased bleeding risk associated with dabigatran when used concomitantly with the P-gp inhibitors verapamil and diltiazem in individuals with normal kidney function. Clinicians and patients may need to consider these drug-drug interactions when choosing oral anticoagulation.

### Amlodipine in hypertension: a first-line agent with efficacy for improving blood pressure and patient outcomes [^494b053b]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were first introduced over 35 years ago initially for coronary heart disease (CHD), but they soon gained wide recognition for their efficacy in hypertension (HTN). The initial indication, besides HTN, also included angina, peripheral vascular disease and some arrhythmic conditions.Amlodipine has many unique qualities that set it apart from other agents in this class. The aim of this review is to compare amlodipine with other antihypertensive agents with particular focus on the ability to improve cardiovascular (CV) health and reduce adverse CV outcomes.

### Amlodipine and atorvastatin [^f49fbcae]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.   Amlodipine may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

Inter-current illness

There are risks of large reductions in eGFR with RAAS blockade, particularly during intercurrent illness or with intravascular fluid depletion (diarrhoea, vomiting and high fever). It is therefore recommended to reduce the dose or to hold off ACEI or ARB use until recovery is made, because ensuing hypotension may cause an acute decline in eGFR in people with type 2 diabetes with CKD who are taking ACEIs or ARBs. It is recommended that people with type 2 diabetes should be advised to stop RAAS-blocking drugs during periods of acute illness and restarted 24–48 h after recovery from the illness. These precautions should especially be taken if an individual is on a combination involving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or diuretics.

Other agents for blood pressure lowering in people with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy

Most of the evidence for the use of other antihypertensive agents (apart from ACEIs or ARBs) is extrapolated from the general population and there is little evidence of their specific use or rationale in people with type 2 diabetes and CKD.

Calcium channel blockers

There is good evidence to suggest that non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem) reduce proteinuria. A multicentre trial in people with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy suggested that adding a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker to an ACEI-based regime can be effective at lowering residual albuminuria with or without a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure. Thus non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can be used as a valid additive or alternative to ACEIs or ARBs in people with type 2 diabetes, suggesting that their renal protective effects are over and above blood pressure lowering alone. Diltiazem and verapamil can induce bradycardia and heart block in combination with beta blockers; dihydropyridines such as amlodipine are more appropriate alongside beta blocker use.

### Amlodipine in hypertension: a first-line agent with efficacy for improving blood pressure and patient outcomes [^96cf4a3b]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Role in combination therapy for HTN

While thus far amlodipine has shown to be non-inferior to many other anti-HTN therapies, the focus on HTN treatment seems to be shifting more towards combination therapy. Less than 50% of patients with stage I or II HTN are adequately controlled with monotherapy, and thus initial treatment for HTN in the majority of patients will require two agents. The classical approach to treating HTN where one first-line agent is maximised before another is added may be flawed since this is a multifactorial disease often occurring with a number of comorbidities. Many studies show that individuals with more CV risk factors generally need more anti-HTN agents to successfully manage their BP. Combination therapy using different mechanisms can lead to more effective BP lowering. In addition, combination therapies block counter-regulatory mechanisms that often limit the efficacy of monotherapy. Furthermore, using multiple agents to lower doses may reduce side effects, and thus improve patient compliance.

The issue arises as to which fixed combinations provide the most benefits. Thiazides in combination with ACEIs or ARBs have synergistic BP-lowering activity, whereas thiazides and BBs have deleterious effects on the metabolic profile. CCBs are powerful vasodilators but can result in renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) activation, thus an ACEI or ARB counteracts this mechanism and leads to enhanced antihypertensive effect. Growing evidence from trial data also shows that CCBs with ACEIs or ARBs may provide the best long-term outcomes.

The ACCOMPLISH trial was a randomised, controlled trial in which 11 506 patients with HTN with high risk for adverse CV events were assigned amlodipine+benazepril versus HCTZ+benazepril.The primary end point was the composite of CV death or major adverse CV events. The amlodipine+benazepril combination was superior to the HCTZ+benazepril for lowering CV death and adverse events (figure 1).

Toxicology: calcium channel blockers—Synopsis describes pharmacology, toxicity patterns, and commonly used modalities: “Antagonists of the L-type calcium channel (commonly called CCBs) are divided into 2 pharmacological classes: dihydropyridines (eg, nifedipine, amlodipine) and nondihydropyridines (eg, diltiazem, verapamil).” “At therapeutic doses, nondihydropyridines have more pronounced effects on cardiac tissue, including the atrioventricular node, resulting in negative chronotropy. In contrast, dihydropyridines primarily cause peripheral vasodilation.” “Amlodipine can cause profound vasodilation mediated by nitric oxide release.” These distinctions may blur in overdose: “These distinctions are often lost when therapeutic doses are exceeded, and patients present with severe shock from bradycardia, vasodilation, or loss of inotropy.” Prolonged toxicity is common: “Prolonged effects are common given that CCBs are frequently prescribed in sustained-release forms (eg, diltiazem, verapamil, nifedipine) or have long half-lives (eg, amlodipine).” It further notes burden and therapies: “CCBs are a leading cause of poisoning mortality reported to poison centers.” and “Commonly used treatment modalities include atropine, calcium, vasopressors, high-dose insulin therapy, methylene blue (a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor), and ILE therapy. ECLS, such as VA-ECMO, has been used in refractory cases.”

Antihypertensive medication interactions—classification, CYP3A4 involvement, and combination effects—are described with practical examples: Drug-drug interactions are categorized as pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic, with key pharmacokinetic interactions involving the CYP3A4 pathway where verapamil and diltiazem can alter metabolism of other medications. Beneficial pharmacodynamic combinations include pairing a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor with a thiazide-type diuretic to minimize diuretic-induced hypokalemia or combining a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) with a RAS inhibitor to reduce lower extremity edema, whereas overlapping mechanisms such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) plus angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or direct renin inhibitor increase the risk of hyperkalemia as an adverse pharmacodynamic interaction.

Medication interactions in hypertension management—drug–drug interactions are categorized as pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic, and knowledge of these interactions is essential; important pharmacokinetic interactions involve the CYP3A4 pathway because verapamil and diltiazem are both substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A4 and can alter the metabolism of other medications, beneficial pharmacodynamic pairs include an RAS inhibitor with a thiazide-type diuretic to minimize diuretic-induced hypokalemia or a dihydropyridine CCB with an RAS inhibitor to reduce lower extremity edema, whereas combining drugs with overlapping mechanisms like ACEI and ARB or direct renin inhibitors leads to an increased risk of hyperkalemia.

Verapamil for cluster headache prevention—safety, hemodynamic effects, and monitoring are described as follows: The most common adverse event was constipation (53%); reductions in blood pressure and heart rate were observed, and the verapamil group experienced an average decrease of 11 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) in systolic blood pressure, 6 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure, and 10 beats per minute in heart rate from baseline, while none of the patients prescribed verapamil stopped treatment because of adverse events. Verapamil is also not recommended for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and other possible cardiac adverse reactions, including atrioventricular block, warrant ECG monitoring as clinically indicated and might limit its use in older adults as well as those with hepatic impairment; safety monitoring, including ECGs, might pose a burden for patients who have difficulty coming to the clinic for monitoring. Patient considerations include that it is dosed multiple times a day, resulting in a high pill burden, it could pose a benefit to patients with concurrent hypertension or a potential risk for hypotension in those who are normotensive, and other common side effects such as constipation and edema might be intolerable to some patients.

### Hypertension and prohypertensive antineoplastic therapies in cancer patients [^df8f76f5]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Currently, specific guidance on the choice of antihypertensive agents in the cancer population is lacking. When choosing antihypertensive agents, it is important that careful consideration is given to drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, as well as the presence of comorbidities and potential side effects. For example, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB), such as verapamil and diltiazem, should not be used in combination with most VEGFI as they have the potential for cytochrome P450 inhibition, which may lead to elevated circulating VEGFI concentrations. The choice of first-line antihypertensive agent generally follows national guidelines for hypertension management, as there is currently no clinical evidence to support the use of one class of agent over another.

Dihydropyridine CCB such as amlodipine or nifedipine potently reduce arterial smooth muscle cell contractility in blood vessels.Therefore, given the role vascular dysfunction plays in the development of hypertension with many anticancer agents (Figure 3), CCB are likely to be effective in this setting. Indeed, a study of 36 patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer who developed hypertension with bevacizumab therapy demonstrated the efficacy of amlodipine in achieving blood pressure control.Nonetheless, it is often necessary to combine 2 or more antihypertensive agents to achieve satisfactory blood pressure levels.In this setting, combination of an ACEI or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) with a CCB is generally accepted as the first choice (Figure 4).

Despite a lack of robust evidence for a major role of the RAAS in the prohypertensive mechanisms of most anticancer therapies, ACEI and ARB are frequently used in the treatment of VEGFI-associated hypertension and in the treatment of hypertension associated with other cancer therapies. ACEI/ARB may be used preferentially in cancer patients with diabetic nephropathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), and cancer-therapy associated proteinuria. Other antihypertensive agents such as diuretics and β-blockers may be used when ACEI/ARB and CCB are ineffective in normalizing blood pressure.Of note, diuretics should be prescribed with caution for patients at risk of dehydration. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as eplerenone and spironolactone are increasingly being administered to patients with resistant hypertension,and they may be a useful option in the management of cancer therapy-associated hypertension that is unresponsive to conventional therapy.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Antihypertensive medications—pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions are detailed across absorption, metabolism, elimination, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) effects, with specific mitigation where stated. Potassium binder (patiromer) decreases absorption of multiple antihypertensives and to mitigate this, administer the antihypertensives at least 3 h before or after taking the potassium binder. Potassium binder (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) increases absorption of furosemide with increased clinical effects (eg, diuresis or risk of hypokalemia); the effect is diminished with separation of administration by 2 h. Iron salts decrease absorption of methyldopa leading to reduced BP lowering. CYP2D6 inhibitors increase BB concentration with enhanced clinical effects (eg, hypotension and bradycardia), and CYP3A4 inhibitors increase nondihydropyridine concentration (diltiazem, verapamil) with enhanced clinical effects. CYP3A4 inhibition via amlodipine, verapamil, or diltiazem increases calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus, cyclosporine) concentration with increased risk for side effects (eg, renal impairment). With eplerenone plus diltiazem there is increased risk of hypotension and hyperkalemia, and using a lower dose of eplerenone when combined with diltiazem could be considered a productive interaction. Lithium clearance is reduced by thiazide-type diuretics and RAS blockers, increasing lithium toxicity risk. Verapamil via P-gp inhibition increases dabigatran levels with a higher risk of bleeding, and verapamil or carvedilol via P-gp inhibition increases digoxin levels with a higher risk of digoxin toxicity.

### Calcium channel blocker-clarithromycin drug interaction did not increase the risk of nonvertebral fracture: a population-based study [^fa43c735]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Calcium channel blocker (CCB) use in elderly patients lowers blood pressure and can increase the risk of falls and fractures. These drugs are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme, and blood concentrations of these drugs may rise to harmful levels when CYP3A4 activity is inhibited. Clarithromycin is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, whereas azithromycin is not.

Objective

In older patients taking a CCB, we investigated whether coprescription of clarithromycin, compared with azithromycin, was associated with a higher risk of fracture.

Methods

This was a population-level retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada, from 2003 to 2012 of older adults (mean age = 76 years) newly prescribed clarithromycin (n = 96226) or azithromycin (n = 94083) while taking a CCB (amlodipine, nifedipine, felodipine, verapamil, diltiazem). The outcome assessed within 30 days of a new coprescription was a nonvertebral fracture.

Results

There were no differences in measured baseline characteristics between the clarithromycin and azithromycin groups. Amlodipine was the most commonly prescribed CCB (more than 50% of patients). Coprescribing clarithromycin, versus azithromycin, was not associated with a higher 30-day risk of nonvertebral fracture (124 patients of 96226 taking clarithromycin [0.13%] vs 98 patients of 94083 taking azithromycin [0.10%]; odds ratio = 1.23 [95% CI = 0.94-1.60]; P = 0.134).

Conclusions

Among older adults taking a CCB, concurrent use of clarithromycin, compared with azithromycin, was not associated with a statistically significantly greater 30-day risk of nonvertebral fracture.

### Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium (Caduet) [^76061ce1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Amlodipine may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

### Contributory risk and management of comorbidities of hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome in chronic heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^462dc94c]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Treatment of refractory hypertension in HFrEF—Most patients with advanced stage C or D HF do not manifest hypertension, and if a patient with HFrEF has refractory hypertension there are no definitive studies to guide additional antihypertensive approaches when recommended HF therapies are inadequate. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) are not recommended as routine treatment for patients with HFrEF, whereas amlodipine and felodipine neither improve nor worsen survival and a dihydropyridine group of calcium channel blockers could be used to control hypertension only after other medications have failed. There are few data on specific combinations of ≥3 drugs, so recommendations are largely empirical or anecdotal; a triple-drug regimen of an ACE inhibitor or ARB, a calcium channel blocker, and a thiazide diuretic is effective and can be well tolerated. Among β-blockers, carvedilol, 1 of the 3 β-blockers proven to reduce mortality in HF, is more effective in reducing BP than metoprolol succinate or bisoprolol and may be the β-blocker of choice in patients with HFrEF with refractory hypertension, whereas evidence with nebivolol and labetalol is very limited and they are not the β-blocker of choice for the treatment of HFrEF according to HF guidelines; experience with prazosin or clonidine is very limited and studies suggest potential adverse outcomes with these classes of agents.

### Improving vascular function in hypertension: potential benefits of combination therapy with amlodipine and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers [^931f1833]. Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Hypertension is characterized by endothelial dysfunction and increased risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. In addition to lowering blood pressure, the calcium-channel blocker amlodipine and blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers) may further reduce cardiovascular risk by improving endothelial function when used alone or in combination. In fact, the beneficial effects of the combination of amlodipine and a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blocker on endothelial function have been found to be greater than the effect of either drug alone, likely due to additive effects on nitric oxide activity. This review summarizes the observed effects of these agents on endothelial function and the complementary mechanisms by which they act, thus providing rationale (beyond blood pressure benefits) for their use in combination.

Metabolism interactions include CYP3A4 inhibitors increasing nondihydropyridine concentration with enhanced clinical effects and CYP3A4 inducers decreasing nondihydropyridine CCB concentration with reduced clinical effects. With CYP3A4 inhibition via amlodipine, verapamil, or diltiazem or other CYP3A4 inhibitors, eplerenone has increased risk of hypotension and hyperkalemia and a lowered dose when combined with diltiazem could be considered a productive interaction. Elimination and transporter interactions include thiazide-type diuretics or RAS blockers reducing lithium clearance with increased lithium toxicity risk, and reduced P-gp efflux of dabigatran increasing dabigatran levels with a higher risk of bleeding.

### Vasodilation in patients with calcium channel blocker poisoning treated with high-dose insulin: a comparison of amlodipine versus non-dihydropyridines [^57b89433]. Clinical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background: High dose insulin (HDI), an inotrope and vasodilator, is a standard therapy for calcium channel blocker (CCB) poisoning. HDI causes vasodilation by stimulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Most literature supporting HDI for CCB poisoning involves verapamil toxicity; however, amlodipine now causes more CCB poisonings. Unlike other CCBs, amlodipine stimulates eNOS and may cause synergistic vasodilation with HDI. The purpose of this study was to determine if amlodipine-poisoned patients treated with HDI had more evidence of vasodilation than similarly treated patients with non-dihydropyridine (non-DHP) poisoning. Methods: This was a retrospective study from a single poison center. Cases were identified via the generic code "Calcium Antagonists" in which the therapy "High Dose Insulin/Glucose" was "performed, whether or not recommended" from 2019-2021. Evidence of vasodilation was assessed via maximum number of vasopressor infusions per case, vasopressor doses, and use of rescue methylene blue to treat refractory vasoplegia. Results: Thirty-three patients were enrolled: 18 poisoned with amlodipine, 15 with non-DHPs (verapamil n =10, diltiazem n =5). The median number of maximum concomitant vasopressors in the amlodipine group was 3 (IQR: 2-5; range 0-6) and 2 in the non-DHP group (IQR: 1-3; range 0-5; p =0.04); median difference in maximum concomitant vasopressors between groups was 1 (95% confidence interval: 0-2). Median maximum epinephrine dosing was higher in the amlodipine group (0.31 mcg/kg/min) compared to non-DHPs (0.09 mcg/kg/min; p =0.03). Use of rescue methylene blue was more common in the amlodipine group (7/18 [39%]) than in the non-DHP group (0; p =0.009). Conclusions: Amlodipine poisoned patients treated with HDI required more vasopressors, higher doses of epinephrine, and more often received rescue methylene blue than similarly treated patients with verapamil or diltiazem poisoning. These differences suggest amlodipine-poisoned patients had more evidence of vasodilation. Further study is warranted to determine if synergistic vasodilation occurs when HDI is used to treat amlodipine poisoning.

### Brain-penetrant calcium channel blockers are associated with a reduced incidence of neuropsychiatric disorders [^3ce082ff]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Secondary analyses

Differences found between BP-CCBs and amlodipine might reflect something unique about amlodipine rather than merely its low brain penetrability, such as aspects of its channel blocking kinetics Thus, in a secondary analysis we compared people prescribed BP-CCBs with patients prescribed verapamil or diltiazem. We omitted these drugs from the primary analysis since (a) they have different clinical indications from amlodipine (i.e. they are not recommended first line for hypertension, and are contraindicated in heart failure) and hence are more likely to lead to confounding by indication, and (b) their pharmacological profiles differ from the dihydropyridines. Though the evidence regarding the brain penetrability and central effects of verapamil and diltiazem is less clear than for the dihydropyridines, we included both drugs in the non-penetrant group, in line with others.

We also conducted secondary analyses for BP-CCBs versus amlodipine separately in men and women, and based on age (under or over 60 years). Finally, we compared BP-CCBs with ARBs, given the evidence mentioned earlier that the latter group are associated with lower risks of many neuropsychiatric disorders compared to CCBs as a class. We hypothesised that this difference would be reduced, or eliminated, when the comparison was limited to BP-CCBs. The same covariates were used for the secondary analyses as for the primary comparison between BP-CCBs and amlodipine.

A STROBE document was completed (Supplementary Table 2).

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^a97b7ac8]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Calcium channel blockers in heart failure (HF)—dihydropyridines such as nifedipine have negative inotropic and vasodilating effects by blocking transmembrane calcium influx, and small trials reported marked worsening of HF with nifedipine in which 5 of 21 patients required hospitalization versus 0 of 20 with isosorbide dinitrate. In HF, amlodipine showed no evidence of a favorable or unfavorable effect on mortality (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.83–1.13; P=0.66), with higher frequencies of peripheral and pulmonary edema reported, and it may exacerbate HF. Non‑dihydropyridines diltiazem and verapamil can worsen HF; after myocardial infarction (MI), diltiazem increased adverse cardiac events in the subgroup with baseline pulmonary congestion (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.01–1.96) among 2466 total patients with 490 in the subgroup, and risk was directly related to baseline HF severity.

### Two multicenter, 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine and valsartan in combination and as monotherapy in adult patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension [^9378b79f]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with hypertension may require combination therapy to attain the blood pressure targets recommended by US and European treatment guidelines. Combination therapy with a calcium channel blocker and an angiotensin II-receptor blocker would be expected to provide enhanced efficacy.

Objectives

Two studies were conducted to compare the efficacy of various combinations of amlodipine and valsartan administered once daily with their individual components and placebo in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (mean sitting diastolic blood pressure [MSDBP] >/=95 and < 110 mm Hg). A secondary objective was to evaluate safety and tolerability.

Methods

The 2 studies were multinational, multicenter, 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials. In study 1, patients were randomized to receive amlodipine 2.5 or 5 mg once daily, valsartan 40 to 320 mg once daily, the combination of amlodipine 2.5 or 5 mg with valsartan 40 to 320 mg once daily, or placebo. In study 2, patients were randomized to receive amlodipine 10 mg once daily, valsartan 160 or 320 mg once daily, the combination of amlodipine 10 mg with valsartan 160 or 320 mg once daily, or placebo. The primary efficacy variable in both studies was change from baseline in MSDBP at the end of the study. Secondary variables included the change in mean sitting systolic blood pressure (MSSBP), response rate (the proportion of patients achieving an MSDBP <90 mm Hg or a >/= 10-mm Hg decrease from baseline), and control rate (the proportion of patients achieving an MSDBP <90 mm Hg). Safety was assessed in terms of adverse events (spontaneously reported or elicited by questioning), vital signs, and laboratory values.

Results

A total of 1911 patients were randomized to treatment in study 1 (1022 amlodipine + valsartan; 507 valsartan; 254 amlodipine; 128 placebo); 1250 were randomized to treatment in study 2 (419, 415, 207, and 209, respectively). In all treatment groups in both studies, the majority of patients were white (79.5% study 1, 79.4% study 2) and male (53.5% and 50.3%, respectively). The overall mean age was 54.4 years in study 1 and 56.9 years in study 2. The mean weight of patients in study 1 was higher than that in study 2 (88.8 vs 79.7 kg). The overall baseline mean sitting BP was 152.8/99.3 mm Hg in study 1 and 156.7/99.1 mm Hg in study 2. With the exception of a few combinations that included amlodipine 2.5 mg, the combination regimens in both studies were associated with significantly greater reductions in MSDBP and MSSBP compared with their individual components and placebo (P < 0.05). A positive dose response was observed for all combinations. The highest response rate in study 1 was associated with the highest dose of combination therapy (amlodipine 5 mg + valsartan 320 mg: 91.3%). Amlodipine 5 mg, valsartan 320 mg, and placebo were associated with response rates of 71.9%, 73.4%, and 40.9%, respectively. In study 2, the 2 doses of combination therapy were associated with similar response rates (amlodipine 10 mg + valsartan 160 mg: 88.5%; amlodipine 10 mg + valsartan 320 mg: 87.5%). Amlodipine 10 mg was associated with a response rate of 86.9%; valsartan 160 and 20 mg were associated with response rates of 74.9% and 72.0%, respectively; and placebo was associated with a response rate of 49.3%. Control rates followed a similar pattern. The incidence of peripheral edema with combination therapy was significantly lower compared with amlodipine monotherapy (5.4% vs 8.7%, respectively; P = 0.014), was significantly higher compared with valsartan monotherapy (2.1%; P < 0.001), and did not differ significantly from placebo (3.0%).

Conclusions

In these adult patients with mild to moderate hypertension, the combination of amlodipine + valsartan was associated with significantly greater blood pressure reductions from baseline compared with amlodipine or valsartan monotherapy or placebo. The incidence of peripheral edema was significantly lower with combination therapy than with amlodipine monotherapy.

### Efficacy and safety of allisartan isoproxil / amlodipine in patients with essential hypertension: a phase III, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomised study [^a63bb225]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension, defined as chronic high blood pressure, is a critical risk factor strongly associated with the incidence and mortality of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels are well-established predictors of increased risks for cardiovascular disease, angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, peripheral artery disease, and abdominal aortic aneurysm, each of which is independently significant. Globally, over 1 billion individuals currently live with uncontrolled hypertension, a number projected to rise to 1.5 billion by 2030. This alarming trend is driven by an aging population and escalating exposure to lifestyle risk factors, including poor dietary habits—marked by high sodium and low potassium intake—and sedentary behavior, leading to suboptimal blood pressure control among many hypertensive patients. In China, awareness, treatment, and control rates remain disappointingly low, with an estimated 245 million hypertensive patients in 2022. The escalating burden of hypertension and its associated cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications poses a significant and growing public health concern.

Hypertension management strategies encompass lifestyle modifications, pharmacological interventions, and device-based therapies. However, pharmacological therapy remains the cornerstone of effective blood pressure control. Commonly used antihypertensive medications comprise calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), diuretics, and β-blockers, alongside fixed-dose combinations of these agents. The Single-Pill Combination (SPC) approach represents an innovative strategy in combination therapy. System reviews have demonstrated that SPCs, which combine multiple components, improve treatment adherence and drug persistence compared to non-fixed combinations. Current European, Chinese, and American guidelines recommend the combination of ACEI/ARB with CCB as a preferred treatment strategy.

ALI, an ARB-class medication, has been positively evaluated for its antihypertensive efficacy in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. It has been shown to mitigate renal impairment associated with hypertension and exhibits exceptional tolerability among essential hypertensive populations. AML, a CCB, exerts its effectiveness by inhibiting voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels. It manifests protective effects on endothelial cell function and anti-atherosclerotic properties. Its efficacy in blood pressure management is well-established in clinical practice. AML is often used in conjunction with other antihypertensive medications, such as ACEIs, ARBs, and diuretics. Systematic reviews have shown that ACEI/ARB combinations significantly enhance metabolic and renal functions in hypertensive patients, surpassing the benefits of other dual or triple drug regimens.

### Extracorporeal treatment for calcium channel blocker poisoning: systematic review and recommendations from the EXTRIP workgroup [^5dc307b6]. Clinical Toxicology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are commonly used to treat conditions such as arterial hypertension and supraventricular dysrhythmias. Poisoning from these drugs can lead to severe morbidity and mortality. We aimed to determine the utility of extracorporeal treatments (ECTRs) in the management of CCB poisoning.

Methods

We conducted systematic reviews of the literature, screened studies, extracted data, summarized findings, and formulated recommendations following published EXTRIP methods.

Results

A total of 83 publications (6 in vitro and 1 animal experiments, 55 case reports or case series, 19 pharmacokinetic studies, 1 cohort study and 1 systematic review) met inclusion criteria regarding the effect of ECTR. Toxicokinetic or pharmacokinetic data were available on 210 patients (including 32 for amlodipine, 20 for diltiazem, and 52 for verapamil). Regardless of the ECTR used, amlodipine, bepridil, diltiazem, felodipine, isradipine, mibefradil, nifedipine, nisoldipine, and verapamil were considered not dialyzable, with variable levels of evidence, while no dialyzability grading was possible for nicardipine and nitrendipine. Data were available for clinical analysis on 78 CCB poisoned patients (including 32 patients for amlodipine, 16 for diltiazem, and 23 for verapamil). Standard care (including high dose insulin euglycemic therapy) was not systematically administered. Clinical data did not suggest an improvement in outcomes with ECTR. Consequently, the EXTRIP workgroup recommends against using ECTR in addition to standard care for patients severely poisoned with either amlodipine, diltiazem or verapamil (strong recommendations, very low quality of the evidence (1D)). There were insufficient clinical data to draft recommendation for other CCBs, although the workgroup acknowledged the low dialyzability from, and lack of biological plausibility for, ECTR.

Conclusions

Both dialyzability and clinical data do not support a clinical benefit from ECTRs for CCB poisoning. The EXTRIP workgroup recommends against using extracorporeal methods to enhance the elimination of amlodipine, diltiazem, and verapamil in patients with severe poisoning.

The verapamil or diltiazem vs amlodipine cohorts differed slightly in baseline characteristics (Table 1). However, after IPTW, all baseline characteristics were balanced with standardized differences less than 10% (eTable 5 in the Supplement). The number of events and crude event rates are reported in eTable 7 in the Supplement. Patients receiving rivaroxaban (274.8 vs 270.1 per 1000 person-years) and apixaban (159.1 vs 207.7 per 1000 person-years) had similar bleeding rates regardless of verapamil, diltiazem, or amlodipine exposure. For dabigatran, however, there were statistically significant increases in overall bleeding rates (244.9 vs 158.4 per 1000 person-years) and in the adjusted HRs of overall bleeding (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.05-2.20), overall GI bleeding (HR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.30-3.60), minor bleeding (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.07-2.27), and minor GI bleeding (HR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.29-3.63). Combined bleeding categories included large point estimates for major/moderate bleeding (HR, 2.27; 95% CI, 0.97-5.29) and major/moderate GI bleeding (HR, 2.27; 95% CI, 0.72-7.11), but the 95% CIs included the null (Table 2).

### Principal results of the controlled onset verapamil investigation of cardiovascular end points (CONVINCE) trial [^408328d7]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Hypertensive patients are often given a calcium antagonist to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, but the benefit compared with other drug classes is controversial.

Objective

To determine whether initial therapy with controlled-onset extended-release (COER) verapamil is equivalent to a physician's choice of atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide in preventing cardiovascular disease.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Double-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted at 661 centers in 15 countries. A total of 16 602 participants diagnosed as having hypertension and who had 1 or more additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease were enrolled between September 1996 and December 1998 and followed up until December 31, 2000. After a mean of 3 years of follow-up, the sponsor closed the study before unblinding the results.

Intervention

Initially, 8241 participants received 180 mg of COER verapamil and 8361 received either 50 mg of atenolol or 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. Other drugs (eg, diuretic, beta-blocker, or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) could be added in specified sequence if needed.

Main Outcome Measures

First occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular disease-related death.

Results

Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were reduced by 13.6 mm Hg and 7.8 mm Hg for participants assigned to the COER verapamil group and by 13.5 and 7.1 mm Hg for partcipants assigned to the atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide group. There were 364 primary cardiovascular disease-related events that occurred in the COER verapamil group vs 365 in atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-1.18; P =.77). For fatal or nonfatal stroke, the HR was 1.15 (95% CI, 0.90-1.48); for fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.65-1.03); and for cardiovascular disease-related death, 1.09 (95% CI, 0.87-1.37). The HR was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.95-1.16) for any prespecified cardiovascular disease-related event and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.93-1.26) for all-cause mortality. Nonstroke hemorrhage was more common with participants in the COER-verapamil group (n = 118) compared with the atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide group (n = 79) (HR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.16-2.04]; P =.003). More cardiovascular disease-related events occurred between 6 AM and noon in both the COER verapamil (99/277) and atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide (88/274) groups; HR, 1.15 (95% CI, 0.86-1.53).

Conclusions

The CONVINCE trial did not demonstrate equivalence of a COER verapamil-based antihypertensive regimen compared with a regimen beginning with a diuretic or beta-blocker. When considered in the context of other trials of calcium antagonists, these data indicate that the effectiveness of calcium-channel therapy in reducing cardiovascular disease is similar but not better than diuretic or beta-blocker treatment.

### Multi-organ dysfunction as a presentation of calcium channel blocker intoxication [^cbb6c7d9]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine CCB, which is widely available and has a variety of indicated usages. It is highly protein bound, has a large volume of distribution and a half-life of 30–50 hours.Dihydropyridines preferentially block the L-type calcium channels in the peripheral vasculature. At standard doses, these medications are potent vasodilators, but have little negative inotropic or chronotropic effect. In comparison, standard doses of the non-dihydropyridines, verapamil and diltiazem, selectively block L-type calcium channels in the myocardium leading to reduced cardiac conduction and contractility with weak vasodilatory effects.

Dihydropyridine intoxication initially results in arterial vasodilation and reflex tachycardia, but as doses increase receptor selectivity is lost. At toxic levels, dihydropyridines may negatively affect the myocardium and cardiac conduction system leading to decreased inotropy, bradycardia and heart block. Amlodipine toxicity induced-atrioventricular conduction disturbances range from prolonged PR intervals to complete atrioventricular dissociation with accelerated junctional rhythm. Additionally, CCBs selectively dilate the afferent branch of capillary networks which, in states of preserved or increased blood flow, may lead to oedema formation including non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (NCPE). A cohort study, by Erik et al, investigated amlodipine poisoning and found an incidence of 47% of NCPE of the whole cohort and 64% who did not go on to develop complete haemodynamic collapse.

### Everolimus rescues the phenotype of elastin insufficiency in patient induced pluripotent stem cell-derived vascular smooth muscle cells [^e5c8b712]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Other Drug Classes Are Less Effective Than mTOR Inhibitors in EI SMCs

CCBs are widely used to treat hypertension in patients with EI but their effect on SMC phenotype and function has not been systematically evaluated in patients with EI. Of the CCBs tested, verapamil and diltiazem rescued the differentiation and proliferation defects but only in patients with WS, not in elastin mutation patients. Also, CCBs did not rescue the poor response to endothelin. Additionally, amlodipine was associated with increased cell death. Although the mechanism of cell toxicity requires further study, this finding raises concerns about the appropriateness of clinical use of amlodipine as an antihypertensive agent in patients with EI. All the other drug classes tested only had antiproliferative effects and did not improve SMC differentiation and were, therefore, not considered candidates for further study. In addition, combination treatment with everolimus and verapamil was not superior than treatment with everolimus alone even in the everolimus-unresponsive WS3 cells suggesting an absence of synergy between these 2 drug classes.

Although treatment with everolimus significantly rescued the in vitro SMC phenotypes, evidence for efficacy will require a clinical trial in patients with EI with vascular stenoses, administered systemically or as drug-eluting stents in areas of discrete stenoses. Everolimus has a well-established safety profile with therapeutic blood levels maintained using therapeutic drug monitoring.Side-effects can be further minimized with targeted delivery using drug-eluting stents. As other novel treatment options emerge,their ability to rescue SMC phenotypes can be evaluated in our iPSC-derived patient SMCs, especially for efficacy in patient SMCs that fail to respond to everolimus.

Overall, these data confirm the effectiveness of mTOR inhibitors in general, and of everolimus in particular, as a best in class drug with potential for rescuing the vascular SMC phenotype in patients with EI. Although mTOR inhibitors are used clinically in drug-eluting stents to prevent and treat restenosis in adult coronary artery disease and systemically in children and adults to treat transplant coronary artery disease, – our findings suggest that vascular stenoses caused by EI may respond better to everolimus. Since elastin variants may influence the vascular phenotype in patients with acquired vascular disorders, our study highlights the importance of assessing the underlying molecular basis of vascular disease to select the most effective mTOR inhibitor and identifies everolimus as an attractive candidate for repurposing to treat vascular stenosis in EI.

### Association between use of pharmacokinetic-interacting drugs and effectiveness and safety of direct acting oral anticoagulants: nested case-control study [^ff99147e]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

In the current study, bleeding risk associated with verapamil was apparent in dabigatran and rivaroxaban users, and risk associated with amiodarone was apparent in rivaroxaban users. Verapamil and amiodarone are both strong P‐gp inhibitors.Our findings are consistent with the variable susceptibility of the three DOACs to P‐gp mediated transport. It has been shown in cell lines that dabigatran uses predominantly P‐gp‐dependent transport; rivaroxaban uses P‐gp as well as the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) for transport; and preferential BCRP‐dependent transport is used by apixaban.Verapamil and amiodarone do not inhibit BCRP transport.Thus, from our results, it seems likely that the clinically important pharmacokinetic inhibition of DOACs by widely used drugs occur with P‐gp inhibition. Interestingly, amlodipine, a P‐gp inhibitor was not associated with bleeding risk, and was associated with lower risk for bleeding (adjusted OR 0.80 (0.64–1.01)), which might be explained by its potency in reducing blood pressure (the latter associated with reduced intracranial bleeding risk).Bisoprolol, a beta‐receptor blocker, used by ~ 50% of patients in our AF cohort, was not previously associated with bleeding risk. Bisoprolol does not show on the lists as P‐gp or CYP3A4 inhibitor but is known to be metabolized partly by CYP3A4 (and partly by CYP2D6).,

### Prior medications and the cardiovascular benefits from combination angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition plus calcium channel blockade among high-risk hypertensive patients [^4131d573]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Antihypertensive therapy is well established to reduce the adverse cardiovascular consequences of high blood pressure (BP). 1 The overall evidence supports that the degree of BP lowering is the major determinant of the health benefits. 1 Guidelines, therefore, emphasize the importance of controlling BP as the preeminent goal. 2, 3 In this regard, it is important to acknowledge that most hypertensive patients (eg, 75%) require ≥2 antihypertensive medications to achieve BP targets. 4 As such, the most germane issue to explore in guiding present‐day clinical practice is which combination of medications (rather than what single agent) provides optimal cardiovascular protection. 5 Although most patients in clinical trials were taking >1 antihypertensive medication, 1 only the ACCOMPLISH (Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension) trial was designed to investigate the comparative cardiovascular risk reductions derived from 2 prespecified combination regimens prescribed as initial therapy. 6 The study was terminated early (mean follow‐up, 36 months) because of the superiority of benazepril+amlodipine compared with benazepril+hydrochlorothiazide for preventing the primary composite outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72–0.90; P <0.001). Subsequent analyses showed that this benefit occurred among patients with coronary artery disease 7 and diabetes mellitus, 8 was superior for preventing adverse renal outcomes, 9 and was not likely a consequence of subtle BP differences between groups (ambulatory BP monitoring). 10

### Prior medications and the cardiovascular benefits from combination angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition plus calcium channel blockade among high-risk hypertensive patients [^289e1ceb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

We are aware of only 1 prior analysis from a major hypertension trial (VALUE [Valsartan Antihypertensive Long‐Term Use Evaluation]) in which the impact on study outcomes was evaluated in relation to prior BP‐lowering treatment regimens. 15 As with the ACCOMPLISH trial, most study patients (92%) had been receiving antihypertensive therapy before entering the VALUE trial. In accordance with our findings, the study end points were not differentially affected by prior medications. This is a particularly relevant issue for contemporary clinical practice because most patients among modern trials had been already undergoing treatment with medications. 1

We acknowledge that our results derive from post hoc observational analyses and, as such, must be considered hypothesis generating. Nevertheless, the consistency of responses favoring benazepril+amlodipine among all subgroups supports the overall veracity of our overarching contention. In addition, our findings only directly apply to high‐risk individuals given the characteristics of the patients in ACCOMPLISH. 6 Whether the results can be extrapolated to other and lower‐risk patients is unknown; however, recent evidence supports that medical treatment is likely beneficial, even for low‐risk patients with mild hypertension. 1 Positive findings in our study were observed in patients previously taking several single BP‐lowering medications and those with a systolic/diastolic BP of <140/90 mm Hg, supporting the hypothesis that even individuals with milder forms of high BP may benefit from benazepril+amlodipine. The average on‐treatment BP in the ACCOMPLISH trial was <140/90 mm Hg. Thus, any speculations of the merits of initiating combination therapy with benazepril+amlodipine implicitly presume that this regimen is capable of keeping BP controlled (alone or with additional agents as needed). This is particularly important given the recent results of the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), which also supports a lower systolic BP target (120 mm Hg) than previously espoused. 16 Patients were allocated to a subgroup on the basis of the medications they were taking right at study enrollment. The duration they had been treated with these agents, prior medication use in the years beforehand, and their adherence to this regimen remain unknown. However, because most subgroups derived similar relative benefits from benazepril+amlodipine, it is not likely that any unaccounted for changing of prior medications between the various regimens in the months to years before entering the trial would have differentially affected the treatment effects of the combination therapy regimens used in the ACCOMPLISH trial in a manner that explains our current findings. Finally, we were not able to explain the significantly greater benefit of benazepril+amlodipine in the ACEI+CCB subgroup (Table 3). It remains possible that unaccounted for factors (ie, not listed in Table 4) could have led to a propensity to receive ACEI+CCB combination and, thus, explains the greater benefit in this 1 subgroup.

### Initial angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor / calcium channel blocker combination therapy achieves superior blood pressure control compared with calcium channel blocker monotherapy in patients with stage 2 hypertension [^e2e6d763]. American Journal of Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee (JNC 7) on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommends initial combination therapy for patients whose blood pressure (BP) is >20/10 mm Hg above goal. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of initial combination therapy versus that of monotherapy in patients with stage 2 hypertension, who by definition meet the JNC 7 recommendation for initial combination antihypertensive therapy.

Methods

This multicenter, double-blind, 12-week study randomized 364 patients with stage 2 hypertension to fixed-dose combination therapy with amlodipine besylate/benazepril HCl (5/20 mg/d titrated to 10/20 mg/d) or amlodipine besylate monotherapy (5 mg/d titrated to 10 mg/d).

Results

Significantly more patients randomized to combination therapy (74.2%) compared with those randomized to monotherapy (53.9%; P <.0001) achieved the primary end point (reductions in systolic BP > or =25 mm Hg, if baseline systolic BP was <180 mm Hg, or > or =32 mm Hg, if baseline systolic BP was > or =180 mm Hg). Significantly more patients randomized to combination therapy compared with monotherapy attained BP goals of <140/90 mm Hg (61.0% v 43.3%; P =.0007) and < or =130/85 mm Hg (35.7% v 19.1%; P =.0004). Among patients with baseline systolic BP > or =180 mm Hg, combination therapy resulted in significantly greater reductions in systolic BP compared with monotherapy (-42.3 v -30.4 mm Hg; P =.001). More than 90% of patients in each group were titrated to the higher dose. Both treatments were well tolerated.

Conclusions

Combination therapy was well tolerated and resulted in significantly greater BP reductions and attainment of BP goals compared with monotherapy in patients with stage 2 hypertension. This evidence supports the recommendation of combination therapy as first-line treatment in stage 2 hypertension.

### Association of oral anticoagulants and verapamil or diltiazem with adverse bleeding events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and normal kidney function [^635ee894]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Results

There were a total of 48 442 patients receiving new DOAC therapy with a diagnosis of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation identified during the study period from 2010 to 2015 (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). After consideration of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the cohorts included 1764 patients receiving DOACs with verapamil or diltiazem compared with 3105 patients receiving DOACs with amlodipine. Adjusted event rates and 95% CIs are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. There were 1793 patients receiving DOACs with verapamil or diltiazem compared with 3224 patients receiving DOACs with metoprolol. These cohort numbers differed slightly due to exclusion of prior medication users. Among all patients, DOAC use overall was approximately 40% for both dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban and 20% for apixaban, which was similarly distributed among all treatment groups. Characteristics differed based on the cohort. Most (approximately 60%) of the cohorts identified were younger than 65 years and male depending on the specific comparison. Comorbidities were prevalent in the population, including diabetes (>25%), hypertension (80%), hypercholesterolemia (>60%), and heart disease (>25%). Approximately 40% of the cohort had a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 4 or greater and 70% to 75% had a HAS-BLED score between 0 and 2.

One clinical trial, the International Verapamil‐Trandolapril Study (INVEST), looked first at a CCB strategy versus a non‐CCB strategy for lowering BP in people ≥60 years with CVD. 44 Because both treatment strategies led to >70% of patients achieving BP <140/90 mm Hg within the follow‐up period of 24 months, all patients were combined for a post‐hoc analysis looking at optimal treatment targets. All patients were split into 3 groups based on their SBP: group 1, <140 mm Hg (57%); group 2, 140 to <150 mm Hg (21%); and group 3, ≥150 mm Hg (22%). These groups achieved a median SBP of 131, 144, and 158 mm Hg, respectively, and a multiple propensity score–adjusted model was created to adjust for the baseline differences between the groups.

Calcium Channel Blockers

Seven calcium channel blockers were studied in 14 trials. – Nicardipine and nifedipine were the most commonly studied (three trials,, and four trials,,,, respectively). Isradipine and lacidipine each had two studies, –,, and amlodipine, nitrendipine, and verapamil each had one study. –

Amlodipine (5 or 10 mg PO) was evaluated in one small (n = 46) retrospective cohort.Both doses significantly reduced the MAP at 1 h (from 140 and 148 to 103 and 131, respectively). No side effects were reported. Isradipine was investigated in two trials, one a prospective cohortand the other an RCT,which found that PO doses ranging from 1.25 to 5 mg reduced SBP from 196–204 to 155–165 at 2 h. Reported side effects with isradipine were dizziness and nausea. In four trials,,,, lacidipine (4 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg), in SLl or PO formulations, significantly reduced SBP, from 238–186 to 178–145, over 2–24 h. Four trials of nicardipine in various formulations significantly reduced SBP over 1–2 h, from 186–238 to 161–163. Reported side effects from nicardipine were mild headache, hypotension, orthostasis, chest pain, and tachycardia. In single trials, nitrendipine 5 mg PO (n = 85) reduced SBP from 228 to 156 over 2–8 h,and verapamil SL reduced SBP significantly over 1–2 h, with 80 mg more effective than 40 mg. Reported side effects with verapamil were decreased heart rate and headache.

ACE Inhibitors

There were nine trials of ace inhibitors (one retrospective cohort,two prospective cohorts,, five RCTs,, – one non-randomized controlled trial). All used captopril in doses ranging from 6.25 to 25 mg in both PO and SL formulations. SBP values were reduced from 244–198 to 177–144 at 0.17–12 h of captopril administration, with greater BP reduction seen using higher doses (25 mg).

Side effects reported with captopril were dizziness, headache, nausea and vomiting,dry mouth, vertigo,and flushing.

### Probable amlodipine-induced angioedema [^b4216892]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of angioedema likely associated with amlodipine administration in a patient with a right thalamic hemorrhagic stroke.

Case Summary

A 50-year-old female experienced angioedema during hospitalization for a right thalamic hemorrhagic stroke. She had no past history of angioedema and all of her medications were assessed for risk of angioedema. After careful evaluation, case reports linking calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and angioedema led to further examination of amlodipine as a cause. Amlodipine therapy had been initiated 24 hours prior to the development of angioedema, which then resolved 72 hours after discontinuation of the drug. In total, the patient experienced oropharyngeal swelling for 10 days.

Discussion

In determining a cause for the patient's angioedema we eliminated genetic, allergic, physically induced, thyroid autoimmune disease-associated, and medication-induced causes. Three case reports describing 7 patients have linked the CCBs verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine with angioedema. The onset and resolution of symptoms in our patient were very similar to those seen in other case reports. Application of the Naranjo probability scale found a probable link between amlodipine and angioedema.

Conclusions

Although few reports of CCB-induced angioedema exist, to our knowledge, this is the first reported case to suggest a link between angioedema and amlodipine therapy. Clinicians should consider amlodipine as a potential cause of angioedema.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^4228ae57]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

A strength of the PATHWAY studies is the use of home BP monitoring as the primary outcome measure. Measured over a number of days and averaged, this value is a better prognostic marker of cardiovascular disease than clinic pressure and avoids misclassification due to the “white coat effect” seen with clinic measures. 33 Although some guidelines now recommend 24 ambulatory blood pressure measurements for initial diagnosis, this is not a practical alternative to HBPM for routine monitoring of treatment, and within a trial environment, the use of serial ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for primary outcome measurements can compromise power by increasing dropout rates. In addition to use of HBPM, we conducted a substudy assessing LV mass. Consistent with the large reductions in BP over phases 1 and 2 in the combination therapy group and over phase 2 in the monotherapy group, our substudy found >10% reduction in LV mass, which compares favorably with the reduction seen in other studies. 18 The absence of difference in LV mass between groups confirms rejection of the never‐catch‐up hypothesis and the rapidity with which cardiovascular risk (for which LV mass is the best surrogate) can be reversed by good BP control.

The British Hypertension Society Research Network took a lead role in the design of ACCELERATE (Aliskiren and the Calcium Channel blocker Amlodipine combination as an initial treatment strategy for hypertension control), 9 a previous trial addressing questions similar to those in PATHWAY‐1. That study was unable to address the question of individual variability and recruited a high proportion of patients on multiple previous drugs. We aimed this time at 50% of naïve patients and achieved 45%, which is rare in studies of this size; the remaining patients had received just 1 previous drug class. Taken together, the present study and the ACCELERATE study 9 provide a reasonable basis to suggest that the benefits of combination therapy over monotherapy are generalizable. The present study used losartan and HCTZ, whereas ACCELERATE used aliskiren and amlodipine, and both studies demonstrated the superiority of initial treatment with combination therapy. Many combination tablets cost no more than the single components. Whether further reduction of BP by combination therapy is cost‐effective and advantageous in the 40% of patients at target on monotherapy is a matter of current interest on which forthcoming guidelines are likely to have a view. 34 Initial combination may be favored by those who consider undertreatment to be a more prevalent problem than overtreatment.

Drug-Drug Interactions

Drug Interactions: Effects of other drugs on 
verapamil pharmacokinetics

In vitro metabolic studies indicate 
that verapamil is metabolized by cytochrome P450, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2C. 
Clinically significant interactions have been reported with inhibitors of CYP3A4 
(eg, erythromycin, ritonavir) causing elevation of plasma levels of verapamil 
while inducers of CYP3A4 (eg, rifampin) have caused a lowering of plasma levels 
of verapamil. Hypotension, bradyarrhythmias, and lactic acidosis have been 
observed in patients receiving concurrent telithromycin, an antibiotic in the 
ketolide class of antibiotics.

Beta Blockers

Concomitant therapy with beta-adrenergic blockers and verapamil 
may result in additive negative effects on heart rate, atrioventricular 
conduction, and/or cardiac contractility. The combination of sustained-release 
verapamil and beta-adrenergic blocking agents has not been studied. However, 
there have been reports of excess bradycardia and AV block, including complete 
heart block, when the combination has been used for the treatment of 
hypertension.

For hypertensive patients, the risk of combined therapy may outweigh the 
potential benefits. The combination should be used only with caution and close 
monitoring.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^05992a47]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Management of hypertension in diabetes and chronic kidney disease—Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, when used to treat hypertension in the absence of ACE inhibitors or ARBs, are less effective than other agents in slowing progression of DKD. (Strong) Numerous studies have shown that dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are less efficacious than ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in reducing albuminuria in DKD, and IDNT showed that the dihydropyridine amlodipine was less effective in slowing kidney disease progression than the ARB irbesartan. ALLHAT showed no detrimental effect of amlodipine compared with lisinopril or chlorthalidone on GFR decline or onset of kidney failure in type 2 diabetes when each agent was given separately. When reduction of proteinuria and albuminuria is a therapeutic goal, it was the opinion of the Work Group that dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should not be used in DKD in the absence of concurrent RAS inhibition; however, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers probably can be used safely in patients taking an ACE inhibitor or an ARB.

Antihypertensive regimen comparison

Hypertension patients aged 50–79 years were eligible if their BP was 140–179/90–109 mm Hg at randomization after a 2-weeks run-in period. All patients had to have at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor, indicated by a history of stroke; myocardial infarction (MI); stable angina pectoris; underwent coronary artery angioplasty at least 3 months earlier; transient ischaemic attack; cardiac insufficiency (NYHA class II); peripheral vascular disease, controlled type 2 diabetes; mild or moderate chronic nephropathy (urine albumin >300 mg per 24 h, or blood creatinine >1.5 mg per 100 ml or >133 μmol l −1); overweight (body mass index >25 kg m −2), or obesity or abdominal obesity (waist circumference: male ⩾85 cm, female ⩾80 cm); abnormal blood lipid levels (total cholesterol (TC) >5.7 mmol l −1, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) <1.0 mmol l −1, triglycerides >1.76 mmol l −1); family history of premature cardiovascular disease (onset before 50 years of age); age ⩾65 years; current cigarette smoker; left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH); intimal thickening or atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid arteries; hypertensive fundus oculi grade III–IV or retinal atherosclerosis grade III–IV.

BP was measured on three visits, 1 week apart, and mean values were calculated. The diagnosis of arterial hypertension was based upon elevations of either systolic (>140 mm Hg) or diastolic (>90 mm Hg) BP.

Patients with any of the following conditions were excluded from this study: secondary hypertension; history of cerebrovascular events or MI within 3 months before registration; severe cardiomyopathy or significant valvular disease; unstable angina; severe liver disease or nephropathy (alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation >2 × ULN or serum creatinine >2.5 mg per 100 ml); malignant tumor; gout; pregnancy or women not using contraceptives; uncontrolled diabetes (fasting plasma glucose >10 mmol l −1, despite therapy); known allergies or contraindications to study drugs; considered to be unsuitable for participation in the clinical trial according to the investigator's opinion.

Lipid-lowering comparison

All subjects were eligible for the antihypertensive regimen comparison, and their serum cholesterol at screening was 4.0–6.1 mmol l −1. Patients were excluded if they had definite and specific indication for, or contraindication to, treatment with statin, an obvious hepatic dysfunction or unwillingness to cooperate.

### Which patients benefit the most from the perindopril / amlodipine combination [^2f4f12ae]. Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Fixed-dose combinations have been strongly endorsed by European guidelines for first-line and second-line treatment of hypertension. Among recommended combinations, that of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker stands out because the mechanisms of action of these two therapeutic classes are complementary, leading to enhanced efficacy. In the large multicentre ASCOT-BPLA trial, treatment based on the combination of amlodipine and perindopril significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular and all-cause death, stroke, coronary events and procedures, new-onset diabetes, and new-onset renal impairment in a wide range of patients with hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors, when compared with atenolol/thiazide-based therapy. The perindopril/amlodipine single-pill combination was developed based on guideline recommendations for combination treatment, the indications of each component, and ASCOT-BPLA trial data. Several studies in real-life settings show that a wide range of hypertensive patients, including everyday hypertensives with common risk factors, would benefit from the perindopril/amlodipine combination.

### Prior medications and the cardiovascular benefits from combination angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition plus calcium channel blockade among high-risk hypertensive patients [^b93163fa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Implications

Taken together with previous ACCOMPLISH trial results, 6 our current findings add support to the contention that high‐risk hypertensive patients will likely benefit, or at the least will not be harmed, by converting their BP‐lowering regimen to combination therapy using benazepril+amlodipine. This applies to diabetic patients, patients with coronary heart disease, and those at risk for adverse renal outcomes. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 In the present analysis, even individuals with controlled hypertension (ie, systolic BP of <140 mm Hg) or taking only a single antihypertensive agent benefitted (or trended towards benefit).

Greater BP‐lowering efficacy of benazepril+amlodipine is unlikely to explain its superiority because 24‐hour ambulatory levels did not differ between treatment limbs in a subgroup analysis (n=573) of participants in the ACCOMPLISH trial. 10 We have previously reviewed several hypotheses, including therapeutic reasons (eg, reduced drug‐related adverse effects and better compliance) and biological mechanisms (eg, greater central aortic BP lowering), plausibly responsible for the greater cardiovascular risk reduction derived from initial combination therapy using benazepril+amlodipine as opposed to other regimens. 5 Nevertheless, the underlying explanation(s) for these current findings and the main ACCOMPLISH trial results must remain speculative at the present time.

The evidence from several trials 11, 12 and observational analyses 13 supports that starting a 2‐drug regimen (ie, “initial” combination therapy) rather than a single antihypertensive agent cannot only achieve more rapid and superior BP control, 4 but may also lead to better cardiovascular outcomes. 14 These prior studies demonstrated the benefits of initial combination therapy in a variety of regimens. Given the superiority of benazepril+amlodipine versus benazepril+hydrochlorothiazide (even among patients taking at least 2 BP medications 6), we posit that initial combination therapy specifically with RAS blockade plus CCB (when clinically appropriate and not contraindicated) may be an even more effective management strategy for the prevention of cardiovascular events than estimated by prior combination therapy studies. 11, 12, 13, 14

### Combination therapy for hypertension [^ba5c879e]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Two or more drugs are needed to control blood pressure in the majority of patients with hypertension. The most commonly used combinations include a diuretic; however, results of two large, controlled trials show that better cardiovascular protection is provided by a combination of a renin-angiotensin inhibitor and a long-acting calcium-channel blocker than combinations that include a diuretic.

Results

The characteristics of the overall ACCOMPLISH trial cohort (n=11 506) have been previously described. 6 Table 1 presents the results separated into 2 subgroups: the primary subgroup (n=4475) versus “all other participants” (n=6975 individuals not receiving a regimen containing an RAS blocker plus either a diuretic or CCB on enrollment). There were 56 participants not taking any BP medication on enrollment into the trial who were not included in our current study, giving us a total sample size of 11 450. There were some small, but statistically significant, differences in characteristics between subgroups. However, this is not relevant in regard to the objectives of this study, which aimed to assess the efficacy of benazepril+amlodipine in both groups, irrespective of potential differences in characteristics.

### Treatment of hypertension in patients > or = 65 years of age: experience with amlodipine [^46a8607f]. Clinical Therapeutics (2000). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a common finding in patients > or =65 years of age that contributes to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but many patients are untreated or their hypertension inadequately controlled. Recent randomized controlled studies have demonstrated the benefits of treating hypertension in the elderly.

Objective

This study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine, a long-acting calcium channel blocker, in elderly (> or =65 years of age) patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 114 mm Hg).

Methods

This was an open-label, multicenter, 10-week, general-practice study involving patients >18 years of age. Patients with malignant or secondary hypertension or unstable angina were excluded, as were those who had experienced an acute myocardial infarction or stroke in the preceding 3 months or had been treated with an alpha-blocker in the preceding 6 months. Patients were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment schedules: amlodipine monotherapy or combination therapy and amlodipine given once daily in the morning or in the evening. Approximately 50% of patients would receive a morning dose, and approximately 80% would receive amlodipine as monotherapy. The paired t test was used to assess the significance of differences from baseline values, with significance set at P < 0.05.

Results

A total of 5135 patients received amlodipine and were included in the tolerability analysis. Of these, 3511 of 3628 patients (96.8%) <65 years and 1471 of 1507 patients (97.6%) > or =65 years (including 336 of 349 [96.3%] > or =75 years) were included in the efficacy analysis. Significant reductions (P < 0.05) in blood pressure were noted in all groups after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. The equivalence of efficacy in all age groups was seen in terms of reduction in blood pressure (reduction of 21/15 mm Hg in patients <65 years of age, 25/16 mm Hg in those > or =65 years of age, and 26/17 mm Hg in those > or =75 years of age) compared with baseline. Therapy was successful in 2878 patients (82.0%) <65 years of age, in 1238 patients (84.2%) > or =65 years of age, and in 284 patients (84.5%) > or =75 years of age. The incidence of adverse events was similar in all age groups (18.0%, <65 years; 22.3%, > or =65 years; and 24.1%, > or =75 years), with no statistically significant differences between groups. Tolerability was rated as good or excellent in all patients, with no significant differences between groups.

Conclusions

Once-daily amlodipine was effective in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension in this patient population and demonstrated a low frequency of adverse events, a high degree of tolerability, and improved well-being. Morning rather than evening dosing appeared to confer a slight advantage.

### Prior medications and the cardiovascular benefits from combination angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition plus calcium channel blockade among high-risk hypertensive patients [^1e3fb3b9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

As with most contemporary trials, 1 most patients (97.1%) entering into the ACCOMPLISH trial had already been receiving antihypertensive therapy. 6 Hence, the main conclusion of the study can most accurately be stated as follows: switching treated hypertensive individuals to initial combination therapy composed of benazepril+amlodipine rather than benazepril+hydrochlorothiazide is more effective for preventing cardiovascular events. Because of this high rate of background therapies, it is important to evaluate if the characteristics of the prior regimens had a modifying effect on study outcomes. For example, some medication(s) may have differed in reducing baseline cardiovascular risk (eg, superior 24‐hour BP control and fewer adverse metabolic actions) and could have, thereby, plausibly affected the capacity for the ensuing randomized treatments to differentially provide cardiovascular protection. The principal aim of this post hoc observational analysis was to determine if combination therapy using benazepril+amlodipine conveys a significant risk reduction on the primary composite end point in a subgroup of patients who had already been taking a drug regimen similar to either of the treatment limbs allocated in the trial (“primary subgroup”): renin‐angiotensin system (RAS) blockade plus either a thiazide‐type diuretic or any calcium channel blocker (CCB) alone or as part of their antihypertensive regimen. This is a clinically relevant question because both combination therapy regimens remain recommended approaches by guidelines 2, 3 and are considered rational pharmacological strategies 4 commonly used in present‐day practice. In secondary analyses, we explored if prior use of other antihypertensive regimens, background lipid‐lowering therapy, or previous BP control status may have modified the benefits derived from allocation to benazepril+amlodipine.

### Comparative efficacy and safety profile of amlodipine 5 mg / losartan 50 mg fixed-dose combination and amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy in hypertensive patients who respond poorly to amlodipine 5 mg monotherapy: an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind phase III noninferiority study [^516849f4]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The number of hypertensive patients achieving treatment targets is not ideal with therapies that engage a single mechanism of action, and combination therapies using different mechanisms of action can increase drug efficacy in a synergistic way.

Objective

This noninferiority study compared the clinical efficacy and safety profile of fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/losartan 5/50 mg and amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy in essential hypertensive patients who respond poorly to amlodipine 5 mg monotherapy.

Methods

This was a double-blind, multicenter, randomized trial of hypertensive patients (N = 185) aged ≥18 years taking amlodipine 5 mg during the run-in treatment period but failed to achieve sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) <90 mm Hg. After randomization into the amlodipine/losartan 5/50 mg fixed-dose combination group (n = 92) and the amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy group (n = 93), treatment was maintained without dose escalation for 8 weeks. The noninferiority margin was prespecified as 4 mm Hg after 8 weeks of treatment for the difference of the average change in DBP between treatments. The primary efficacy evaluation of noninferiority was tested using a confidence interval approach with a 97.5% 1-sided lower confidence limit using the average difference in DBP measured at baseline and 8 weeks.

Results

After 8 weeks, the DBP of both groups decreased from baseline by 8.9 (6.1) and 9.4 (7.5) mm Hg, respectively (difference = -0.5 [6.9] mm Hg, 95% CI: -2.5 to 1.5). Secondary end points of reductions in DBP after 4 weeks (-8.1 [6.7] vs -9.9 [7.3] mm Hg, difference = -1.8 mm Hg, 95% CI: -3.9 to 0.2) and sitting systolic blood pressure after 4 (-10.2 [11.8] vs -12.8 [10.2] mm Hg, difference = -2.6 mm Hg, 95% CI: -5.9 to 0.6) and 8 weeks (-12.2 [11.0] vs -13.4 [11.3] mm Hg, difference = -1.2 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.4 to 2.1) were comparable between the 2 treatment groups. There were 38 adverse events in 20 patients (21.7%) in the amlodipine/losartan 5/50 mg fixed-dose combination group and 31 in 24 patients (26.1%) in the amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy group; most were mild. There were 7 adverse events in 6 patients (6.5%) related to treatment in the fixed-dose combination group and 13 in 10 patients (10.9%) in the monotherapy group (P = 0.30).

Conclusions

Fixed-dose combination amlodipine/losartan 5/50 mg was not inferior in terms of reductions in DBP after 8 weeks of treatment and had comparable safety profile to amlodipine 10 mg in patients who did not respond to amlodipine 5 mg monotherapy. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00940667.

### Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^d140c972]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (e.g., patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

 Limitation of Use 

Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablet is not indicated for the initial therapy of hypertension [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

• Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablet is a combination tablet of amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (DHP CCB), valsartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic. Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes, and myocardial infarctions. (1)

Effects of BP-CCB versus amlodipine on a subsequent neuropsychiatric diagnosis

In this analysis, we only included patients who had at least one prior psychiatric or neurodegenerative diagnosis before first exposure to a CCB. After matching, these cohorts contained 17,896 patients (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 3A). As shown in panel B of Table 2, there was a minimally lower incidence of most diagnoses during the exposure period for patients prescribed BP-CCBs compared to amlodipine (71.6% vs. 72.6%), with an overall risk ratio of 0.99 [0.97–0.99]. The only risk ratio of note for an individual disorder was for psychotic disorder (RR = 0.83 [0.74–0.94]).

Secondary analyses

We repeated the analyses, comparing BP-CCBs with a group comprising patients prescribed either verapamil or diltiazem, both non-penetrant non-dihydropyridine CCBs (Table 3 and Supplementary Table 3B). Results were broadly similar as for the comparison with amlodipine, with the exception of dementia, for which BP-CCBs showed a similar incidence as verapamil/diltiazem in those with no prior diagnosis, and a higher incidence in those with a prior diagnosis (Table 4).

### Long-term management of the successful adult liver transplant: 2012 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^05634732]. Liver Transplantation (2013). Medium credibility.

Adult liver transplant (LT) recipients—hypertension management and first-line agents are detailed as follows: In LT recipients with systemic hypertension, it is prudent to target a blood pressure treatment goal of 130/80 mm Hg, and the treatment of hypertension should aim for a target goal of 130/80 mm Hg with a combination of lifestyle modifications and pharmacological agents as appropriate (grade 1, level A). Immunosuppression leading to hypertension should be minimized; lifestyle modifications (including weight loss and dietary salt restriction) and home blood pressure measurement are encouraged, with antihypertensive medications introduced if these measures do not achieve the goal. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and direct renin inhibitors should be used as first-line antihypertensive therapy in LT recipients with diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and/or significant proteinuria (grade 1, level A), with monitoring of potassium when these drugs are used with calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) such as tacrolimus. Calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine and nifedipine may be more effective; non-dihydropyridine agents (verapamil and diltiazem) should be used with caution because they may increase CNI bioavailability, beta-blockers are equally as effective as calcium channel blockers, thiazide or loop diuretics should be used with caution, and combination therapy may be required to control blood pressure.

### 2022 ESC / ERS guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension [^d0c133d6]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)—calcium channel blocker (CCB) therapy after acute vasoreactivity testing: Patients with PAH who respond favourably to acute vasoreactivity testing may respond to treatment with high-dose CCBs, but less than 10% of patients with IPAH, HPAH, or PAH are responders. Patients treated with CCBs should be closely followed with a complete reassessment after 3–6 months of therapy, including right heart catheterization (RHC), and additional acute vasoreactivity testing should be performed at re-evaluation. A satisfactory chronic response presents with WHO functional class (WHO-FC) I/II and marked haemodynamic improvement—ideally, mPAP <30 mmHg and PVR <4 WU—while on CCB therapy; in the absence of a satisfactory response, additional PAH therapy should be instituted, and in some cases a combination with approved PAH drugs is required because of clinical deterioration with CCB withdrawal. The CCBs predominantly used are nifedipine, diltiazem, and amlodipine; amlodipine and felodipine are increasingly used due to long half-life and good tolerability, and common adverse events are systemic hypotension and peripheral oedema.
