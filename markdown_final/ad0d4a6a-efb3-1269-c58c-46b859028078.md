## Question

Develop plan for hypertensive emergency

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking me to develop a plan for hypertensive emergency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing hypertensive emergency from hypertensive urgency. Then, I should verify the immediate disposition and monitoring requirements. Next, I will consider first-hour blood pressure targets and the principle of controlled, partial reduction. After that, I need to select parenteral agents tailored to comorbidities and organ involvement. Then, I should outline the 2–6 hour and 24–48 hour phases, including oral transition and secondary evaluation. Finally, I will address special populations, documentation, and quality metrics, and I will double-check areas where evidence is weak or controversial before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions based on a number alone. Hypertensive emergency requires severe hypertension, typically systolic blood pressure greater than 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure greater than 120 mmHg, plus evidence of acute target organ damage such as neurologic deficits, acute heart failure with pulmonary edema, acute coronary syndrome, acute kidney injury, retinal hemorrhages or papilledema, or aortic dissection, so I need to check for these systematically before labeling an emergency [^82ca87a2] [^cffc3dc7].

> Hold on, let's not conflate hypertensive urgency with emergency. I should verify that there is no acute target organ damage in patients with markedly elevated blood pressure, because if there is no damage, that is hypertensive urgency and does not warrant immediate parenteral therapy or ICU admission, so I need to ensure I am not over-treating a nonemergency [^7165ec6e] [^c7de687d].

> Next, I should review disposition and monitoring. For confirmed hypertensive emergency, I need to ensure ICU-level care with continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring and continuous assessment of target organ damage, and I should involve the appropriate specialists early, such as cardiology, neurology, nephrology, or obstetrics depending on the organ system involved, because continuous monitoring and rapid titration are critical to safe outcomes [^166462bf] [^030dffe6].

> I will now examine first-hour blood pressure targets. The general principle is a controlled, partial reduction to avoid cerebral hypoperfusion from excessive drops. For most nonpregnant, nonstroke adults, I should target a 20–25% reduction in mean arterial pressure within the first hour, not exceeding 25%, and I should double-check that I am not aiming for normalization in the first hour, which risks ischemia in chronically hypertensive patients with shifted autoregulation curves [^7523ebc0] [^030dffe6].

> Wait, let me verify the exceptions where faster, more aggressive targets are warranted. In acute aortic dissection, I should reduce systolic blood pressure to less than 120 mmHg within the first hour using a beta-blocker first to blunt shear stress, then a vasodilator, and in severe preeclampsia or eclampsia, I should target less than 140/90 mmHg within the first hour, whereas in acute ischemic stroke eligible for thrombolysis, I should lower to 185/110 mmHg before reperfusion, and in intracerebral hemorrhage, evidence supports lowering to 140/90 mmHg within the first hour in many cases, so I need to tailor the target to the specific emergency [^b83890d9] [^0ef7b184] [^c7de687d].

> Let me consider agent selection next, and I should confirm contraindications before choosing. Nicardipine is a good first-line option for most neurologic and cardiovascular emergencies because it is titratable, does not cause reflex tachycardia, and has minimal sedative effects, while labetalol is preferred when beta-blockade is beneficial or when there is concern for coronary ischemia, and clevidipine offers rapid onset and offset with minimal accumulation, which is useful in perioperative or unstable patients, whereas sodium nitroprusside remains an option but requires caution due to cyanide toxicity with prolonged use and is less favored when alternatives exist [^3b6c1149] [^cffc3dc7].

> I should double-check agents to avoid in specific contexts. Beta-blockers are contraindicated in cocaine intoxication, where alpha-blockade with phentolamine or combined alpha-beta blockade with labetalol may be considered only after adequate alpha-blockade, and hydralazine is generally avoided for acute control due to unpredictable drops and reflex tachycardia, so I need to ensure I match the drug to the pathophysiology and comorbidities [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the 2–6 hour phase. If the patient is stable after the first hour, I will continue careful titration toward a systolic blood pressure less than 160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure less than 100–110 mmHg over the next 2–6 hours, and I need to monitor neurologic status, urine output, and renal function closely to detect hypoperfusion or worsening organ injury during this interval [^7523ebc0] [^030dffe6].

> I will now examine the 24–48 hour phase. Once the patient is stabilized, I should transition to oral antihypertensives and aim for a gradual reduction toward less than 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, while screening for secondary causes of hypertension such as renal artery stenosis, pheochromocytoma, or primary aldosteronism, and I should arrange close follow-up because poor outpatient control is a major driver of recurrent emergencies [^7523ebc0] [^e3070de5].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or postpartum. I need to ensure magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis in preeclampsia with severe features, use labetalol or nifedipine for acute blood pressure control, and avoid nitroprusside, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers, and I should coordinate with obstetrics for maternal-fetal assessment and delivery planning when indicated [^fdd462bc].

> Hold on, I should verify stroke-specific nuances. In acute ischemic stroke without thrombolysis, permissive hypertension is often maintained unless there is malignant hypertension or other indication, whereas with thrombolysis, I must lower to 185/110 mmHg before treatment and maintain below 180/105 mmHg for 24 hours, and in intracerebral hemorrhage, rapid lowering to 140/90 mmHg within the first hour is reasonable in many patients, but I should avoid excessive drops that could compromise cerebral perfusion [^c7de687d].

> I need to ensure meticulous documentation and quality metrics are addressed. I should record the exact blood pressure thresholds, the evidence of acute target organ damage that justifies the emergency designation, the agents used with doses and titration, and the time course of blood pressure reduction, and I should align with quality measures that emphasize screening for hypertension, documenting follow-up plans, and avoiding unnecessary ED interventions for asymptomatic severe hypertension [^83606df7] [^3c23b166].

> Let me reconsider the strength of evidence so I do not overstate certainty. Much of the guidance for hypertensive emergency is based on expert consensus and observational data, with no randomized trials proving mortality benefit from acute antihypertensive therapy in this heterogeneous syndrome, so I should communicate uncertainty, individualize decisions, and monitor closely for iatrogenic harm from overly aggressive reductions [^b7642b29] [^c51f1a88].

> In summary, I should confirm severe hypertension plus acute target organ damage to diagnose hypertensive emergency, admit to ICU for continuous monitoring, reduce mean arterial pressure by about 20–25% in the first hour with condition-specific exceptions, select parenteral agents tailored to comorbidities, continue cautious titration over 2–6 hours, transition to oral therapy with secondary evaluation over 24–48 hours, and coordinate specialty care and follow-up, while avoiding aggressive treatment in patients without target organ damage and documenting the rationale throughout [^82ca87a2] [^7523ebc0] [^cffc3dc7].

---

A hypertensive emergency is **severe hypertension (> 180/120 mmHg) with acute target organ damage** [^82ca87a2] and requires **immediate ICU admission** [^166462bf] for continuous monitoring and parenteral therapy [^151071d1]. The priority is to **reduce BP by no more than 25% in the first hour** [^7523ebc0] to prevent cerebral hypoperfusion, using labetalol, nicardipine, or clevidipine [^3b6c1149] tailored to comorbidities. Avoid rapid BP drops and oral agents initially; after stabilization, transition to oral therapy and address secondary causes with close follow-up [^cffc3dc7].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

Hypertensive emergency is defined as **severe hypertension (SBP ≥ 180 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 120 mmHg) with acute target organ damage (TOD)** [^82ca87a2], including:

- **Neurologic**: encephalopathy, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage.
- **Cardiovascular**: acute coronary syndrome, acute heart failure, aortic dissection.
- **Renal**: acute kidney injury, hematuria, proteinuria.
- **Ophthalmologic**: papilledema, retinal hemorrhages, exudates.

---

## Initial evaluation and assessment

Rapid assessment focuses on confirming severe hypertension and identifying TOD using:

- **Vital signs**: continuous BP, heart rate, oxygen saturation.
- **History**: symptoms, medication adherence, substance use, pregnancy.
- **Physical exam**: neurologic deficits, cardiac murmurs, pulmonary edema, retinal changes.
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, electrolytes, renal function, troponin, urinalysis.
- **Imaging**: ECG, chest X-ray, head CT/MRI, echocardiography as indicated.

---

## Immediate management and blood pressure targets

The cornerstone is **controlled BP reduction** to prevent ongoing organ damage while avoiding cerebral hypoperfusion:

| **Phase** | **Target** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| First hour | Reduce MAP by ≤ 25% | Prevent cerebral hypoperfusion from rapid shifts in autoregulation [^7523ebc0] [^030dffe6] |
| Next 2–6 hours | Gradual reduction to < 160/100 mmHg | Balance perfusion and organ protection [^7523ebc0] [^3b6c1149] |
| 24–48 hours | Normalize BP to < 130/80 mmHg if tolerated | Long-term organ protection and recurrence prevention [^7523ebc0] [^cffc3dc7] |

---

## Pharmacologic management

Parenteral agents are **first-line** for rapid, titratable control:

| **Medication** | **Mechanism** | **Indications** | **Contraindications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Labetalol | α/β-blocker | - Most emergencies <br/> - Especially with coronary ischemia | - Bradycardia <br/> - Heart block <br/> - Asthma |
| Nicardipine | Calcium channel blocker | - Neurologic emergencies <br/> - Coronary ischemia | - Severe aortic stenosis |
| Clevidipine | Calcium channel blocker | - Rapid titration <br/> - Perioperative use | - Allergy to soy/egg |
| Sodium nitroprusside | Direct vasodilator | - Refractory cases <br/> - Aortic dissection | - Hepatic/renal failure <br/> - Cyanide risk |
| Esmolol | β-blocker | - Aortic dissection <br/> - Arrhythmias | - Bradycardia <br/> - Heart failure |

---

Avoid **rapid BP drops** and oral agents initially; after stabilization, transition to oral therapy and address secondary causes with close follow-up [^7523ebc0] [^cffc3dc7].

---

## Special considerations

- **Stroke**: Allow permissive hypertension unless thrombolysis or malignant hypertension is present; if treated, use gentle reduction per stroke protocols [^c7de687d].
- **Aortic dissection**: Rapid SBP reduction to < 120 mmHg within 20 minutes using beta-blocker plus vasodilator [^b83890d9].
- **Pregnancy**: Use magnesium sulfate, labetalol, or nifedipine; avoid nitroprusside, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs [^notfound].
- **Renal failure**: Prefer calcium channel blockers or nicardipine; avoid nitroprusside.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Continuous monitoring includes **BP, heart rate, oxygen saturation, urine output, and neurologic status**, with frequent labs (electrolytes, renal function, troponin) and imaging as indicated. After stabilization, transition to oral therapy, arrange close outpatient follow-up, and evaluate for secondary causes (e.g. renovascular disease, pheochromocytoma, primary aldosteronism) [^e3070de5].

---

## Potential complications of inadequate or excessive treatment

Inadequate treatment risks **progressive organ damage**, permanent neurologic deficits, myocardial infarction, renal failure, and death [^7165ec6e], whereas excessive treatment can cause cerebral hypoperfusion, ischemic stroke, coronary ischemia, and acute kidney injury [^030dffe6].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **Confirm diagnosis**: Severe hypertension with acute TOD [^82ca87a2].
- **ICU admission**: Continuous monitoring and parenteral therapy [^166462bf].
- **Controlled reduction**: ≤ 25% MAP in the first hour; gradual thereafter [^7523ebc0].
- **Agent selection**: Tailor to comorbidities and organ involvement [^3b6c1149].
- **Avoid rapid drops**: Prevent cerebral hypoperfusion [^030dffe6].
- **Transition**: Oral therapy and secondary evaluation after stabilization [^cffc3dc7].

---

Effective management of hypertensive emergency requires **rapid recognition, ICU-level care, and controlled BP reduction** to prevent irreversible organ damage while avoiding iatrogenic harm from overly aggressive treatment [^cffc3dc7].

Patients with severely increased blood pressure often present to the emergency department. Emergency physicians evaluate and treat hypertension in various contexts, ranging from the compliant patient with well-controlled blood pressure to the asymptomatic patient with increased blood pressure to the critically ill patient with increased blood pressure and acute target-organ deterioration. Despite extensive study and national guidelines for the assessment and treatment of chronically increased blood pressure, there is no clear consensus on the acute management of patients with severely increased blood pressure. In this article, we examine the broad spectrum of disease, from the asymptomatic to critically ill patient, and the dilemma it creates for the emergency physician in deciding how and when in the process to intervene.

Broader Coverage of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Aspects by Guidelines and Protocols Proposed for the Primary Clinical Conditions

The natural diagnosis sequence in patients with hypertensive emergencies is usually from the typical manifestations of the primary clinical diagnosis and not from the detection of high BP. The management of BP is one among several steps of care in such conditions, and frequently the intervention over BP is secondary or even not considered in guidelines for the primary diagnoses.

Stroke

The management of high BP in patients presenting with acute stroke in emergency departments is the more controversial among the diagnosis that characterizes a hypertensive emergency. The 2017 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology hypertension guidelines divide the management by the diagnoses of acute ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage. The 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines for hypertension do not include any presentation of stroke as a criterion for diagnosing hypertensive emergencies because the beneficial effects of BP reduction in these conditions are unclear.

The management of high BP is among several steps proposed by the specific guidelines for acute cerebrovascular events. The recommendations unfold in ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, several BP levels, and by the possibility of carrying out thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy. The classes of recommendations and the corresponding level of evidence in all guidelines that address the management of BP during acute stroke are mostly low (or weak) (IIa or IIb and B and C, respectively). Nonetheless, there is high uncertainty over the benefits and risks of intensive BP lowering on functional outcomes.

The various nuances of BP management during acute cerebrovascular events suggest that neurovascular specialists (or trained intensivists and emergency physicians) are needed to achieve better outcomes in these patients. The recommendations for nonspecialists should be restricted to the recognition of a cerebrovascular event in patients with acute elevation of BP and the immediate referral to a tertiary care hospital. If it is impossible to transfer a patient within the time window for thrombolysis or thrombectomy, a better alternative would be to avoid modulating BP. This option has been associated with better neurologic outcomes in patients who are not candidates for pharmacological or mechanical reperfusion.

### Hypertensive emergencies: diagnosis and management [^0c43fd95]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The treatment of hypertension is preventive medicine. This principle applies in the emergency room as well as the clinic. However, there are crucial contrasts between these two care settings related to specific goals of management for real emergencies and nonemergency conditions. In the emergency room, rapid triage is necessary to separate those who can safely be sent home for future clinic assessment from those who require immediate interventions including short stays in 24-hour observation units or hospitalization for more serious problems. This review focuses on decisions related to hypertension management in the emergency room and over brief periods of observation and treatment. Strategy is supported by evidence-based considerations whenever possible. Where outcome studies are not available, we rely on the rationale derived from relevant clinical research.

Furthermore, existing guidelines provide few recommendations as to the management of those with markedly elevated BP absent a hypertensive emergency, leading to questions on who warrants diagnostic testing to look for end-organ injury, how much acute pain or anxiety may contribute to BP in the ED, when initiation or titration of antihypertensive medications is indicated, or how to manage patients with no reliable outpatient follow-up. Emergency clinicians continue to use outdated and incorrect diagnoses such as "hypertension urgency", a term that implies the need for "something" to be done in the ED setting, despite lack of sound basis in the literature, including current international guidelines.

Under "Level B recommendations". the policy states: "Initiating treatment for asymptomatic hypertension in the ED is not necessary when patients have follow-up", "Rapidly lowering blood pressure in asymptomatic patients in the ED is unnecessary and may be harmful in some patients", and "When ED treatment for asymptomatic hypertension is initiated, blood pressure management should attempt to gradually lower blood pressure and should not be expected to be normalized during the initial ED visit". "Level C recommendations. None specified". The page also notes that "one third of patients with diastolic blood pressures greater than 95 mm Hg on initial ED visit have been found to normalize before arranged follow-up", and that "the emergency physician may provide the greatest benefit to the patient by identifying the patient at risk with an elevated blood pressure and advising them to arrange prompt and definitive follow-up with their primary physician".

### Evaluation and management of hypertensive emergency [^cffc3dc7]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Hypertensive emergencies cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly when acute organ injury is present. Careful and effective strategies to reduce blood pressure and diminish the effects of pressure-mediated injury are essential. While the selection of specific antihypertensive medications varies little across different forms of hypertensive emergencies, the intensity of blood pressure reduction to the target pressure differs substantially. Treatment hinges on balancing the positive effects of lowering blood pressure with the potential for negative effects of organ hypoperfusion in patients with altered autoregulatory mechanisms. When patients do not have acute organ injury in addition to severe hypertension, they benefit from a conservative, outpatient approach to blood pressure management. In all cases, long term control of blood pressure is paramount to prevent recurrent hypertensive emergencies and improve overall prognosis. This review discusses the current evidence and guidelines on the evaluation and management of hypertensive emergency.

### Poor guideline adherence in a real-world evaluation of hypertensive emergency management [^7cddbfdd]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association define hypertensive emergency (HTN-E) as a systolic blood pressure greater than 180 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure greater than 120 mmHg with evidence of end-organ damage (EOD). Based on expert opinion, current guidelines recommend antihypertensive therapy to reduce blood pressure (BP) at specific hourly rates to reduce progression of EOD, outlined by four criteria. Our goal was to describe compliance with guideline recommendations for early management of HTN-E and to analyze safety outcomes related to pharmacologic intervention.

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review including patients presenting to the emergency department with HTN-E between September 2016 and August 2020. We excluded patients with a compelling indication for altered therapeutic goals (e.g. acute aortic dissection, hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, and pheochromocytoma). The primary outcome was complete adherence with guideline recommendations in the first 24 h.

Results

Of 758 screened records, 402 were included. Mean age was 54 years and majority Black race (72%). Overall, total adherence was poor (< 1%): 30% received intravenous therapy within 1 h, 64% achieved 1-h BP goals, 44% achieved 6-h goals, and 9% had appropriate 24-h maintenance BP. Hypotensive events (N = 67) were common and antihypertensive-associated EOD (N = 21) did occur. Predictors of hypotension include treatment within 1 h and management with continuous infusion medication.

Conclusions

Current practice is poorly compliant with guideline criteria and there are risks associated with recommended treatments. Our results favor relaxing the expert opinion-based recommendations.

### Aafp grading system… [^d668bc20]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose: To review the evidence and provide clinical recommendations for appropriate blood pressure treatment targets for adults with hypertension. Recommendation 1: The American Academy of Family Physicians strongly recommends clinicians treat adults who have hypertension to a standard blood pressure target to reduce the risk of all cause and cardiovascular mortality. Treating to a lower blood pressure target did not provide additional benefit at preventing mortality; however, a lower blood pressure target could be considered based on clinical assessment and patient preferences and values. 18 Serious adverse events were defined according to U. S. Food and Drug Administration criteria, including death, life-threatening event, requiring or prolonging hospitalization, congenital anomaly, or requiring intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage.

Recommendations RECOMMENDATION 1 The AAFP strongly recommends clinicians treat adults who have hypertension to a standard blood pressure target to reduce the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Treating to a lower blood pressure target does not provide additional benefit at preventing mortality; however, a lower blood pressure target could be considered based on patient preferences and values. Clinicians should employ shared decision-making and consider patient values, goals, and preferences when considering blood pressure targets to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction. Although the potential for a small decrease in myocardial infarction risk at lower blood pressure targets occurs, there is also the potential for increased harms, as described previously.

Shared decision-making conversations should consider additional clinical risk factors of myocardial infarction, alternative measures to reduce risk, harms of medication regimens, costs, and impact of treatment options on the lives of patients and their families. A patient's occupation, support structures, or comorbid conditions may alter the patient's risk tolerance or ability and willingness to accept treatment adverse effects. Patient risk for CVD should be incorporated into shared decision-making, and treatment options should include risk-reduction measures. Multiple cardiovascular risk assessment tools are available to assist in patient-centered treatment discussions, but many are limited by their use of race as a risk factor.

Patients should be actively engaged in decision-making when determining blood pressure targets, and these targets should be frequently reassessed to ensure that changes in patient values and preferences are incorporated into treatment planning.

### Current diagnosis and management of hypertensive emergency [^6958f478]. Seminars in Dialysis (2006). Low credibility.

The appropriate and timely evaluation and treatment of patients with severely elevated blood pressure is essential to avoid serious adverse outcomes. Most importantly, the distinction between a hypertensive emergency (crisis) and urgency needs to be made. A sudden elevation in systolic (SBP) and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) that is associated with acute end organ damage (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or renal) is defined as a hypertensive crisis or emergency. In contrast, acute elevation in SBP and/or DBP not associated with evidence of end organ damage is defined as hypertensive urgency. In patients with a hypertensive emergency, blood pressure control should be attained as expeditiously as possible with parenteral medications to prevent ongoing and potentially permanent end organ damage. In contrast, with hypertensive urgency, blood pressure control can be achieved with the use of oral medications within 24–48 hours. This paper reviews the management of hypertensive emergencies.

American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) clinical policy — this document addresses asymptomatic elevated blood pressure in adult emergency department (ED) patients and poses the critical question: "In adult emergency department patients being discharged with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure, is initiation of outpatient antihypertensive medications from the emergency department safe and effective?" Background epidemiology and definitions include: "Approximately half of adults in the United States (119.9 million) are affected by hypertension, but only 25% (27.0 million) of these individuals effectively control their blood pressure" and "Hypertension, defined as blood pressure more than 130/80 mmHg". ED burden is described as "There are just over 6 million emergency department (ED) visits annually in the United States for a primary chief complaint of hypertension, and of those patients, about 64% receive a primary diagnosis of hypertension". Prior guidance notes that an American Heart Association statement "supports the avoidance of intensifying hypertension medications in the ED, with a preference toward restarting home medication(s) and arranging close follow-up", and that the 2013 ACEP policy "did not recommend routine ED medical interventions for asymptomatic elevated blood pressure unless the patient had poor follow-up or the patient was part of a select high-risk patient population". The current policy "updates the 2013 clinical policy" to provide guidance "to determine if initiation of antihypertensive medications at and/or prior to discharge from the ED is safe and effective" and "does not revisit the 2013 question related to screening of patients for target organ injury nor evaluate the need for the lowering of acute asymptomatic elevated blood pressure within the ED". Methods specify that "Searches of PubMed, SCOPUS, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were performed by a second librarian", that "All searches were limited to human studies published in English", and that "Using Covidence (Covidence, Melbourne, Australia), 2 subcommittee members independently reviewed the identified abstracts to assess for possible inclusion".

Emergency department asymptomatic markedly elevated blood pressure — future research priorities are enumerated, emphasizing evaluation, management, and follow-up knowledge gaps. Given the limited literature on the optimal evaluation, management, and follow-up of ED patients with asymptomatic markedly elevated blood pressure, suggested topics include: what is the optimal screening as it relates to patient outcomes; what is the optimal management as it relates to patient outcomes; whether writing a prescription from the ED or administering an oral dose of medication in the ED changes outcomes; and what is the ideal interval for patient follow-up to minimize adverse patient outcomes.

Acute Coronary Syndromes

According to hypertension guidelines, unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction are traditionally listed as criteria to diagnose a hypertensive emergency. Unlike the detailed recommendations for managing high BP in patients with stroke, the hypertension guidelines superficially address BP management in patients with acute cardiac ischemia.

There are no clinical trials of major cardiovascular outcomes assessing the benefits of different strategies to reduce BP in the context of acute coronary syndromes. Differently from guidelines for hypertension, guidelines for acute coronary syndromes focus on revascularization therapies, which are firmly based on the results of randomized clinical trials and do not include BP in the flow charts and algorithms for the management.

Physicians are more often concerned with low BP values in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes, which can signal incipient cardiogenic shock. High BP is usually secondary to pain (reversal causality), particularly in patients with previous hypertension, and is evidence of preserved cardiac output. These patients are treated with nitrates, drugs that have a BP‐lowering effect as one of their mechanisms to reduce myocardial ischemia, while the procedures to promote coronary reperfusion are prepared.

In this review article, we outline the current approach to the management of these individuals and highlight the crucial role emergency medicine clinicians play in reducing the morbidity associated with elevated BP.

RESULTS

We highlight the critical importance of immediate treatment when elevated BP contributes to new or worsening end-organ injury but emphasize that such hypertensive emergencies are rare. For the vast majority of patients with elevated BP in the ED who do not have new or worsening end-organ injury from elevated BP, immediate BP reduction within the ED is not recommended or safe. Nonetheless, within weeks after an ED visit, there is a pressing need to improve the care of patients with elevated or previously undiagnosed hypertension. For many, it may be their only regular point of engagement with the healthcare system. To address this, we present novel perspectives that envision a new role for emergency medicine in chronic hypertension management — one that acknowledges the significant population-level gaps in BP control that contribute to disparities in cardiovascular disease and sets the stage for future changes in systems-based practice.

CONCLUSIONS

Emergency medicine plays a key and evolving role in reducing morbidity associated with elevated BP.

Absence of Clinical Trials With Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients With Hypertensive Emergencies

Patients presenting with the diagnosis of hypertensive emergency have already a diagnosis of an acute cardiovascular event on course. Therefore, treatments would aim to reduce complications of the clinical conditions that characterize the occurrence of hypertensive emergencies, particularly the evolution to fatal outcomes or more severe complications. The strategy to reach these goals should be tested in randomized clinical trials, which should depart from the definition of the disease to be treated. Hypertensive emergencies do not fill this criterion because various clinical conditions define it. The simple decision to treat or not treat is naturally different in patients with stroke, acute left ventricular failure, angina, and others. Moreover, there is no common denominator among the different clinical conditions to justify a similar BP‐lowering strategy for all.

The use of BP‐lowering drugs in the absence of such trials could be eventually justified because the hypertensive response worsens the clinical condition, such as acute pulmonary edema. In this case, however, the treatment should be tailored to the underlining diagnosis, which is better defined by guidelines and protocols specific to each clinical condition.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to management of hypertensive urgency, ACEP 2013 guidelines recommend to do not offer routine medical intervention in the emergency department in patients presenting with asymptomatic markedly elevated BP (HTN stage 2, ≥ 160/100 mmHg). Consider treating markedly elevated BP in the emergency department and/or initiate therapy for long-term control in selected patients, such as with poor follow-up. Refer patients with asymptomatic markedly elevated BP for outpatient follow-up.

Asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department — guideline statements — emphasize limited need for emergency therapy without target organ damage but provide mixed direction on immediate treatment. JNC VI stated, "Elevated blood pressure alone, in the absence of symptoms or new or progressive target organ damage, rarely requires emergency therapy". JNC 7 recommendations state that "marked elevations of blood pressure without target organ damage "usually do not require hospitalization, but should receive immediate combination oral antihypertensive therapy". This statement appears to be consensus in origin because no supportive references were cited, and the authors noted, "We could find no evidence demonstrating improved patient outcomes or decreased mortality or morbidity with acute management of elevated blood pressure in the ED".

Conclusion

The recognition of high BP in patients in emergency settings requires the diagnosis of the causes of the elevation. The diversity of clinical conditions that lead to the diagnosis of hypertensive emergency does not have a common denominator to justify a similar BP‐lowering strategy for all. The clinical conditions are usually self‐evident and should be managed according to their specific guidelines, which include several aspects of diagnosis and treatment. Treating elevated BP rather than the primary clinical condition can be harmful. The diagnosis of hypertensive emergency provided good services to doctors and patients, but given the contemporary reality, it should have a well‐deserved retirement.

Severely elevated blood pressure is a common clinical problem en-countered in the Emergency Department. It is often difficult for physicians to differentiate between patients who need emergent blood pressure reduction, requiring the use of intravenous agents and in-tensive monitoring, and those for whom careful, slow reduction in BP is more appropriate. The optimal assessment and management of these patients is reviewed here, with an emphasis on clinical strategies that will most efficiently identify those at greatest risk.

### Evaluation and treatment of severe asymptomatic hypertension [^536bfb18]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Poorly controlled hypertension is a common finding in the outpatient setting. When patients present with severely elevated blood pressure (i.e., systolic blood pressure of 180 mm Hg or greater, or diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or greater), physicians need to differentiate hypertensive emergency from severely elevated blood pressure without signs or symptoms of end-organ damage (severe asymptomatic hypertension). Most patients who are asymptomatic but have poorly controlled hypertension do not have acute end-organ damage and, therefore, do not require immediate workup or treatment (within 24 hours). However, physicians should confirm blood pressure readings and appropriately classify the hypertensive state. A cardiovascular risk profile is important in guiding the treatment of severe asymptomatic hypertension; higher risk patients may benefit from more urgent and aggressive evaluation and treatment. Oral agents may be initiated before discharge, but intravenous medications and fast-acting oral agents should be reserved for true hypertensive emergencies. High blood pressure should be treated gradually. Appropriate, repeated follow-up over weeks to months is needed to reach desired blood pressure goals.

Hypertension affects approximately one-third of Americans. An additional 30% are unaware that they harbor the disease. Significantly increased blood pressure constitutes a hypertensive emergency that could lead to end-organ damage. When organs such as the brain, heart, or kidney are affected, an intervention that will lower the blood pressure in several hours is indicated. Several pharmacologic options are available for treatment, with intravenous antihypertensive therapy being the cornerstone, but there is no standard of care. Careful consideration of each patient's specific complaint, history, and physical examination guides the emergency physician through the treatment algorithm.

Hypertension affects > 65 million people in the United States and is one of the leading causes of death. One to two percent of patients with hypertension have acute elevations of BP that require urgent medical treatment. Depending on the degree of BP elevation and presence of end-organ damage, severe hypertension can be defined as either a hypertensive emergency or a hypertensive urgency. A hypertensive emergency is associated with acute end-organ damage and requires immediate treatment with a titratable short-acting IV antihypertensive agent. Severe hypertension without acute end-organ damage is referred to as a hypertensive urgency and is usually treated with oral antihypertensive agents. This article reviews definitions, current concepts, common misconceptions, and pitfalls in the diagnosis and management of patients with acutely elevated BP as well as special clinical situations in which BP must be controlled.

### Hypertension management in emergency departments [^9923f10b]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines revising the diagnosis threshold for hypertension and goal BP to 130/80 mm Hg among high-risk patientsadds to the importance of identifying and addressing elevated BP in the ED, particularly for ED patients without access other sources of care. While there is considerable evidence linked to long-term outcomes that guide non-ED assessment and management of nonemergent BP elevations, evidence to inform ED care is still evolving. The 2013 ACEP clinical policy writing group articulated this noting significant gaps in evidence regarding ED hypertension screening, management of nonemergent elevated BP, antihypertensive medication initiation or titration, and timing of follow-up to improve short- and long-term outcomes while minimizing risks of adverse events.

While the ACC/AHA guidelines have traction in the United States, the 2018 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines have noted differences in defining hypertension and targets for treatment. The ESC/ESH guidelines define hypertension as ≥ 140/90 mm Hg and target treatment based on age and risk. For patients with BP 130–139/85–89 mm Hg, ESC/ESH guidelines recommend lifestyle change and consideration of drug treatment, particularly if patients have high cardiovascular risk. For patients ≤ 80 years who have BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg, drug treatment is indicated. For patients > 80 years, ESC/ESH guidelines recommend drug treatment for SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg. If patients tolerate treatment to maintain BP < 140/90 mm Hg, further lowering targets a DBP < 80 mm Hg and SBP based on age (SBP target 120–129 mm Hg if age < 65 years, 130–139 mm Hg if 65–79 years, and 130–139 mm Hg as tolerated in those > 80 years). For patients with known coronary artery disease, therapy is targeted to maintain BP < 130/80 mm Hg. Both guidelines have similar recommendations for BP measurement, lifestyle modifications, and recommended medications. Both recommend strong consideration for single-pill combination antihypertensive medications.

### Clinical features in the management of selected hypertensive emergencies [^376693b7]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

A hypertensive emergency is a clinical diagnosis that is appropriate when marked hypertension is associated with acute target-organ damage; in this setting, lowering of blood pressure (BP) is typically begun within hours of diagnosis. For hypertensive urgency with no acute target-organ damage, BP lowering may occur over hours to days. A hypertensive emergency may present with cardiac, renal, neurologic, hemorrhagic, or obstetric manifestations, but prompt recognition of the condition and institution of rapidly acting parenteral therapy to lower BP (typically in an intensive care unit) are widely recommended. For aortic dissection, the systolic BP target is lower than 120 mm Hg, to be achieved during the first 20 minutes using a beta-blocker (typically esmolol) and a vasodilator to reduce both shear stress on the aortic tear and the BP, respectively. Otherwise, sodium nitroprusside is the agent with the lowest acquisition cost and longest record of successful use in hypertensive emergencies; however, it is metabolized to toxic thiocyanate and cyanide. Other attractive agents include fenoldopam mesylate, nicardipine, and labetalol; in pregnant women, magnesium and nifedipine are used commonly. Most authors suggest a reduction in mean arterial pressure of approximately 10% during the first hour and a further 10% to 15% during the next 2 to 4 hours; hypoperfusion can result if the BP is lowered too suddenly or too far (eg, into the range of < 140/90 mm Hg). Oral antihypertensive therapy can usually be instituted after 6 to 12 hours of parenteral therapy, and the patient moved out of the intensive care unit, when consideration should be given to screening for secondary causes of hypertension. Long-term follow-up to ensure adequate control of hypertension is necessary to prevent further target-organ damage and recurrence of another hypertensive emergency.

Hypertension is an extremely common clinical problem, affecting approximately 50 million people in the USA and approximately 1 billion individuals worldwide. Approximately 1% of these patients will develop acute elevations in blood pressure at some point in their lifetime. A number of terms have been applied to severe hypertension, including hypertensive crises, emergencies, and urgencies. By definition, acute elevations in blood pressure that are associated with end-organ damage are called hypertensive crises. Immediate reduction in blood pressure is required only in patients with acute end-organ damage.

### The management of elevated blood pressure in the acute care setting: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^38b92543]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Over the past 3 decades, a substantial body of high-quality evidence has guided the diagnosis and management of elevated blood pressure (BP) in the outpatient setting. In contrast, there is a lack of comparable evidence for guiding the management of elevated BP in the acute care setting, resulting in significant practice variation. Throughout this scientific statement, we use the terms acute care and inpatient to refer to care received in the emergency department and after admission to the hospital. Elevated inpatient BP is common and can manifest either as asymptomatic or with signs of new or worsening target-organ damage, a condition referred to as hypertensive emergency. Hypertensive emergency involves acute target-organ damage and should be treated swiftly, usually with intravenous antihypertensive medications, in a closely monitored setting. However, the risk-benefit ratio of initiating or intensifying antihypertensive medications for asymptomatic elevated inpatient BP is less clear. Despite this ambiguity, clinicians prescribe oral or intravenous antihypertensive medications in approximately one-third of cases of asymptomatic elevated inpatient BP. Recent observational studies have suggested potential harms associated with treating asymptomatic elevated inpatient BP, which brings current practice into question. Despite the ubiquity of elevated inpatient BPs, few position papers, guidelines, or consensus statements have focused on improving BP management in the acute care setting. Therefore, this scientific statement aims to synthesize the available evidence, provide suggestions for best practice based on the available evidence, identify evidence-based gaps in managing elevated inpatient BP (asymptomatic and hypertensive emergency), and highlight areas requiring further research.

Summary of international guidelines for hypertensive emergencies

The ESC/ESH and AHA/ACC guidelines (Table 14) state that the aim of treatment of markedly elevated BP is to intensify/reinstitute oral anti-hypertensive drug therapy and ensure adequate follow-up with acknowledgement of the lack of a robust evidence base. There is overall general agreement that a patient with acute EOD is managed as hypertensive emergency, usually treated with IV anti-hypertensive therapy, in a high dependency/intensive care environment. There is, however, heterogeneity in outlined management of patients with acute severe HTN and the pace of reduction in BP in various specific scenarios. The guidelines mostly adopt a threshold BP of 180/110–120 mmHg to define severely elevated BP. Our opinion differs in that regard, as there cannot be a single cut off value of BP that is too low to cause EOD and the corollary that not all patients with 'severely elevated BP' need immediate treatment and assessment should be directed to define and treat the EOD. It is important to treat the patient and not the numbers. The targets for BP reduction and the pace of reduction defined in several hypertensive emergency states are not based on robust evidence and are mostly based on expert opinion. It must be widely appreciated that anti-hypertensive therapy should be personalised to the patient's characteristics and the aim of treatment should be to reduce BP proportionally rather than to an arbitrary target value.

GENERAL TREATMENT CONSIDERATIONS

Current treatment for patients with hypertensive emergencies involves rapid BP reduction to reverse new or worsening end-organ injury and preventing further damage. The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association Task Force in their 2017 guidelines recommend reduction of the MAP by 25% within the first hour of treatment. This recommendation is based on evidence that the baseline right-shift in the cerebral autoregulation curve with chronic hypertension is understood to reset approximately 25% above the average MAP. However, it is important to remember that with acute BP elevation, an individual with a hypertensive emergency may be able to withstand greater BP drops as they are on the ascendant portion (as opposed to the plateau) of the autoregulation curve. In general, carefully titrated IV antihypertensive medications are the preferred initial treatment approach in order to limit the risk of cerebral hypoperfusion that may be caused reducing BP too quickly. Over the next 2–6 hours, further BP reduction should occur with the goal SBP 160 mm Hg and DBP 100–110 mm Hg. Following the ED management, inpatient BP reduction aims to reach a normal range gradually within 24–48 hours. For individual disease processes, additional guidelines exist to tailor BP management, and the optimal BP goal for immediate intervention may be greater than 25% of MAP. Table 2 reviews such disease-specific treatment goals. The most common medications indicated for treatment are nicardipine, labetalol, clevidipine, and esmolol. While nitroprusside was a mainstay of treatment for decades, antihypertensive medications such as nicardipine and clevidipine demonstrate similar efficacy, are easy to titrate and have no concern for possible cyanide toxicity. Notably, we do not suggest the use of diuretics for emergent BP treatment. The BP-lowering effect of diuretics is unpredictable, and patients with hypertensive emergencies do not routinely have hypervolemia. The existing literature does not provide sufficient evidence to show that any specific IV antihypertensive agent is superior to another, though the dihydropyridine agents (nicardipine and clevidipine), as well as labetalol, are preferred agents in the setting of neurological hypertensive emergencies.

Personalized treatment

As mentioned, initiation and titration of antihypertensive therapy can be done from the ED, but there is reluctance to do so on the part of emergency medicine clinicians. Yet, this is a relatively simple and potentially highly effective strategy that ED clinicians can use to improve the BP control of their patients. It is also a simple strategy to overcome clinical inertia or the "bystander effect". The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines recommend maximizing the dose of antihypertensive medication and then adding addition medication. Understanding the anticipated BP-lowering effect using tools like the therapeutic intensity score can be used to give providers feedback regarding their prescribing practices and help guide emergency medicine clinicians who seek to do more than simply refer patients on to the next station of care. The therapeutic intensity score provides a quantifiable estimate of the anticipated impact of antihypertensive therapy, particularly in the setting of multiple antihypertensive medications.

With the steady increase in ED visits and the high proportion of patients with elevated BP, the opportunity for recognition and interventions is shifting from the realm of outpatient medicine and becoming incorporated into the practice of emergency medicine. These opportunities require emergency medicine physicians to be familiar with the definitions of hypertension, the distinction between nonemergent hypertension and hypertensive emergencies, and the treatment for all BP elevations. The ED can serve as a critical partner in systems-level efforts to reduce the morbidity associated with poor hypertension control, particularly in underserved communities.

ASSESSING AND TREATING HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCIES

Hypertensive emergencies classically occur in patients with systolic BP (SBP) > 220 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) > 120 mm Hg. Nevertheless, lower thresholds can be associated with hypertensive emergencies in the setting of rapid elevations from low-to-normal baseline BP. Furthermore, BP elevations > 170/100 mm Hg can cause worsening target-organ injury in select patients. Elevated BP values in isolation, no matter how high they may be, do not by themselves define a hypertensive emergency unless the patient has concomitant acute organ injury for which immediate BP lowering will modify this injury. Thus, terms such as "hypertensive crisis", which have been historically assigned to all patients with markedly elevated BP have little utility in contemporary practice. New or worsening end-organ injury occurs in the cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, ophthalmologic, hematologic, and renovascular systems. The most common hypertensive emergencies are stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) and acute heart failure leading to pulmonary edema. Hypertensive encephalopathy is a rare and poorly understood condition that may reflect direct adverse acute effects of markedly elevated BP on the brain.

Most ED patients with SBP ≥ 180 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg have elevated BP without evidence of end-organ injury. These patients have no immediate indication for rapid BP lowering. Though a common concern among ED providers, hypertensive emergency is rare in patients with elevated BP in the ED. Thus, while all hypertensive emergencies should be managed with intravenous (IV) antihypertensive therapy to achieve immediate BP reduction, few patients require such intervention. Beyond hypertensive emergency, IV antihypertensive therapy is only indicated for select patients with strict oral medication restrictions and patients abruptly withdrawing from beta-blockade or sympatholytic therapy. These latter patients may benefit from IV labetalol. Given the aforementioned variability in clinical practice, it is not surprising that the majority of IV medications given to achieve immediate BP reduction in the ED are done so inappropriately to patients without new or worsening end-organ injury that can be modified by rapid treatment.

Preeclampsia and Eclampsia

Guidelines for hypertension, recommend lowering BP to values lower than 140/90 mm Hg. Preeclampsia and eclampsia, however, are self‐evident conditions usually managed in an obstetric department and not in emergency departments. There are many randomized clinical trials comparing the effect of different drugs over BP in patients with eclampsia, but none comparing the effect of different BP targets in maternal‐fetal outcomes. The treatment of pregnant women with high BP should follow guidelines that cover BP and other conditions in patients with preeclampsia/eclampsia.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertensive urgency in the outpatient setting: a systematic review [^7dbb8153]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hypertensive urgency (HU) is defined as systolic blood pressure of at least 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure of at least 110 mmHg, without associated end-organ damage. Patients with HU may be completely asymptomatic or may present with symptoms such as headache, epistaxis, faintness, malaise, psychomotor agitation, nausea, or vomiting.

Up to 65 million Americans have hypertension; about 1% will have an episode of HU during their lives. The prevalence of HU in emergency room (ER) or office settings is estimated at 3–5%. In a recent cohort study, cardiovascular events were found to occur in less than 1% of patients within a 6-month period.

Guidance for immediate management of HU is unclear, since there is no consensus on the optimal target for acute blood pressure reduction or the time frame for achieving a normal blood pressure range. Most patients receive drug therapy for elevated blood pressure within the first 48 h of presentation. – Knowledge of the effectiveness and safety of different medication choices and associated comorbidities is crucial for clinicians, especially generalists.

The aim of this systematic review is to summarize evidence of the benefits and harms associated with antihypertensive medications used to treat HU in adults, either in the clinic or ER. This systematic review is intended for a broad audience, including clinicians — especially general internists — along with policymakers and funding agencies, professional societies developing clinical practice guidelines, patients and their care providers, and researchers.

Acute-onset, severe systolic hypertension; severe diastolic hypertension; or both can occur in pregnant women or women in the postpartum period. Introducing standardized, evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of patients with preeclampsia and eclampsia has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of adverse maternal outcomes. Individuals and institutions should have mechanisms in place to initiate the prompt administration of medication when a patient presents with a hypertensive emergency. Once the hypertensive emergency is treated, a complete and detailed evaluation of maternal and fetal well-being is needed with consideration of, among many issues, the need for subsequent pharmacotherapy and the appropriate timing of delivery.

NONEMERGENT HYPERTENSION

While hypertensive emergencies are rare, ED encounters with elevated BP are common and represent valuable opportunities to recognize and address chronic hypertension, particularly among difficult-to-reach patient populations. ED visits related to hypertension rose more than 5% annually from 2006 to 2012. In 2012, just over 1 million ED visits had a primary diagnosis of hypertension, and almost 27 million ED visits were hypertension related. Thus, appropriate recognition and management of nonemergent BP elevations for patients with and without diagnosed hypertension should be a core function of emergency medicine clinicians.

One of the primary issues that affect the management of nonemergent BP elevations in the ED is uncertainty around measurement accuracy. BP measurements over minutes to hours using appropriate cuff size and patient positioning can provide valuable information regarding BP variability, range, and trajectory, which can supplement clinic and home BP measurements to guide hypertension diagnosis and medication titration. Multiple studies have shown that BP remains elevated after ED discharge for many patients, and even when BP decreases after ED visits, it does not reach normotension. Elevated SBP and DBP in the ED are both risk factors for incident cardiovascular disease, and the risk rises in a step-wise, dose-dependent fashion with increasing ED BP. The number needed to screen to prevent a single cardiovascular event was 151, but that decreases to 71 among patients with ED BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg in the ED. ED BP is particularly informative when measured more than an hour after ED arrival and when it remains elevated over repeated measures, but even triage BP provides important information despite the potential for measurement error due to cuff size and patient positioning. Among ED patients discharged with home BP monitors, more than 88% of patients with a single ED triage BP ≥ 160/100 mm Hg had a mean home BP ≥ 135/85 mm Hg. Another 46% of patients with elevated BP in the ED met criteria for hypertension in follow-up based on home BP monitor, and it is notable that ED physician gestalt was less accurate than mean ED BP for elevated post-ED BP.

Future

It is clear that there is a lack of robust clinical trial data and a lack of consensus over terminology and interpretation of the data available. Using BP levels as a threshold to determine if patients have a hypertensive emergency, and the use of terminologies like 'hypertensive urgency' dilute the strength of evidence. We suggest the development of established international standardised terminologies in this field.

As a core concept, the pace of reduction in hypertensive emergencies is based on CPP, and there is an unmet need for developing user-friendly non-invasive methods of assessing cerebral flow in routine clinical settings. This might help develop individualised BP targets leading to a controlled MAP and CPP management.

Less is known about underlying genetic, cultural, and environmental factors that predispose patients to hypertensive emergencies. Intrinsic heterogeneity in patients presenting with hypertensive crises and responses to therapy make RCTs difficult to design and follow through. To improve and develop an evidence base in this field prospective international observational studies either in the form of registries or trials need to be set up. These may not only help assess current treatment strategies but could also help develop biomarkers or a multivariate risk score system based on epidemiology, which in turn may help stratify patients adequately and enable personalised therapy. The set-up of a multi-national registry could also help identify areas with high prevalence rates of uncontrolled HTN and focus on regional trials to address knowledge gaps. Overall, any planned RCT should be pragmatic and relevant, and consider all the factors that are likely to affect the risks. Last but not the least, it is important to prevent nonadherence to medications right from the start i.e., at the point of diagnosis, by ensuring patients are at the centre of the shared decision-making. Throughout the patient's journey perspectives change, and it is vital to continuously assess the factors that affect adherence both subjectively and objectively in a non-judgmental way, using the best available tools (biochemical testing is by far the most effective) within the clinical setting. Various strategies can be implemented including patient-focused solutions, using reminders/smart phone apps, regular follow-up, pill boxes and single combination pills. The ultimate goal of reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease resulting from uncontrolled hypertension is unattainable without patient partnership.

### Hypertension management in emergency departments [^9ac53e9c]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

To improve the care of patients with elevated blood pressure (BP) in the emergency department (ED), we provide an overview of the management of hypertensive emergencies, followed by an overview of the management of markedly elevated BP without evidence of end-organ injury. Of equal, if not greater importance, we then deliberate on assessment of patients with nonmarkedly elevated BP and the evolving, essential role that emergency medicine has in population-level hypertension management and in reducing long-term cardiovascular disparities that remain particularly pervasive in urban environments where poor BP control is common. We highlight our experience in Detroit, where hypertension directly contributes to a 1.5-fold increase in years of potential life lost due to heart disease in African Americans compared with non-Hispanic Whites under age 75 years. We emphasize that reducing such disparities will require the entire house of medicine to work together to overcome the impact that elevated hypertension has on communities nationwide.

An estimated 33–50% of adults in the United States have hypertension, and approximately 41–50% of these adults do not have adequate BP control. More than 145 million ED visits take place each year in the United States, and the estimated prevalence of elevated BP among these patients is close to 45%. In an analysis of 7 years of data from the Nationwide ED Sample (2006–2012), 165.9 million hypertension-related visits (23.6% of all visits) occurred. During this same period, patients hospitalized declined while hypertension-related ED visits increased. Data from 2016 showed that approximately 1.2 million ED visits had a chief complaint of essential hypertension.

Based on their training, emergency medicine clinicians naturally focus on the identification and management of hypertensive emergencies for those patients with elevated BP. These critical conditions require rapid evaluation and treatment; however, such patients are rare overall, accounting for < 2% of ED visits where high BP is noted. Accordingly, nearly all patients that emergency clinicians see in the ED with elevated BP, including markedly elevated BP (i.e. ≥ 180/110 mm Hg), are not experiencing an emergency that requires immediate intervention. Despite this, there is often an expectation on the part of patients and other providers, who send their patients to the ED based on a perceived acute risk associated with markedly elevated BP, that something will (or should) be done. Such expectations lead to wide variation in practice patterns.

### Clinical outcomes in hypertensive emergency: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1bef6acf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines defines hypertensive emergency as systolic blood pressure (BP) > 180 mm Hg and diastolic BP > 120 mm Hg, along with evidence of new or worsening hypertension‐mediated organ damage (HMOD). Hypertensive emergency is a life‐threatening condition and has been linked with increased admission rates. It has been estimated that emergency department (ED) visits for hypertensive emergency have increased by 2‐fold per million adults from 2006 to 2013. Although a 0.3% reduction in mortality rate over the period of 7 years was observed, 4.5% of ED visits for hypertensive emergency still resulted in death in 2013, either in the ED or during subsequent hospital admission. Despite the increased rate of hypertensive emergency presentations, subsequent morbidity and mortality data to support clinical decision making are still scarce. Hypertensive emergency may originate from poor management of essential hypertension or secondary hypertension, unrecognized hypertension, inadequately managed hypertension, reduced patient compliance, and reduced access to health care. Many people who present with hypertensive emergencies have chronic hypertension. Secondary hypertension can stem from several underlying causes, such as renal disease due to atherosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia, endocrine disorders like pheochromocytoma, or medications such as nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory agents and hormonal contraceptives. Malignant hypertension is one of the several forms of hypertensive emergency and is characterized by severe BP spikes and abrupt microvascular injury to a variety of organs, including the retina, brain, and kidney. Analysis of a multiracial population in England reported essential hypertension to be the most common underlying cause of malignant hypertension, whereas secondary hypertension, mainly due to chronic kidney disease, was identified as the cause in about 40% of the patients. Moreover, the incidence rates of malignant hypertension have been documented as 2 new cases per 100 000 people per year, including up to 4 times greater rates (7.3 per 100 000 per year) recorded for self‐identified Black individuals. Concerns have been raised that although BP control is often acutely achieved in patients admitted with hypertensive emergencies, sufficient focus is not placed on control of chronic hypertension and prevention of organ damage in the long run. Moreover, hypertensive emergency cases are further challenging due to involvement of a variety of organ damages, each of which may complicate the prognosis of the patients. Although some studies have demonstrated prevalence of hypertensive emergencies in patients presenting to the ED, the literature lacks robust estimates of the true prevalence of hypertensive emergencies. Moreover, the estimates available can substantially vary depending on the populations studied and the methods used. In addition, there is a lack of consensus‐based guidelines in the management strategies of hypertensive emergencies. In this study, we sought to conduct a systematic review and meta‐analysis to assess the prevalence of hypertensive emergency, HMOD, and subsequent hospitalization and in‐hospital mortality among patients with hypertensive emergency visiting the ED. Therefore, we aim to provide a review of existing literature, highlight future avenues of research, and find high‐powered estimates to evaluate the prevalence of outcomes of interest. Our analysis synthesizes data on the incidence of hypertensive emergency and their related HMOD from multiple studies and reduces the gap in the literature due to a lack of well‐powered estimates on prevalence of hypertensive emergency. Hence, these findings will assist policymakers in providing more accurate recommendations about diagnosis, treatment, and management of hypertensive emergency and in developing evidence‐based guidelines to improve patient‐related outcomes. Moreover, we also highlight the limitations of existing studies and provide recommendations to improve future clinical studies on patients with hypertensive emergency.

Asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department — VA Cooperative Trial outcomes — found fewer long-term adverse events with drug therapy but no early events and no demonstrated ED benefit without end-organ damage. Placebo had 27 (39%) of 70 adverse events versus 2 (3%) of 73 with antihypertensive drugs within 20 months (absolute risk reduction 36%; number needed to treat = 3), yet there were no adverse events in either group within the first 3 months, and without acute end-organ damage, ED pharmacologic intervention did not yield better outcomes than referral for repeat measurements, screening, and treatment.

Classification and management of blood pressure for adults aged 18 years or older detail categories, lifestyle modification, and initial drug therapy. Normal is defined as systolic < 120 mm Hg and diastolic < 80 mm Hg with lifestyle modification to encourage. Prehypertension is 120–139 mm Hg systolic or 80–89 mm Hg diastolic, lifestyle modification is yes, and without compelling indications no antihypertensive drug is indicated. Stage 1 hypertension is 140–159 mm Hg systolic or 90–99 mm Hg diastolic, lifestyle modification is yes, and without compelling indications initial therapy is thiazide-type diuretics for most; may consider ACE inhibitor, ARB, β-blocker, CCB, or combination. Stage 2 hypertension is ≥ 160 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 100 mm Hg diastolic, lifestyle modification is yes, and without compelling indications initial therapy is a 2-drug combination for most (usually thiazide-type diuretic and ACE inhibitor or ARB or β-blocker or CCB). With compelling indications, use drug(s) for the compelling indications, with other antihypertensive drugs (diuretics, ACE inhibitor, ARB, β-blocker, CCB) as needed. Treatment is determined by highest BP category. Treat patients with chronic kidney disease or diabetes to BP goal of less than 130/80 mm Hg. Initial combined therapy should be used cautiously in those at risk for orthostatic hypotension.

Hypertensive emergencies and severe hypertension — acute heart failure (HF) and inpatient management emphasize that in patients with acute HF and severe hypertension, dyspnea improved when systolic blood pressure (SBP) was reduced by 15% (ie, 20 to 40 mm Hg) within 30 minutes without increased adverse events, and strategies to reduce blood pressure (BP) should be more conservative to achieve 25% reduction in the first hour, followed by gradual further reduction within 24 to 48 hours. Antihypertensive drug treatment should be used with extreme caution in hospitalized patients with asymptomatic severe hypertension because spontaneous falls in BP without any antihypertensive agents occur commonly, at a rate of 40% to 50%, and observational studies have shown that initiation or intermittent use of additional IV or oral antihypertensive medications in patients hospitalized for noncardiac conditions are associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality, acute kidney injury (AKI), and prolonged hospital stay; asymptomatic patients with severe hypertension can be treated with careful and frequent monitoring using standing medications and avoiding as-needed medications.

### Management of inpatient elevated blood pressures: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines [^05e5900b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Management of elevated blood pressure (BP) during hospitalization varies widely, with many hospitalized adults experiencing BPs higher than those recommended for the outpatient setting.

Purpose

To systematically identify guidelines on elevated BP management in the hospital.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Guidelines International Network, and specialty society websites from 1 January 2010 to 29 January 2024.

Study Selection

Clinical practice guidelines pertaining to BP management for the adult and older adult populations in ambulatory, emergency department, and inpatient settings.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently screened articles, assessed quality, and extracted data. Disagreements were resolved via consensus. Recommendations on treatment targets, preferred antihypertensive classes, and follow-up were collected for ambulatory and inpatient settings.

Data Synthesis

Fourteen clinical practice guidelines met inclusion criteria (11 were assessed as high-quality per the AGREE II [Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation II] instrument), 11 provided broad BP management recommendations, and 1 each was specific to the emergency department setting, older adults, and hypertensive crises. No guidelines provided goals for inpatient BP or recommendations for managing asymptomatic moderately elevated BP in the hospital. Six guidelines defined hypertensive urgency as BP above 180/120 mm Hg, with hypertensive emergencies requiring the addition of target organ damage. Hypertensive emergency recommendations consistently included use of intravenous antihypertensives in intensive care settings. Recommendations for managing hypertensive urgencies were inconsistent, from expert consensus, and focused on the emergency department. Outpatient treatment with oral medications and follow-up in days to weeks were most often advised. In contrast, outpatient BP goals were clearly defined, varying between 130/80 and 140/90 mm Hg.

Limitation

Exclusion of non-English-language guidelines and guidelines specific to subpopulations.

Conclusion

Despite general consensus on outpatient BP management, guidance on inpatient management of elevated BP without symptoms is lacking, which may contribute to variable practice patterns.

### Management of hypertensive crisis: British and Irish hypertension society position document [^030dffe6]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Where to treat?

Admission to high dependency unit or facility providing frequent BP monitoring and observation and ability to supervise IV medication is recommended, as IV antihypertensive agents are generally used to titrate doses to BP targets in most cases. Involvement of the relevant specialist teams is essential to provide comprehensive proficient management of the patient.

An important principle is that a rapid lowering of BP can be more damaging to the patient than no change at all. Most guidelines are based on expert opinion, or retrospective, observational non-randomised studies. ICH and severe pre-eclampsia are an exception to this, where larger randomised control trials (RCTs) have been undertaken (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2) for both target BP, and choice of drug. Multiple factors affect pooling of these results in emergency states and hence their usefulness and application in guiding local policies has been limited. Importantly RCTs conducted in hypertensive emergencies states have largely excluded patients with extremely high BP (typically > 220 mmHg SBP and/or > 110 mmHg DBP). Moreover, most trials, set a BP target level/cut off, which fundamentally is flawed in principle if one considers the autoregulation theory described above.

Overall, there is an agreement in all international guidelines that the aim in the first 6–24 h is a controlled but only partial reduction of the MAP: no more than 20–25% and usually a fall in DBP of 10–15% or to ~110 mmHg, whilst aiming to maintain the DBP above 100 mmHg except in acute aortic syndromes. However, where there is evidence of chronic HTN, an even slower reduction in BP may be indicated to avoid rapid shifts in autoregulation. It is crucial to assess urine output, acid-base balance, renal function tests, and neurological state to ensure adequate end-organ perfusion.

If acute target organ damage is absent, management of severe hypertension includes "Evaluate INP vs OPT treatment depending on indication(s) other than BP alone", "Avoid parenteral BP lowering therapy or intensified oral therapy in the acute setting", and for outpatients "No need to refer to ED. Reinstitute and intensify or modify medical therapy in the OPT setting" with "Close follow-up in the OPT setting in 4 weeks".

### Characteristics, practice patterns, and outcomes in patients with acute hypertension: European registry for studying the treatment of acute hyperTension (euro-STAT) [^7d06f99c]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Over 1 billion people worldwide are estimated to have hypertension, which increases their risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and organ injury. One percent of all hypertensive patients experience at least one episode of acute, severe hypertension, necessitating intravenous (IV) antihypertensive therapy and placing these patients at risk of overt, acute end-organ damage over their lifetime. The actual prevalence may in fact be much higher. One-fourth of patients who present to busy emergency departments (EDs) have acute, severe hypertension. In the present study, we defined this population by using a pragmatic approach according to whether the treating physicians decided to use IV antihypertensive therapy.

Multiple effective strategies are used for the management of chronic hypertension, but less is known about treating patients who present with acute, severe elevations in arterial blood pressure (BP). The optimal target for BP lowering has yet to be defined; the definitions of hypertensive urgencies, emergencies and outcome measures lack uniformity; evidence supporting the use of one drug over another is lacking; and whether certain treatments are better than others is unknown. As a consequence, treatment practices vary. The European registry for Studying the Treatment of Acute hyperTension (Euro-STAT) was conducted to evaluate 'real-life' management practices and outcomes in patients treated with IV antihypertensive therapy for an episode of acute hypertension.

### The CRASH report: emergency management dilemmas facing acute physicians in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^40f7467a]. Thorax (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment of acute emergencies in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) can be challenging. In the UK and Ireland, management of adult patients with PAH is centred in eight nationally designated pulmonary hypertension (PH) centres. However, many patients live far from these centres and physicians in local hospitals are often required to manage PAH emergencies. A committee of physicians from nationally designated PH centres identified the 'most common' emergency clinical scenarios encountered in patients with PAH. Thereafter, a review of the literature was performed centred on these specified topics and a management approach was developed based on best available evidence and expert consensus. Management protocols were developed on the following PAH emergencies: chest pain (including myocardial ischaemia), right ventricular failure, arrhythmias, sepsis, haemoptysis ('CRASH'), as well as considerations relevant to surgery, anaesthesia and pregnancy. Emergencies are not uncommon in PAH. While expertise in PAH management is essential, all physicians involved in acute care should be aware of the principles of acute management of PAH emergencies. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary, with physicians from tertiary PH centres supporting care locally and planning safe transfer of patients to PH centres when appropriate.

BIHS position: Management of hypertension associated with phaeochromocytoma/adrenergic crisis.

Patients with 'extremely high BP' may have intravascular volume depletion due to pressure natriuresis, fluid balance should be managed carefully while avoiding volume overload. The dose of antihypertensive agents should be titrated carefully against BP response. Invasive monitoring, where used, should be correlated with non-invasive monitoring (SBP differs between the brachial and radial artery).

The aim of the next section is to summarise specific practice points in relation to each hypertensive emergency state. Management of acute kidney injury (AKI) as a standalone acute EOD has not been covered specifically here as it tends to overlap with MHT and other emergency states. Prevention of iatrogenic AKI is a key consideration in management of hypertensive emergencies and nephrologists should be involved at an early stage for patients presenting with AKI. For further details on management, refer to relevant national (NG148, NG203) and international guidelines for management of AKI, HTN with chronic kidney disease, and HTN associated with glomerular diseases.

Uncomplicated acute severe hypertension

NICE guidelines recommend referring patients with BP ≥ 180/120 mmHg to ED for a same-day assessment, when patients have features suggestive of acute EOD or suspicion of phaeochromocytoma, whilst recommending a repeat BP measurement reading within a week for all patients with severe HTN without EOD (acute and chronic). Similarly, both the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Society of HTN (ESH) guidelines state no indication for referral to the ED, nor for an immediate reduction in BP in hospital, in uncomplicated severe HTN.

During the treatment of HTN-naïve patients, it is important to ensure that confounding factors like pain, anxiety and distress are identified and addressed while assessing for acute EOD. Ambulatory BP monitoring, and/or home BP monitoring may be appropriate for some patients to investigate the persistence of elevated BP whereas in practice, close ambulatory/inpatient observation, and starting oral therapy are undertaken for many patients, particularly in a subgroup of patients such as those who do not have access to follow-up, access to home BP monitoring, pregnancy, or associated co-morbidities that may contribute to subsequent deterioration. If there is a strong suspicion of underlying nonadherence, biochemical testing, and/or directly observed therapy may be appropriate.

In patients with severe HTN without life-threatening EOD, BP should be reduced over days to weeks, rather than hours, and managed with oral therapy rather than IV (Fig. 1 a, b, Tables 2 and 3).

Hypertensive emergencies — risk and approach for severe hypertension without target organ damage: Patients with hypertensive emergencies experience a high in-hospital mortality rate of 10% with a 1-year cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rate of 20% to 30%. In contrast, patients with severe hypertension without evidence of acute target organ damage (previously called hypertensive urgency) should not have aggressive BP lowering in the short-term or be given parenteral antihypertensive drug therapy, and reinstitution or intensification of oral antihypertensive medications, preferably in the outpatient setting, is recommended for these patients.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: failing to consider primary aldosteronism in the initial evaluation of hypertension, hypertensive urgency, and hypertensive emergency [^e3070de5]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hypertension is frequently treated as essential hypertension. However, secondary causes of hypertension should be considered, because distinct treatments are used for different causes of hypertension. Primary aldosteronism is considered a candidate for the most common cause of secondary hypertension. Despite the effects of many antihypertensive agents on the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, ongoing efforts to manage hypertension should not be discontinued solely for the purposes of screening. If a patient presents with new or untreated hypertension, screening should be considered before starting antihypertensive agents that could affect the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system.

### ISHLT consensus statement: perioperative management of patients with pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure undergoing surgery [^716c8e83]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2022). High credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) — emergency surgery and preoperative planning highlight that emergency surgery is associated with worse perioperative outcomes and, in non-cardiac surgery in patients with PH, is an independent risk factor for perioperative mortality (mortality 15%-50%). Emergency surgery typically cannot be postponed even in the face of a high surgical risk, so emergency echocardiography should be arranged and plans for the anesthetic approach and management of PH specific medications should be quickly established and communicated. If the patient is at very high perioperative mortality based on advanced PH disease and intermediate to high-risk surgery, urgent transfer to a PH center with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) capabilities should be discussed, and patient selection for ECMO support in this situation depends heavily on the patient's age, likelihood of recovery, and transplant candidacy. Key preoperative directives include that a systematic preoperative risk assessment should be performed and an individualized perioperative plan developed by a multidisciplinary team, that patients with WHO Group 1 PAH should have surgery performed at a PH expert center, that in moderate to high-risk cases consideration should be given to preoperative invasive hemodynamic assessment, that if time permits medical and hemodynamic optimization should be attempted prior to surgery in patients with evidence of decompensated PH/RVF, and that unless surgery is urgently needed patients with previously undiagnosed PH should have an expedited evaluation to establish etiology, assess disease severity, and guide treatment according to evidence-based PH guidelines.

Background

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is characterized by increased pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressure and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This narrative review evaluates PH, outlines the complex pathophysiologic derangements, and addresses the emergency department (ED) management of this patient population.

Discussion

Approximately 10–20% of individuals in the United States suffer from PH. Each year nearly 12,000 PH patients seek care in the ED for a variety of symptoms which may or may not be related to PH. There are 5 classes of PH, some of which respond to particular therapies outlined in this review. As presenting complaints are frequently vague and non-specific, emergency physicians must recognize manifestations of PH and complications related to PH to deliver appropriate care. Early imaging with chest radiograph, bedside echocardiogram, and computed tomography can assist in determining the underlying etiology of PH exacerbation. Restarting oral or intravenous PH medications that may have been discontinued is crucial in initial management. Immense care should be taken to avoid hypoxia and hypercarbia as well as maintaining right ventricular preload support. In addition to correction of underlying precipitants, judicious vasopressor and inotrope use can help to correct pathophysiology and avoid further airway intervention.

Conclusions

An understanding of the pathophysiology of PH and available emergency treatments can assist emergency clinicians in reducing the immediate morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Restarting maintenance PH medications and proper selection of vasopressors and inotropes will benefit decompensating patients with PH.

A 50-year-old man presents to the emergency department with epigastric pain and is found to have severe hypertension on clinical examination. After admission to hospital, further investigation with CT imaging reveals the patient has an uncomplicated splenic artery dissection. Conservative management is chosen as advised by a vascular surgery team and the patient was subsequently discharged from hospital with warfarin anticoagulation and antihypertensive medicines. This case report aims to build a profile of a patient who may present with splenic artery dissection and details our recommended management plan.

Another important consideration is race in antihypertensive medication selection. African American patients have higher risk of treatment resistant hypertension and are more likely to require more agents for adequate control. To this end, current guidelines promote the use of dual drug antihypertensive drug therapy. Recommended treatment is a combination drug therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker combined with a calcium channel blocker or thiazide diuretic.

Our recommendations are consistent with the 2013 American College of Emergency Physicians' (ACEP) clinical policy which, based on expert opinion and panel consensus, states that in order to gradually lower BP and/or facilitate chronic BP management, "emergency physicians may choose to initiate hypertension treatment for markedly elevated BP" (defined as SBP ≥ 180 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg based on expert opinion). The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines similarly note that prompt management of very high BP is important to limit the risk of target-organ damage. Additionally, clinicians should consider factors such as poor primary care follow-up, geriatric patients, or patients at greater risk for adverse outcomes from elevated hypertension such as African American patients in making ED prescribing decisions. Prescribing antihypertensive medication in the ED setting is effective and can be done safely. Additional resources include mobile health follow-up and engagement, home BP monitor, and community health workers.
