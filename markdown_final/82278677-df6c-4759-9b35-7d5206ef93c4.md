## Question

risk factor by itsself indication for gi prophylaxis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which single risk factor, by itself, is sufficient to indicate gastrointestinal prophylaxis across common clinical contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenarios where "GI prophylaxis" is relevant: stress ulcer prophylaxis in critical illness, NSAID-associated upper GI injury, and antiplatelet/anticoagulant-related bleeding risk. Then, I should verify which risk factors in each scenario are strong enough alone to mandate prophylaxis. Next, I will cross-check for exceptions and nuances, including age thresholds, concomitant medications, and competing risks. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable answer with the clearest single risk factor that consistently triggers prophylaxis across guidelines and labels.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts and definitions so I don't conflate indications. GI prophylaxis here refers to acid suppression to prevent stress-related mucosal bleeding in the ICU, gastroprotection to prevent NSAID- or aspirin-related ulcers and bleeding, and mitigation of bleeding risk with antithrombotic therapy; I need to ensure I'm not mixing these with antibiotic prophylaxis for endoscopy or cirrhosis, which are different questions entirely.

> Now, for stress ulcer prophylaxis in critical illness, I should verify which single risk factors are sufficient. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggests stress ulcer prophylaxis for adults with sepsis or septic shock who have risk factors, and contemporary ICU guidance emphasizes targeting high-risk patients rather than universal prophylaxis. The strongest, repeatedly cited independent risk factors are mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours and coagulopathy, with additional high-risk states including severe traumatic brain injury, burns, and persistent shock or multiorgan failure, so mechanical ventilation beyond 48 hours or coagulopathy alone are typically sufficient to start prophylaxis in ICU practice [^114rTuFT] [^11383i3H] [^111xaey7].

> Wait, let me verify the NSAID context next, because I need to check whether any single risk factor mandates PPI co-therapy. Multiple guidelines converge on the same high-risk markers: prior peptic ulcer disease or prior GI bleeding, age 65 years or older, concomitant anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy (especially dual antiplatelet therapy or aspirin plus anticoagulant), high-dose NSAID use, and concomitant corticosteroids; importantly, prior ulcer bleeding carries a greater than 10-fold increased risk and is universally considered an indication for gastroprotection when NSAIDs are necessary, and advanced age alone is commonly used as a threshold for prophylaxis in practice [^1122mWiL] [^112RkpuG] [^1171ADKu] [^116zb5po].

> Hold on, I should verify the antiplatelet/anticoagulant scenario separately, since the balance differs from NSAIDs. In patients requiring antiplatelet therapy, especially dual antiplatelet therapy or aspirin plus an oral anticoagulant, guidelines recommend PPI gastroprotection because the bleeding risk is materially elevated; similarly, after ulcer bleeding in patients who must continue antiplatelet therapy, early resumption of aspirin with PPI reduces mortality despite higher rebleeding risk, reinforcing that the combination of antiplatelet therapy with high GI risk is a situation where prophylaxis is indicated [^1122mWiL] [^11542xSX] [^113tfDio].

> I will now examine whether any single factor cleanly stands out across these domains. Prior peptic ulcer bleeding is the clearest, consistently cited standalone indication for GI prophylaxis whenever NSAIDs or antiplatelet therapy are necessary, given the dramatic increase in rebleeding risk; in critical illness, mechanical ventilation beyond 48 hours or coagulopathy are the most robust single triggers for stress ulcer prophylaxis; and in antithrombotic therapy, the combination of antiplatelet therapy with additional GI risk (such as age or prior ulcer) justifies prophylaxis, with prior ulcer bleeding again tipping the scale decisively [^1122mWiL] [^112RkpuG] [^114rTuFT] [^111xaey7].

> But wait, what if someone argues for age alone as the single factor? Let me reconsider and double-check the strength of evidence. Age 65 years or older is widely used as a threshold for NSAID gastroprotection and is endorsed by major guidance, yet it sits alongside other single high-risk features such as concomitant anticoagulant or corticosteroid therapy; while clinically accepted, it is slightly less absolute than prior ulcer bleeding in terms of risk magnitude and unanimity across sources, so if I must pick the single strongest factor, prior ulcer bleeding edges out age for its > 10-fold risk amplification and consistent guideline endorsement [^1122mWiL] [^112RkpuG] [^1171ADKu].

> I should confirm practical implementation details so the recommendation is actionable. For NSAID users with prior ulcer bleeding, preferred strategies include a COX-2 inhibitor plus PPI or, if a nonselective NSAID is required, mandatory PPI co-therapy; for antiplatelet therapy in high GI risk, add a PPI; for ICU patients with mechanical ventilation beyond 48 hours or coagulopathy, initiate PPI stress ulcer prophylaxis and reassess daily for ongoing need, with de-escalation when risk factors resolve to avoid unnecessary acid suppression [^1122mWiL] [^114rTuFT] [^11383i3H].

> Final answer, keeping the synthesis tight: Prior peptic ulcer bleeding is the single risk factor that, by itself, most consistently and strongly indicates GI prophylaxis when NSAIDs or antiplatelet therapy are used, given its greater than 10-fold increase in rebleeding risk and universal endorsement across guidelines. In critical illness, mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours or coagulopathy each independently justify stress ulcer prophylaxis. And in antithrombotic regimens, the combination of antiplatelet therapy with additional GI risk (notably prior ulcer or advanced age) warrants PPI gastroprotection to mitigate bleeding risk [^1122mWiL] [^112RkpuG] [^114rTuFT] [^111xaey7].

A single risk factor can justify GI prophylaxis when it confers **high risk of bleeding** [^112RkpuG] and the benefit of prophylaxis outweighs risks. The clearest example is a **history of peptic ulcer bleeding** [^1122mWiL]; if NSAIDs, aspirin, or anticoagulants are required, prophylaxis is indicated [^1122mWiL]. Other high-risk factors include age ≥ 65, concomitant anticoagulants or corticosteroids, and multiple antiplatelet agents [^1122mWiL]; prophylaxis is recommended when these are present with NSAIDs or aspirin [^1122mWiL]. In the ICU, mechanical ventilation > 48 hours or coagulopathy alone can justify stress ulcer prophylaxis [^111xaey7] [^111xaey7]. Routine prophylaxis is not indicated for a single low-risk factor, such as age alone without other risks [^notfound].

## Risk factors warranting GI prophylaxis

Several risk factors independently confer sufficient risk to **justify GI prophylaxis**:

| **Risk factor** | **Clinical context** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| History of peptic ulcer bleeding | NSAID or aspirin use; anticoagulant therapy | High [^1122mWiL] |
| Age ≥ 65 years | NSAID or aspirin use | High [^1122mWiL] |
| Concomitant anticoagulant therapy | NSAID or aspirin use | High [^1122mWiL] [^112RkpuG] |
| Concomitant corticosteroid therapy | NSAID or aspirin use | High [^1122mWiL] [^112RkpuG] |
| Multiple antiplatelet agents (e.g. dual antiplatelet therapy) | Antiplatelet therapy | High [^1122mWiL] |
| Mechanical ventilation > 48 hours | ICU patients | High [^111xaey7] [^114sAqaK] |
| Coagulopathy (INR > 1.5, platelets < 50,000) | ICU patients | High [^111xaey7] [^114sAqaK] |

## Clinical scenarios where a single risk factor justifies prophylaxis

### NSAID or aspirin use

- **History of peptic ulcer bleeding**: A prior ulcer bleed increases NSAID-associated GI bleed risk > 10-fold [^1171ADKu]; prophylaxis is indicated if NSAIDs or aspirin are required [^1122mWiL].
- **Age ≥ 65 years**: Older age independently increases GI bleeding risk with NSAIDs or aspirin; prophylaxis is recommended [^1122mWiL] [^112RkpuG].
- **Concomitant anticoagulant therapy**: Anticoagulants markedly increase GI bleeding risk with NSAIDs or aspirin; prophylaxis is advised [^1122mWiL] [^112RkpuG].
- **Concomitant corticosteroid therapy**: Corticosteroids increase GI bleeding risk with NSAIDs or aspirin; prophylaxis is recommended [^1122mWiL] [^112RkpuG].
- **Multiple antiplatelet agents**: Dual antiplatelet therapy increases GI bleeding risk; prophylaxis is indicated [^1122mWiL].

---

### ICU patients

In ICU patients, **mechanical ventilation > 48 hours** is a strong independent risk factor for stress-related GI bleeding; prophylaxis is recommended [^114rTuFT] [^112sMz11]. Coagulopathy — with INR > 1.5, platelets < 50,000, or PTT > 2× normal — also justifies stress ulcer prophylaxis [^114rTuFT] [^112sMz11].

---

## Risk factors that do not independently warrant prophylaxis

Certain risk factors alone **do not justify routine prophylaxis**:

- **Age < 65 years without other risk factors**: Low risk; prophylaxis not indicated [^1122mWiL].
- **Single antiplatelet agent without other risk factors**: Generally low risk; prophylaxis not indicated [^1122mWiL] [^111ZUvuE].
- **Corticosteroid therapy alone without NSAIDs or aspirin**: No clear indication for prophylaxis [^1112EQkW] [^114rjXvZ].

---

## Balance of benefits and risks

Prophylaxis reduces GI bleeding [^114rTuFT] but carries risks (e.g. C. difficile, pneumonia, fractures) [^112KFGax]; decisions should **individualize the risk–benefit balance** [^114VssRA].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines consistently support prophylaxis for high-risk patients, including those with prior ulcer bleeding, older age, anticoagulant or corticosteroid co-therapy, and ICU patients with prolonged ventilation or coagulopathy [^1122mWiL] [^114rTuFT] [^112RkpuG].

---

A single high-risk factor — notably prior peptic ulcer bleeding, age ≥ 65 with NSAID/aspirin use, concomitant anticoagulant or corticosteroid therapy, multiple antiplatelet agents, or ICU factors such as mechanical ventilation > 48 hours or coagulopathy — **can justify GI prophylaxis**. Routine prophylaxis is not indicated for a single low-risk factor.

Figure 1
Algorithm for long-term NSAID therapy according to a patient's GI and CV risk factors.

In patients with high GI risk, testing for and eradicating H. pylori should be considered, but will be insufficient without ongoing gastroprotection. In these patients, if CV risk is low, a COX-2 selective inhibitor alone or ns-NSAID with a PPI appear to offer similar protection from upper GI events. However, according to recent evidence, only celecoxib will reduce mucosal harm throughout the entire (upper and lower) GI tract. This agent should be combined with a PPI in patients at very high risk of upper GI bleeding. When both GI and CV risks are high, the optimal strategy is to avoid NSAID therapy, if at all possible. If the NSAID therapy is deemed necessary, the therapeutic approach will depend on co-medication. If the patient is not on antiplatelet therapy (because, for instance, the benefits of primary prevention have been considered not to outweigh the risks), either naproxen or low-dose celecoxib could be considered, but should be combined with a PPI, while this COX-2 selective agent seems the most appropriate choice in patients on low-dose aspirin. It should be emphasized that the suggested algorithm should be viewed as a "general guidance", which needs to be tailored to the individual patient, taking into account co-morbidities and co-therapies.

### Clinical practice guidelines for Clostridium difficile infection in adults and children: 2017 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) [^112KFGax]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) risk factors — antibiotic exposure and acid-suppressing medications are highlighted with timing and recurrence data. Receipt of antibiotics increases the risk of CDI, the disruption of the intestinal microbiota is long-lasting with risk increasing during therapy and in the 3-month period following cessation, and the highest risk (7- to 10-fold increase) is during and in the first month after antibiotic exposure; longer or multiple antibiotic courses increase risk, and even single-dose surgical prophylaxis increases C. difficile colonization and symptomatic disease. In a retrospective study of 754 patients with healthcare-associated CDI, continuous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use was independently associated with a 50% increased risk for recurrence, whereas reexposure to antibiotics was associated with only a 30% increased risk; PPIs and histamine-2 blockers may be associated with CDI when comparing cases to nontested controls but not when comparing cases to tested-negative controls. For recurrence and severity, identified risk factors include advanced age, antibiotics during follow-up, PPI, strain type, and previous fluoroquinolones; risk factors for complicated disease include older age, leukocytosis, renal failure and comorbidities, while risk factors for mortality include age, comorbidities, hypoalbuminemia, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and infection with ribotype 027; low vitamin D levels are noted as an independent risk factor across several patient groups.

### Stress-induced ulcer bleeding in critically ill patients [^114sAqaK]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Increased knowledge of risk factors and improved ICU care has decreased the incidence of stress-related bleeding. Not all critically ill patients need prophylaxis for SRMD and withholding such prophylaxis in suitable low-risk candidates is a reasonable and cost-effective approach. Mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours and coagulopathy are the main risk factors for stress-induced upper GI bleeding. Although intravenous H2RAs can prevent clinically important bleeding, their benefits seem to be limited by the rapid development of tolerance. The availability of intravenous formulations of PPIs makes it possible to critically compare their prophylactic efficacy and safety to different classes of acid-suppressive agents, such as H2RAs, in critically ill patients. The appropriate dose of PPI and the role of newer PPI formulations need to be further defined along with proposed guidelines for the use of intravenous and oral/enteral formulations of PPIs in patients at risk for stress-related mucosal damage.

### Guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis for GI endoscopy [^11758yaQ]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

This is one of a series of statements discussing the utilization of GI endoscopy in common clinical situations. The Standards of Practice Committee of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy prepared this text. In preparing this guideline, a MEDLINE literature search was performed, and additional references were obtained from the bibliographies of the identified articles and from recommendations of expert consultants. When little or no data exist from well-designed prospective trials, emphasis is given to results from large series and reports from recognized experts. Guidelines for appropriate utilization of endoscopy are based on a critical review of the available data and expert consensus. Further controlled clinical studies are needed to clarify aspects of this statement, and revision may be necessary as new data appear. Clinical consideration may justify a course of action at variance to these recommendations.

### Meloxicam (Xifyrm) [^111if8QJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2	Gastrointestinal Effects- Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including meloxicam, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with XIFYRM. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2–4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short- term NSAID therapy is not without risk.

Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:

- Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.

- Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.

- Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.

- Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.

- If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue XIFYRM until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.

- In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Aspirin — primary prophylaxis remarks indicate that aspirin slightly reduces total mortality regardless of cardiovascular risk profile if taken over 10 years; in people at moderate to high risk of cardiovascular events, the reduction in myocardial infarction (MI) is closely balanced with an increase in major bleeding events, and individuals who value preventing an MI substantially higher than avoiding a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, if they are in the moderate or high cardiovascular risk strata, will be more likely to choose aspirin for primary prophylaxis.

### Individualized prevention of proton pump inhibitor related adverse events by risk stratification [^114VssRA]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Given the links with a substantial global disease burden and the high rate of inappropriate overuse of PPIs (up to 70%), the potential impact of long-term PPI use should not be ignored, even if the causal effects for these outcomes have not been established. In practice, the net risk of PPI-related adverse effects is low in those with low baseline risk, but it is not negligible and the risk profile may change over time. Personalized prevention is feasible by regular evaluating the baseline risk with readily available predictive factors for long-term PPI users while focusing on the high-risk patients. For high-risk individuals, potential effective strategies, such as dose reduction, discontinuation, transitioning to "on-demand" use, considering less profound acid suppressants like H2RAs, and regular monitoring for early indications of adverse events (e.g. blood glucose levels for the risk of diabetes,), may help mitigate the additional absolute risk associated with PPI use.

Further research is still required to (1) confirm the causal effects of PPIs on disease risk through RCT-based meta-analysis; (2) improve and validate the performance of prediction models for multiple PPI-related adverse effects; (3) investigate the appropriate cut-off value for defining high-risk population; (4) evaluate the effectiveness of the risk stratification strategy. These research avenues have the potential to refine clinical practices and optimize PPI use, ensuring a balanced approach between therapeutic benefits and potential risks in diverse patient populations.

In conclusion, long-term use of PPIs is likely to be associated with a wide range of high-burden diseases. Although it remains unclear whether these associations are causal, its impacts should not be ignored due to potential links with heavy disease burden. The risk stratification approach by individualized using of PPIs after evaluating the PPI-related risk, may be an effective strategy to reduce potential risks as well as fears among patients.

### Approaches to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use in the high-risk patient [^116K9crp]. Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are probably the most common cause of gastroduodenal injury in the United States today. Approximately half of patients who regularly take NSAIDs have gastric erosions, and 15%-30% have ulcers when they are examined endoscopically. However, the incidence of clinical gastrointestinal (GI) events caused by NSAIDs is much lower. Clinical upper GI events may occur in 3%-4.5% of patients taking NSAIDs, and serious complicated events develop in approximately 1.5%. However, the risk varies widely in relationship to clinical features such as history of ulcers or GI events, age, concomitant anticoagulant or steroid use, and NSAID dose. This review discusses the risks of clinical GI disease in NSAID users, the predictors of increased risk, and strategies for prevention of NSAID-associated GI disease.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2008). Medium credibility.

AHA infective endocarditis (IE) prophylaxis — scope and consequences of revisions — states that 'substantially fewer patients will be recommended for IE prophylaxis' and that 'Substantive changes in recommendations could (1) violate long-standing expectations and practice patterns, (2) make fewer patients eligible for IE prophylaxis, (3) reduce malpractice claims related to IE prophylaxis and (4) stimulate prospective studies on IE prophylaxis'. The document explains that prior AHA guidelines 'contained ambiguities and inconsistencies and often were based on minimal published data or expert opinion' and that 'Cases of IE either temporally or remotely associated with an invasive procedure, especially a dental procedure, have frequently been the basis for malpractice claims against health care providers'. It further notes that the document 'is intended to identify which, if any, patients may possibly benefit from IE prophylaxis and to define, to the extent possible, which dental procedures should have prophylaxis in this select group of patients' and that recommendations 'must be evidence-based'; a 'placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded study to evaluate the efficacy of IE prophylaxis in patients who undergo a dental, GI or GU tract procedure has not been done' and such a study 'would require a large number of patients per treatment group'.

### American College of Gastroenterology-Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: management of anticoagulants and antiplatelets during acute gastrointestinal bleeding and the periendoscopic period [^114CMwnw]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary of evidence.

For this recommendation, no eligible studies specifically addressing patients with GI bleeding were identified by literature searches. The observational studies identified were cohort studies without a comparator arm, or the study did not report separate results for clinical outcomes in patients with GI bleeding. It is thus not possible to infer with any certainty whether administering FFP can benefit, harm, or make no difference in these patients compared with no reversal.

Pertinent studies included a small cohort of 41 warfarin-treated patients requiring rapid reversal, with 12 receiving FFP, 29 receiving clotting factor concentrates, and all receiving vitamin K 1–5 mg intravenously. No clinical outcomes were measured, but in the 12 patients given FFP, the international normalized ratio (INR) did not normalize (range 1.6–3.8, mean 2.3), indicating an ongoing anticoagulated state in all patients. In a case-control study of 267 patients with major bleeding prescribed VKA for venous thromboembolism, 78 patients had GI bleeding, but no results were reported for the GI bleeding outcomes. In a multivariable analysis that failed to adjust sufficiently for confounding, FFP use was associated with a higher risk of thrombotic events (OR: 4.22; 95% CI: 1.25–14.3).

Three additional RCTs which lacked the comparator of interest (i.e. placebo) provide cohort-type data that further inform this recommendation. Sarode et al. randomized 202 patients on a VKA with an INR ≥ 2.0 and major bleeding to FFP (n = 104) vs 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), while both arms received vitamin K (5–10 mg intravenously). In the FFP arm, 58 patients had GI bleeding with excellent or good hemostatic efficacy achieved in 75.9%. Additional outcome measures were reported only for all-cause bleeding and included thrombotic events in 7 of 109, mortality in 6 of 103, rapid INR reduction in 10 of 109, and fluid overload after 10–45 days in 14 of 109. Smaller RCTs by Steiner et al. (N = 50, 23 in the FFP arm) and Boulis et al. (N = 13, 8 in the FFP arm) assessed patients with intracranial hemorrhage, reporting thromboembolic events in 2 of 23 and 1 of 8 patients, respectively, and an INR ≤ 2 within 3 hours of treatment in 2 of 23 patients; significant complications from fluid overload were noted in 5 of 8 patients.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2008). Medium credibility.

American Heart Association infective endocarditis (IE) prophylaxis decision context — underlying cardiac conditions and dental, gastrointestinal (GI), or genitourinary (GU) procedures: Underlying cardiac conditions are described as representing a lifetime increased risk of acquisition of IE, and when using previous AHA guidelines to decide on IE prophylaxis for a patient scheduled for a dental, GI or GU tract procedure, clinicians were required to base decisions on population-based studies of IE acquisition risk. Clinicians also had to weigh the potential efficacy of IE prophylaxis against the risk of adverse reaction to the antibiotic prescribed and consider medicolegal risk, with the guideline noting for dental procedures that IE prophylaxis may prevent only an exceedingly small number of IE cases.

### Improving on our goal to reduce NSAID-induced GI complications: a challenging task? [^1143RFVZ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

A large number of at-risk patients treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) do not receive prophylaxis for gastrointestinal (GI) complications. The combination of a 10-min physician educational intervention and a computer alert has been proved to increase the rate of prescribing gastroprotective therapy for high-risk patients who receive ulcerogenic drugs at hospital discharge from 45% to 67%. This improvement is remarkable; still, more than 30% of these high-risk patients did not receive appropriate therapy. Considering that most patients who receive NSAIDs are outpatients treated by generalists, and considering that adherence may be poor and self-medication with NSAIDs is common among patients with GI risk factors, closing the gap between patients treated with NSAIDs who do and do not receive adequate GI prophylaxis is a challenging endeavor. In order to more effectively pursue this goal, we will need to develop new and more complex approaches.

Regarding preventative measures for febrile neutropenia, more specifically with respect to G-CSFs, indications, ASCO 2015 guidelines recommend to initiate primary prophylaxis with a colony-stimulating factor starting in the first cycle and continuing through subsequent cycles of chemotherapy in patients with an approximately 20% or higher risk for FN based on patient-, disease-, and treatment-related factors. Administer primary colony-stimulating factor prophylaxis in patients receiving dose-dense chemotherapy when appropriate. Consider alternative, equally effective, and safe chemotherapy regimens not requiring colony-stimulating factor support when available.

Perioperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) risk screening — "Antiemetic prophylaxis should be guided by preoperative screening for risk factors for postoperative nausea/ vomiting. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B". The incidence of PONV in postanesthesia care units is "≈30%", rising "as high as 80%" with documented risk factors. A single-center, cluster-randomized trial of "12,032 elective surgical patients" found that implementing a PONV prediction model without specific prophylaxis recommendations "did not reduce the PONV incidence", whereas a subsequent prospective study that combined risk assessment with a specific antiemetic recommendation "showed a significant reduction in PONV in all patients, with an even greater reduction in high-risk patients".

### An evidence-based approach to the gastrointestinal safety profile of COX-2-selective anti-inflammatories [^113AUQtk]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine (EBM) provides frameworks for the systematic review of study methodology and results. Thus, EBM frameworks facilitate assessing a study's ability to produce unbiased and accurate results and applying the results to the management of individual patients. Using EBM frameworks, published literature about risk factors for serious NSAID-associated gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, GI safety of COX-2 selective NSAIDs, and GI safety of co-therapy of proton pump inhibitors and NSAIDs are reviewed. This article concludes with evidence-based recommendations concerning which patients are at high risk for serious NSAID-associated GI disorders and which therapies are most effective in reducing serious NSAID-associated GI disorders.

### ACG clinical guideline: upper gastrointestinal and ulcer bleeding [^113EDxhr]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — post-endoscopy proton pump inhibitor (PPI) regimen in high-risk ulcer bleeding — Evidence led the panel to a conditional recommendation for twice-daily PPI until 2 weeks after index endoscopy in this population; after 2 weeks, the regimen used in the single relevant RCT switched patients to a 2-week course of once-daily PPI; and the conclusion states that twice-daily PPI therapy from days 4–14 after index endoscopy reduces further bleeding compared with once-daily PPI in high-risk patients who received endoscopic therapy followed by 3 days of high-dose PPI therapy.

### Celecoxib (Celebrex) [^116jihtL]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants; or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

Complicated and symptomatic ulcer rates were 0.78% at nine months for all patients in the CLASS trial, and 2.19% for the subgroup on low-dose ASA. Patients 65 years of age and older had an incidence of 1.40% at nine months, 3.06% when also taking ASA [see Clinical Studies (14.7)].

Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated Patients:

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.
Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.
Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.
Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.
If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue CELEBREX until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.
In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Risk factors for patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^113oTUFZ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Building on risk factor evidence from prior trials and many other study designs, in this study, we use time-to-event modeling to assess events and exposures in the ICU while adjusting for illness severity and the competing risk of death to examine patient-important bleeding. Challenges interpreting studies of risk factors for clinically important upper gastrointestinal bleeding relate to different populations enrolled (influencing the profile and prevalence of each risk factor), risk factors themselves (various putative risk factors considered, alternate or unclear definitions), bleeding endpoints (different outcomes, different definitions, or ascertainment methods of the same outcome), and analytic methods (e.g. univariable analyses, overfitted multivariable models with low outcome event rates). It is also challenging in the current and prior studies to know whether risk factors predispose patients to bleeding, perpetuate the duration of bleeding, potentiate the severity of bleeding, or a combination thereof.

Although gastrointestinal bleeding in the ICU has an attributable mortality and can be fatal, in most cases it is recognized early, is treated, and does not result in death. In the REVISE trial, pantoprazole did not decrease the risk of death (HR, 0.94 [95% CI = 0.85, 1.04]), aligned with a meta-analysis of 12 trials (relative risk, 0.99 [95% CI = 0.93, 1.05]). Subgroup analysis of this meta-analysis raised the possibility that pantoprazole may be associated with a higher risk of death among patients with greater illness severity compared those with lower illness severity (effect modification between low and moderate credibility). By contrast, the effectiveness of pantoprazole at reducing bleeding is evidenced, regardless of illness severity. The main analysis incorporated the competing risk of death.

### Practice advisory on the appropriate use of NSAIDs in primary care [^112MFGNY]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

One strategy used to minimize the risk of GI complications involves the coadministration of NSAIDs with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Such coadministration is generally regarded as safe and is recommended in guidelines. However, recent evidence challenging this view suggests that in addition to the adverse effects of PPIs, their coadministration with NSAIDs may potentiate the GI risks of the latter. In particular, PPIs have been shown to alter gut microbiome composition leading to the risk of bacterial overgrowth and contributing to a low-grade, chronic inflammation that can exacerbate NSAID-induced mucosal injury of the small bowel. In some patients at least, the use of PPIs may increase the risk of bone fractures, Clostridium difficile and other enteric infections, and gastric cancer. Extrapolation of results of the CONDOR trial and related studies also suggest that PPI prophylaxis may be unnecessary in some long-term NSAID users. The CONDOR trial evaluated celecoxib compared with diclofenac plus omeprazole in patients with OA and RA. The findings showed that the risk of a clinically significant upper or lower GI event was lower in patients treated with a COX-2 selective NSAID compared with a nonselective NSAID plus PPI. In patients at high risk of GI bleeding, concomitant PPI use remains an appropriate strategy for managing GI risk, particularly when prescribed in accordance with any risk factors. In the MEDAL program, the reduction in uncomplicated GI events with etoricoxib compared with diclofenac was maintained in patients treated with PPIs.

### Diclofenac sodium [^115ewvMB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including diclofenac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk.

### Late cytomegalovirus disease after hematopoietic cell transplantation: significance of novel transplantation techniques [^113rz7VT]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first and most comprehensive study in the present era to specifically analyze risk factors and clinical manifestations of late CMV disease including PET and LET populations. The rate of late CMV disease in the LET group appears to be higher than that reported in a recent meta-analysis, likely due to prolonged follow-up. The finding that PT-Cy was a risk factor for late CMV disease is novel and important because PT-Cy is increasingly used as GVHD prophylaxis. Our results expand upon previous study of PT-Cy and CMV disease risk, which largely targeted early CMV disease events and were restricted to HLA-matched transplants. Letermovir prophylaxis appears to reduce the unfavorable effect of PT-Cy prophylaxis on CMV disease risk, likely due to protection against high levels of CMV viremia before post-HCT day 100, which was one on the main factors increasing the risk of late CMV disease. However, it seems that different transplantation and CMV prevention protocols may influence specific organ involvement of CMV disease, as indicated by the higher incidence of CMV GI disease seen in PT-Cy and mycophenolate mofetil recipients, whereas such association was not observed for patients with pneumonia. This may be related to direct GI toxicity of both drugs as well as the overall higher incidence of viral infections seen with these regimens. Late CMV GI disease was the most common manifestation and primarily affected patients with a history of acute GI GVHD; this observation is consistent with previously published data that showed severe grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD increased the risk of any GI CMV disease.,

We also examined, for the first time, risk factors for recurrent CMV disease and disease risk in the second year after HCT. Administration of high-dose steroid treatment appeared to be the most important factor for prediction of second episode and disease in the second year after HCT. This suggests that prolonged or reinstitution of PCR monitoring is advisable in these situations.

Our data indicate that risk stratification at the time of discharge from the transplant center is insufficient. Dynamic risk stratification and restart of PCR monitoring when immunosuppression increases should be applied to all patients regardless of day 100 stratification, because the high-dose steroid treatment as a time-varying variable was the strongest risk factor for late CMV disease. Community providers caring for patients after transplantation need to remain vigilant in their surveillance for CMV viremia in patients at risk, particularly those who receive novel immunosuppressive therapy prophylactic protocols and also high-dose corticosteroids for treatment of cGVHD.

### Optimizing antithrombotic therapy in patients with coexisting cardiovascular and gastrointestinal disease [^113tfDio]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Balancing the safety and efficacy of antithrombotic agents in patients with gastrointestinal disorders is challenging because of the potential for interference with the absorption of antithrombotic drugs and for an increased risk of bleeding. In this Review, we address considerations for enteral antithrombotic therapy in patients with cardiovascular disease and gastrointestinal comorbidities. For those with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), we summarize a general scheme for risk stratification and clinical evidence on risk reduction approaches, such as limiting the use of concomitant medications that increase the risk of GIB and the potential utility of gastrointestinal protection strategies (such as proton pump inhibitors or histamine type 2 receptor antagonists). Furthermore, we summarize the best available evidence and potential gaps in our knowledge on tailoring antithrombotic therapy in patients with active or recent GIB and in those at high risk of GIB but without active or recent GIB. Finally, we review the recommendations provided by major medical societies, highlighting the crucial role of teamwork and multidisciplinary discussions to customize the antithrombotic regimen in patients with coexisting cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases.

5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

NSAIDs, including FENOPROFEN CALCIUM, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDS. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2%-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — stress ulcer prophylaxis: For adults with sepsis or septic shock, and who have risk factors for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, we suggest using stress ulcer prophylaxis (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). An updated analysis showed no effect on mortality (RR, 1.01 95% CI, 0.93–1.10) and a reduction in GI hemorrhage (RR, 0.52 95% CI, 0.45–0.61); a sensitivity analysis including only trials at low risk of bias provided similar results, and no increase in Clostridioides difficile colitis or pneumonia was observed. The most recent (and largest) RCT did not demonstrate any effect of pantoprazole versus placebo on 90-day mortality and a composite outcome of clinically important events, and a recent meta-analysis suggested a higher risk of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections with proton pump inhibitors.

### Mitigating GI risks associated with the use of NSAIDs [^114VXTG7]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have multiple established adverse effects on various organ systems. Among those associated with high mortality are gastrointestinal complications. We address the scope of the problem and the scientific basis for risk mitigation.

Design

This review covers the most successful of such strategies published to date.

Results

Mitigation strategies to enable ongoing anti-inflammatory benefit are well studied, albeit imperfect.

Conclusions

Such strategies may involve the choice of NSAID or the combined use of gastroprotective measures in association with NSAIDs.

### Approach to outcome measurement in the prevention of thrombosis in surgical and medical patients: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^117Swu96]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Trading off symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) and bleeding — Making recommendations requires deciding on whether net benefit is optimized by administering or withholding antithrombotic prophylaxis. The relevant nonfatal events in medical and surgical prophylaxis are pulmonary embolus, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and gastrointestinal (GI) and surgical site bleeding, and these events were judged to be of similar importance to patients, with DVT slightly less important and pulmonary embolus, GI, and perioperative bleeding very similar. Considering nonfatal events alone, if an antithrombotic regimen prevents more VTE events than it causes bleeding events compared with an alternative, recommendations will favor that regimen; if therapy causes more bleeding events than it prevents VTE events, recommendations will favor withholding or administering less aggressive antithrombotic prophylaxis. Given a constant relative risk reduction in VTE, the former is likely for patient groups at relatively high risk of symptomatic VTE, and for very low risk, the latter. This trade-off approach has important limitations, including ignoring fatalities, as antithrombotic prophylaxis, relative to no prophylaxis, reduces deaths from pulmonary embolus in both medical and surgical patients enrolled in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and may reduce all-cause mortality in surgical patients, and therefore, for decisions regarding which antithrombotic agent or regimen to use, the authors largely base inferences on evidence in nonfatal VTE prevention versus increases in nonfatal bleeding. A further limitation is that the judgment that bleeding events have more or less the same disutility as VTE events is fraught with uncertainty, and because studies of patient values and preferences do not exist, recommending one antithrombotic agent over another requires a substantial benefit-risk gradient between therapies, with a high level of confidence in that gradient.

### Indomethacin for post-ERCP pancreatitis prophylaxis: another attempt at the holy grail [^111WfB3o]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis continues to be the most dreaded complication after ERCP. Various risk factors for post-ERCP pancreatitis have now been recognized including patient-related, procedure-related, and operator-related factors. Numerous attempts at finding the ideal pharmacological agent for prevention of this complication have been made but nearly all drugs evaluated have failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy. Predictably, these agents have shown promise in early single-center studies but met with disappointing results when tested in larger multicenter randomized controlled trials. As the quest for the "magic bullet" continues, selecting patients with appropriate indications for ERCP and prophylactic pancreatic duct stenting in high-risk cases appears to be the best approach to averting this complication.

PPIs for corticosteroid users

Summary of the current evidence

Corticosteroid therapy does not cause damage to the gastroduodenal mucosa, but can enhance the GI risk associated with NSAID use. Therefore, unless patients taking corticosteroid therapy have a PU or are under concomitant NSAID therapy, mucosal protection with a PPI is not routinely indicated.

Contrary to NSAIDs, corticosteroids do not cause any direct injury to the gastroduodenal mucosa, and indeed some experimental evidence actually suggests a mucosal protective effect. These drugs may, however, increase the GI risk of NSAID therapy and may hamper the healing of idiopathic or iatrogenic ulcers. The association between corticosteroid use and GI adverse events in patients with risk factors other than NSAID use remains controversial. Indeed, some studies reported an increased risk of PU complications in corticosteroid users, while other investigators failed to demonstrate such an association after adjustment for confounding factors. A meta-analysis also failed to show any significant risk for gastric or duodenal ulcers in patients receiving corticosteroid treatment compared to controls. It is worthwhile emphasizing that the design of the studies included in the meta-analysis was quite heterogeneous as was the type of patients selected (outpatients or inpatients, presence of comorbidity and co-therapy) as well as PU definition. However, a systematic review of available meta-analyses as well as of published case–control studies reached the same conclusion.

A more recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 159 studies, appeared between 1983 and 2013, on GI bleeding and perforation in corticosteroid users, found that corticosteroid therapy may increase the risk of GI events (OR = 1.43) only in hospitalized patients. Here again, the diversity of GI bleeding definitions (widely varying from occult blood in stool to bleeding requiring transfusion or hospital stay) as well as the heterogeneity of the patients included do not allow drawing clinically relevant conclusions. Taking these considerations into account, no evidence currently supports PPI therapy as prophylaxis for corticosteroid use in the absence of concomitant NSAID therapy.

In summary, PPI co-therapy is not routinely indicated in patients taking corticosteroids unless they have a history of PU or are taking NSAIDs. In hospitalized patients on corticosteroid therapy, prophylaxis against stress ulcers could be limited to those with a history of PU, clotting impairment or requiring mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. Despite corticosteroids increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients with either diverticular disease of the colon or acute ischemic stroke, PPI therapy is not expected to exert any preventive effect on eventual drug-induced GI bleeding in these patients.

### Safe prescribing of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with osteoarthritis – an expert consensus addressing benefits as well as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks [^115gs5XV]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

NSAIDs are an essential part of our therapeutic armamentarium despite their well characterized GI and CV risk profiles. The time is now ripe for offering the patient with OA the safest and most cost-effective therapeutic option, thus preventing serious adverse events, which could have important QoL and resource use implications. The integration of existing guidelines with the present one, together with a careful evaluation of both GI and CV risk factors, should allow clinicians to correctly manage OA patients without expanding the already growing NSAID epidemic. In the future, the potential chemopreventive effects of NSAIDs/coxibs and of low-dose aspirin on GI (as well as non-GI) cancers may impact the benefits and risks equation, observed in the arthritic population, and expand the use of these compounds.

### Risk factors of active upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with COVID-19 infection and the effectiveness of PPI prophylaxis [^111vfF73]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study demonstrated that absence of PPI use and high GBS of 14 or more were significant risk factors for active UGIB requiring therapeutic endoscopy in patients with COVID-19 infection. Results suggest that short-term PPI prophylaxis may be considered in hospitalized patients to minimize the severity of UGIB. A prospective research on the benefit and risk of PPI for UGIB prevention in patients with emerging respiratory tract infection should be further explored.

### Extremity risk factors of sepsis for gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients with liver cirrhosis [^112FzuAE]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

According to the ASGE guidelines for GI procedures from 2015, prophylactic antibiotic administration is recommended for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration, endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography, and patients with cirrhosis admitted for GI bleeding, and which should receive antibiotic therapy with third-generation cephalosporin. Based on this, we used third-generation cephalosporin (ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, or flomoxef) as a prophylactic antibiotic agent. Flomoxef was used more often in our practice for the additional coverage of anaerobic infection compared with ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.

The four positive blood cultures in the experience cohort indicated Micrococcus, S. aureus, E. coli, and A. sobria bacteremia. In the validation cohort with overall antibiotic prophylaxis, there were only four cases of post-endoscopic sepsis, and the culture revealed negative results. An association between bacteremia and antibiotics was also evident in our study (0% vs. 1.3% in the groups with and without antibiotic prophylaxis, respectively; P = 0.032).

Limitations of the study

This study had several limitations. Firstly, the retrospective data may have impacted the identification of some confounding factors. Secondly, the study was conducted in a single medical center, and sepsis associated with GI endoscopy may vary in different hospitals. Thirdly, because EGD and CFS were performed together, it was difficult to differentiate sepsis coming from single and combined procedures. Finally, the study recruited only 642 patients. Therefore, a large, prospective, randomized, controlled trial is required to study the incidence of sepsis after GI endoscopy in cirrhotic patients.

### Risk factors for patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^116UikYh]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

To assess the effect of risk factors on the primary outcome of time to patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding, a Fine and Gray competing risk analysis was used (,–), accounting for death as a competing risk, with discharge from the ICU and consent withdrawal considered as censoring events.

There were few missing data except after 2 weeks on study, as platelet aggregation inhibitors and corticosteroids were not collected after Day 14. If a platelet aggregation inhibitor was received on Day 14, we imputed that it was continued until ICU discharge for the original indication, except in the event of bleeding. If a patient received corticosteroid treatment on Day 14, we imputed that the indication continued to Day 21.

Regression results are reported as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and two-tailed P values were calculated; P < 0.05 indicates statistical significance. No multiplicity corrections were performed. Analyses were performed using SAS Version 9.4.

Sensitivity and Secondary Analyses

In sensitivity analyses, we conducted a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to evaluate risk factors for patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding that did not consider the competing risk of death. Second, we evaluated all time-dependent risk factors within the preceding 2 days rather than 3 days, for exposures more proximate to the patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleed.

In secondary analyses, we evaluated risk factors for the secondary outcome of clinically important upper gastrointestinal bleeding using the same factors as in the main model. Separately, to evaluate whether enteral nutrition through enhanced mucosal integrity, attenuated or augmented the effect of pantoprazole on prevention of patient-important bleeding compared with placebo, we included an interaction term between pantoprazole versus placebo and amount of enteral nutrition received.

Finally, to evaluate whether certain baseline conditions were associated with patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding, we incorporated the following into the main model one at a time: acute hepatic failure, severe traumatic brain injury, and female sex.

### Cardioprotective effects and gastrointestinal risks of aspirin: maintaining the delicate balance [^113UnRXM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Aspirin is a very useful medication for the prevention of cardiovascular thrombotic events in patients with or those at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Aspirin, however, carries an increased risk for gastrointestinal (GI) injury (e.g., ulceration) and its complications (e.g., hemorrhage), which may be caused by its antiplatelet and gastric mucosal effects. In those with established CVD, aspirin use has been documented to decrease the risk of a first myocardial infarction (MI). Its effects on stroke and vascular death are less conclusive. The use of aspirin in these individuals is recommended only for those whose risk for cardiovascular events (based on coronary risk assessment tools) is sufficiently high that it outweighs the risk for GI complications. Secondary prevention refers to the use of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events in patients with established CVD such as an MI, stroke, or angina. The use of aspirin in these individuals is recommended based on a documented decrease in future cardiovascular events and mortality. The risk for GI events with aspirin is at least additive to the risk for these events in those who also are receiving therapy with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Patients being treated with aspirin, even at 81 mg/day for cardioprotection, should be assessed for factors that increase the risk for GI injury. Studies have confirmed that co-therapy with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or misoprostol decreases the risk for GI injury and complications. Although both classes of such gastroprotective agents are effective, treatment with a PPI is tolerated better, with fewer patients discontinuing the drug because of side effects such as diarrhea.

Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin), anticoagulants; or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

Complicated and symptomatic ulcer rates were 0.78% at nine months for all patients in the CLASS trial, and 2.19% for the subgroup on low-dose ASA. Patients 65 years of age and older had an incidence of 1.40% at nine months, 3.06% when also taking ASA [see Clinical Studies (14.7)].

Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.
Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.
Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.
Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.
If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue celecoxib until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.
In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Safe prescribing of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with osteoarthritis – an expert consensus addressing benefits as well as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks [^114daYgX]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Current guidelines on NSAID use have been developed by rheumatologists, gastroenterologists, cardiologists, or multidisciplinary teams of experts. Rheumatologists were first concerned with safety, thus recommending paracetamol (acetaminophen) as a first-line analgesic. Gastroenterologists dealt mainly with GI risk factors and gastroprotection, emphasizing how misused and underused it is, while cardiologists were worried about CV safety and suggested naproxen use in patients with CV risk factors. Some multidisciplinary consensus papers discussed both GI and CV risks and put forward evidence-based proposals on how to balance the benefits and risks of anti-inflammatory therapy. Despite this, some important issues have been left unsettled, partly because sufficient evidence was not available at the time of guideline drafting.

Navigating through the different GI and CV risk factors and balancing them with the potential benefits of NSAID therapy is a difficult task. This is why a team of 34 experts, from five different disciplines, gathered together to critically examine and grade the current evidence with the aim of achieving a consensus on how to best manage complex patients with high GI and/or CV risks. The Consensus statements and their comparison with those of previous guidelines are summarized in Table 2.

### Underutilization of preventive strategies in patients receiving NSAIDs [^1116H8cA]. Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple treatment guidelines for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) suggest that patients with one or more risk factors for NSAID-associated upper gastrointestinal (UGI) ulcer complications should be prescribed preventive strategies such as acid-suppressive drugs, misoprostol or cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-specific inhibitors to reduce their risk of serious ulcer complications. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the extent to which new NSAID users receive recommended preventive strategies and to assess the association between risk factors and a prescription of acid suppressive drugs or misoprostol.

Method

A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted using the Integrated Primary Care Information (IPCI) database, a longitudinal database of electronic general practitioner patient records in The Netherlands. The study population comprised all new NSAID users, defined as users of non-specific NSAIDs, COX-2-preferential NSAIDs and COX-2-specific inhibitors, during the period from January 1996 to April 2002. Subjects were excluded if they had an H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA), proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or misoprostol prescription in the 3 months prior to the first NSAID prescription. Preventive use of acid-suppressive drugs or misoprostol was identified by the coprescription for these drugs on the same day (± 2 days) as the NSAID prescription. The drug use for each patient was validated as having a preventive indication by reviewing the physician-recorded symptoms and diagnoses. Risk factors for UGI ulcer events were defined as age > 65 yr, UGI history (gastroduodenal ulcer, UGI bleeding, dyspepsia) and concomitant medications (anticoagulants, aspirin, oral corticosteroids). The study population comprised 69 648 new NSAID users.

Results

Overall, 7.9% of NSAID users received a preventive strategy (6.6% received a gastroprotective agent and an additional 1.3% received COX-2-specific inhibitors). Patients using preventive drugs had higher odds of having one or more UGI risk factors than patients without preventive drugs [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.78, 95% confidence interval 1.66–1.92]. Despite the greater rate of preventive drug prescriptions in patients who may have been at higher risk, 86.6% of patients with one risk factor and 81.2% with two or more risk factors received no preventive strategies. In contrast to non-specific NSAIDs, patients who received a prescription for a COX-2-specific inhibitor had significantly lower adjusted odds (OR = 0.22) of having H2RA/PPI or misoprostol coprescribed.

Conclusions

Although patients who are treated with preventive strategies have higher odds of having gastrointestinal risk factors than those not prescribed preventive therapies, the majority (> 80%) of patients with one or more gastrointestinal risk factors do not receive the recommended NSAID treatment regimen of a COX-2-specific inhibitor or NSAID + H2RA/PPI or misoprostol and are therefore undertreated.

Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors.

### Practice advisory on the appropriate use of NSAIDs in primary care [^115ZXmPU]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Preventative strategies for GI toxicity may be used both for primary and secondary prevention, and include the eradication of H. pylori and use of PPIs as already discussed, together with the use of enteric-coated NSAIDs and high-dose H 2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs). Evidence suggests that enteric-coating of NSAIDs does not reduce the incidence of upper GI complications compared with other formulations, but may shift the site of injury to more distal regions of the gut. The use of PPI prophylaxis is likely to be more effective than the use of H2RAs, with the latter protective at high doses, but ineffective at reducing the risk of gastric ulcers at lower doses. Although the use of PPI prophylaxis can improve GI tolerability during chronic NSAID administration and may also prevent upper GI complications, video endoscopy has shown that the risk of small bowel lesions remains even in healthy subjects. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of PPIs on upper GI complications do not extend to the lower GI tract, with PPI use unable to prevent NSAID or aspirin-associated lower GI bleeding. Another gastroprotective strategy involves the use of misoprostol, which is effective at preventing upper GI bleeding in high-risk patients and may be appropriate in case of intolerance to PPIs. There is also support for H. pylori eradication particularly in Asia where the prevalence is high,–but available data suggest that H. pylori eradication in infected patients is at best equivalent to PPIs in preventing GI complications and may even be inferior.

There are several guidelines and expert recommendations addressing the issues around the use of NSAIDs. However, none has specifically addressed the upper versus lower GI risk of COX-2 selective and non-selective compounds or the interaction at both the GI and CV level of either class of drugs with low-dose aspirin. To this end, a multidisciplinary group of experts convened to review current evidence, with the aim of developing statements and guidance devoted to these specific issues, to help clinicians make evidence-based decisions when selecting anti-inflammatory agents for the individual patient.

### Anticoagulant-associated gastrointestinal bleeding: framework for decisions about whether, when and how to resume anticoagulants [^117EJMk9]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is the most frequent single site of oral anticoagulant (OAC)-associated major bleeding. Patients with major GI bleeding experience morbidity and a substantial risk of short-term all-cause mortality up to 10%. While OACs are frequently discontinued during acute bleeding, there is substantial uncertainty about whether, when, and how OACs should be resumed after bleeding has resolved. Limited evidence suggests a lower risk of thromboembolism and death, and a higher risk of recurrent bleeding with OAC resumption. However, the absolute risks and optimal timing of anticoagulation remain uncertain based on these observational studies at risk of bias, particularly due to baseline confounding. In addition to an individualized approach to determining the benefits and harms of treatment decisions informed by the best available evidence about thrombosis and recurrent bleeding, discussions should meaningfully incorporate patient values and preferences. The objective of this review is to provide a framework for decision-making by summarizing the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of OAC-associated GI bleeding, providing an approach for assessment and risk stratification for OAC resumption and its timing, and outlining strategies for the prevention of recurrent GI bleeding.

### Prevalence and factors associated with inappropriate continuation of stress ulcer prophylaxis at discharge [^111xaey7]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Stress ulcers, as the name indicates, are upper gastrointestinal (GI) ulcers caused in response to stress in critically ill persons, especially those who are hospitalised. Bleeding from stress ulcers can increase morbidity and mortality further in this group of patients. Thus, stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) was introduced. The agents often used as SUP are histamine 2 receptor blockers (H2 blockers) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). The most common indications for SUP in the intensive care unit (ICU) include bleeding diathesis, use of mechanical ventilation, history of peptic ulcer or GI bleeding within the past year, traumatic brain injury or burn injury, among others, as described in Box 1. There are no established safe criteria to discontinue SUP. Most experts consider discontinuing SUP after discharge from the ICU, as they are no longer critically ill unless risk factors prevail. This consensus is based on the rationale that the baseline risk of GI bleeding is low in non-critically ill hospitalised patients. However, SUP initiated in the ICU often continues during the hospital stay and discharge. Prior studies found that 27–39% of patients were inappropriately continued on PPI upon discharge. Though they are considered relatively safe medications, interactions along with healthcare costs add to unnecessary burdens. Given this background, with a future goal to reduce the inappropriate continuation of SUP as long term, our team decided to estimate the prevalence of inappropriate continuation of SUP at discharge in addition to identifying the risk factors associated with its continuation.

Box 1
Indications of stress ulcer prophylaxis

Bleeding diathesis INR > 1.5 PTT > 2 times the control value Platelet count < 50 × 10⁹/L

### Venous thromboembolism prevention in surgery and obstetrics: clinical practice guidelines [^111ibWEH]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

To produce up-to-date clinical practice guidelines on the prevention of venous thromboembolism in surgery and obstetrics.

Methods

A Steering Committee defined the scope of the topic, the questions to be answered, and the assessment criteria. Eight multidisciplinary working groups (total of 70 experts) performed a critical appraisal of the literature in the following disciplines: pharmacology of antithrombotic agents, orthopaedics; general surgery (gastrointestinal (GI) and varicose vein surgery); urology; gynaecology and obstetrics; thoracic, cardiac and vascular surgery; surgery of the head, neck and spine; and surgery of burns patients. The resultant reports and guidelines were submitted for comment and completion of the Appraisal of Guidelines Research & Evaluation questionnaire to a total of 150 peer reviewers, before producing definite guidelines.

Results

The report answers the following questions for each type of surgery: (i) What is the venous thromboembolism incidence according to clinical and/or paraclinical criteria in the absence of prophylaxis? (with stratification of venous thromboembolism risk into low, moderate and high categories); (ii) What is the efficacy and safety of the prophylactic measures used? (iii) When should prophylaxis be introduced and how long should it last? (iv) Does ambulatory surgery affect efficacy and safety of prophylaxis?

Conclusions

Apart from answering the above questions, the guidelines provide a summary table for each discipline. This table stratifies types of surgery into the three risk categories, specifies the recommended prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (pharmacological and/or mechanical) and grades each recommendation. In addition, whenever appropriate, the recommended prophylaxis is adjusted to low- and high-risk patients.

### Management of patients with high gastrointestinal risk on antiplatelet therapy [^111WGdHg]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Increasing use of antiplatelet therapies is associated with increasing GI complications, such as ulceration and GI bleeding. Identification of high-risk patients and, in such patients, incorporation of strategies to reduce their GI risk would be clinically prudent. After assessment and treatment of H pylori in patients with prior ulcer or GI bleeding histories, further reduction in GI risk in other high-risk patients who require antiplatelet agents is primarily accomplished by prescribing drugs that when coadministered with antiplatelet agents protect against mucosal ulceration, primarily proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). However, observational studies indicate a higher cardiovascular event rate in patients taking PPIs along with clopidogrel and aspirin compared with that of patients undergoing dual antiplatelet therapy without PPIs. Whether concurrent use of a PPI with clopidogrel represents a safety concern or not is currently being evaluated by the US Food and Drug Administration. Until more specific regulatory guidance is available, current recommendations are that patients taking both PPIs and clopidogrel concurrently should probably continue to do so until more data become available.

### Proton pump inhibitors and the risk of gastric cancer: a systematic review, evidence synthesis and life course epidemiology perspective [^113fVMfY]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

In 1994, H. pylori was categorised as a Class I carcinogen for gastric cancer, and we question if PPIs should become listed as a 'possible' carcinogen. As H. pylori negative gastric is rare (< 5%), it may be unlikely that PPI exposure by itself is a sufficient, single cause of gastric cancer, and the risk will also be affected by other confounding factors including diet, obesity, physical activity and smoking. It seems unlikely that confounding by indication can fully explain this association, as several included studies used an active comparator designstratified, adjustedor restrictedby indication. Increased risks of gastric cancer were also found in groups only using PPI as ulcer prophylaxis.

PPIs may create a cancer-promoting micro-environment for H. pylori -induced changes to evolve more rapidly, pushing the patient up on the risk scale. Previous mechanistic research showed that reduced gastric acid production in individuals with H. pylori allowed the bacteria to expand their territory within the stomach and changed the distribution of gastritis. Prolonged gastric acid inhibition also hinders recovery of gastric atrophy after H. pylori eradication, with gastrin playing a key role in the regulation of gastric acidity. Similar mechanisms may also play for other gastric acid inhibiting drugs, such as the newer and even more potent vonoprazan. The effects of vonoprazan cannot yet be assessed on a population level in Sweden as it was not yet recorded during the study period. Our earlier PPI utilisation study showed other anti-acid drugs became rare in Sweden (< 1% of all prescriptions in 2023 of the A02B containing all drugs to treat gastro-oesophageal reflux and peptic ulcers), hindering the assessment of population-based long-term carcinogenic effects.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^112NTgPH]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric postoperative vomiting (POV) prophylaxis — risk-stratified recommendations and antiemetic options are described as follows: Major pediatric risk prediction models show minimal difference in predicted risk between zero and one risk factor, with reported values of 9% and 5% versus 10% and 6%, and there is a lack of robust evidence for prophylactic regimens with greater than two pharmacologic agents; for pediatric patients without risk factors, a single prophylactic agent (preferably ondansetron or dexamethasone) is recommended, and escalation to a two-agent regimen (typically combining ondansetron and dexamethasone) is advisable for one or two risk factors, whereas for three or more risk factors the current evidence does not conclusively favor routine addition of a third agent, with emphasis instead on modifying baseline risk factors such as eliminating nitrous oxide, using propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia, employing local and regional techniques, incorporating multimodal analgesia, and minimizing opioid use. For specific agents, evidence supporting the role of propofol as an antiemetic and risk mitigation strategy is outlined in the risk mitigation section. For 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, the effectiveness and safety, particularly of ondansetron (0.05 mg/kg to 0.1 mg/kg) in children, are well established (A1, table 3), and a study comparing ondansetron (0.2 mg/kg) to dexamethasone (0.1 mg/kg) in children receiving cochlear implants found significant PONV reduction without notable QTc changes, although caution is advised in patients with existing cardiac conduction issues.

### The David Y. graham lecture: use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in a COX-2 restricted environment [^111mYRto]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Recent evidence suggests that both cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors and nonselective NSAIDs, with the possible exception of naproxen, increase cardiovascular (CV) hazard. Clinicians should assess not only patients' GI risk but also their CV risk before prescribing these drugs. Patients with low CV risk can be managed according to their GI risk-low-risk patients (without risk factors) receive nonselective NSAIDs, medium risk patients (1–2 risk factors) receive COX-2 inhibitors or nonselective NSAIDs plus a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or misoprostol, whereas high-risk patients (multiple risk factors, previous ulcer complications, or concomitant anticoagulants) receive a COX-2 inhibitor plus a PPI or misoprostol. Among patients with high CV risk (e.g., prior cardiothrombotic events) who require NSAIDs, naproxen is preferred. These patients should receive a prophylactic PPI or misoprostol because the risk of ulcer bleeding is substantially increased with concomitant use of naproxen and low-dose aspirin. Substitution of clopidogrel for aspirin is not recommended in patients at risk for upper GI bleeding who require antiplatelet therapy. Patients with high GI and high CV risk should avoid NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors. If antiinflammatory analgesics are required, the choice of therapy depends on the relative importance of GI and CV risks of individual patients. Combination of naproxen, low-dose aspirin, and a PPI or misoprostol is recommended if CV risk is the major concern (e.g., recent myocardial infarction). In contrast, combination of low-dose COX-2 inhibitor, low-dose aspirin, and a PPI or misoprostol is preferred if GI risk outweighs CV risk (e.g., recent ulcer bleeding and stable CV disease).

### Risk factors of active upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with COVID-19 infection and the effectiveness of PPI prophylaxis [^116ZHun9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of GI bleeding has been reported between 0.6–13% in patients hospitalized from COVID-19 infection. The mechanisms thought to cause GI bleeding include patient factors, viral factors eg. epithelial cells expressing the angiotensin 2-converting enzyme (ACE2), and indirectly from treatment-related consequences eg. systemic corticosteroids. Previous data showed that patients with COVID-19 infection who developed either upper or lower GI bleeding during hospitalization had a significant higher mortality rate compared to those without GI bleeding.

A recent meta-analysis reported that between 37–100% of patients with COVID-19 infection who developed GI bleeding had taken anticoagulants and/or antiplatelet drugs. However, there was insufficient data to test antiplatelet or anticoagulant as a predisposing factor of upper and lower GI bleeding in patients with COVID-19 infection. Most recent studies assessed both upper and lower GI bleeding. To our knowledge, no study has evaluated the risk factors of active upper GI bleeding (UGIB) in patients with COVID-19 infection. Additionally, evidence supporting the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) which can prevent upper GI bleeding in high risk patients is still lacking.

The primary purpose of our study was to evaluate the risk of active UGIB in patients with COVID-19 infection. The secondary purpose were 1) determining the etiology of UGIB; 2) rate of endoscopic hemostasis; 3) mortality rate of those patients and 4) the role of PPI prophylaxis.

### Stress ulcer prophylaxis [^114B9BqM]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Stress ulcer prophylaxis is commonly administered to critically ill patients for the prevention of clinically important stress-related mucosal bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract. Despite widespread incorporation of stress ulcer prophylaxis into practice around the world, questions are emerging about its indications and impact. This clinically focused article will review current controversies related to stress ulcer prophylaxis for critically ill adult patients, including bleeding frequency, risk factors, comparative efficacy, adverse effect profile, and overall cost-effectiveness of the available stress ulcer prophylaxis regimens.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search was conducted from inception through August 2015.

Study Selection

Selected publications describing stress ulcer prophylaxis in adult patients were retrieved (original research, systematic reviews, and practice guidelines); their bibliographies were also reviewed to identify additional pertinent publications.

Data Extraction

Data from relevant publications were abstracted and summarized.

Data Synthesis

The existing evidence is organized to describe the patients most likely to benefit from stress ulcer prophylaxis, review the comparative efficacy of proton pump inhibitors and histamine 2 receptor antagonists, the adverse effects of stress ulcer prophylaxis, and overall cost-effectiveness.

Conclusions

Many stress ulcer prophylaxis recommendations are based on older studies at risk of bias, which may not be applicable to modern practice. Stress ulcer prophylaxis should be limited to patients considered to be at high risk for clinically important bleeding. When evaluating only the trials at low risk for bias, the evidence does not clearly support lower bleeding rates with proton pump inhibitors over histamine 2 receptor antagonists; however, proton pump inhibitors appear to be the dominant drug class used worldwide today. The current rate of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and the relative adverse effects of acid suppression on infectious risk may drive not only the effectiveness, but also the cost-effectiveness of stress ulcer prophylaxis today. Research is currently underway to better address these issues.

### Coprescribing proton-pump inhibitors with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: risks versus benefits [^115byt67]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Appropriate use of PPIs in patients on NSAIDs: when and why?

Managing upper-GI damage

According to the guidelines available, PPIs are still essential in the treatment and prophylaxis of NSAID-induced upper-GI injury. However, their prescription for this indication should be based on appropriate recommendations from worldwide published guidelines. Also, it is essential to reduce their continuation after the patient's discharge from hospital by assessing the true need on a case-by-case basis and periodically reviewing the long-term intake. Table 4 summarizes some risks and benefits of using PPIs.

Managing lower-GI damage

Much of the data available are catered toward upper-GI protection. Scarpignato et alprovided general guidance on prescription of NSAIDs and PPIs based on cardiovascular and GI risk of the patient. However, this was based only on upper-GI risk. At present, there are no comprehensive guidelines on how and when to prescribe PPIs for the prophylaxis of both upper- and lower-GI injury in NSAID users. Although several international guidelines touch on this issue, they do not explicitly state what to do in the event that a low-GI-risk patient becomes a high-risk one or what to do in the event that the first-line decision fails. Perhaps it is time to reconsider the use of PPIs together with NSAIDs.

### Indomethacin extended-release [^116aQjh8]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.

Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time. Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, as well as those with active GI bleeding, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs.

Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.

If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue indomethacin extended-release until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.

In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.3 Hepatotoxicity

Elevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported.

Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs including indomethacin.

Journal of the American Dental Association (2008). Medium credibility.

Infective endocarditis (IE) prophylaxis rationale and external guidance — underlying principles included that IE is an uncommon but life-threatening disease and prevention is preferable to treatment of established infection; certain underlying cardiac conditions predispose to IE; bacteremia with organisms known to cause IE occurs commonly with invasive dental, gastrointestinal (GI) or genitourinary (GU) tract procedures; antimicrobial prophylaxis was proven effective for prevention of experimental IE in animals; and antimicrobial prophylaxis was thought to be effective in humans for prevention of IE associated with dental, GI or GU tract procedures. Using an evidence-based grading system, the recommendations would be Class IIb, LOE C, and the quality of evidence was limited to a few case-control studies or was based on expert opinion, clinical experience and descriptive studies, which used surrogate measures of risk. The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy issued new IE prophylaxis recommendations and now recommends prophylaxis before dental procedures only for patients who have a history of previous IE or who have had cardiac valve replacement or surgically constructed pulmonary shunts or conduits.

### Risk factors of active upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with COVID-19 infection and the effectiveness of PPI prophylaxis [^112LWo5y]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

A systematic review from the United States showed that 108 of 123 (87.8%) patients with overall GI bleeding were managed conservatively with PPIs, somatostatin analogs, vasopressin analogs, and intravenous fluid resuscitation. Experts from Italy and United States suggest postponing non-urgent endoscopy in those patients. Performing EGD in patients with COVID-19 infection consumes many resources and is costly. The procedure has a high risk of viral shedding which requires a multidisciplinary team, personal protective equipment, and an appropriate negative pressure room. Our study proposed a GBS threshold of 14 or more supported by an excellent AUROC for selecting patients most likely to benefit from urgent EGD.

Our study had certain limitations. First, the number of patients with active upper GI bleeding is limited. Significant testing on mortality rates was likely impacted by the small sample size. Despite the limited sample size, this study was able to demonstrate two significant factors in the multivariable analysis. Second, since our study was a retrospectively design, there were definitely biases which might affect the outcomes, for instance, the incomplete data of tobacco use, alcohol consumption and Helicobacter pylori status. Finally, this study recruited small proportion of patients having an active UGIB in the first phase of study, and this can affect the result of the multivariate regression analysis. This limitation was highlighted by the large 95% CI obtained in the analysis. Nevertheless, this study demonstrated the data from a real-life practice on the emerging disease. A future prospective study on the benefits of PPI for UGIB prevention in patients with emerging viral disease e.g. COVID-19 should be further explored. After incorporating the results of this study with 0.05 alpha and 0.20 beta, the sample size of PPI and non-PPI group in the future prospective randomization study was 36 each.

### Risk factors of active upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with COVID-19 infection and the effectiveness of PPI prophylaxis [^111BRCxE]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The current guidelines have suggested using PPI as co-therapy in patients requiring anticoagulants only if they had a history of peptic ulcer bleeding. There was no recommendation for prescribing PPI when patients were taking only anticoagulants or corticosteroids without any risk of UGIB. However, we know that patients taking anticoagulant have a risk of bleeding. Two systematic reviews revealed that corticosteroids increased the incidence of GI bleeding, especially in critically ill patients. Thus, we proposed the short-term PPI prophylaxis protocol for patients with COVID-19 infection who received anticoagulants and/or corticosteroids and found it could prevent active UGIB during hospitalization. This may support the future societal guideline on this issue.

This study reported a need for therapeutic endoscopy of 14% for overall GI bleeding and 100% in patients presenting with the clinical of active UGIB. Our data did not differ from previous studies which reported an overall therapeutic endoscopic hemostasis rate between 6–48%. However, no previous study evaluated the need for therapeutic endoscopy in patients with active GI bleeding.

Regarding the Glasgow-Blatchford score (GBS) which is a screening method for determining whether patient with an acute UGIB will likely require endoscopic hemostatic procedure. The performance of the GBS to predict the need for therapeutic intervention and blood transfusion has been widely validated in the previous studies. According to guidelines for UGIB management, it is recommended to perform EGD within the first 24 h after presentation in patients with a GBS of more than 1. Although the patients in this study had inactive UGIB, they had a median GBS at 10.5. If we had followed the guidelines, we would have had to perform EGD in those patients. This study demonstrated that the threshold for early endoscopy within 24 h in patients with COVID-19 and UGIB should be revised. Those patients could be given more conservative treatment with high-dose PPI and supportive treatment.

### Clopidogrel with proton pump inhibitors: safe or not? [^111ZUvuE]. Clinical Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a serious complication associated with use of antiplatelet therapy, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are known to be beneficial in decreasing such risk. Several studies in the recent past have suggested concerns regarding interaction between clopidogrel and PPIs, presumably due to inhibition of clopidogrel activity and thus attenuation of its antiplatelet activity. A web-based literature and guidelines search was done using the keywords "clopidogrel", "omeprazole", "proton pump inhibitors" and "interaction". Of the available results, relevant studies (n = 11) were then systematically reviewed and summarized. The studies were categorized based on their retrospective or prospective nature. Most of the retrospective, observational studies suggested a link between the 2; however, recent prospective studies have shown no interaction, as well as a positive influence of PPIs in preventing the GI side effects of antiplatelet therapy. There is currently insufficient clinical evidence to suggest interaction between clopidogrel and PPIs and decision to add PPI therapy to clopidogrel should be guided by its clinical indications rather than as a routine prophylactic measure.

### Consensus about managing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs? [^1168c4gB]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The second issue worthy of comment is the conclusion the consensus group reached about whether some NSAIDs are safer than others from the standpoint of CV risk. Statement 8 reads: ' The risk of CV events associated with celecoxib use is similar to that associated with the use of most ns-NSAIDs'. Eighty-four percent of the panel agreed strongly or moderately, although only just over half the panel rated the level of evidence as high. They did not endorse earlier strong recommendations from bodies such as the American Heart Association and American College of Gastroenterology that naproxen should be the NSAID of choice for patients with high CV risk. Instead, the treatment-guidance algorithm they propose allows either naproxen or low-dose celecoxib as the preferred agents in patients with high CV risk, adding in a PPI to either if patients are judged to also be at high GI risk.

As Scarpignato et al. indicate, the evidence about whether naproxen has a lower CV risk has been conflicting; there is some pharmacokinetic basis to suspect it might. Aspirin exerts its prolonged anti-platelet effect because it irreversibly acetylates platelet cyclooxygenase. However, other nsNSAIDs are reversible inhibitors of the enzyme, so their platelet inhibitory effect disappears as their plasma levels dissipate. Naproxen is one of the longer acting nsNSAIDs, with a plasma elimination half-life of about 14 hours; a small study of volunteers given a single dose of 1,000 mg found platelet aggregation still reduced after 24 hours in 60% of cases. Thus, it is plausible that twice daily dosing may offer some protection against thrombotic events.

Seemingly in support of this, a recent large meta-analysis (the CNT collaboration) found that a coxib, diclofenac, or ibuprofen increased the rate of major vascular events by about a third (not quite significant for ibuprofen), but naproxen did not. However, a meta-analysis is only as strong as its component parts, and a particular weakness of the CNT meta-analysis was that it had to indirectly compare the effects of the different drugs. That is to say, studies of drug A versus drug B were combined with studies of drug A versus placebo to estimate relative risks for drug B versus placebo.

### Risk factors of active upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with COVID-19 infection and the effectiveness of PPI prophylaxis [^114H8wfD]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our present study demonstrated an overall incidence of UGIB in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who needed hospitalization of 0.7% (44/6,373 patients). This number was slightly decreased to 0.6% (5/841) after implementing a standard dose of PPI prophylaxis. Importantly, the percentage of patients presenting with active UGIB was reduced from 16 to 0% after prescribing PPI prophylaxis to patients taking steroids and/or anticoagulants. This information supported our first phase data that the absence of PPI prophylaxis was the significant factor associated with active UGIB. In addition, our first phase data showed 26% absolute risk reduction (ARR) when using PPI to prevent active UGIB in patients who admitted with COVID-19 and provided number needed to treat (NNT) of 4. Previous studies had combined data from UGIB and LGIB. To our knowledge, this is the first study that focuses solely on UGIB in COVID-19 patients.

A large retrospective cohort in the United States demonstrated that using antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents was not a risk factor for GI bleeding. Our study supported these findings on the prior use of antiplatelet/anticoagulant and risk of GI bleeding. Patients recently receiving anticoagulant for VTE prophylaxis for COVID-19 infection were also not found to be a risk factor for active UGIB.

The mortality of COVID-19 infected patients with GI bleeding has been previously reported inconclusively. A propensity score-matched case–control study reported that the occurrence of GI bleeding during hospitalization is associated with a significantly increased mortality rate compared to those without GI bleeding with OR 1.58 (95% CI 1.06–2.34, p = 0.02). A second matched case–control study reported that in-hospital mortality rates were similar between patients with and without GI bleeding. Recently, a meta-analysis study reported no significant association between GI bleeding and overall mortality rate. In our cohort study, we demonstrated no difference in the overall mortality rate of patients with active UGIB group compared to those with inactive UGIB group.

### ACG clinical guidelines: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridioides difficile infections [^112BV4nE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) — antisecretory therapy continuation: We suggest against discontinuation of antisecretory therapy in patients with CDI, provided there is an appropriate indication for their use (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). A systematic review of 16 observational studies reporting more than 7,000 patients found higher CDI rates with gastric acid suppressors vs none (OR 1.52; 95% CI 1.20–1.94). In a large randomized trial of more than 17,000 participants followed for an average of 3 years, enteric infection occurred in 1.4% vs 1.0% (OR 1.33 95% CI 1.01–1.75), with CDI events 9 vs 4 and not statistically significant. The guideline concludes that the effects of antisecretory therapy on CDI risk are extremely small in comparison with known CDI risk factors and states that when used for appropriate indications, the benefits of PPI are clear and therapy should be continued.

### Gastroprotective therapy and risk of gastrointestinal ulcers: risk reduction by COX-2 therapy [^113H6zF8]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) and misoprostol decrease the risk of development of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug induced gastric ulcers and aid healing of upper gastrointestinal (GI) ulcers. H2 receptor antagonists (H2RA) are less effective for this task, but are widely used by patients and physicians for the treatment of GI symptoms and duodenal ulcers. Sucralfate is a weaker agent that is sometimes used for prophylaxis or treatment of upper GI ulcers. We investigated the effect of GI drugs and selective and nonselective NSAID on the incidence of GI ulcer development in a cohort of patients immediately after the release of celecoxib and rofecoxib to investigate the effect of confounding by indication when effective GI agents and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)-specific inhibitors are prescribed to a high risk population.

Methods

During a 6 month period of observation 8547 NSAID users were evaluated by mailed questionnaire concerning NSAID drug use and ulcer development. In the first half of 1999, patients took 12,177 separate NSAID courses. GI therapy that followed the development of upper GI ulcers was excluded from analysis. Ulcer reports were confirmed by followup validation.

Results

GI drugs were used concomitantly in this population by 42% of patients using an NSAID. GI drugs were associated with an increased risk of ulcer. But this risk was confined to PPI (OR 4.1, 95% CI 2.95, 5.69), and not to other GI drugs. Overall, patients using nonselective NSAID compared to those taking COX-2-specific inhibitors had an increased risk of upper GI ulcers (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.43, 3.34). Patients taking nonselective NSAID plus PPI were also at increased risk for upper GI ulcers compared to those taking nonselective NSAID alone (OR 5.09. 95% CI 3.88, 6.67). Similarly, the risk of upper GI ulcers was increased in the nonselective NSAID plus PPI group (OR 3.83, 95% CI 2.32, 6.31) compared to the COX-2 plus PPI group.

Conclusion

PPI use, but not other GI drug use, is a marker for increased susceptibility to ulcers among NSAID users. This risk of upper GI ulcers is increased in PPI users regardless of which NSAID is used (nonselective or COX-2-specific inhibitor). Although COX-2 use is associated with greater risk factors for upper GI ulcers due to channeling bias, COX-2 users have significantly fewer ulcers than equivalent nonselective NSAID users regardless of concomitant PPI utilization.

### Risk factors for patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^114g5tem]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Critically ill patients are at risk of stress erosions in the upper gastrointestinal tract that may cause clinically important upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Although many bleeding risk factors have been reported, the epidemiology and care of critically ill patients has changed over time, and no study has evaluated risk factors for bleeding using an endpoint defined by ICU survivors and family members. Most research evaluating gastrointestinal bleeding as a complication of critical illness has reported clinically important upper gastrointestinal bleeding as defined by study investigators. In response to the infrequent use of endpoints that are determined by members of the public in clinical research, the outcome of patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding was developed in a mixed-methods study by survivors of critical illness and family members of patients admitted to an ICU.

Unlike clinically important upper gastrointestinal bleeding, hemodynamic changes and hemoglobin values associated with bleeding were not part of the definition. ICU survivors and relatives of patients who experienced critical illness defined patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding as overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding that required a single blood transfusion, vasopressor treatment, diagnostic endoscopy, computed tomography angiography, or surgery, or that resulted in death, disability, or prolonged hospitalization.

Patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding was a secondary endpoint for a recent international stress ulcer prophylaxis trial. REVISE (Re-Evaluating the Inhibition of Stress Erosions) was a multicenter, randomized, stratified, concealed, parallel-group trial that enrolled 4,821 invasively ventilated patients who were at least 18 years old and admitted to the ICU, designed to determine the effect of pantoprazole versus placebo on the primary efficacy outcome of clinically important upper gastrointestinal bleeding and the primary safety outcome of 90-day mortality. In the main analysis, pantoprazole significantly reduced the risk of clinically important upper gastrointestinal bleeding and patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding (the numbers needed to prevent a bleeding episode were 40 and 37, respectively); other outcomes related to microbiome modification and the gastropulmonary route of infection were unaffected.

Stress ulcer prevention in practice may range from no prophylaxism, to a risk-based approach, to universal prescribing. The primary objective of this study was to identify, among invasively ventilated critically ill adults, the contemporary risk factors for patient-important upper gastrointestinal bleeding, considering illness severity, and the competing risk of death.

### Oral vancomycin for prevention of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection… [^111erHQU]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

eFigure 5. Estimated Nonrecurrence Probability Over Time Between Treatment Groups for the Randomized Participants Aged 65 Years or Older Data Sharing Statement GI indicates gastrointestinal; SOC, standard of care. therapy and resolution of initial CDI, recurrent CDI may be triggered when antibiotics are given for other indications. 2, 6 Prevention is essential to reduce the myriad medical, social, and psychological consequences of recurrent CDI. 7, 8 Interventions to prevent recurrent CDI during exposure to systemic antibiotics in a person with prior but not current CDI are needed in clinical practice.
9. We conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial to assess the effect of oral vancomycin prophylaxis on recurrent CDI incidence and VRE carriage of the gut in patients with a recent CDI who were taking systemic antibiotics for a non-CDI indication.

This study aimed to evaluate whether a low dose of oral vancomycin administered during and immediately following non–CDI-indicated antibiotic treatment was effective in preventing recurrent CDI. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial, patients who had CDI in the previous 180 days who took 125 mg of prophylactic oral vancomycin during and for 5 days after a course of non–CDI-indicated antibiotic therapy had lower rates of recurrent CDI than patients taking a placebo; however, this study was underpowered to find a statistically significant difference. There were high rates of recurrent CDI in both the treatment and the placebo groups. However, the study population was at particularly high risk for recurrent CDI given that all participants had a recent CDI and used systemic antibiotics. 26, 27 The median age of participants was 59 years, and older age is also a risk factor for recurrent CDI.
26.

Oral vancomycin prophylaxis during non–CDI-indicated systemic antibiotic therapy has been conditionally recommended for patients at high risk of CDI recurrence by the American College of Gastroenterology, which notes that this recommendation is supported by low-quality evidence and that there is a need for prospective clinical trials. Our clinical trial used the ACG dosage and treatment duration for prophylactic oral vancomycin. Previous studies have evaluated different dosages and durations of oral vancomycin treatment. 17, 18 We selected a low dosage to reduce the risk of gut dysbiosis.

### Role of calcitonin gene-related peptide on the gastrointestinal symptoms of migraine-clinical considerations: a narrative review [^114c631F]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Implications for Physicians Managing Patients With Migraine

Given that individuals receiving migraine therapies are at risk of developing GI AEs, it is important to consider how both physicians and patients can best mitigate these effects. From the patient's perspective, counseling about possible GI outcomes is important, and some self-care strategies are listed in Table 3; e68 any changes or restrictions in diet should only be introduced in consultation with a health care provider. Accurate medical and treatment history taken by physicians is essential when initiating migraine treatment. A full history should also be noted if GI symptoms are subsequently reported by the patient. Questions for the clinician to consider include the following:
Does the patient have a preexisting GI disorder?
What are the patient's baseline bowel habits, and did these habits change after treatment initiation?
Does the patient have underlying risk factors for GI disorders other than migraine?
Is a particular class of migraine treatment likely to increase the risk of GI AEs or exacerbate an existing GI disorder?
What is the best route of administration of migraine medications, in light of the patient's GI symptoms?
Is the patient receiving an acute therapy (especially an over-the-counter medication) that can confound or exacerbate GI events of preventive medications?
Is the patient taking other nonmigraine medications associated with GI AEs?

Table 3
Key Recommendations to Help Patients to Avoid Mild Gastrointestinal Disorders a

These factors should be considered when choosing a preventive medication, alongside the indication and established AE profile of the treatment. GI disorders associated with migraine treatments are generally mild and transient, but if they are severe, the patient should be referred to a GI specialist. Guidance on when a GI specialist should be consulted is available. e68

It is possible that magnesium or other preventive therapies concomitantly administered with a mAb may reduce constipation and increase migraine prophylaxis. Studies are needed to test this hypothesis. If NSAIDs are used during acute treatment for migraine, the minimal dose necessary should be used to prevent gastric side effects and nephrotoxicity. e69 Acid suppression in the form of histamine-2 antagonism or proton pump inhibition may be considered, especially for those at risk of GI bleeding. e70

### Association of cardiometabolic risk burden with gastrointestinal bleeding in aspirin users [^116dxQgt]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is one of the most widely used medications, which is the mainstream for the prevention and treatment of ischemic cardiovascular disease. Many studies have demonstrated that aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of acute myocardial infarction, transient cerebral ischemia, secondary stroke, as well as some cancers, such as colorectal cancer (RR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.47–0.76). However, the use of aspirin for the prevention of cardiovascular events is accompanied by non-negligible adverse effects. Among these, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a well-established adverse reaction of aspirin, while the risk of GI bleeding in aspirin users varies between individuals and has been linked to multiple factors, such as age, comorbidities, co-prescribed drugs, et al. Research has found that aspirin increases the risk of GI bleeding by 60% in elderly populations, although the absolute five-year risk remains relatively low, at approximately 0.4%. However, in the presence of risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, obesity, and other metabolic factors, the absolute five-year risk can exceed 5%. Appropriate intervention, such as co-prescription of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), are established to mitigate aspirin-related aspirin-related GI bleeding. However, the net benefit of routine PPI use depends largely on the risk of GI bleeding in a long-term time course, so a personalized estimate of GI bleeding risk is necessary.

### Reducing inappropriate proton pump inhibitors use for stress ulcer prophylaxis in hospitalized patients: systematic review of De-implementation studies [^112GPYp9]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In 2013, the Choosing Wisely campaign has identified PPI and H2RA acid-suppressive therapy for SUP as low-value care that should be avoided. We identified ten studies evaluating the effectiveness of strategies to reduce inappropriate PPI use for SUP in adult hospitalized, non-ICU patients. Altogether, we can conclude that small to moderate reductions in inappropriate PPI prescriptions or use can be accomplished in a wide range of hospital settings upon implementation of PPI-reducing strategies. Nevertheless, these results should be interpreted cautiously as the type of study design of most studies (before-after design) has intrinsic limitations (no control group, no randomization, contamination issues). Taking these shortcomings in study design into account, critical appraisal of the quality of included studies revealed moderate quality for most studies (Fig. 2).

Inter-study heterogeneity hampered meta-analysis of the data. The included studies were different regarding several aspects, namely combinations of interventions, type of hospital departments, and hence patient populations, setting (academic or general hospitals), and country. Adding to clinical heterogeneity, the included studies applied different PPI prescription/use appropriateness criteria (Suppl. Table 4), and based these criteria on a variety of information (Suppl. Table 5). Consequently, studies differed in the indications and specifications of symptoms in which PPI prescription was considered appropriate, including several gastrointestinal tract indications (e.g. reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease) and SUP for high-risk patients, (Suppl. Table 4). Finally, lack of reporting standardization impaired data extraction and analysis.

Evidence on prevention of GI bleeding by PPI in low-risk patients has been lacking for a long time, and recently, it was shown that even in ICU patients at risk of GI bleeding, PPI prescription did not prevent CIB occurrence. Despite clear advice against SUP prescription for non-ICU-hospitalized patients without additional risk factors in guidelines, this recommendation is apparently not followed by healthcare professionals. It is questionable whether an update of the guideline with evidence is needed or that stricter adherence to guidelines is required. Nevertheless, the ASHP guideline is based on outdated information, with evidence for CIB prevention coming from studies when H2RAs were more commonly used. Also, most studies examined short-term SUP use, while nowadays patients are on continued PPI prescription of which long-term adverse effects are not thoroughly examined.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding in high risk survivors of myocardial infarction: the VALIANT trial [^117MZ3qf]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

The risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding limits the use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs. Risk factors for GI bleeding in post- myocardial infarction (MI) patients have not been well defined. We sought to identify risk factors for GI bleeding in patients following MI.

Methods and Results

The VALsartan In Acute myocardial iNfarcTion trial (VALIANT) enrolled 14 703 post-MI patients with left ventricular dysfunction and/or heart failure and followed them for a median of 24.7 months. In the present secondary analysis, times from baseline to first GI bleeding were identified from the VALIANT serious adverse event database. Potential risk factors were explored from medical history, demographics, clinical profile, and medications, both at baseline and during follow-up. We also explored the relationship between the occurrence of GI bleeding and subsequent mortality. During follow-up, 98 (0.7%) patients had a serious GI bleeding event. These patients were older, had more comorbidities, were more likely to be taking additional antiplatelet drugs, and had worse left ventricular systolic and renal function. The Kaplan-Meier estimated rate of GI bleeding at 6 months was 0.37% (95% CI 0.27–0.47). In a multivariable Cox model, dual antiplatelet therapy was the most powerful predictor of GI bleeding, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 3.18 (95% CI 1.91–5.29). Other predictors were non-white race, history of alcohol abuse, increasing age, worse New York Heart Association class, anticoagulant therapy, diabetes, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, and male sex. Gastrointestinal bleeding was associated with increased risk of death [adjusted hazard ratio 2.54 (95% CI 1.66–3.89)].

Conclusion

Following MI, clinical characteristics can identify patients with increased risk of GI bleeding. The use of dual antiplatelet agents appears to be the most profound risk factor. Whether these patients would benefit from GI prophylaxis therapy remains unknown.

### Upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults: evaluation and… [^112hNsBz]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Risk Factors The most common risk factors for upper GI bleeding include prior upper GI bleeding, anticoagulant use, high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and older age. 1 The overall incidence of peptic ulcer disease is decreasing, likely because of an increase in the treatment of Helicobacter pylori and an increase in the use of proton pump inhibitors; however, the incidence of peptic ulcer disease not related to H. pylori or to NSAID use is increasing. 1, 3 Renal failure, though less common, is a risk factor for upper GI bleeding, particularly in the first year of dialysis 1 because of platelet dysfunction, platelet-vessel wall interaction, and blood coagulation abnormalities. Predictive factors of upper GI bleeding include history of melena, melanotic stool on examination, tachycardia, and hemoglobin less than 8 g per dL.
24.

Laboratory tests should include a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, coagulation panel, liver tests, and type and screen. 23, 25 The use of prokinetic agents before endoscopy is controversial; however, a meta-analysis of eight RCTs that included 598 individuals found that an erythromycin infusion before endoscopy improved visualization, reduced the need for second-look endoscopy, and reduced hospital stay. 3 Clinical prediction guides are necessary for upper GI bleeding risk stratification and to determine therapy. The Glasgow-Blatchford bleeding score is used to predict a composite of various clinical interventions and mortality, and it appears to be superior to other prediction guides. 3 A Glasgow-Blatchford bleeding score less than or equal to one predicts survival without the need for intervention, 26 and these patients may be discharged from the emergency department for outpatient treatment and diagnostic testing. PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS Proton pump inhibitors should be started upon presentation with upper GI bleeding. Guidelines recommend resumption of aspirin for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease immediately following endoscopy if the rebleeding risk is low or within three days if the rebleeding risk is moderate or high.

### Preexposure prophylaxis to prevent acquisition of HIV: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115xNDfU]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) rationale and net benefit — The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes with high certainty that there is a substantial net benefit from the use of effective antiretroviral therapy to reduce the risk of acquisition of HIV in persons at increased risk of acquiring HIV, with convincing evidence that PrEP is of substantial benefit in decreasing the risk of HIV in persons at increased risk of HIV acquisition and that adherence to PrEP is highly correlated with its efficacy in preventing the acquisition of HIV; adequate evidence indicates PrEP is associated with a small magnitude of harms, which include kidney and gastrointestinal adverse effects, weight gain, and injection site reactions, while identification of risk relies on adequate epidemiologic data on risk factors and behaviors but faces inadequate evidence on risk assessment tools and their accuracy in identifying persons at increased risk of HIV acquisition.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^112sMz11]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Critically ill patients are at increased risk of developing stress-related mucosal disease and subsequent stress-ulcer bleeding as a result of both their underlying disease and therapeutic interventions. There are some well-established strong, independent risk factors for stress-related mucosal disease, respiratory failure and coagulopathy being the most relevant ones, with an OR of 15.6 and 4.3, respectively. Other important factors include acute renal or hepatic failure, sepsis, hypotension, severe head or spinal cord injury, thermal injury involving more than 35% of the body surface area, acute lung injury, major surgery (lasting more than 4 hours), and history of GI bleeding.

Although no single study or meta-analysis has reported a decrease in the overall mortality related to SUP, guidelines from the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists and Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommend routine prophylaxis with acid suppressive therapy for high-risk patients. The rationale for this recommendation relies on the finding that important GI bleeding is strongly associated with prolonged ICU stay and increased mortality. Indeed, three large meta-analyses found that the risk of bleeding in ICU is reduced by some 60% in patients receiving SUP compared with those treated with placebo or no prophylaxis. Therefore, SUP has become the standard of care in the ICU, sometimes irrespective of the presence of risk factors. The benefit of SUP using real-world data is, however, not easy to estimate because of the lack of a control group.

### Coprescribing proton-pump inhibitors with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: risks versus benefits [^111qvXZB]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

NSAID-induced GI injury and the coprescription of PPIs

NSAIDs are a leading cause of drug-related morbidity, especially in the elderly and patients with comorbidities. Adverse events associated with NSAIDs are a challenge in treatment optimization for pain. Adverse events include alterations in renal function, effects on blood pressure, hepatic injury, and platelet inhibition, which may result in increased bleeding. However, the most important adverse effects of NSAIDs are the gastrointestinal (GI) and cardiovascular adverse effects. A considerable amount of money is spent treating and preventing just the GI events. A Canadian study found that the GI iatrogenic cost factor for NSAIDs was 1.73, meaning that an additional CA$0.73 was spent on the prophylaxis and treatment of NSAID-related GI events for each Canadian dollar of direct cost spent on NSAID. The deleterious GI effects of ns-NSAIDs are a cause for concern, because of their frequency and seriousness.

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been proven efficacious in healing NSAID-associated ulcers, as they provide potent and long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion. As such, they are often coprescribed with NSAIDs. However, this leads to excessive cost for both patients and governments, and also induces a potential risk for iatrogenic harm. In the past two decades, the coadministration of NSAIDs and PPIs has resulted in a decrease in upper-GI tract adverse events, but has been associated with an increased frequency of lower-GI tract events. This enteropathy induced by the combination of an NSAID and PPI is common, and lesions induced by these drugs in the small intestine could be of considerable clinical importance. The subsequent sections of this manuscript focus on the GI effects/complications of NSAIDs, options for prevention of GI side effects, and appropriate use of PPIs in combination with NSAIDs.

### Gastrointestinal considerations in patients with cardiovascular disease using nonopioid analgesics for mild-to-moderate pain or cardioprotection [^1152mBBB]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most widely used classes of medications worldwide, available both through prescription and over the counter (OTC). Although these drugs are highly effective for pain, gastrointestinal (GI) complications may occur. Risk factors for GI complications from NSAIDs have been well studied, and the highest risk exists among the elderly and patients with a history of GI bleeding or complications. The increasingly widespread use of aspirin for both primary and secondary cardiovascular prophylaxis has also drawn attention to the potential increase in GI complications. Several strategies may minimize NSAID-mediated GI complications, including the use of drugs that do not injure the gut, such as acetaminophen or a low-dose opiate. The cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, which cause approximately 50% fewer GI complications than traditional NSAIDs, may also be used, although their cardiovascular safety has recently come into question. Antacid therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may also be used to reduce NSAID-related dyspepsia and upper GI complications. Misoprostol is also effective in preventing NSAID-related complications, but is not as well tolerated. In any patient, the risk-benefit ratio must be assessed to determine the appropriate therapies to minimize GI complications resulting from daily aspirin therapy.

### Major GI bleeding in older persons using aspirin: incidence and risk factors in the ASPREE randomised controlled trial [^114XYH2i]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

There is a lack of robust data on significant gastrointestinal bleeding in older people using aspirin. We calculated the incidence, risk factors and absolute risk using data from a large randomised, controlled trial.

Design

Data were extracted from an aspirin versus placebo primary prevention trial conducted throughout 2010–2017 ('ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE)', n = 19114) in community-dwelling persons aged ≥ 70 years. Clinical characteristics were collected at baseline and annually. The endpoint was major GI bleeding that resulted in transfusion, hospitalisation, surgery or death, adjudicated independently by two physicians blinded to trial arm.

Results

Over a median follow-up of 4.7 years (88389 person years), there were 137 upper GI bleeds (89 in aspirin arm and 48 in placebo arm, HR 1.87, 95%CI 1.32 to 2.66, p < 0.01) and 127 lower GI bleeds (73 in aspirin and 54 in placebo arm, HR 1.36, 95%CI 0.96 to 1.94, p = 0.08) reflecting a 60% increase in bleeding overall. There were two fatal bleeds in the placebo arm. Multivariable analyses indicated age, smoking, hypertension, chronic kidney disease and obesity increased bleeding risk. The absolute 5-year risk of bleeding was 0.25% (95% CI 0.16% to 0.37%) for a 70 year old not on aspirin and up to 5.03% (2.56% to 8.73%) for an 80 year old taking aspirin with additional risk factors.

Conclusion

Aspirin increases overall GI bleeding risk by 60%; however, the 5-year absolute risk of serious bleeding is modest in younger, well individuals. These data may assist patients and their clinicians to make informed decisions about prophylactic use of aspirin.

### Low-dose aspirin in primary prevention: cardioprotection, chemoprevention, both, or neither? [^115aFQvm]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Low-dose aspirin has been shown to be effective in preventing about one-fifth of atherothrombotic vascular complications (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death) in a meta-analysis of 16 secondary prevention trials in patients with previous myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient cerebral ischaemia. This corresponds to an absolute reduction of about 10–20 per 1000 patients in the yearly incidence of non-fatal events, and to a smaller, but still definite, reduction in vascular death. Against this benefit, the absolute increase in major extracranial bleeding complications [mostly, gastrointestinal (GI)] is 20- to 50-fold smaller, depending on age and sex. Hence, for secondary prevention, the benefits of antiplatelet therapy substantially exceed the risks. For primary prevention, the balance between vascular events avoided and major bleeds caused by aspirin is substantially uncertain because the risks without aspirin, and hence the absolute benefits of antiplatelet prophylaxis, are at least an order of magnitude lower than in secondary prevention. The aim of this article is to review the updated evidence for the efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin in primary prevention and to discuss additional health benefits resulting from prolonged antiplatelet therapy in apparently healthy people at low average risk of vascular events.

### Management of patients on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: a clinical practice recommendation from the first international working party on gastrointestinal and cardiovascular effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anti-platelet agents [^1135V1m9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Prescribing nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is challenging because physicians have to consider gastrointestinal (GI) and cardiovascular (CV) safety issues.

Objective

The purpose of the study was to determine appropriate NSAID treatment strategies based on different combinations of GI and CV risks.

Methods

The working party comprised a multidisciplinary international panel of 19 experts. Two hundred eighty-eight vignettes were evaluated for the appropriateness of each of six options: naproxen, non-naproxen nonselective NSAIDs, naproxen plus proton pump inhibitor (PPI)/misoprostol, non-naproxen nonselective NSAID plus PPI/misoprostol, cyclooxygenase-2 selective NSAID (coxib), or coxib plus PPI/misoprostol. Using a two-stage modified Delphi process, the panel anonymously ranked the appropriateness of each option from 1 (extremely inappropriate) to 9 (extremely appropriate). Vignettes were considered appropriate if ≥ 80% of all panelists' scores were 7–9 and inappropriate if ≥ 80% of all panelists' scores were 1–3.

Results

The panel rated nonselective NSAIDs as appropriate when the patient had average GI risk (< 70 yr of age; no prior upper GI event; no corticosteroids, antithrombotic agents, anticoagulants). In patients with GI risk factors, cotherapy with a PPI/misoprostol was appropriate. Either a nonselective NSAID or a coxib was rated appropriate in patients with average CV risk; naproxen was preferred in patients with high CV risk. None of the options was considered appropriate in patients with multiple GI risk factors and high CV risk.

Conclusions

The initial choice of an NSAID (naproxen vs. others) relates to a patient's CV risk, and the need for therapy to decrease GI complications (PPI/misoprostol or coxibs) is determined by severity and number of GI risk factors.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^111ofaxZ]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

PPIs are among the safest class of drugs. Although concerns have been raised on their long-term safety, the preponderance of evidence does not strongly support the concerns, publicized over the last few years, and the absolute risk is probably low. Some adverse effects are plausible and predictable; others are idiosyncratic, unpredictable, and rare. Based on the quality of the existing evidence, the benefits of PPI treatment outweigh the potential risks in most patients, especially if PPI use is based on a relevant and appropriate indication. Conversely, patients treated without an appropriate therapeutic indication are only exposed to potential risks and the benefit-to-harm balance becomes very low. Consequently, the overall focus should be on the appropriateness of PPI therapy and on a regular assessment of the need for continued PPI treatment.

Nearly all the adverse outcomes associated with PPIs occur among patients who receive long-term therapy; minimizing the duration of treatment by periodically reviewing a patient's need for acid-suppressive therapy could eliminate or substantially reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. Therefore, during continued long-term use, the clinical effects should always be reviewed and attempts be made to stop any therapy that may not be needed. It is imperative to use the lowest dose of drug required to achieve the desired therapeutic goals. This may entail implementing discontinuation of treatment in asymptomatic patients as well as step-down, intermittent, or on-demand PPI therapy for maintenance of GERD. It should be emphasized, however, that PPI treatment in GERD is merely palliative in nature, since it does not address the underlying pathophysiology, something only ARS is able to achieve. Therefore, in young fit patients needing continuous acid suppression, fundoplication should be considered. Intermittent or on-demand PPI therapy is not suitable for NSAID users, since the risk of serious GI events is constant in those patients with GI risk factors and can persist for some time after stopping therapy.

### CDC updates guidelines for the prevention of perinatal… [^113JwPDU]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

However, patients who at any time during their current pregnancy have had a GBS-related urinary tract infection or GBS bacteria isolated from the urine should receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis and do not need third-trimester screening for GBS colonization. The use of antimicrobial agents should be avoided before the intrapartum period unless GBS urinary tract infection occurs during the pregnancy. Threatened Preterm Delivery Preterm delivery is an important risk factor for early-onset GBS disease. Management of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with threatened preterm delivery is challenging because it can be difficult to determine if preterm premature rupture of membranes or signs and symptoms of preterm labor will actually result in preterm delivery, and GBS colonization status often is unknown before 35 to 37 weeks' gestation.

GBS prophylaxis should be given at hospital admission in patients with threatened preterm delivery if their colonization status is unknown or if they had a positive screen within the preceding five weeks. Women who have not had vaginal-rectal GBS screening within the preceding five weeks should be screened for colonization at hospital admission. If admission screening results are negative for GBS or if, at any point, it is determined that a patient admitted with preterm labor is not in true labor, antibiotics given for GBS prophylaxis should be discontinued immediately. The administration of antibiotics for other indications should not be affected by negative GBS culture results. In patients who had a positive GBS admission screen from a threatened preterm delivery that did not result in true labor at the time, prophylaxis is indicated when true labor begins.

Patients who had a negative GBS admission screen from a threatened preterm delivery that did not result in true labor should have repeat screening at 35 to 37 weeks' gestation. Screening also should be repeated in such patients if they are readmitted with threatened preterm delivery more than five weeks after their previous GBS screen. GBS testing results should not affect the duration of antibiotics given to such patients who are not in labor. Unless a screen performed within the preceding five weeks was negative, GBS prophylaxis should be given for 48 hours in patients with PPROM who are not in labor and are not receiving antibiotics to prolong latency. Prophylaxis should be discontinued if negative results from admission screening become available during that 48-hour period.

### Predicting the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs: NSAID electronic assessment of risk [^112ASE2L]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To validate that, using patient demographics and other risk factors readily obtained from computerized databases, one can predict a priori the risk for developing a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) associated gastrointestinal (GI) bleed prior to exposing patients to therapy.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using computer-stored information from a large group-model health maintenance organization. All patients who received one or more prescriptions for a single NSAID over a 9 month period were eligible. Historical and risk factor data was obtained for age, sex, prior GI bleeds, use of GI medications, prednisone use, and use of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD). We tested a model (eSCORE) that is based on a previous risk stratification method. The primary outcome was a hospital admission for a GI bleed (GI event).

Results

A total of 303,211 NSAID patient-users met eligibility requirements. Serious GI events occurred in 302 patients, for a rate of 0.68% (0.68 events per 100 patient-years' exposure). All the risk factors except DMARD use were associated with a significant increase in the GI event rate. Higher eSCORE points were associated with increased GI event rates.

Conclusion

The study supports the concept that the rate of GI events can be predicted by a defined set of easily assessed patient criteria using the eSCORE. Stratification of patients by risk score can guide the physician to appropriate therapeutic options, with the potential of protecting patients at greatest risk for a GI event.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in chronic pain: implications of new data for clinical practice [^1177aXqD]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

NSAIDs are associated with different GI risks, and it is important that this is taken into account in clinical practice. Data from a nested case–control study showed that celecoxib was the only NSAID that did not have a significantly higher rate of upper-GI-tract events compared with placebo. In contrast, the risk of adverse upper-GI-tract events with rofecoxib, ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, and aspirin was significantly higher than in controls. Celecoxib has also been shown to be associated with a significantly lower rate of GI intolerability than naproxen, ibuprofen, or diclofenac in elderly patients (age ≥ 65 years).

The addition of a PPI for ulcer prophylaxis significantly decreases the proportion of NSAID recipients who will develop a gastric or duodenal ulcer during chronic NSAID therapy. In very high-risk subjects (defined as those who had previous NSAID-induced ulcer bleeding and continued need for anti-inflammatory analgesics), combining celecoxib with PPI provides even greater gastroprotection (cumulative incidence of recurrent ulcer bleeding over 13 months' follow-up: 0% for celecoxib+ esomeprazole vs 8.9% for celecoxib alone; P = 0.0004). However, PPIs do not have any protective effects in the lower GI tract. It is also important to note that PPIs are not a risk-free therapy, and thus, care needs to be taken in the setting of long-term PPI use. Adverse events associated with a PPI include increased risk of Clostridium difficile infection and hospital-acquired pneumonia, hypersensitivity with resulting organ damage (eg, interstitial nephritis), increased fractures in postmenopausal women, altered absorption of vitamins and minerals, increased risk of CV complications, and potential for drug interactions.–In addition, PPI treatment has been shown to increase the incidence of small-intestine bacterial overgrowth.

### Ketorolac tromethamine (Sprix) [^111jy56U]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.2 Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

SPRIX is contraindicated in patients with active peptic ulcers and/or GI bleeding and in patients with recent gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation [see Contraindications (4)].

NSAIDs, including ketorolac, cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated for 3–6 months, and in about 2%-4% of patients treated for one year. However, even short-term NSAID therapy is not without risk.

Risk Factors for GI Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation

Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who used NSAIDs had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. Other factors that increase the risk of GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include longer duration of NSAID therapy; concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking; use of alcohol; older age; and poor general health status. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Additionally, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at increased risk for GI bleeding.

Strategies to Minimize the GI Risks in NSAID-treated patients:

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest possible duration.
Avoid administration of more than one NSAID at a time.
Avoid use in patients at higher risk unless benefits are expected to outweigh the increased risk of bleeding. For such patients, consider alternate therapies other than NSAIDs. Do not use Sprix in those with active GI bleeding.
Remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy.
If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, promptly initiate evaluation and treatment, and discontinue SPRIX until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out.
In the setting of concomitant use of low-dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis, monitor patients more closely for evidence of GI bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].
Use great care when giving SPRIX to patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease) as their condition may be exacerbated.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^117X3pfR]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric sepsis — stress-ulcer prophylaxis: The guideline states that 'Stress ulcer prophylaxis should not be routinely administered to children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction' and advises that 'individual patients should be assessed for the presence of risk factors of clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding' including 'multiple organ dysfunction', 'prolonged mechanical ventilation (> 48 hr)', 'coagulopathy, persistent shock', and 'treatment with corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents'. Supporting data note a meta-analysis 'of 1,836 adult patients' where 'pharmacological stress ulcer prophylaxis did not significantly change the risk of GI bleeding', but 'the risk of pneumonia was increased' with stress-ulcer prophylaxis versus none '(OR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.2–6.6)', and that benefit is suggested only when 'baseline rate of clinically important bleeding is approximately 13%'.

Regular monitoring

In a European survey investigating primary-care physician behavior and understanding, it was found that only half of the doctors measured their osteoarthritis patients' hemoglobin routinely as part of a complete blood count. Although GI-injury prophylaxis is important, regular monitoring is still essential to allow early detection of injury so that treatment can be administered, and also to prevent development of complications. Hemoglobin levels can be used as an indicator of GI injury; low hemoglobin and hematocrit are attributable to blood loss in the absence of other evident causes. The CONDOR trial, which looked at both upper- and lower-GI events, also investigated the frequency of clinically significant blood loss measured by decreases ≥ 2 g/dL in hemoglobin throughout the GI tract. A drop in hemoglobin ≥ 2g/dL has been well recognized as a surrogate end point in clinical trials investigating the GI toxicity of NSAIDs conducted over the last 20 years.–

Patients on antithrombotic therapy undergoing endoscopy — adverse events of antithrombotic therapy include GI bleeding, and their use increases the risk of hemorrhage after some endoscopic interventions, and for patients taking these medications who require endoscopy, one should consider the following important factors: (1) the urgency of the procedure, (2) the bleeding risk of the procedure, (3) the effect of the antithrombotic drug(s) on the bleeding risk, and (4) the risk of a thromboembolic event related to periprocedural interruption of antithrombotic agents.

Reduction in the incidence of advanced adenomas at colonoscopy
Prevention of CRC
Reduced morbidity related to CRC, or morbidity secondary to complications of surveillance and treatment
Improved identification of hereditary CRC syndromes
Improved pathways from diagnosis to treatment in susceptible populations.

We sought a consistent approach in our assessment of the relative effectiveness of interventions. In principle we agreed that surveillance should only be offered to individuals who remain at higher risk of developing CRC than the general population. As CRC risk is not always clearly defined, as a surrogate we accepted that advanced adenoma yield on surveillance should be approximately double that in susceptible populations compared with the average risk population.

A relative threshold for genetic testing was agreed for people with a 10% or greater probability of having a germline pathogenic variant in a cancer susceptibility gene in accordance with previous UK guidelines. However the GDG agreed that the arbitrary nature of this threshold meant that it could be modified in cases where objective risk assessment was difficult to attain, and clinicians had sufficient clinical suspicion of risk.

Key questions we sought to cover included the following:

Which aspects of the previous guidelines require updating?
What is the lifetime CRC risk and optimal surveillance for those with a family history of CRC (where LS and polyposis syndromes have been excluded)?
What is the diagnostic yield of genetic testing and/or surveillance for high-risk populations?
What is the optimal gastrointestinal (GI) surveillance for patients at hereditary risk GI cancer?
What is the impact of high-quality endoscopy in patients with known or suspected hereditary cancer syndromes?
Should we develop gene- or gender-specific guidelines for surveillance?
What is the optimal diagnostic assessment and surveillance interval for 'Lynch-like' syndrome patients?
How can we improve recognition, diagnosis and treatment of patients at hereditary risk of CRC?
Which diagnostic genetic tests should we offer serrated polyposis syndrome (SPS), multiple colorectal adenoma (MCRA) and early onset CRC (EOCRC) patients (if any)?
When should colonoscopic surveillance for familial risk patients stop, because it is no longer necessary, or because the patient should be referred for surgery?
Which are the optimal surgical approaches in patients with hereditary CRC syndromes?
What is the evidence for chemoprophylaxis in patients who are at hereditary risk of CRC?
What is the evidence for the effect of lifestyle modification on hereditary risk of CRC?
What information do we need to share with our patients at inherited risk of GI cancer?

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^11542xSX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Aspirin for primary vs secondary prophylaxis after ulcer bleeding — risk–benefit and outcomes: For primary prophylaxis without overt cardiovascular disease, meta-analysis shows an annual absolute risk reduction of 0.07% (NNT = 1,429). For secondary prophylaxis in established cardiovascular disease, the annual absolute risk reduction is 1.49% (NNT = 68), and failure to resume low-dose aspirin after ulcer bleeding is associated with increased mortality. In a randomized trial of such patients with a bleeding ulcer, resumption of low-dose aspirin versus placebo increased rebleeding (10.3 vs. 5.4%) but decreased overall mortality (1.3% vs. 12.9%). Thus, it is important to resume antiplatelet therapy, along with PPI co-therapy, as early as possible in patients with established cardiovascular disease.

### Strategies to optimize treatment with NSAIDs in patients at risk for gastrointestinal and cardiovascular adverse events [^113ASFbB]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

NSAIDs, including cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors, are among the most widely prescribed medications worldwide. However, NSAIDs have been associated with gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. The cardiovascular (CV) toxicity associated with COX-2 inhibitors and some other NSAIDs further complicates the choice of therapy.

Objective

The aim of this commentary was to appraise current NSAID treatment strategies and provide clinicians with guidance on the GI and CV risks of these strategies and choosing an appropriate treatment in individual patients.

Methods

A literature search of PubMed was conducted (1989-August 2009) to gather relevant studies, meta-analyses, reviews, and treatment guidelines using the following terms, either alone or in combination: NSAID, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, toxicity, gastroprotection, proton pump inhibitor, COX-2 inhibitor, aspirin, fixed-dose combination, and adherence.

Results

Based on the data from the literature search, gastroprotective strategies (eg, proton pump inhibitors [PPIs]) are underused in patients at risk for NSAIDrelated GI complications, including in those patients most at risk. Risk factors for GI toxicity with NSAID use include high NSAID dose, a history of NSAID-associated GI adverse events or the presence of upper GI symptoms, advanced age, corticosteroid use, concurrent aspirin use, and certain comorbidities (eg, rheumatoid arthritis). Risk factors for CV toxicity with NSAID use include established CV disease or an estimated 10-year CV risk > 20%. Findings from randomized controlled trials have suggested that, in patients with an increased risk for GI complications, the use of a nonselective NSAID with a PPI may be at least as effective as the use of a COX-2 selective inhibitor in preventing the recurrence of ulcer complications. In patients with a high GI risk and a moderate CV risk, the use of a COX-2 inhibitor with a PPI may be appropriate.

Conclusions

The choice of NSAID should be tailored to the GI and CV risks in the patient. The risk profile can be affected by numerous factors, including NSAID dosing and concurrent aspirin use. Thus, individualized risk stratification should be the clinician's primary consideration when selecting treatment.
