## Question

PASP measurements in severe Tricuspid regurgitation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) in severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) using echocardiography, including why conventional methods fail, what newer approaches improve accuracy, and when to escalate to invasive hemodynamics. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard echocardiographic method and its assumptions. Then, I should verify the specific hemodynamic reasons for underestimation in severe TR. Next, I will review the evidence quantifying bias and correlation. After that, I need to examine refined echocardiographic strategies that improve right atrial pressure (RAP) estimation and PASP calculation. Finally, I should integrate guideline recommendations and outline a practical, stepwise clinical algorithm with explicit thresholds and contingencies.

> Let me first confirm the conventional approach. PASP is typically estimated from the peak tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity using the simplified Bernoulli equation (4 × Vmax²) plus an estimated RAP from inferior vena cava (IVC) size and collapsibility; in the absence of pulmonary stenosis or RV outflow obstruction, right ventricular systolic pressure approximates PASP, so PASP ≈ 4 × Vmax² + RAP [^111oxVKc] [^114qQD27].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this works well in many settings, but I need to check why it breaks down in severe TR. The key issues are: (1) early systolic pressure equalization between the right ventricle and right atrium due to a large effective regurgitant orifice, which blunts the true gradient and yields a low TR velocity despite high pulmonary pressures; (2) laminar, low-velocity TR jets around 2 m/s that violate the inertial assumptions of the simplified Bernoulli equation; (3) a prominent V-wave and dynamic RAP that standard IVC-based RAP estimation cannot capture, especially when RAP exceeds 15 mmHg; and (4) the V-wave cutoff sign on continuous-wave Doppler, which signals rapid RV–RA pressure equilibration and predicts underestimation of PASP [^1157qanC] [^117Wyjpi] [^113Hi7tc] [^114NHawP] [^113wzXQs].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of error. In a prospective cohort with severe TR, echocardiography underestimated PASP by about 8 mmHg when RAP was elevated, with a tendency toward systematic underestimation. The V-wave cutoff sign independently predicted misestimation with an odds ratio near 3.7, and Lin's concordance correlation fell from 0.80 in the overall cohort to 0.67 in severe TR, indicating weaker agreement [^117Wyjpi]. But I should double-check whether simultaneous studies align — yes, simultaneous echocardiography and right heart catheterization (RHC) show a small mean bias of about +1.3 mmHg yet wide limits of agreement (−12.8 to +15.5 mmHg), with 18.8% of patients having a ≥ 10 mmHg discrepancy, underscoring clinically meaningful misclassification risk in severe TR [^11356UWE].

> I will now examine refined echocardiographic strategies to improve RAP estimation, because PASP accuracy hinges on RAP. Let me consider a multiparametric approach: in patients with an initial eRAP of 15 mmHg by IVC criteria, incorporate IVC collapsibility ≤ 20%, hepatic vein systolic flow reversal, and the V-wave cutoff sign to reclassify RAP to 10, 15, or 20 mmHg; this stratification tightened the spread of invasively measured RAP and improved PASP correlation with RHC from r = 0.85 to r = 0.90, with limits of agreement narrowing to about −9.8 to +12.9 mmHg [^116mvXvM] [^114NHawP] [^1173utM4]. Hold on, I should verify that this was prospectively validated with simultaneous RHC — yes, the protocol explicitly performed simultaneous measurements to minimize hemodynamic drift and confounding [^113CKsHJ].

> Next, I should review alternative noninvasive indices when the TR jet is unreliable. Pulmonary artery acceleration time (PAAT) is obtainable in most patients and correlates inversely with PASP; in adults, PAAT less than about 100 ms suggests elevated mean PAP, though heart rate and RV function influence PAAT and must be considered [^113TTHdK] [^116DfMYd]. I need to ensure I mention pulmonary regurgitation–based estimates as well — end-diastolic pulmonary regurgitation velocity can estimate pulmonary artery end-diastolic pressure and, in the absence of pulmonary disease, approximate wedge pressure, but adequate envelope capture and RAP estimation remain limiting factors [^116bD4Za]. Let me reconsider pediatric guidance briefly — PAAT is particularly useful when TR is insufficient, with age-specific cutoffs aiding screening, though adult data should not be extrapolated wholesale [^116DfMYd].

> But wait, what if the clinical stakes are high or the numbers don't fit the physiology? I should confirm guideline positions. Both contemporary ESC/ERS pulmonary hypertension guidance and ACC/AHA valvular heart disease guidance advise invasive hemodynamic assessment when noninvasive and clinical data are discordant or when planning intervention in severe TR, because precapillary pulmonary hypertension worsens outcomes after transcatheter tricuspid repair and cannot be reliably excluded by echo alone in this setting [^113GASbz] [^112cXE19] [^114RDid9]. Direct RHC clarifies PASP, mPAP, PVR, and RAP, and helps distinguish precapillary from postcapillary disease; it also avoids the pitfalls of thermodilution cardiac output in severe TR, where Fick-based output is preferred for resistance calculations [^113Tuctb].

> Let me think about integrating RV–PA coupling, because PASP alone may mislead in severe TR. The TAPSE/PASP ratio is a pragmatic noninvasive surrogate of RV–PA coupling; values around 0.3–0.4 mm/mmHg are associated with uncoupling and worse outcomes, and using invasively measured PASP improves prognostic discrimination compared with echo-estimated PASP in this context [^114tiE1C] [^114KFUdY]. I should confirm that guideline documents endorse reporting TAPSE/PASP when assessing RV function and load — yes, ASE guidance highlights its prognostic utility and recommends reporting it alongside other RV metrics [^114tiE1C].

> I should double-check practical acquisition tips to minimize Doppler error even when TR is severe. Optimal alignment to minimize the intercept angle, use of color to guide placement, careful gain and velocity scale settings, and averaging over multiple beats — especially in atrial fibrillation — improve signal quality; recognizing a triangular, laminar TR envelope with early equalization should prompt caution and consideration of alternative methods or invasive confirmation rather than accepting a deceptively low PASP estimate [^111oxVKc] [^114AxoQK] [^1157qanC].

> Let me synthesize a stepwise clinical approach. First, attempt standard PASP estimation from TR velocity plus IVC-derived RAP, but interpret any PASP < 35–40 mmHg with skepticism in severe TR. Second, if eRAP is 15 mmHg or the V-wave cutoff sign is present, apply the refined RAP algorithm (IVC collapsibility ≤ 20%, hepatic vein systolic flow reversal, V-wave cutoff) to reclassify RAP and recalculate PASP. Third, if the TR jet is inadequate or the hemodynamics remain discordant, use PAAT or pulmonary regurgitation–based estimates as adjuncts. Fourth, if results remain uncertain or intervention is planned, proceed to RHC to define pulmonary pressures, PVR, and RAP, and to phenotype PH before transcatheter or surgical therapy [^111oxVKc] [^116mvXvM] [^113GASbz] [^114RDid9].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear: severe TR systematically undermines the assumptions behind the simplified Bernoulli approach, leading to underestimation of PASP by roughly 8–15 mmHg in a meaningful fraction of patients. A multiparametric RAP refinement strategy improves accuracy but does not replace the need for invasive hemodynamics when decisions hinge on precise pulmonary vascular characterization or when echo and physiology disagree [^117Wyjpi] [^116mvXvM] [^113GASbz].

---

PASP estimation in severe TR is often **underestimated** by echocardiography due to early RV–RA pressure equalization and low TR jet velocities, even when RAP is high [^117Wyjpi] [^1157qanC]. The simplified Bernoulli equation is **less reliable** in this setting, and the V-wave cutoff sign is a marker of underestimation [^117Wyjpi] [^1157qanC]. For accurate assessment, **use RHC** when echo and clinical data are discordant or intervention is planned [^113GASbz] [^112cXE19]. If echo is used, apply a multiparametric approach (IVC, hepatic vein flow, RV size/function) and consider TAPSE/PASP for risk stratification, but interpret cautiously [^1142sP7R] [^114tiE1C].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms influencing PASP estimation in severe TR

Severe TR alters right heart hemodynamics in ways that **compromise PASP estimation**:

- **Early RV–RA pressure equalization**: Large regurgitant volumes cause rapid RV–RA pressure equilibration, reducing the RV–RA gradient and yielding low TR velocities despite high PASP [^113wzXQs].

- **Laminar TR flow**: Severe TR often produces laminar jets with triangular CW envelopes, reflecting early pressure equalization and underestimation of true PASP [^1157qanC].

- **Elevated RAP**: High RAP further narrows the RV–RA gradient, leading to underestimation of PASP when using the simplified Bernoulli equation [^117Wyjpi].

---

## Limitations of echocardiographic methods in severe TR

Standard echocardiographic methods have **important limitations** in severe TR:

| **Echocardiographic method** | **Limitation in severe tr** |
|-|-|
| Simplified Bernoulli equation (4 × TR velocity² + RAP) | - Underestimates PASP due to early RV–RA pressure equalization and low TR velocities [^1157qanC] [^117Wyjpi] |
| IVC-based RAP estimation | - Overestimates RAP in severe TR, compounding PASP underestimation [^114NHawP] |
| V-wave cutoff sign | - Indicates early pressure equalization and is a marker of PASP underestimation [^117Wyjpi] [^1157qanC] |

## Accuracy of echocardiographic PASP estimation compared to invasive measurements

Studies comparing echo to RHC show **systematic underestimation** in severe TR:

- **Lemarchand et al. (2024)**: In severe TR, echo underestimated PASP by ~8 mmHg vs RHC; LCC = 0.67, with a tendency to underestimate as RAP rose [^117Wyjpi].

- **Simultaneous RHC-echo studies**: Echo PASP showed a small positive bias (+1.3 mmHg) but wide limits of agreement (−12.8 to +15.5 mmHg), with 18.8% having ≥ 10 mmHg discrepancy [^11356UWE].

- **Pediatric data**: In BPD infants, echo underestimated PASP in 58% of cases with PH, highlighting poor agreement in high RAP states [^112U9Rz7].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **caution and invasive confirmation**:

- **ESC/ERS 2022**: RHC is recommended before surgical or interventional valve repair in severe TR to distinguish precapillary from postcapillary PH [^113GASbz].

- **ACC/AHA 2021**: Invasive hemodynamics are advised when echo and clinical data are discordant or inadequate [^112cXE19].

- **TV ARC**: Routine invasive assessment is important given frequent discordance between echo and invasive pressures in severe TR [^112uoL9w].

---

## Alternative and complementary echocardiographic parameters

Given the limitations, **additional parameters** can aid assessment:

- **TAPSE/PASP ratio**: A noninvasive surrogate of RV–PA coupling; TAPSE/PASP < 0.36 mm/mmHg indicates uncoupling and worse outcomes, though PASP estimation errors in severe TR limit accuracy [^114tiE1C] [^114KFUdY].

- **RV size and function**: RV dilation/dysfunction and septal flattening support elevated PASP but are indirect [^111iZwGm].

- **Hepatic vein flow**: Systolic flow reversal suggests elevated RAP and severe TR, aiding RAP estimation [^114NHawP].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Underestimation of PASP in severe TR has **important consequences**:

- **Delayed diagnosis**: Underestimation can delay PH recognition and treatment, worsening outcomes [^115ZB4Fp] [^114WxgNv].

- **Risk stratification**: TAPSE/PASP and RV–PA coupling metrics help risk stratify, but invasive PASP improves accuracy [^114KFUdY].

- **Intervention planning**: Accurate PASP is critical for selecting patients for tricuspid valve interventions; RHC is recommended when intervention is planned [^113GASbz] [^114RDid9].

---

## Recommendations for clinical practice

Given these limitations, **the following approach is recommended**:

- **Initial assessment**: Use echo to estimate PASP, but interpret cautiously in severe TR; look for the V-wave cutoff sign and laminar TR flow as markers of underestimation [^1157qanC].

- **Multiparametric approach**: Integrate IVC, hepatic vein flow, RV size/function, and TAPSE/PASP, recognizing their limitations in severe TR [^112uoL9w].

- **Invasive confirmation**: Use RHC when echo and clinical data are discordant, when PH is suspected, or when intervention is planned [^113GASbz] [^114RDid9].

- **Serial monitoring**: Reassess hemodynamics periodically, as TR severity and RV function evolve [^114N168m].

---

PASP estimation in severe TR is frequently underestimated by echocardiography due to hemodynamic alterations that violate the assumptions of the simplified Bernoulli equation. Accurate assessment **requires a multiparametric echo approach** and, when decisions hinge on precise pressures, **confirmation by right heart catheterization** [^113GASbz].

Right heart hemodynamic assessment — right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) is calculated from the peak tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet velocity using the simplified Bernoulli equation and adding this value to the right atrial pressure (RAP) estimate; RVSP is equivalent to PASP in the absence of RVOT obstruction, PS, and/or proximal PA stenosis, and to avoid overestimation ensure that the peak systolic measurement is from the dense aspect of the spectral Doppler envelope with an optimal CW Doppler TR signal characterized by a dense envelope indicating a complete Doppler profile; RVSP should be calculated by averaging at least three consecutive beats from the window with the highest velocities and the clearest Doppler envelope, and is computed as RVSP = 4 × (peak TR velocity)² + RAP.

Tricuspid regurgitation diagnosis — ACC/AHA recommendations: In patients with tricuspid regurgitation (TR), transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is indicated to evaluate presence and severity, determine etiology, measure right-sided chamber and inferior vena cava size, assess right ventricular (RV) systolic function, estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and characterize associated left-sided heart disease (COR 1, LOE C-LD). In patients with TR, invasive measurement of the cardiac index, right-sided diastolic pressures, pulmonary artery pressures, and pulmonary vascular resistance, as well as a right ventriculogram, can be useful when clinical and noninvasive data are discordant or inadequate (COR 2a, LOE C-LD).

### New echocardiographic algorithm for estimating right atrial pressure in severe tricuspid regurgitation: insights from simultaneous cardiac catheterization [^111qKYdy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have reported varying degrees of discordance between echocardiographic and catheter‐based measurements of PAP in patients with severe TR. For instance, studies by Özpelit et al and Fei et al noted substantial overestimations of PASP by echocardiography compared with RHC. However, these studies were limited by the inclusion of patients with conditions such as congenital heart disease and primary pulmonary hypertension, which may not fully represent the general population of patients with severe TR. In a study involving 243 patients undergoing transcatheter edge‐to‐edge repair for severe TR, preprocedural echocardiography demonstrated a moderate correlation for PASP estimation (r = 0.47) with a median time from echocardiography to RHC of 6 (interquartile range, 2–17) days. This study also found that echocardiography tended to underestimate RAP compared with invasively measured values. Recently, Lemarchand et al evaluated the reliability of Doppler echocardiography in 78 patients with severe TR who underwent RHC and echocardiography, performed within a maximum delay of 48 hours. The mean age was 74.5 years, and 85% of patients had atrial fibrillation, with a mean PASP of 42.1 mm Hg, a population similar to ours. The study found a good correlation for PASP (r = 0.72) between echocardiography and RHC, with a bias of < 5 mm Hg. However, the correlation for RAP estimation was only fair, with significant variation across the eRAP range. High RAPs were not assessable by echocardiography, leading to underestimation of PASP.

### New echocardiographic algorithm for estimating right atrial pressure in severe tricuspid regurgitation: insights from simultaneous cardiac catheterization [^1131Cukr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

eRAP was calculated on the basis on an IVC size of 21 mm or larger and the presence of plethora as follows: If both factors were present, eRAP was 15 mm Hg; if only 1 factor was present, eRAP was 8 mm Hg, and if neither factor was present, eRAP was 3 mm Hg. Hepatic vein systolic flow reversal was measured in the subcostal view using the pulsed‐wave Doppler. To improve RAP estimation in patients with an elevated eRAP of 15 mm Hg, additional parameters were incorporated, including hepatic vein systolic flow reversal, low IVC collapsibility (≤ 20%), and the V‐wave cutoff sign. Under our proposed new criteria, eRAP was considered to be 20 mm Hg if all 3 factors–hepatic vein systolic flow reversal, low IVC collapsibility, and a V‐wave cutoff sign–were present; 15 mm Hg if 1 or 2 factors were present; and 10 mm Hg if none of the factors were present. Consequently, PASP echo was recalculated using the eRAP determined by this new criterion. To minimize observer bias, echocardiographic measurements were performed by a cardiologist blinded to RHC results.

Right Heart Catheterization

RHC was performed at rest without sedation using a Swan–Ganz catheter by experienced cardiologists (J.H.Y. and K.H.C.). For accurate pressure measurements, the transducer was positioned at the midchest level, corresponding to the level of the left atrium in the supine patient, aligned with the anterior part of the sternum and the midaxillary line. Proper zeroing was performed before the preparation and initiation of the procedure. Heart rates were recorded at rest. RVSP, RV end‐diastolic pressure, PASP (PASP cath), pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, mean PAP, pulmonary artery wedge pressure, and RAP were measured and recorded at end‐expiration. Venous blood gas analysis was conducted in the pulmonary artery and RA. Cardiac output was measured using the indirect Fick method, and the cardiac index was calculated by dividing cardiac output by body surface area. Pulmonary vascular resistance was calculated as the difference between mean PAP and pulmonary artery wedge pressure, divided by cardiac output. During RHC, simultaneous transthoracic echocardiography was performed by an experienced cardiologist (J.K.) using a Vivid E95 ultrasound machine (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI).

### Reassessment of the accuracy of cardiac Doppler pulmonary artery pressure measurements in ventilated ICU patients: a simultaneous Doppler-Catheterization study [^111RBAHJ]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Doppler echocardiography is a well-recognized technique for the noninvasive evaluation of pulmonary artery pressure; however, little information is available concerning patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, recent studies have debatable results regarding the relevance of this technique to assess pulmonary artery pressure. The aim of our study was to reassess the accuracy of Doppler echocardiography to evaluate pulmonary artery pressure and to predict pulmonary hypertension.

Design

Prospective observational study.

Setting

Amiens ICU, France.

Patients

ICU patients receiving mechanical ventilation.

Interventions

In 40 patients, we simultaneously recorded Doppler echocardiography variables (including tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary regurgitation) and invasive central venous pressure, systolic pulmonary artery pressure, diastolic pulmonary artery pressure, and mean pulmonary artery pressure.

Measurements and Main Results

Systolic pulmonary artery pressure assessed from the tricuspid regurgitation derived maximal pressure gradient added to the central venous pressure demonstrated the best correlation with the invasive systolic pulmonary artery pressure (r = 0.87) with a small bias (-3mm Hg) and a precision of 9mm Hg. A Doppler echocardiography systolic pulmonary artery pressure greater than 39mm Hg predicted pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥ 25mm Hg) with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Tricuspid regurgitation maximal velocity greater than 2.82 m/s as well as tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient greater than 32mm Hg predicted the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary regurgitation was recorded in 10 patients (25%). No correlation was found between pulmonary regurgitation velocities and either mean pulmonary artery pressure or diastolic pulmonary artery pressure. Pulmonary acceleration time less than 57ms and isovolumic relaxation time less than 40ms respectively predicted pulmonary hypertension 100% of the time and had a 100% negative predictive value.

Conclusions

Tricuspid regurgitation maximal velocity pressure gradient added to invasive central venous pressure accurately estimates systolic pulmonary artery pressure and mean pulmonary artery pressure in ICU patients receiving mechanical ventilation and may predict pulmonary hypertension.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of Cardiovascular imaging [^113GVgmu]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Medium credibility.

CW Doppler TR systolic jet velocity — A significant correlation exists between systolic PA pressure and noninvasively derived LAP, and in the absence of pulmonary disease, increased systolic PA pressure suggests elevated LAP. Systolic PA pressure can be used as an adjunctive parameter of mean LAP, and evidence of pulmonary hypertension has prognostic implications. Limitations include that this is an indirect estimate of LAP, adequate recording of a full envelope is not always possible though intravenous agitated saline or contrast increases yield, and with severe TR and low systolic RV-RA pressure gradient, accuracy of calculation is dependent on reliable estimation of RA systolic pressure.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113Tuctb]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) hemodynamic assessment caveats — A weak TR signal or the presence of severe TR may result in underestimation of pulmonary systolic pressure; direct invasive measurement can resolve this uncertainty. Direct measurements of right atrial pressure may also be useful for clinical decision-making. Right ventriculography may further aid in the evaluation of the severity of TR and the status of the RV. Thermodilution cardiac output measurements may be inaccurate with severe TR, and thus a Fick cardiac output should be measured to apply the calculation of pulmonary resistance.

### Validity of echocardiographic tricuspid regurgitation gradient to screen for new definition of pulmonary hypertension [^114WxgNv]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The accuracy and PPV of TRG for screening for pre-capillary and combined pre- and post-capillary PH (mPAP > 20 mmHg and PVR ≥ 3 WU) in our study were worse than those for screening for PH overall (mPAP > 20 mmHg), indicating that addition of PVR to the new definition of pre-capillary PH alters the usefulness of TRG as a screening parameter. Our study provides evidence that lowering the TRG threshold for intermediate risk of PH below the currently recommended level of 31 mmHg results in extremely low specificity with unacceptable PPV and moderate accuracy for screening for pre-capillary and combined pre- and post-capillary PH. The sensitivity of TRG did not meaningfully increase when lowering the TRG threshold. This is mirrored by the fact that echocardiographic TRG has been shown to correlate with invasively measured sPAP, but with low precision. In addition, a noticeable divergence between echocardiographic PASP (TRG+RAP) and invasively measured sPAP has been described at low pressures, consistent with our data which showed a correlation between invasively measured sPAP and echocardiographic TRG overall but not at TRG values ≤ 31 mmHg. In a tertiary referral centre, a high PPV is crucial to avoid unnecessary RHC in individuals without PH. High sensitivity, however, avoids cases of manifest PH being missed. This is even more important than avoiding unnecessary RHC (which is associated with low morbidity and mortality when performed by experts), because a missed or delayed diagnosis of PH leads to delayed PH-specific therapy which may result in a significant deterioration in life expectancy. Therefore, we suggest maintaining the current TRG cut-off of 31 mmHg because it combines high sensitivity with acceptable PPV.

### Epiphenomenon or prognostically relevant interventional target? A novel proportionality framework for severe tricuspid regurgitation [^111Mu5Kb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Echocardiographic Analysis

All echocardiographic studies were performed by experienced institutional cardiologists during clinical routine. PH was routinely evaluated by preprocedural transthoracic echocardiography. Echocardiographic systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) levels were calculated by adding peak systolic pressure gradients between the right ventricle and right atrium (estimated from the continuous wave Doppler profile of the TR jet) to right atrial pressure levels. Right atrial pressure, in turn, was estimated by the diameter and collapsibility of the inferior vena cava as described in contemporary guidelines. Right ventricular systolic function was estimated on the basis of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) measurements and on right ventricular fractional area change calculations. TR vena contracta width was measured from a right ventricle–focused apical 4‐chamber view as the narrowest portion of the regurgitant flow that occurs at or immediately downstream of the regurgitant orifice. TV EROA and TR volume were calculated using the flow convergence method (also known as the proximal isovelocity surface area method).

InvasiveAssessment

Right heart catheterization represents the gold standard to assess pulmonary artery pressure levels. A 7 French Swan‐Ganz catheter was routinely used for preprocedural right heart catheterization via femoral access. sPAP and diastolic pulmonary artery pressure levels were directly recorded. mPAP levels were calculated as mPAP = diastolic pulmonary artery pressure + [1/3]×(sPAP − diastolic pulmonary artery pressure). Mean postcapillary wedge pressure was calculated over the entire cardiac cycle. Cardiac output was determined using the indirect Fick method. Pulmonary vascular resistance was defined as (mPAP−mean postcapillary wedge pressure)/cardiac output. Acknowledging that mean postcapillary wedge pressure and mPAP levels are sensitive to left‐sided loading conditions, it was standardized practice at the participating sites to recompensate patients before right heart catheterization and to avoid hemodynamic measurements in the presence of volume overload. Right heart catheterization–derived mPAP levels were the primary source to calculate the TV EROA/mPAP ratio.

Artificial Intelligence–EnabledPrediction

The methodology for mPAP prediction by employing an extreme gradient boosting algorithm using standard echocardiographic parameters as data input has been extensively described elsewhere. Echocardiographic parameters serving as input variables included left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular end‐systolic diameter, left atrial area, sPAP, basal right ventricular diameter, TAPSE, TR vena contracta width, right atrial area, and inferior vena cava diameter. Artificial intelligence–derived mPAP values are hereinafter referred to as mPAP predicted.

### New echocardiographic algorithm for estimating right atrial pressure in severe tricuspid regurgitation: insights from simultaneous cardiac catheterization [^113wzXQs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

This study has several limitations that should be considered. First, the sample size was relatively small, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. Although the results were statistically significant, larger studies are needed to validate these findings and explore the utility of the proposed echocardiographic criteria in broader patient populations. Second, our results do not apply to severe pulmonary hypertension. It is well known that Doppler echocardiography may frequently be inaccurate in estimating PAP in patients with pulmonary hypertension, as TR V max is squared in the Bernoulli equation, which amplifies any measurement error or hemodynamic variability as velocity increases. Additionally, only 1 patient (2.1%) had a high mean RAP above 25 mm Hg; however, this patient also fulfilled all 3 of the proposed criteria. Since pulmonary hypertension can introduce additional inaccuracies in PASP estimation, further research should involve a more diverse cohort with a wider range of PASP and RAP values to better assess the reliability of echocardiographic measurements in severe TR. Third, the simplified Bernoulli equation has inherent limitations in patients with laminar TR flow, as it underestimates the true RVSP, even with high RAP. In this subgroup from our study, the bias between mean PAP derived from simultaneous echocardiography and that obtained from catheterization was −0.52 mm Hg, with 95% LOA ranging from −10.32 to 9.28 mm Hg. These findings suggest that a multiparametric approach should be considered when assessing pressure profiles, particularly in patients with laminar TR flow where the TR velocity is around 2 m/s, whatever the pulmonary pressure level. Particularly, recording pulmonary regurgitation and approaching pulmonary resistances could be helpful. Despite these limitations, our study provides valuable insights into the accuracy of echocardiographic PAP estimation in severe TR and reinforces the diagnostic role of echocardiography in this specific population, where long‐standing concerns about inaccuracies in echocardiographic PAP estimation have persisted. Furthermore, the new proposal for RAP estimation may offer clinical assistance in the evaluation and management of patients with severe TR.

### Normal range for pulmonary artery systolic pressure… [^113Ga75X]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor: In their Grand Rounds article on pulmonary hypertension as a complication of hereditary hemolytic anemias, Dr Barnett and colleagues1 reported that the upper limit of normal for pulmonary arterial systolic pressure derived from the echocardiographic measurement of the tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity is less than 30 mm Hg. However, this limit does not apply to at least one-third of normal persons, particularly those who are older or obese, in whom the upper limit of normal is 40 mm Hg.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary hypertension, more specifically with respect to echocardiography, CCS/CTS 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain a complete echocardiographic assessment in patients with suspected PH, including estimation of systolic pulmonary arterial pressure using the tricuspid regurgitation velocity jet, measurement of IVC size, and degree of inspiratory collapse, as well as assessment of "secondary" signs of PH, such as right atrial or RV enlargement, RV hypertrophy, septal flattening, and RV dysfunction.

### Management of tricuspid regurgitation – what's next? [^113tEuGr]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation is a highly prevalent condition, particularly in the aging population, and has gained significant attention over the past decade with the advent of transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions. This renewed interest has led to significant progress in understanding the mechanisms of TR, including the introduction of a new classification, advancements in imaging and TR quantification with the refinement of tricuspid valve anatomy nomenclature and grading scale, and the development of dedicated prognostic risk scores. The role of less-invasive therapeutic options in driving these advances should not be underestimated, including their influence on the development of new classifications that favor the demonstration of positive outcomes from these therapies.

### Association of right ventricular-pulmonary arterial coupling and progression of tricuspid regurgitation in patients with atrial fibrillation [^111YdCxk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

We randomly selected 20 patients from this study population and analyzed the intra‐ and interobserver reproducibility of the RV4CSL, pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), and vena contracta measurement using a Bland–Altman analysis. The intra‐ and interclass correlation coefficients of RV4CSL were 0.988 and 0.989. The Bland–Altman analysis showed the limits of agreement (LOA) across a broad range of RV4CSL, PASP, and vena contracta; the bias for intra‐ and interobserver measurements of RV4CSL was 0.36% (range: −0.21% to 0.92%) and 0.16% (range: −0.39% to 0.71%), PASP was −1.25% (range: −2.32% to −0.17%) and 2.15% (range: 0.35% to 3.95%), and vena contracta was −0.01% (range: −0.03% to 0.01%) and −0.03% (range: −0.05% to 0.01%), respectively.

Assessment of‐Coupling

RV‐PA coupling was calculated by dividing RV4CSL by PASP. Additionally, we assessed RV FAC/PASP, RV‐FWS/PASP, and TAPSE/PASP in sensitivity analysis.

Study Outcomes

The primary outcome was the progression of TR by at least more than a moderate degree on follow‐up echocardiography at least after 6 months from the initial examination. We additionally investigated the composite of clinical outcomes, including all‐cause death or HF hospitalization after follow‐up echocardiography to demonstrate whether the progression of TR leads to worse outcomes. HF hospitalization was defined as the presence of new‐onset or worsening HF‐related symptoms and signs that require intravenous diuretics in the emergency room or overnight hospitalization.

### Echocardiographic estimation of pulmonary pressure in patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation [^117Wyjpi]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The estimation of systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is challenging in patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR). The study aimed to determine the reliability of the assessment of sPAP by TTE in this population.

Methods

This study was a single-centre analysis of consecutive patients at the University Hospital of Rennes with right heart catheterisation and TTE, performed with a maximum delay of 48 hours. Lin's concordance coefficient (LCC) and Bland-Altman analysis were used to compare the values.

Results

After applying the exclusion criteria, 236 patients were included in the analysis (age 71 ± 11.5 years old; male 56%). The two principal indications were TR (34.3%) and mitral regurgitation (32.2%). The correlation between the two procedures was good in the total population (LCC = 0.80; 95% limits of agreement (LOA): 0.74, 0.84), but weaker in the 78 patients (33%) with severe TR (LCC = 0.67; 95% LOA: 0.49, 0.80), with a propensity to an underestimation by TTE. An elevated right atrial pressure (RAP) was associated with an underestimation by TTE of about 8mmHg. The presence of a 'V-wave cut-off' sign on continuous-wave Doppler (OR = 3.74; 95% CI 1.48, 9.30; p < 0.01), found exclusively in patients with severe TR, was an independent predictor of sPAP misestimation by TTE.

Conclusion

The reliability of the estimation of sPAP in patients with severe TR could be altered by high RAP which cannot be estimated with current thresholds.

### Accuracy of noninvasively determined pulmonary artery systolic pressure [^116VVyGS]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The noninvasive estimation of pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) has become a standard component of the echocardiographic examination. Our aim was to evaluate the accuracy of this modality in a large series of unselected studies obtained in clinical practice. All right heart catheterizations during a 4-year period were reviewed. Studies with echocardiographic findings available within 48 hours were evaluated for PASP agreement. In an effort to mirror clinical practice, the right heart catheterization findings were used as the reference standard and the PASP values were taken directly from the respective clinical reports. Overall, 792 right heart catheterization-echocardiogram pairs were identified. Echocardiographic PASP could not be estimated in 174 of these studies (22.0%). The correlation between modalities was moderate, but agreement was poor (bias 9.0%, 95% limits of agreement -53.2% to 71.2%, r = 0.52, p < 0.001). Misclassification of clinical PASP categories occurred more often than not (54.4%). Multivariate analysis using multiple potential sources of error could only account for 3.2% of the total variation in the discrepancy between the study modalities (p = 0.003). In conclusion, noninvasively estimated PASP had limited agreement with the invasively determined PASP, and misclassification of PASP clinical categories occurred frequently. Given the widespread use of echocardiographically determined PASP, these data are in need of replication in a large prospective study.

### Right ventricular-pulmonary arterial coupling in secondary tricuspid regurgitation [^115YHW7c]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic pressure-overload induces right ventricular (RV) adaptation to maintain RV-pulmonary arterial (PA) coupling. RV remodeling is frequently associated with secondary tricuspid regurgitation (TR) which may accelerate uncoupling. Our aim is to determine whether the non-invasive analysis of RV-PA coupling could improve risk stratification in patients with secondary TR. A total of 1,149 patients (median age 72[IQR, 63 to 79] years, 51% men) with moderate or severe secondary TR were included. RV-PA coupling was estimated using the ratio between two standard echocardiographic measurements: tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP). The risk of all-cause mortality across different values of TAPSE/PASP was analyzed with a spline analysis. The cut-off value of TAPSE/PASP to identify RV-PA uncoupling was based on the spline curve analysis. At the time of significant secondary TR diagnosis the median TAPSE/PASP was 0.35 (IQR, 0.25 to 0.49) mm/mm Hg. A total of 470 patients (41%) demonstrated RV-PA uncoupling (< 0.31 mm/mm Hg). Patients with RV-PA uncoupling presented more frequently with heart failure symptoms had larger RV and left ventricular dimensions, and more severe TR compared to those with RV-PA coupling. During a median follow-up of 51 (IQR, 17 to 86) months, 586 patients (51%) died. The cumulative 5-year survival rate was lower in patients with RV-PA uncoupling compared to their counterparts (37% vs 64%, p < 0.001). After correcting for potential confounders, RV-PA uncoupling was the only echocardiographic parameter independently associated with all-cause mortality (HR 1.462; 95% CI 1.192 to 1.793; p < 0.001). In conclusion, RV-PA uncoupling in patients with secondary TR is independently associated with poor prognosis and may improve risk stratification.

### New echocardiographic algorithm for estimating right atrial pressure in severe tricuspid regurgitation: insights from simultaneous cardiac catheterization [^115NwX3b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Transthoracic Echocardiography

Echocardiography was performed using a Vivid 7 ultrasound machine (GE Medical System, Milwaukee, WI). Standard 2‐dimensional echocardiographic measurements were conducted in accordance with the recommendations. The RA diameter was measured at end‐systole in the apical 4‐chamber view, and the RV diameter was measured at end‐diastole in the RV‐focused apical 4‐chamber view at both the mid and basal levels. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion was measured at the lateral portion of the tricuspid annulus in the RV‐focused apical 4‐chamber view using M‐mode echocardiography. The tricuspid annular s' velocity was also measured at the lateral portion of the tricuspid annulus in the RV‐focused view using tissue Doppler method.

To obtain the parameters of TR, multiple factors were evaluated, including the morphology of the tricuspid valve and annulus, enlargement and systolic function of the RV and RA, TR continuous‐wave Doppler profile, vena contracta, effective regurgitant orifice area, and hepatic vein systolic flow reversal. Multiple views were used to evaluate TR and record its Doppler profile. TR V max was measured at the point of highest velocity using continuous‐wave Doppler. RVSP was calculated using the simplified Bernoulli formula (4×(TR V max)² + eRAP), and this was referred to as PASP (PASP echo). Mean PAP was calculated using the time‐velocity integral method, which involves tracing the envelope of the continuous‐wave Doppler signal. The mean PAP was derived using the formula: mean PAP = time‐velocity integral of TR Doppler+estimated RAP. The V‐wave cutoff sign was identified by analyzing continuous‐wave Doppler recordings of TR velocity envelopes. This sign was defined as an abrupt late‐systolic drop in TR velocity, resulting in a truncated or parabolic waveform rather than the expected gradual deceleration. Doppler waveforms were assessed across multiple cardiac cycles to account for variability, particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation. To ensure consistency, 2 independent observers reviewed the Doppler recordings, and discrepancies were resolved by consensus. IVC size was measured in the subcostal view at a point 1 to 2 cm from the IVC–RA junction. During imaging, patients were asked to rapidly inhale or perform a "sniff", and a decrease in IVC diameter of < 50% was considered indicative of plethora. The IVC collapsibility index was calculated as [(maximum IVC diameter − minimum IVC diameter)/maximum IVC diameter]×100. IVC diameters were measured carefully to avoid transient dilatation caused by TR flow. In patients with atrial fibrillation, echocardiographic parameters were averaged over 3 consecutive beats with a heart rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute, following validated methods for pulmonary pressure assessment.

### Guidelines for the echocardiographic assessment of the right heart in adults and special considerations in pulmonary hypertension: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^1157qanC]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Pulmonary valve/right ventricular outflow tract (PV/RVOT) gradient and hemodynamic influences — In the absence of a gradient across the PV or RVOT, PASP is equal to RVSP. In severe PH with right heart failure, reduced RV contractility and decreased PA compliance result in a diminished RV-PA pressure gradient and unreliable RVSP measurements. Inadequate TR signal strength may underestimate RVSP, while severe TR with turbulent flow can result in potential overestimation; in functional TR and malcoaptation, laminar TR flow with a triangular CW Doppler signal contour reflects early equalization of RA-RV pressures and leads to underestimation of the RA-RV gradient. RV-RA gradients can be accurately calculated by the modified Bernoulli equation in patients with a parabolic TR velocity curve, whereas in patients with a V-wave cutoff sign the Bernoulli equation cannot be applied.

### New echocardiographic algorithm for estimating right atrial pressure in severe tricuspid regurgitation: insights from simultaneous cardiac catheterization [^113CKsHJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

The strength of our study lies in being the first, to the best of our knowledge, to directly compare echocardiography and RHC performed simultaneously in patients with severe TR, in contrast to previous studies that focused on correlations between these 2 methods. Various factors, such as diuretic therapy, fasting status, and patient discomfort or tension, could influence the pressure profile differently between noninvasive and invasive procedures, potentially affecting their correlation. Our study addresses these limitations by directly comparing echocardiographic and RHC measurements, thereby minimizing potential confounding factors like changes in volume status or hemodynamics between tests. We found that echocardiography demonstrated a good correlation for PASP estimation compared with RHC, with a correlation coefficient similar to that observed in previous studies involving unselected populations. A significant limitation of PASP estimation by echocardiography is the difficulty in obtaining a clear TR Doppler tracing. However, this issue is less prominent in cases of severe TR, where the regurgitant jet is well visualized. Our study findings suggest that echocardiography remains a reliable tool for estimating PASP even in patients with severe TR.

### Echocardiographic progression of peak tricuspid regurgitant velocity among Medicare beneficiaries [^112ZDBFg]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

While there may have been technical differences in echocardiographs used over the study period, the fundamental techniques and precision of TRV measurement have remained substantially unchanged since inception. Invasive hemodynamic assessment of PASP was not feasible and thus conclusions must be considered within the context of the limitations of TRV as a measure of pulmonary vascular function. Due to inherent inaccuracies in estimation of RA pressure, the analysis focused on TRV rather than estimated PASP. We utilized a TRV > 2.8 m/s to define baseline PH, but it is possible that a different cutoff may better identify mortality risk and propose this as a topic for future investigation. As TRV progression was defined as conditional predicted slope > 0, it is possible that the confidence limits for the conditional predicted slope cross zero, though this likely represents a small portion of the included population. Furthermore, it is possible that some individuals may experience TRV progression prior to death that was unobserved as they did not receive a second TTE. Thus, these results should be considered exploratory and are conditional on survival to receive a second TTE. Moreover, the current analysis assumes TRV progression is linear, though this assumption should be tested in future investigations. Lastly, while relevant in a minority of cases, the use of TRV to estimate PASP is not accurate in the setting of pulmonic stenosis.

### Transthoracic echocardiography for the evaluation of children and adolescents with suspected or confirmed pulmonary hypertension. expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and treatment of paediatric pulmonary hypertension. the European paediatric pulmonary vascular disease network, endorsed by ISHLT and D6PK [^117H5B2c]. Heart (2016). Medium credibility.

Estimation of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) — paediatric pulmonary hypertension (PH) by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is summarized as follows: The estimation of systolic PAP (PASP) is based on the peak velocity of the jet of tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and the mean (m)PAP can be calculated from the PA systolic pressure (≈ RVSP) as the mean PAP = 0.61×PASP+2 mm Hg. Using the accepted definition of paediatric PH as a mean PAP > 25 mm Hg and a PVR index > 3.0 Wood units•m² for biventricular circulations, usually TR velocity (TRV) values > 3–4 m/s, corresponding to a PASP > 50 mm Hg at rest, make PAH highly likely in the clinical suspicion of PH.

### Reliability of noninvasive assessment of systolic pulmonary artery pressure by Doppler echocardiography compared to right heart catheterization: analysis in a large patient population [^111KjDUg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that analyzes accuracy of noninvasive assessment of sPAP by Doppler echocardiography in comparison to invasive pressure measurement in a large, unselected patient population. In our study, Doppler echocardiography has proven to be a reliable noninvasive method for the assessment of sPAP. Furthermore, pulmonary hypertension could be detected with high sensitivity and specificity.

Our findings confirm previous reports. Thirty years ago, a first publication by Yock and Poppfound a high correlation between noninvasive and invasive data in 54 patients (r = 0.93, SEE = 8 mm Hg). Berger et alfound an even higher correlation in a study population of 41, when invasive and noninvasive examinations were conducted simultaneously in almost all patients (r = 0.97, SEE = 4.9 mm Hg). Currie et alassessed accuracy of noninvasively measured RVSP simultaneously with right heart catheterization in 127 patients and described very good correlations (r = 0.96, SEE = 7 mm Hg). Vazquez de Prada et alconducted a similar study including 34 patients with adequate CW Doppler tracings, with a time interval of 24 to 48 hours between examinations; nonetheless, they showed high correlations as well (r = 0.96).

Although recommended in many guidelines, and used routinely, noninvasive quantification of sPAP has never been tested sufficiently in unselected large patient populations undergoing routine echocardiography examination. This lack of information has sparked the discussion about reliability of this method. Few publications had mentioned doubts about is reliability. Arcasoy et alfound in a cohort study of 374 patients with advanced lung disease that in 52% of the cases, pressure estimations were inaccurate, and that 48% of patients were false positive for pulmonary hypertension as determined by echocardiography. Noninvasive estimation of sPAP was not possible in 57% of the patients. The authors suggested that factors related to chronic pulmonary disease may have influenced the results, limiting accurate visualization and measurement of the tricuspid regurgitation jet.

In our study, only 424 patients had to be excluded due to the absence of tricuspid regurgitation (20%). This ratio is much lower than described by Arcasoy et al. In 227 of these 424 patients, pulmonary hypertension with mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥ 25 mm Hg was documented invasively, confirming that absence of a measurable tricuspid regurgitation does not exclude PH.

### Impact of tricuspid regurgitation on long-term survival [^113epEmm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

The goal of this study was to examine mortality associated with tricuspid regurgitation (TR) after controlling for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), right ventricular (RV) dilation and dysfunction, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP).

Background

Tricuspid regurgitation is a frequent echocardiographic finding; however, the association with prognosis is unclear.

Methods

We retrospectively identified 5,223 patients (age 66.5 ± 12.8 years; predominantly male) undergoing echocardiography at one of three Veterans Affairs Medical Center laboratories over a period of four years. Follow-up data were available for four years (mean 498 ± 402 days). Kaplan-Meier and proportional hazards methods were used to compare differences in survival among TR grades.

Results

Mortality increased with increasing severity of TR. The one-year survival was 91.7% with no TR, 90.3% with mild TR, 78.9% with moderate TR, and 63.9% with severe TR. Moderate or greater TR was associated with increased mortality regardless of PASP (hazard ratio [HR] 1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16 to 1.49 for PASP > 40 mm Hg; HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.62 for PASP ≤ 40 mm Hg) and LVEF (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.66 for EF < 50%; HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.71 for EF ≥ 50%). When adjusted for age, LVEF, inferior vena cava size, and RV size and function, survival was worse for patients with moderate (HR 1.17, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.42) and severe TR (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.66) than for those with no TR.

Conclusions

We conclude that increasing TR severity is associated with worse survival in men regardless of LVEF or pulmonary artery pressure. Severe TR is associated with a poor prognosis, independent of age, biventricular systolic function, RV size, and dilation of the inferior vena cava.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1142sP7R]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Echocardiography and Doppler-based assessment of right ventricular (RV) function and load — 3-dimensional echocardiography is emerging as a potential alternative, perhaps more accurate, method of evaluating RV size and contractility, and close correlation exists between 3-dimensional echocardiography and MRI for RV size in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) and congenital heart disease (CHD). RV diastolic dysfunction may be measured with tissue Doppler early diastolic myocardial velocity at the tricuspid lateral annulus (E') and early diastolic tricuspid inflow (E) ratio (E/E'), and systolic annular velocity measurement includes velocity < 10 cm/s at the plane of the tricuspid annulus. An estimate of pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) can be made by Doppler interrogation of tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and PASP is calculated as the Doppler gradient across the tricuspid valve (TV) plus estimated right atrial pressure (RAP). The tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE)/PASP ratio has recently been proposed as a potential marker of RV–pulmonary artery (PA) coupling, and this ratio was lower in subjects who died within a similar distribution in the heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) populations. Inferior vena cava diameter and collapsibility with inspiration can be used to estimate RAP as a marker of volume status; hepatic vein flow reversal indicates severe TR; leftward interatrial septal bowing indicates RAP or volume overload; and diastolic septal flattening is associated with a volume-overloaded state, whereas systolic flattening is more consistent with pressure overload.

### A novel echocardiographic Doppler method for estimation of pulmonary arterial pressures [^117VpoGp]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Current noninvasive methods for estimating diastolic and mean pulmonary artery pressures (PAp) in children are cumbersome and have limited accuracy. We hypothesized that systolic PAp correlates with diastolic and mean PAp, and that this correlation can be used to estimate diastolic and mean PAp from Doppler flow data.

Methods

We recorded PAp in 112 patients 30 years or younger catheterized for heart failure, heart transplant, pulmonary hypertension, or congenital heart disease. We derived the relationship of systolic PAp to diastolic and mean PAp. We then applied these relations to systolic PAp measured by tricuspid regurgitation (TR) Doppler flow in a subset of 17 patients with pulmonary hypertension to predict mean and diastolic PAp, and correlated the results.

Results

An excellent linear relation was found between systolic PAp and both the diastolic and mean PAp measured at cardiac catheterization (r = 0.95, P < .0001; r = 0.98, P < .0001, respectively). The calculated diastolic PAp calculated from TR Doppler correlated well with invasive data (31 ± 13 vs 30 ± 11 mm Hg, respectively, not significant; r = 0.85, P < .0001) and surpassed existing methods that are based on pulmonary regurgitation for predicting diastolic PAp. Similarly, mean PAp calculated from TR Doppler flow correlated well with invasive data (r = 0.86, P < .0001).

Conclusion

A strong linear relationship between systolic and diastolic PAp allows for easy and accurate noninvasive estimation of diastolic and mean PAp from TR Doppler flow.

### Guidelines for the echocardiographic assessment of the right heart in adults and special considerations in pulmonary hypertension: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^116P335D]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension — determinants and nonparallel severity: In pulmonary hypertension (PH), tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is frequently multifactorial with primary and secondary mechanisms coexisting, and the degree of tricuspid valve annulus (TVA) dilatation may be a stronger determinant of functional TR (FTR) severity than leaflet tethering or papillary muscle displacement. Structural parameters such as TVA, tethering area, and eccentricity index are more closely associated with FTR severity than right ventricular systolic function or pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP). The severity of one condition does not reliably predict the other, as severe PH can occur without severe TR and, conversely, severe TR may develop without severe PH. Severely elevated right ventricular afterload can oppose regurgitant flow, promoting leaflet coaptation and potentially reducing FTR severity; high RV systolic pressure increases intracavitary forces and may temporarily improve leaflet apposition despite annular dilation or tethering.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2019). High credibility.

Pulmonary artery systolic pressure after edge-to-edge repair — role and example change: Pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) is an adjunctive measurement because it may be normal or elevated at rest in patients with moderate-to-severe MR, and elevated PASP may also be due to intrinsic pulmonary vascular disease rather than MR. In one study, the PASP fell from 36 ± 4 to 29 ± 7 mm Hg after MitraClip placement, with the fall primarily seen in patients with elevated baseline values.

### Natural history of tricuspid regurgitation after transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^113gj9J3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The impact of preoperative TR on outcomes after TAVI remains poorly characterized, and it is unknown how uncorrected TR evolves in response to TAVI alone. A few notable findings are evident from this study. First, moderate or greater TR was present in 13% of patients at the time of TAVI, which represents an appreciable proportion of patients undergoing TAVI. Second, significant TR had a substantial adverse impact after TAVI: Survival was significantly reduced, and the incidence of heart failure readmissions was significantly elevated in patients with pre‐TAVI moderate or greater TR. By implication, evolution of TR must be carefully surveilled after TAVI. Third, 12% of the entire cohort had moderate or greater TR at 1 year after TAVI, suggesting that TR does not reliably respond to correction of AS. Finally, certain clinical and echocardiographic parameters were found to be associated with progression or persistence of significant TR, while periprocedural variables related to valve implantation were not. Thus, even though more data are needed to establish guidelines for managing mixed AS and TR, these findings ought to inform decision making for managing the tricuspid valve in these patients.

Significant TR may be common in patients with severe AS. In this study, the prevalence of moderate or greater TR was 13%, which is consistent with prior reports that 11% to 15% of patients undergoing TAVI also have moderate to severe TR. Most commonly, significant TR develops secondary to left‐sided heart disease. Elevated right ventricular pressure and/or volume overload from left‐sided heart disease is associated with right ventricular dysfunction, TV annular dilation, adverse right ventricular remodeling, and TV leaflet tethering, all of which leads to significant TR. In the setting of aortic or mitral valve disease, left‐sided pressure overload is transmitted across the pulmonary vasculature, with pulmonary hypertension being independently associated with worse outcomes after TAVI. Unsurprisingly, patients in this study with moderate or greater TR had a lower ejection fraction, lower mean aortic TVPG, and higher PASP, compared with patients with less than moderate TR. As such, significant TR likely indicates patients with more advanced cardiomyopathy from their AS.

### New echocardiographic algorithm for estimating right atrial pressure in severe tricuspid regurgitation: insights from simultaneous cardiac catheterization [^116mvXvM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The accuracy of echocardiographic estimation of pulmonary artery pressure has been questioned in patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR). This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of echocardiographic estimates of pulmonary artery pressure compared with simultaneous right heart catheterization (RHC) in patients with severe TR.

Methods

In this prospective observational study, a total of 48 patients with severe TR were enrolled between September 2021 and August 2024 at an experienced RHC center. Data were obtained by simultaneously measuring echocardiography and RHC parameters. The correlation between pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP) measured by echocardiography and RHC was analyzed using Pearson correlation and Bland–Altman analysis.

Results

The median age was 71.5 years, and 26 (54.2%) of the patients were women. Forty‐three (89.6%) patients had secondary TR as the underlying pathogenesis. There was a good correlation (r = 0.85 as Pearson correlation, P < 0.001) between PASP measurements obtained via echocardiography and RHC, with a bias of +1.3 mm Hg and 95% limits of agreement ranging from −12.8 to 15.5 mm Hg. Incorporating parameters such as inferior vena cava collapsibility of ≤ 20%, hepatic vein systolic flow reversal, and the V‐wave cutoff sign further stratified the estimated right atrial pressure to 10, 15, or 20 mm Hg in patients initially estimated to have a right atrial pressure of 15 mm Hg (P < 0.001). The use of these new criteria improved the correlation for PASP estimation by echocardiography compared with RHC (r = 0.90, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Echocardiography demonstrated good agreement with invasively measured PASP. Incorporating additional echocardiographic parameters significantly enhanced the accuracy of PASP estimation, suggesting a refined noninvasive diagnostic approach in severe TR.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Medium credibility.

Hemodynamic assessment of the right ventricle and pulmonary circulation — estimation methods, formula, and diagnostic thresholds. SPAP can be estimated using TR velocity, PADP from the end-diastolic pulmonary regurgitation velocity, and mean PA pressure from PA acceleration time or derived from systolic and diastolic pressures. RVSP is calculated by the simplified Bernoulli equation, "RVSP = 4(V)² + RA pressure", using peak TR jet velocity with RA pressure estimated from IVC diameter and respiratory changes; in the absence of a pulmonic valve/RVOT gradient, "SPAP is equal to RVSP". Normal cutoff for invasively measured mean PA pressure is "25 mmHg", and normal resting values are "a peak TR… of ≤ 2.8 to 2.9 m/s or a peak systolic pressure of 35 or 36 mm Hg, assuming an RA pressure of 3 to 5 mm Hg". Further evaluation is recommended for dyspnea with estimated "RVSP ≥ 40 mm Hg", and some consider "SPAP greater than two thirds of the systemic blood pressure as indicative of severe PH". Obstruction at the RVOT or pulmonic valve should be excluded when RVSP is elevated.

### New echocardiographic algorithm for estimating right atrial pressure in severe tricuspid regurgitation: insights from simultaneous cardiac catheterization [^114NHawP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

The conventional echocardiographic estimation of RAP closely matched the invasively measured RAP in patients with predicted low RAPs of 3 and 8 mm Hg. However, in patients with an eRAP of 15 mm Hg, there was a wide range of invasively measured RAP values, from 4 to 26 mm Hg, which could lead to inaccuracies in PASP estimation. This discrepancy was similarly reported by Lemarchand et al. To address this issue, we used additional echocardiographic parameters to further stratify patients with an eRAP of 15 mm Hg. IVC collapsibility is a recognized marker of RAP. Several studies have suggested that an IVC collapsibility of 20% is indicative of an RAP of 10 mm Hg, with a high negative predictive value. Severe TR is frequently associated with hepatic vein systolic flow reversal, although no specific regurgitant volume is universally linked to this phenomenon. Both a large regurgitant volume and low RA compliance may contribute to this flow reversal. In our study, patients exhibiting hepatic vein systolic flow reversal had a high RAP, with a mean value approximating 15 mm Hg. Additionally, we used the V‐wave cutoff sign, which indicates rapid pressure equalization between RV and RA. This sign can be associated with a large effective regurgitant orifice area, high regurgitant volume, and elevated RAP. By incorporating these parameters, we stratified patients with an eRAP of 15 mm Hg into categories of 10, 15, or 20 mm Hg. This approach improved the accuracy of both RAP and PASP estimation. Using this refined method, echocardiography demonstrated a strong correlation with RHC for PASP estimation, highlighting its reliability even in the presence of severe TR. Despite the observed increase in bias from 1.3 to 1.6 mm Hg, which is minimal and unlikely to significantly influence clinical decision making, the introduction of these enhanced echocardiographic criteria represents a significant advancement in the noninvasive assessment of PAP. This method has the potential to improve clinical decision making and risk stratification for patients with severe TR. Future studies with larger cohorts are warranted to validate these findings and further refine the echocardiographic approach for broader clinical application.

Background

A surrogate of right ventricular-pulmonary arterial coupling, the ratio of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) to pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) has been associated with outcomes across a wide range of cardiac pathologies and interventions. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic significance of baseline TAPSE/PASP ratio in patients undergoing mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective analysis encompassing 448 days (interquartile range, 86–958 days) of follow-up after 707 consecutive isolated, first-time mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair procedures. Stratified by the cohort's median TAPSE/PASP ratio of 0.37 mm/mm Hg, eligible cases were examined for the occurrence of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization.

Results

Patients with low TAPSE/PASP ratios exhibited a greater prevalence of functional mitral regurgitation, a higher burden of comorbidities, and worse clinical and echocardiographic indices of cardiac function, as well as an attenuated rate of technical success. After the procedure, they experienced similar 1-month and 1-year improvement in mitral regurgitation grade and functional status but higher rates of death, heart failure hospitalizations, and the composite of both at all time points explored (1 year, 15.3% vs 7.6%, 20.7% vs 10.2%, and 32.3% vs 16.1%, respectively; P < .001 for all). Lower TAPSE/PASP ratio was independently associated with a higher risk for the 1-year combined end point of death or heart failure hospitalizations (hazard ratio, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.09–7.43; p = 0.033). A novel TAPSE/PASP-MitraScore risk model showed a better discriminative property than currently validated scores. Subgroup analysis produced similarly significant observations solely in patients with functional mitral regurgitation (n = 383 [54.2%]), which remained when using subgroup-specific medians of the baseline TAPSE/PASP ratio.

Conclusions

A low TAPSE/PASP ratio before mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair identifies higher risk patients and predicts a less favorable outcome after the procedure.

### Clinical value of a novel three-dimensional echocardiography-derived index of right ventricle-pulmonary artery coupling in tricuspid regurgitation [^116kFKCt]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Echocardiographic surrogates of right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery (RV-PA) coupling have been reported to be associated with outcomes in patients with secondary tricuspid regurgitation (STR). However, pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) is difficult to estimate using echocardiography in patients with severe STR. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the predictive power of a surrogate of RV-PA coupling obtained using right ventricular (RV) volumes measured on three-dimensional echocardiography.

Methods

One hundred eight patients (mean age, 73 ± 13 years; 61% women) with moderate or severe STR were included.

Results

At a median follow-up of 24 months (interquartile range, 2–48 months), 72 patients (40%) had reached the composite end point of death of any cause and heart failure hospitalization. RV-PA coupling was computed as the ratio between RV forward stroke volume (SV) (i.e. RV SV - regurgitant volume) and RV end-systolic volume (ESV). RV forward SV/ESV was significantly more related to the composite end point than RV ejection fraction (area under the curve, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.78–0.93] vs 0.73 [95% CI, 0.64–0.83], respectively; p = 0.03). A value of 0.40 was found to best correlate with outcome. On multivariate Cox regression, RV forward SV/ESV, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion/PASP, and RV free wall longitudinal strain/PASP were all independently associated with the occurrence of the composite end point when added to a group of parameters including STR severity (severe vs moderate), atrial fibrillation, pulmonary arterial hypertension, right atrial volume, RV end-diastolic volume, and RV free wall longitudinal strain. RV forward SV/ESV < 0.40 (HR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.49–7.56; P < .01) carried higher related risk than RV free wall longitudinal strain/PASP < -0.42%/mm Hg (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.26–7.84; p = 0.01) and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion/PASP < 0.36 mm/mm Hg (HR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.29–5.58; p = 0.01). RV ejection fraction did not correlate independently with prognosis when added to the same group of variables.

Conclusions

RV forward SV/ESV is associated with the risk for death and heart failure hospitalization in patients with STR.

### Reliability of noninvasive assessment of systolic pulmonary artery pressure by Doppler echocardiography compared to right heart catheterization: analysis in a large patient population [^116iTHC6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Numerous cardiac and pulmonary pathologies are associated with an increase in pulmonary artery pressures (PAP), and multiple studies evidenced the prognostic relevance of pulmonary hypertension (PH). This condition is characterized by an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, leading to right heart failure and death if left untreated. – Furthermore, even slightly elevated PAP may have adverse prognostic implications in the general population. Therefore, the measurement of PAP has gained wide acceptance in the assessment and follow‐up of patients with cardiac or pulmonary disorders.

Direct pressure measurement with right heart catheterization is the reference method and "gold standard" for quantification of PAP; however, a noninvasive assessment of pulmonary artery systolic pressure (sPAP) by Doppler echocardiography is feasible, and represents a keystone examination in suspected PH according to current guidelines. Furthermore, echocardiography may represent an important step in the diagnosis work‐up in diseases in which prognosis may be largely affected by PH and may even differentiate the causes of PH. – However, a reliable noninvasive quantification by Doppler echocardiography is an important prerequisite.

Assessment of sPAP by continuous‐wave Doppler was first reported by Yock and Popp 30 years ago. Right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) is calculated from the maximal flow velocity of the tricuspid valve regurgitation using the modified Bernoulli equation ΔP = 4×Vmax², and adding an estimated RAP. First publications of noninvasive sPAP measurements by Doppler echocardiography were very encouraging. – Although assessment of RAP was simplified, a study by Chan et alin 1987 suggested that this method of noninvasive PAP assessment is superior compared to other noninvasive approaches. For many years, noninvasive PAP measurement by addition of RVSP and estimated RAP is advised and used in standard echocardiography routinely. However, until now only studies with small and selected patient populations were conducted to assess correlation between sPAP measurements by right heart catheterization and Doppler echocardiography. Furthermore, some recent studies questioned the accuracy of noninvasively measured sPAP. –

Thus, in this study we aimed to analyze the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of noninvasive PAP assessment compared to invasive measurements in a large patient population of a high‐turnover tertiary cardiac care center.

### Determinants of right heart hemodynamic derangement in patients with and without tricuspid regurgitation [^115QYUiS]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

RA Hemodynamic Derangement in TR

Multiple reports on the various invasive hemodynamic presentations of TR have been published in recent years. Although there is no standardized method for reading RA pressure during RHC (eg, whether it should be measured at end-expiration or averaged throughout the respiratory cycle), RA pressure, and particularly its systolic component, or V wave, has generally been considered a classic marker of TR severity. Consequently, the reduction of RA V wave amplitude following transcatheter procedures on the tricuspid valve has been reported as a marker of intervention effectiveness and improved outcomes.

Our study confirmed that increasing TR severity is associated with higher RA pressure and RA V wave values and amplitudes. However, we also found that other details of the RA pressure waveform may be associated with increased TR severity, including a lower difference between PA systolic pressure and RA V wave (as a sign of ventricularization of RA pressure) and a higher ratio between mean RA pressure and PAWP.

Furthermore, changes in RA pressures related to respiration are often overlooked or not reported. Nevertheless, RA pressure changes during spontaneous breathing may be important in characterizing severe TR. We observed that RA pressure systolic amplitude, as well as the ratio between RA pressure and PAWP increased during inspiration in patients with severe TR, consistent with a hemodynamic Kussmaul sign.

Pulmonary Blood Flow in TR

In our cohort, patients with severe TR presented with low median CI and SV index, as determined through the direct Fick method. The great majority of them had a CI < 2 L/min per m². This is consistent with the fact that, by increasing the RegFr, the forward SV may decrease, despite RV dilation. However, low CI was not an invariable finding in previous hemodynamic studies. Our data, albeit obtained in a relatively small cohort, seem to confirm that the indirect Fick method provides unreliable results in the individual patient with TR. In particular, and contrary to previous reports where quantification of TR was not provided, we could show that the indirect Fick method may lead to an overestimation of CI which is proportional to TR severity, further arguing against its use in patients with TR. When the direct Fick CO calculation cannot be implemented, thermodilution should be preferredover indirect Fick (unless an intracardiac shunt is present).

### Guidelines for the echocardiographic assessment of the right heart in adults: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography endorsed by the European association of echocardiography, a registered branch of the European Society of Cardiology, and the Canadian society of echocardiography [^114maxyP]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2010). Medium credibility.

Right heart echocardiography — reporting recommendations for pulmonary pressures: Pulmonary hemodynamics are feasible in most subjects, and SPAP should be estimated and reported in all subjects with reliable tricuspid regurgitant jets; the recommended method is by TR velocity using the simplified Bernoulli equation with an estimate of RA pressure. In patients with PA hypertension or heart failure, an estimate of PADP from either the mean gradient of the TR jet or from the pulmonary regurgitant jet should be reported. If the estimated SPAP is > 35 to 40 mm Hg, stronger scrutiny may be warranted to determine if pulmonary hypertension is present, factoring in other clinical information.

### Determinants and prognostic value of pulmonary arterial pressure in patients with chronic heart failure [^111EpXKi]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

The epidemiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in patients with heart failure (HF) is poorly described. Our aim was to investigate the determinants and prognostic significance of PAH in a large representative outpatient population with HF.

Methods and Results

Routine measurement of right ventricular tricuspid pressure gradient (RVTG) was attempted among unselected, consecutive referrals to an HF clinic. The diagnosis of HF was based on symptoms, signs, echocardiography, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Of 2100 patients referred, 1380 were diagnosed as HF, of whom 1026 had left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and 354 did not. Right ventricular tricuspid pressure gradient could be measured in 270 (26%) patients with and 143 (40%) without LVSD. The highest RVTG quartile [RVTG > 35 mmHg equivalent to an estimated PA systolic pressure (PASP) > 45 mmHg] constituted 7% of all those with HF and was associated with higher LV filling pressures, LV end-diastolic volume, LVSD, and more severe mitral regurgitation (MR). During a median (inter-quartile range) follow-up of 66 (56–74) months, mortality was 40.3%. Mortality was similar in the lowest quartile of RVTG and in those in whom RVTG could not be measured and rose with increasing RVTG quartile (log-rank: 26.9; P < 0.0001). The highest RVTG quartile, age, blood pressure, and log NT-proBNP independently predicted mortality. Right ventricular tricuspid pressure gradient > 35 mmHg had a 96% specificity to discriminate between those with and without HF in patients without LVSD.

Conclusion

Using a definition of PASP > 45 mmHg, 7% of the patients with HF have PAH, which is associated with worse LV function, MR, and prognosis. Whether PAH is a target for therapy in this population remains to be elucidated.

### New echocardiographic algorithm for estimating right atrial pressure in severe tricuspid regurgitation: insights from simultaneous cardiac catheterization [^113Hi7tc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Pulmonary hypertension is a recognized poor prognostic factor in patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR), making it a critical component in current guidelines. In addition, elevated right atrial pressure (RAP) itself is associated with an increased risk of death. Therefore, accurate estimation of right heart pressure is crucial for clinical decision making. Although right heart catheterization (RHC) remains the gold standard for hemodynamic measurements, Doppler echocardiography is widely adopted to estimate pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and RAP, due to the invasive nature of RHC. This echocardiographic method calculates right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) using the maximal velocity of tricuspid regurgitation (TR V max) and estimated RAP (eRAP). In the absence of pulmonary valve stenosis, RVSP is considered equivalent to PAP. However, the accuracy and reliability of echocardiographic estimates of PAP have been questioned in the context of severe TR. The simplified Bernoulli equation, commonly used to estimate PAP, may be unreliable in these patients due to rapid pressure equalization between the right ventricle (RV) and right atrium (RA). Furthermore, a large regurgitant volume can complicate conventional RAP estimation on the basis of the size and collapsibility of the inferior vena cava (IVC).

Despite its widespread use, several retrospective observational studies have reported significant discrepancies between echocardiographic and invasive catheterization measurements of PAP in patients with severe TR. These discrepancies arise from challenges such as rapid pressure equalization between the RV and RA and the limitations of conventional RAP estimation methods. However, despite long‐standing concerns regarding the accuracy of echocardiographic PAP estimation in severe TR, no prospective study has directly addressed this issue using simultaneous RHC and echocardiography.

In this study, we aimed to prospectively compare echocardiographic and invasive PAP measurements using simultaneous RHC in patients with severe TR. Notably, our study is the first to incorporate refined echocardiographic criteria, including parameters such as IVC collapsibility, hepatic vein systolic flow reversal, and the V‐wave cutoff sign, to address the limitations of RAP estimation and enhance overall diagnostic accuracy.

Comparison ofandBetween theand Simultaneous Echocardiography

Compared with RHC, simultaneous echocardiography demonstrated a bias of +1.3 mm Hg for PASP (95% LOA, −12.8 to 15.5 mm Hg; Figure 1A). There was a good correlation between the 2 tests (r = 0.85, P < 0.001; Figure 1B). The intraclass correlation coefficient between the 2 measures was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.74–0.91). However, 9 (18.8%) patients exhibited a difference of 10 mm Hg or more in PASP between RHC and simultaneous echocardiography.

There was a good correlation between the 2 tests (r = 0.85, P < 0.001). LOA indicates limits of agreement; PASP, pulmonary artery systolic pressure; and RHC, right heart catheterization.

Among the 48 patients, eRAP values were 3 mm Hg in 9 (18.8) patients, 8 mm Hg in 8 (16.7) patients, and 15 mm Hg in 31 (64.6%) patients. The invasively measured RAP for these groups was 3.9 ± 2.0, 8.1 ± 2.2, and 15.0 ± 5.2 mm Hg, respectively (P < 0.001; Figure 2). However, patients with an eRAP of 15 mm Hg exhibited a wide range of invasively measured RAP values, from 4 to 26 mm Hg.

### Addressing the controversy of estimating pulmonary arterial pressure by echocardiography [^114QnMUz]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There is currently controversy over whether echocardiography provides reliable estimations of pulmonary pressures. The objective of this study was to determine the factors influencing the accuracy and reliability of estimating right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) using echocardiography in patients with advanced lung disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Methods

Between January 2001 and December 2012, 667 patients with advanced lung disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension underwent right heart catheterization and transthoracic echocardiography. Of those, 307 had both studies within 5 days of each other. The correlation and bias in estimating RVSP according to tricuspid regurgitation (TR) signal quality and reader expertise were retrospectively determined. Reasons for under- and overestimation were analyzed. The diagnostic performance of estimated RVSP, relative right ventricular size, eccentricity index, and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion was compared for classifying patients with pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥ 25 mm Hg).

Results

Invasive mean and systolic pulmonary artery pressures were strongly correlated (R(2) = 0.95, P < .001), with mean pulmonary artery pressure = 0.60 × systolic pulmonary artery pressure + 2.1 mm Hg. Among patients undergoing right heart catheterization and transthoracic echocardiography within 5 days, level 3 readers considered only 61% of TR signals interpretable, compared with 72% in clinical reports. Overestimation in the clinical report was related mainly to not assigning peak TR velocity at the modal frequency and underestimation to overreading of uninterpretable signals. When the TR signal was interpretable, the areas under the curve for classifying pulmonary hypertension were 0.97 for RVSP and 0.98 for RVSP and eccentricity index (P > .05). When TR signals were uninterpretable, eccentricity index and right ventricular size were independently associated with pulmonary hypertension (area under the curve, 0.77).

Conclusions

Echocardiography reliably estimates RVSP when attention is given to simple quality metrics.

### Measuring health status in patients with tricuspid regurgitation… [^114MZfSt]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Severe tricuspid regurgitation is a common finding in patients with a variety of comorbid conditions, including chronic heart failure, lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and right ventricular dysfunction and is associated with impaired health status and worse survival. 1 Isolated tricuspid valve surgery is associated. with relatively high morbidity and/or mortality, often in the setting of concomitant severe right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and frailty. 2, 3 Consequently, there is a rapidly expanding landscape of transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions with relatively low in-hospital mortality, but no clear demonstrable improvements in survival or heart failure hospitalizations. 4 Measures of success for these interventions have been focused instead on health status, exercise capacity, and reduction in the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.

Common instruments used to measure health status have included heart failure–specific tools, such as the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire, and generic instruments, such as the 36-Item Short Form-Health Survey. Despite the importance of health status and its use as key outcomes in studies of TTVI, the validity of these instruments to measure health status in these patients has not been well established.

### Echocardiographic Doppler estimation of pulmonary artery pressure in critically ill patients with severe hypoxemia [^115pJyF5]. Anesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

In spontaneously breathing cardiac patients, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) can be accurately estimated from the transthoracic Doppler study of pulmonary artery and tricuspid regurgitation blood flows. In critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation for acute lung injury, the interposition of gas between the probe and the heart renders the transthoracic approach problematic. This study was aimed at determining whether the transesophageal approach could offer an alternative.

Methods

Fifty-one consecutive sedated and ventilated patients with severe hypoxemia (arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen < 300) were prospectively studied. Mean PAP measured from the pulmonary artery catheter was compared with several indices characterizing pulmonary artery blood flow assessed using transesophageal echocardiography: preejection time, acceleration time, ejection duration, preejection time on ejection duration ratio, and acceleration time on ejection duration ratio. In a subgroup of 20 patients, systolic PAP measured from the pulmonary artery catheter immediately before withdrawal was compared with Doppler study of regurgitation tricuspid flow performed immediately after pulmonary artery catheter withdrawal using either the transthoracic or the transesophageal approach.

Results

Weak and clinically irrelevant correlations were found between mean PAP and indices of pulmonary artery flow. A statistically significant and clinically relevant correlation was found between systolic PAP and regurgitation tricuspid flow. In 3 patients (14%), pulmonary artery pressure could not be assessed echocardiographically.

Conclusions

In hypoxemic patients on mechanical ventilation, mean PAP cannot be reliably estimated from indices characterizing pulmonary artery blood flow. Systolic PAP can be estimated from regurgitation tricuspid flow using either transthoracic or transesophageal approach.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Mitral regurgitation — continuous wave Doppler (CWD) jet characteristics: In most patients, maximum MR velocity is 4–6 m/sec due to the high systolic pressure gradient between the left ventricle (LV) and left atrium (LA), and the density of the CWD signal is a qualitative index of MR severity such that a dense signal suggests significant MR whereas a faint signal is likely to be mild or trace; CWD should also be used to interrogate the tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet to estimate pulmonary artery (PA) systolic pressure as an indirect clue to MR severity and compensation for the volume overload.

### Interventricular septal curvature as an additional echocardiographic parameter for evaluating chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: a single-center retrospective study [^111HuFwk]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is caused by untreated thromboembolism of the pulmonary arteries, leading to right ventricular afterload, progression of pulmonary hypertension (PH), and life-threatening right heart failure. Pulmonary artery pressure measurement using right-sided heart catheterization (RHC) is considered the gold standard for diagnosing PH, but RHC can be challenging because of the invasiveness of the procedure. Echocardiography is routinely used for patients with suspected or diagnosed PH to roughly check the severity of PH and determine if they need RHC to manage PH.

Tricuspid regurgitant pressure gradient (TRPG) measured using echocardiography is among highly reliable parameters in the noninvasive measures for predicting actual systolic pulmonary arterial pressure measured using RHC (sPAP RHC). Therefore, TRPG is widely used for estimating sPAP RHC in clinical practice. However, we sometimes encounter PH patients in whom the systolic pulmonary arterial pressure estimated using TRPG (esPAP TRPG) clearly differs from the sPAP RHC, resulting in critical management errors. One reason for this discrepancy (i.e. between esPAP TRPG and sPAP RHC) is that esPAP TRPG depends on the degree of the angle between the tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet and Doppler beam. Another possible reason is that some patients have too trivial TR to measure TR velocity, resulting in seemingly normal TRPG values. Previous studies have reported that esPAP TRPG might be significantly underestimated in some patients with severe PH because the modified Bernoulli equation cannot be used in such cases. Thus, esPAP TRPG cannot always be helpful in evaluating the severity of PH. Therefore, other echocardiographic components are required for better management of patients with unreliable TRPG.

### Pediatric pulmonary hypertension: guidelines from the American Heart Association and American Thoracic Society [^112U9Rz7]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Echocardiography performance versus cardiac catheterization in BPD shows limitations: Past studies in congenital heart disease demonstrated excellent correlation coefficients (r values between 0.93 and 0.97) with catheterization in children < 2 years, but in BPD infants one study found systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) could be estimated in only 61% of studies with poor correlation. Echocardiogram estimates correctly identified the presence or absence of PH in 79% but severity was correctly assessed in only 47%, and seven of 12 children (58%) without PH by echocardiogram had PH on subsequent catheterization. In the absence of a measurable tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet, qualitative signs have relatively poor predictive value; despite limitations, echocardiography remains the best available screening tool for PH in BPD patients.

### It's all about that right ventricle [^112FMX5S]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Often the forgotten ventricle, the right ventricle is gaining traction as a major determinant of outcomes across a spectrum of cardiovascular disorders. In this context, there has been recent interest in the concept of right ventricle–pulmonary artery (PA) coupling, and particularly on the detrimental impact to outcomes when the RV can no longer compensate for elevated afterload and right ventricle–PA uncoupling ensues, resulting in right ventricular (RV) failure. In this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Hatab et al present a timely article exploring the impact and influence of RV function and RV uncoupling on outcomes in patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) undergoing mitral transcatheter edge‐to‐edge repair (M‐TEER).

Traditionally, the right ventricle has been difficult to evaluate, due to its complex geometry and concurrent longitudinal and radial contractility. Commonly employed echocardiographic measures such as tricuspid annular plane of systolic excursion (TAPSE), RV systolic tissue velocity (S′) and RV 2‐dimensional global longitudinal strain provide some objective measures of right ventricular function, but preferentially evaluate longitudinal function to the exclusion of radial function and could result in overestimation and false reassurance of RV function. While 3‐dimensional echocardiography enables full volume measurements and calculation of RV ejection fraction, this technique has proven practically difficult in many patients with suboptimal acoustic windows and large RV size precluding complete capture by 3‐dimensional volume sector. These noninvasive measures to estimate RV afterload are subject to several limitations and assumptions, which reduce accuracy and reliability of measurements. The widest adopted technique involves using the modified Bernoulli equation as a rudimentary tool for estimation of pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), which is calculated by imputing the peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity and right atrial pressure. While useful as a guide, this measure is notoriously less accurate at higher pulmonary pressures. Additionally, it is dependent on a reliable tricuspid regurgitation jet, which may not be obtainable in all patients.

### 10 issues for the clinician in tricuspid regurgitation evaluation and management: 2025 ACC expert consensus decision pathway: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^114RDid9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) assessment in severe TR — systolic pulmonary artery (PA) pressure can be estimated by echocardiography and assumed equivalent to right ventricular (RV) systolic pressure if there is no significant pulmonic valve gradient; RV systolic pressure is calculated as RV systolic pressure = 4(V)² + RA pressure where V is the peak TR jet velocity. Recent invasive studies have shown inaccuracy of guideline-suggested right atrial (RA) pressure assumptions using inferior vena cava (IVC) size and collapsibility; in these situations, an invasive assessment with right heart catheterization is advised and is also necessary to distinguish precapillary PH from postcapillary PH. The presence of precapillary PH in the setting of severe TR is associated with worse outcomes after T-TEER.

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) — pulmonary artery acceleration time (PAAT) in paediatric pulmonary hypertension: The PA forward flow velocity in the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) with pulsed wave (PW)-Doppler proximal to the pulmonary valve can be used to obtain PAAT, which is the interval in milliseconds from the onset of ejection to the peak flow velocity and can estimate right ventricular (RV) pressure and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP). Even without a complete tricuspid regurgitation (TR) continuous wave (CW)-Doppler envelope, PAAT measurements are possible in 99% of patients. In adults, a PAAT < 100 ms is considered abnormal and an indicator for elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), while in children, a PAAT > 124 ms was suggested as a cut-off to distinguish patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) from healthy controls; accurate Doppler sample placement/alignment is essential, and PAAT is dependent on heart rate and RV function.

### Prognostic implication of right ventricular free wall longitudinal strain and right atrial pressure estimated by echocardiography in patients with severe functional tricuspid regurgitation [^116AqtRt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Severe functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is associated with poor outcomes. In recent years, treatment options for TR have expanded, including transcatheter tricuspid valve therapy. Various risk factors, including irreversible right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension (PHT), and end‐organ damage, have been investigated to enhance the prognosis through early intervention.

The relationship between RV function and PHT is reportedly important for prognosis in patients with severe TR. As for RV function, recent studies have suggested that RV free wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS) is the most sensitive predictor of clinical outcomes, as it can detect RV systolic dysfunction earlier than other conventional parameters in patients with severe functional TR (FTR). Noninvasive RV–pulmonary arterial coupling surrogates are widely recognized as indicators of RV contractility adaptation to afterload. However, the clinical utility of noninvasive RV–pulmonary arterial coupling surrogates in patients with severe FTR is controversial. This inconsistency could be attributed to the fact that pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) estimated by Doppler echocardiography is often underestimated in severe TR. Determination of PASP and right atrial (RA) pressure requires right heart catheterization (RHC), which is not practical for routine hemodynamic assessment. RA pressure (RAP) can be estimated using inferior vena cava (IVC) morphology easily and is a component of estimated PASP.RAP is affected by RA, RV function, volume overload attributable to TR, and PHT. In heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and congenital heart disease, the utility of RAP for the risk stratification was reported. Elevated RAP may serve as a comprehensive indicator to stratify the risk in patients with severe TR.

We hypothesized that RVFWLS is a more accurate predictor than RV fractional area change (RVFAC), and elevated RAP provides additional predictive value in patients with severe FTR. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic implication of elevated RAP and RVFWLS in patients with severe FTR. In addition, we examined the potential benefits of combining RVFWLS with elevated RAP for better risk stratification.

Conclusions

Our study validates the noninvasive quantification of sPAP by Doppler echocardiography in a large, unselected patient population. Values obtained noninvasively show reliable results and good correlation to invasive measurements. PH can be detected with high sensitivity and specificity. However, several pitfalls should be taken into account to achieve best results.

### New echocardiographic algorithm for estimating right atrial pressure in severe tricuspid regurgitation: insights from simultaneous cardiac catheterization [^115qd61Y]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective study, we assessed the accuracy of echocardiographic estimation of PASP compared with simultaneous RHC in patients with severe TR. Our findings demonstrate a strong correlation between echocardiographic and RHC measurements, validating the use of echocardiography in this complex patient population. Furthermore, incorporating additional echocardiographic parameters, such as IVC collapsibility, hepatic vein systolic flow reversal, and the presence of a V‐wave cutoff sign, significantly improved the accuracy of both RAP and PASP estimations. Our refined echocardiographic criteria provide an accessible and reproducible method for RAP estimation, potentially guiding treatment decisions in patients with severe TR, particularly in resource‐limited settings where RHC may not be routinely available.

Clinically significant TR, defined as moderate or greater in severity, is common in the global population. Severe TR is a progressive condition associated with substantial morbidity, poor quality of life, and increased mortality rate. Pulmonary hypertension is a critical prognostic factor in this setting, often serving as a contraindication for tricuspid valve surgery due to its association with poor outcomes. While Doppler echocardiography is widely used for noninvasive PAP estimation, concerns have been raised about its accuracy in the presence of severe TR. The simplified Bernoulli equation, commonly used to calculate PAP, may become unreliable due to altered hemodynamics in severe TR, such as broad and laminar flow, where inertial forces become nonnegligible. In patients exhibiting laminar systolic TR flow, the simplified Bernoulli equation may significantly underestimate PASP, with TR V max often measured around 2 m/s. Additionally, highly elevated RAP, which cannot be properly estimated using current recommendations, can lead to underestimation of both RAP and PASP. Furthermore, a prominent V‐wave and dynamic RAP contribute to the potential inaccuracies in estimating RAP. These challenges underscore the need for refined echocardiographic techniques and further validation.

### Atrial secondary tricuspid regurgitation: pathophysiology, definition, diagnosis, and treatment [^114KFUdY]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Both tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and the RV fractional area change are heavily affected by RV volume overload and are likely to overestimate the actual RV function in patients with severe A-STR. The ratio between RV systolic function parameters and the Doppler-estimated pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP) [TAPSE/PASP or RV free wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS)/PASP] has been proposed as a surrogate for the invasively determined RV-pulmonary artery (PA) coupling. Despite the limited accuracy of PASP estimation in massive/torrential STR characterized by a large effective regurgitant orifice area with low-flow velocity and rapid equalization of the RV and RA pressures, TAPSE/PASP < 0.36 mm/mmHg and RVFWLS/PASP < −0.42%/mmHg have been associated with worse outcomes in medically treated patients with clinically relevant TR, whilst TAPSE/PASP < 0.39–0.41 mm/mmHg was associated with increased mortality after TTVI. A RV-PA coupling using TAPSE and invasively measured PASP (proposed cut-offs of < 0.29–0.30 mm/mmHg), improved the outcome prediction compared with the non-invasive TAPSE/PASP.

We performed a simultaneous Doppler and invasive study to validate the role of Doppler-derived peak pulmonary regurgitant velocity as a reliable noninvasive measure of pulmonary artery mean pressure. Assessment of right atrial pressure, as shown in this study, enhances the use of this Doppler parameter as a correlate of pulmonary artery mean pressure.

Heart (2016). Medium credibility.

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) continuous wave (CW)-Doppler estimation of right ventricular (RV) and pulmonary artery (PA) pressures is illustrated by measuring tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity, where "The peak TR velocity is above 4 m/s", and, when combined with an estimated right atrial (RA) pressure, "will estimate the systolic RV pressure that is approximately the systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) (in the absence of pulmonary stenosis)". Using pulmonary regurgitation (PR) spectra, "The mean PAP can be seen as the PR gradient with a markedly increased value of 48 mm Hg compared with normal values (< 25 mm Hg)", and "The end-diastolic regurgitation velocity (yellow line) is 2.5 m/s"; "When added to an estimated mean RA pressure of 10 mm Hg, this suggests a diastolic PA pressure (dPAP) of 35 mm Hg". Technique considerations include that "Velocity measurements are dependent on the angle of interrogation (goal: Doppler sample in line with the blood flow)", and limitations include that "A limitation of the CW-Doppler velocity measurements includes cases with severe TR when the PASP usually is underestimated", with "Inappropriate estimation of RAP and the use of inadequate Doppler signals" noted as "frequent pitfalls in TTE that led to incorrect PAP estimations". When feasible, "If PR can be interrogated with CW-Doppler, mPAP and end-diastolic PA pressure can be estimated from the maximum (early diastolic) and minimum (end-diastolic) PR velocity (PRV) using the simplified Bernoulli equation".

### Pulmonary hypertension in mitral regurgitation [^112rrbN6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Diagnostic Evaluation

Echocardiography

Echocardiography has become established as the primary tool not only for evaluating the severity and etiology of MR, but also for the screening and monitoring of sequelae such as pulmonary hypertension (Table). Estimation of the PASP using Doppler‐derived RV systolic pressure (RVSP) is the most commonly used noninvasive test for the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension. Transthoracic Doppler echocardiography allows for measurement of the peak tricuspid regurgitant velocity (TRV), which is used to calculate the systolic pressure gradient between the RV and right atrium using the modified Bernoulli's equation. The value of this pressure gradient is then added to a noninvasive estimation of the mean RAP using inferior vena cava diameter at end‐expiration to calculate the RVSP. Because the systolic pressure gradient across the pulmonary valve is generally negligible, the RVSP is considered an acceptable surrogate for the PASP. Whereas initial studies showed adequate correlation between Doppler‐derived RVSP and invasively measured PASP, others have shown a significant lack of correlation in certain clinical situations. – For example, in the presence of significant tricuspid regurgitation, the modified Bernoulli's equation cannot be properly applied and the TRV underestimates the RVSP. Incomplete Doppler envelope resulting from eccentric or trace tricuspid regurgitation is another common cause of underestimation of RVSP. Thus, over‐reliance on Doppler‐derived RVSP for the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension can lead to misclassification of its severity or even failure to identify it. Furthermore, even when RVSP is appropriately measured, it may belie the true severity of pulmonary hypertension in the presence of significant RV contractile dysfunction or low cardiac output.

### Pulmonary artery acceleration time provides an accurate estimate of systolic pulmonary arterial pressure during transthoracic echocardiography [^113TTHdK]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Transthoracic echocardiographic estimates of peak systolic pulmonary artery pressure are conventionally calculated from the maximal velocity of the tricuspid regurgitation (TR) jet. Unfortunately, there is insufficient TR to determine estimated peak systolic pulmonary artery pressure (EPSPAP) in a significant number of patients. To date, in the absence of TR, no noninvasive method of deriving EPSPAP has been developed.

Methods

Five hundred clinically indicated transthoracic echocardiograms were reviewed over a period of 6 months. Patients with pulmonic stenosis were excluded. Pulsed-wave Doppler was used to measure pulmonary artery acceleration time (PAAT) and right ventricular ejection time. Continuous-wave Doppler was used to measure the peak velocity of TR (TR(Vmax)), and EPSPAP was calculated as 4 × TR(Vmax)² + 10 mm Hg (to account for right atrial pressure). The relationship between PAAT and EPSPAP was then assessed.

Results

Adequate imaging to measure PAAT was available in 99.6% of patients (498 of 500), but 25.3% (126 of 498) had insufficient TR to determine EPSPAP, and 1 patient had significant pulmonic stenosis. Therefore, 371 were included in the final analysis. Interobserver variability for PAAT was 0.97. There were strong inverse correlations between PAAT and TR(Vmax) (r = -0.96), the right atrial/right ventricular pressure gradient (r = -0.95), and EPSPAP (r = -0.95). The regression equation describing the relationship between PAAT and EPSPAP was log(10)(EPSPAP) = -0.004 (PAAT) + 2.1 (P < .001).

Conclusions

PAAT is routinely obtainable and correlates strongly with both TR(Vmax) and EPSPAP in a large population of randomly selected patients undergoing transthoracic echocardiography. Characterization of the relationship between PAAT and EPSPAP permits PAAT to be used to estimate peak systolic pulmonary artery pressure independent of TR, thereby increasing the percentage of patients in whom transthoracic echocardiography can be used to quantify pulmonary artery pressure.

### Right ventricular-pulmonary artery uncoupling and strain in acute heart failure [^112DBVKF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) has been recognized as an ominous prognostic feature related to poor outcome in patients with heart failure (HF). Additionally, RVD is often related to a more relevant pulmonary and systemic congestion status leading to poorer exercise tolerance and quality of life.

Although many echocardiographic measurements of right ventricular (RV) function are currently available, such as analysis of tricuspid annular peak systolic excursion (TAPSE) and RV longitudinal strain, few studies have been evaluated RVD in an acute setting. Several echocardiographic parameters have been shown to be independently predictive of poor prognosis in a broad spectrum of patients with HF. Their evaluation may be integrated with the measurement of pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP). Of note, PASP is matched with TAPSE to obtain an index of right ventricular–pulmonary artery (RV‐PA) pressure coupling that has shown good correlation with direct RV invasive measurements by pressure volume curves. The prognostic value of noninvasively assessed RV‐PA coupling in patients with HF has also been confirmed in several studies, almost all conducted in patients with chronic HF in stable hemodynamic conditions and in an ambulatory setting.

However, RV‐PA coupling is still a crucial factor in the context of acute heart failure (AHF), in which the RV often fails to cope with the sudden rise in pulmonary artery (PA) pressure, leading to uncoupling and subsequent RV failure. This failure is partly due to the intrinsic properties of the RV myocardium and partly due to the changes in PA stiffness and pressure. A further item is tricuspid regurgitation severity: Its degree may depend on RV morphology, maladaptation, and RV contractile condition. Additionally, tricuspid regurgitation could significantly change according to different pulmonary pressure loads, pulmonary congestion, and treatment response. Currently, studies evaluating the prognostic role of RV‐PA coupling in the setting of AHF are scarce. Recent data by our group seem to suggest that, although both TAPSE/PASP and S′/PASP by tissue Doppler echocardiography may have an independent predictive role in this setting, parameters derived by more advanced echocardiographic techniques could be more sensitive in patients with preserved ejection fraction than in those with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). However all these measurements are pre‐ and postload dependent, whereas the strain analysis reflects much more the intrinsic RV myocardial forces.

### Can echocardiographic evaluation of cardiopulmonary hemodynamics decrease right heart catheterizations in end-stage heart failure patients awaiting transplantation? [^117TBvhw]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Candidacy for heart transplantation is influenced by the severity of pulmonary hypertension. In this study, invasive hemodynamics from right-sided cardiac catheterization were compared with values obtained by validated equations from Doppler 2-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography. This prospective study was conducted in 40 patients with end-stage heart failure evaluated for heart transplantation or ventricular assist device implantation. Transthoracic echocardiography and right-sided cardiac catheterization were performed within 4 hours. From continuous-wave Doppler of the tricuspid regurgitation jet, pulmonary artery systolic pressure was calculated as the peak gradient across the tricuspid valve plus right atrial pressure estimated from inferior vena cava filling. Mean pulmonary artery pressure was calculated as (0.61 × pulmonary artery systolic pressure) + 2. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was calculated as (tricuspid regurgitation velocity/right ventricular outflow tract time-velocity integral × 10) + 0.16. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was calculated as 1.91 + (1.24 × E/E'). Pearson's correlation and Bland-Altman analysis of mean differences between echocardiographic and right-sided cardiac catheterization measurements were statistically significant for all hemodynamic parameters (pulmonary artery systolic pressure: r = 0.82, p < 0.05, mean difference 3.1 mm Hg, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.2 to 6.3; mean pulmonary artery pressure: r = 0.80, p < 0.05, mean difference 2.5 mm Hg, 95% CI 0.3 to 4.6; PVR: r = 0.52, p < 0.05, mean difference 0.8 Wood units, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.4; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure: r = 0.65, p < 0.05, mean difference 2.2 mm Hg, 95% CI 0.1 to 4.3). Compared with right-sided cardiac catheterization, PVR by Doppler echocardiography identified all patients with PVR > 4 Wood units (n = 4), 73% of patients with PVR < 2 Wood units (n = 8), and 52% of patients with PVR from 2 to 4 Wood units (n = 10). In conclusion, echocardiographic estimation of cardiopulmonary hemodynamics is reliable in patients with end-stage cardiomyopathy. The noninvasive assessment of hemodynamics by echocardiography may be able to decrease the number of serial right-sided cardiac catheterizations in selected patients awaiting heart transplantation. However, in patients with borderline PVR, right-sided cardiac catheterization is indicated to assess eligibility for transplantation.

### New echocardiographic algorithm for estimating right atrial pressure in severe tricuspid regurgitation: insights from simultaneous cardiac catheterization [^112xGgyX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This prospective study demonstrated a strong correlation between echocardiographic and invasive RHC measurements for estimating PASP in patients with severe TR. Our findings indicate that echocardiography, particularly when incorporating refined criteria such as IVC collapsibility, hepatic vein systolic flow reversal, and the V‐wave cutoff sign, significantly improves the accuracy of RAP estimation. These refined echocardiographic criteria enhance the overall reliability of PASP assessment, offering a robust noninvasive approach for hemodynamic evaluation in this challenging patient population. This method holds promise for guiding clinical management and improving risk stratification in patients with severe TR.

### Prognostic implication of right ventricular free wall longitudinal strain and right atrial pressure estimated by echocardiography in patients with severe functional tricuspid regurgitation [^114jA892]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Usefulness of the Classification Based on Elevatedand

Multiple echocardiographic RV functional parameters have been combined to assess their prognostic value. For example, RVFWLS as an RV functional parameter was reportedly combined with clinical and imaging risk factors to enhance prognostic ability for all‐cause mortality in patients with FTR. On the other hand, there have been conflicting reports on the clinical utility of RV function and PHT as RV–pulmonary arterial coupling surrogates in patients with severe TR. The estimated PASP by echocardiography can be underestimated compared with invasive PASP because of early equalization of RV and RA pressures. In the study by Lurz et al, with 28% of the study subjects having massive or torrential TR, the echocardiographic diagnostic accuracy for detecting PHT diagnosed by RHC was only 55%. The use of estimated PASP as a prognostic predictor in patients with severe TR has limitations.

The usefulness of estimated RAP by echocardiography in predicting outcomes has been reported in various clinical settings. Conversely, Lemarchand et al demonstrated a moderate correlation between estimated RAP by echocardiography and invasive RAP in patients with severe TR. It is suggested that estimated RAP by current guidelines may be inadequate for evaluating RAP exceeding 15 mm Hg in this population. Although RHC is the gold standard for measuring RAP, the assessment of IVC is used to estimate RAP noninvasively.RAP may be a useful and simpler parameter instead of estimated PASP in the risk stratification and management of patients with severe FTR.

In our study, elevated RAP was an independent predictor of all‐cause death, and the combination of elevated RAP and RVFWLS of ≤ 18% among 4 groups showed the worst outcome by Kaplan‐Meier curves for event‐free survival. Elevated RAP leads to increasing venous congestion, resulting in renal, hepatic, and intestinal dysfunction. Especially in patients with RV dysfunction, the presence of high RAP could be more likely to exacerbate venous congestion and accelerate the progression of right heart failure compared with that of normal RAP.

This finding provides additional evidence for the importance of evaluating RVFWLS and RAP in patients with severe FTR. Further studies may be necessary to investigate the efficacy of RVFWLS and RAP in identifying patients with severe FTR who may benefit from tricuspid valve intervention before irreversible RV dysfunction and end‐organ damage occurs.

### Accuracy of echocardiographic estimations of right heart pressures in adult heart transplant recipients [^111j8Eyo]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Accurate PASP estimation was not feasible in 16 patients due to lack of sufficient TR jet. Mean PASP was 33 ± 8 mmHg (range: 15–63 mmHg) by RHC. There was a modest correlation between echocardiographic estimation of PASP and invasive PASP (r = .39, p = .002; Figure 2A). Bland‐Altman analysis showed a mean bias of 2.1 ± 9 mmHg (limits of agreement = −15 to 20 mmHg; Figure 2B). There was also a modest but significant correlation between TR gradient measured by Doppler echocardiography and invasive PASP (r = .4223, p = .0003, Figure 2C).

### Noninvasive estimation of both systolic and diastolic pulmonary artery pressure from Doppler analysis of tricuspid regurgitant velocity spectrum in patients with chronic heart failure [^114cR4qS]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Noninvasive estimation of pulmonary artery systolic and diastolic pressures usually requires the investigation of both tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitant jets and an estimate of right atrial pressure. A new, noninvasive method to obtain pulmonary diastolic pressure (based on the hemodynamic demonstration that right ventricular systolic pressure and pulmonary artery diastolic pressure are equal at the time of pulmonary valve opening) from the analysis of tricuspid regurgitation alone has been described in a small cohort of patients. We sought to verify the accuracy of this method in a large population of patients with heart failure.

Methods

An estimate of pulmonary artery diastolic pressure was obtained by transposing the pulmonary opening time (from the onset of the R wave on the electrocardiographic tracing to the beginning of pulmonic forward flow on Doppler examination) onto the tricuspid regurgitant velocity curve and calculating the pulmonary artery diastolic pressure value as the pressure gradient between the right ventricle and right atrium at this time. The study group included 86 consecutive patients (64 men, aged 52 ± 11 years) with heart failure (New York Heart Association class ≥ II, 94%) who were in stable clinical condition with a chiefly idiopathic (57%), ischemic (24%), or other form (13%) of dilated cardiomyopathy. Noninvasive, right-sided pressures were compared with invasive measurements obtained during right heart catheterization performed within 24 hours. The Bland and Altman graphic method was used together with the calculation of the Lin concordance correlation coefficient and its 95% CI to assess the agreement between hemodynamic and echocardiographic measurements.

Results

Catheter-derived pulmonary artery systolic pressure ranged from 8 to 119 mm Hg (mean 42 ± 21 mm Hg), pulmonary artery diastolic pressure from 1 to 59 mm Hg (mean 20 ± 11 mm Hg), and right atrial pressure from -5 to 20 mm Hg (mean 6 ± 5 mm Hg). Tricuspid regurgitation was detected in 75 of 86 patients (87%). Pulmonary artery systolic pressure ranged from 13 to 110 mm Hg (mean 44 ± 21 mm Hg); the pressure gradient between the right ventricle and right atrium at time t of the pulmonary valve opening on the tricuspid regurgitation velocity curve was measurable in 70 of 75 (93%) cases and ranged from 3.5 to 64 mm Hg (mean 22 ± 11 mm Hg). Good agreement was observed not only for pulmonary artery systolic pressure but also for pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, based on the analysis of the tricuspid regurgitation velocity jet, with a slight difference between measurements (-1.8 and 0.1, respectively), no evident pattern of point scattering, and a high concordance correlation coefficient that was elicited by the virtually total overlapping of lines on the graph. Overall results were not significantly different whether patients with depressed right ventricular function (right ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35%), with a tricuspid regurgitation grade ≥ 2 and atrial fibrillation were included in the analysis.

Conclusions

The narrow paired difference for the estimate of pulmonary artery systolic pressure and the even better difference for pulmonary artery diastolic pressure using the tricuspid regurgitation velocity curve analysis indicates that this new method reliably estimates invasive right-sided pressures over a wide range of pressure values in patients with heart failure. The overall good correlation with invasive values indicates that Doppler examination of tricuspid regurgitation alone may provide a simple and comprehensive new method for the noninvasive evaluation of right ventricular and pulmonary hemodynamics in patients with heart failure.

### Echocardiographic estimation of mean pulmonary artery pressure: a comparison of different approaches to assign the likelihood of pulmonary hypertension [^111f1CSs]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines advise using echocardiography for noninvasive estimation of the likelihood that a patient has pulmonary hypertension (PH). To estimate the echocardiographic probability of PH, the maximal tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TR Vmax) is recommended as the main parameter to use over more complex algorithms that provide an estimation of pulmonary artery pressure. This preference is based on concerns about inaccuracies and amplification of measurement errors that can occur from using derived variables. However, this has not been examined systematically.

Methods

A retrospective database analysis was performed of invasively determined measurements of right heart pressure in 90 patients, corresponding echocardiographic estimations of pulmonary artery pressure, and additional parameters obtained within 24 hours. Several algorithms were compared for their correlations and accuracy parameters.

Results

Although a Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated that all examined algorithms exhibited inaccuracies that could be clinically relevant in individuals, algorithms estimating mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAPm) on the basis of tricuspid regurgitation generally exhibited stronger correlations with invasively determined PAPm and more accurate identification of PH than did TR Vmax. Echocardiographic estimation of right atrial pressure > 15 mm Hg exhibited the highest odds ratio for invasively confirmed PH, suggesting that this parameter is of additional diagnostic value. Indeed, algorithms that also considered right atrial pressure performed best, whereas empirical algorithms, TR Vmax, and methods relying on pulmonary acceleration time exhibited weaker performance.

Conclusions

Although all methods are associated with inaccuracies, echocardiographically determined PAPm was superior to the current guideline recommendation of using TR Vmax with regard to its correlation with invasively determined PAPm and the presence of PH. PAPm may be considered as an alternative to TR Vmax for evaluating the echocardiographic probability of PH.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of Cardiovascular imaging [^114n9b7V]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2016). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular diastolic function — hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) example: In a patient with HCM, mitral inflow shows an E/A ratio > 1, septal and lateral tissue Doppler early (e′) and late (a′) velocities are markedly reduced consistent with severely impaired LV relaxation, and the average E/e′ ratio is > 14, consistent with elevated mean left atrial pressure (LAP); peak tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity is 3.42 m/ sec with a peak right ventricular–to–right atrial systolic pressure gradient of 47 mm Hg, thus pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) is ≥ 47 mm Hg; if only the mitral A wave is present, only TR velocity can be used as a possible indicator of LV filling pressures.

### Utility of pulmonary artery acceleration time to estimate systolic pulmonary artery pressure in neonates and young infants [^117RXJsP]. Pediatric Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is commonly used to screen for pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) in neonates and young infants. However, in the absence of sufficient tricuspid regurgitation (TR), a ventricular septal defect (VSD), or a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), the estimation of systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) becomes challenging. Pulmonary artery acceleration time (PAAT) is an alternate parameter that is easy to obtain in almost all patients and does not require the presence of tricuspid valvar regurgitation or an anatomical cardiac defect. We sought to examine the correlation of PAAT with estimated SPAP by TTE and create an equation to estimate the SPAP using PAAT. We performed a retrospective review of TTEs performed on neonates and young infants (4 months of age or younger) at our institution between April 2017 and December 2018, along with the corresponding medical records. We included TTEs that provided estimation for SPAP and at least one PAAT measurement. During the study period, 138 TTEs performed on 82 patients met the inclusion criteria. Strong correlation was delineated between PAAT and SPAP estimated by the maximum velocity of tricuspid valve regurgitation Doppler, correlation coefficient (r) = - 0.83. Moderate correlation was detected between PAAT and SPAP estimated by PDA Doppler, r = -0.66. Utilizing the following equation "SPAP = 82.6–0.58×PAAT+RA mean pressure", PAAT can be used to estimate SPAP in neonates and young infants. PAAT can be used as an alternative to TR jet to assess SPAP when the latter is absent or insufficient. Further studies are needed to verify the accuracy of this equation.

Sensitivity, Specificity, and Diagnostic Accuracy of Noninvasive Assessment of Pulmonary Hypertension by Doppler Echocardiography at Various Cut‐Off Levels

Systolic PAP overestimation and underestimation leading to significant overdiagnosis or underdiagnosis of pulmonary hypertension are listed in Table 5. An incomplete CW Doppler spectral envelope was the predominant cause for underestimation, whereas overestimation was due to different causes. In one third of the cases, overestimation was due to false interpretation of the spectral envelope maximal velocity boundary in the presence of vertical linear Doppler artifacts ("fringes"), followed by incomplete spectral‐wave envelope and too‐soft signal due to low spectral Doppler gain setting. Severe tricuspid regurgitation by echocardiographic definition was present in n = 79 of all patients (5%) and a sPAP was documented in the echo report in spite of the restrictions of the measurement in this setting. However, severe tricuspid regurgitation accounted for only 11 cases (7%) of underestimation and missed diagnosis of PH. Misinterpretation of the diameter and respiration dynamics of the inferior vena cava was also involved in both underestimation and overestimation, but in a lesser manner.

### Association between functional tricuspid regurgitation and mortality following cardiac surgery [^114MDnKE]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In our representative sample of adult patients undergoing various types of cardiac surgery, the echocardiographic finding of moderate TR heralded a clinically important increase in risk of postoperative mortality and major morbidity. The increase in risk was magnified when moderate TR was accompanied by a normal PASP and to a lesser extent by a dysfunctional RV. Whereas previous studies focused on the implications of TR in mitral or aortic valve disease, our results indicate that the implications may be as significant if not more in other types of procedures such as aortic surgery. Clinical trials are needed to determine whether concomitant tricuspid valve repair should be advocated in cases when TR is moderate and PASP is normal.

PERSPECTIVES

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Functional tricuspid regurgitation is associated with a heightened risk of mortality and major morbidity after cardiac surgery.

COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE: Concomitant repair of functional tricuspid regurgitation should be considered when it is severe or progressive, the latter being more likely when pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal or right ventricular function is impaired.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: The mechanistic reasons for tricuspid regurgitation progression and adverse clinical outcomes require further investigation. Serial examinations of tricuspid valve mobility and competency should be related to atrioventricular remodeling and pulmonary arterial hemodynamics.

Tricuspid regurgitation peak velocity

Systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) can be estimated by measuring the peak velocity of tricuspid valve regurgitation with the use of the modified Bernoulli's equation; see Eqs. 2 and 3:

RAP is usually not measured, and a value of 3–5 mmHg is generally assumed. The estimation of SPAP by measuring TR is reliable and often equivalent to pressures measured in the catheter lab while using continuous wave Doppler (Fig. 1). However, the accuracy depends on the quality of the acquired TR jet. An optimal quality TR jet shows a well demarcated envelope. Measuring an inadequate Doppler spectral envelope will potentially lead to an underestimation of SPAP. The angle of insonation should be less than 20° to achieve a reliable measurement. This is aided by assessing maximal TR jet velocity by imaging from three views (apical 4 chamber, short axis, and modified parasternal long axis). However, this estimation of SPAP is not reliable in the presence of right ventricular failure or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Tricuspid valve regurgitation cannot always be observed and is present in approximately 60–85% of patients with PPHN. –

Fig. 1
Estimation of SPAP from tricuspid regurgitation jet. The peak velocity of the tricuspid regurgitation jet is 5.12 m/s, which corresponds to a maximum pressure gradient of 105 mmHg according to the modified Bernoulli equation (see left upper panel). On the right, the concomitant systemic arterial blood pressure is displayed, indicating suprasystemic pulmonary pressure

Pulmonary regurgitation peak velocity

I n the presence of pulmonary valve regurgitation, mean PAP (MPAP) can be estimated by measuring its peak velocity using Eq. 4:

The RVdP is generally assumed to be around 2–5 mmHg.

Transductal right-to-left blood flow peak velocity

Transductal right-to-left blood flow can be used to estimate SPAP, when it lasts ≥ 30% of the heart cycle, by measuring its peak velocity using Eq. 5:

A ductal right-to-left or bidirectional shunt is observed in 73–91% of the patients with PPHN. However, measurement of PAP via ductal flow is often not reliable. Assessment of the direction of transductal blood flow is more useful and will indicate the relation between pulmonary and systemic pressures.

### Intra-operative assessment of pulmonary artery pressure by transoesophageal echocardiography [^116327o1]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

The clinical value of the estimation of systolic pulmonary artery pressure, based on Doppler assessment of peak tricuspid regurgitant velocity using transoesophageal echocardiography, is unclear. We studied 109 patients to evaluate the feasibility of obtaining adequate Doppler recordings, and compared Doppler estimates with values measured using a pulmonary artery catheter in a subset of 33 patients. Tricuspid regurgitation was evaluated at the mid-oesophageal level at 0–120° using Doppler echocardiography. A Doppler signal was defined as adequate if there was a ≤ 20° alignment and a full envelope. Doppler estimates of systolic pulmonary artery pressure within 10 mmHg and 15% of the value recorded with the pulmonary artery catheter were considered to be in sufficient agreement. Adequate Doppler signals were obtained in 64/109 (59%) patients before and 54/103 (52%) after surgery. Doppler estimates by transoesophageal echocardiography were within 10 mmHg and 15% of values recorded with the pulmonary artery catheter in 28/33 (75%) patients and 22/31 (55%) patients, respectively. In 7 (21%) patients, the echocardiographic Doppler measurement exceeded the measured systolic pulmonary artery pressure by more than 30%. Our study indicates that estimation of the systolic pulmonary artery pressure using transoesophageal Doppler echocardiography is not a reliable and clinically useful method in anaesthetised patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.

### Echocardiographic assessment of pulmonary artery systolic pressure and outcomes in ambulatory heart failure patients [^114a4bWh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Echocardiography

Transthoracic echocardiograms performed as part of outpatient care were assessed; studies performed during hospitalizations or for acute indications were not considered. For the purposes of this study, all echocardiograms were reanalyzed independently of clinical reports by an experienced echocardiographer blinded to clinical data. Measurements were performed according to the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) standards. All patients had dedicated 2‐dimensional and color Doppler imaging to exclude right ventricular outflow tract obstruction or pulmonary stenosis. PASP was estimated from the tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity using the modified Bernoulli equation and adding the estimated right atrial pressure (RAP) on the basis of inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter and collapsibility. We assigned RAP using a classification scheme that has been validated in an advanced HF cohort: IVC ≤ 2 cm and > 50% collapsibility, 5 mm Hg; IVC > 2 cm and ≥ 50% collapsibility, 10 mm Hg; IVC > 2 cm and < 50% collapsibility, 15 mm Hg; and IVC > 2 cm and no collapsibility, 20 mm Hg. We assumed RAP 10 mm Hg for cases with IVC ≤ 2 cm and ≤ 50% collapsibility. Chamber quantification and right ventricular systolic function measurements, including right ventricular fractional area change (RVFAC) and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), were performed as recommended by ASE. – Mitral and tricuspid regurgitation were graded semiquantitatively into none/trace, mild, mild‐to‐moderate, moderate‐to‐severe, and severe.

Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) — TAPSE is obtained from the right ventricular (RV)–focused view by placing the M‑mode cursor along the lateral tricuspid valve annulus and is a core component of RV systolic function assessment; the normal value for M‑mode‑derived TAPSE is > 1.70 cm, and measurements should be reported considering quality, other parameters, and clinical context, because TAPSE should not be used in isolation; the TAPSE/PASP ratio is a noninvasive index of RV‑pulmonary artery coupling, and a TAPSE/PASP ratio ranging between 0.3–0.4 mm / mm Hg is associated with RV‑PA uncoupling and increased mortality risk.

### Epiphenomenon or prognostically relevant interventional target? A novel proportionality framework for severe tricuspid regurgitation [^117AioJ1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) frequently develops in patients with long-standing pulmonary hypertension, and both pathologies are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to improve prognostic assessment in patients with severe TR undergoing transcatheter tricuspid valve intervention (TTVI) by relating the extent of TR to pulmonary artery pressures. Methods and Results In this multicenter study, we included 533 patients undergoing TTVI for moderate-to-severe or severe TR. The proportionality framework was based on the ratio of tricuspid valve effective regurgitant orifice area to mean pulmonary artery pressure. An optimal threshold for tricuspid valve effective regurgitant orifice area/mean pulmonary artery pressure ratio was derived on 353 patients with regard to 2-year all-cause mortality and externally validated on 180 patients. Patients with a tricuspid valve effective regurgitant orifice area/mean pulmonary artery pressure ratio ≤ 1.25mm²/mmHg (defining proportionate TR) featured significantly lower 2-year survival rates after TTVI than patients with disproportionate TR (56.6% versus 69.6%; P = 0.005). In contrast with patients with disproportionate TR (n = 398), patients with proportionate TR (n = 135) showed more pronounced mPAP levels (37.9 ± 9.06mmHg versus 27.9 ± 8.17mmHg; P < 2.2×10⁻¹⁶) and more severely impaired right ventricular function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion: 16.0 ± 4.11 versus 17.0 ± 4.64mm; P = 0.012). Moreover, tricuspid valve effective regurgitant orifice area was smaller in patients with proportionate TR when compared with disproportionate TR (0.350 ± 0.105cm² versus 0.770 ± 0.432cm²; P < 2.2×10⁻¹⁶). Importantly, proportionate TR remained a significant predictor for 2-year mortality after adjusting for demographic and clinical variables (hazard ratio, 1.7; P = 0.006). Conclusions The proposed proportionality framework promises to improve future risk stratification and clinical decision-making by identifying patients who benefit the most from TTVI (disproportionate TR). As a next step, randomized controlled studies with a conservative treatment arm are needed to quantify the net benefit of TTVI in patients with proportionate TR.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography and for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction diagnosis: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^113fGrge]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Echocardiography diastolic assessment — tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity can estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) when there is no pulmonic stenosis (PS) or right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction (right ventricular systolic pressure [RVSP] = PASP); there is a significant correlation between PASP and noninvasively derived left atrial pressure (LAP) in group II pulmonary hypertension (PH), and in the absence of pulmonary disease increased PASP suggests elevated LAP; advantages are that PASP is passively elevated when LAP is increased due to left heart PH (so an elevated PASP infers an elevated LAP) and increased PASP indicates PH with prognostic implications; limitations are that it is an indirect estimate of LAP, full envelope recording may be limited though intravenous agitated saline or UEAs increases yield, accuracy depends on reliable right atrial pressure (RAP) estimation, with very severe TR and a low systolic RV‑RA gradient PASP cannot be accurately estimated, and RVSP does not equal PASP with PS or RVOT obstruction.

Comparison of PASP between catheterization and echocardiographic estimation (A) and their correlation (B) using new criteria.

By adopting the new eRAP values and recalculated PASP echo_new, the bias between PASP echo_new and PASP cath across all patients was +1.6 mm Hg, with 95% LOA ranging from −9.8 mm Hg to +12.9 mm Hg. There was a strong correlation (r = 0.90) between echocardiography and RHC for PASP, representing a significant improvement (P = 0.008) compared with the conventional echocardiographic measurements. eRAP indicates estimated right atrial pressure; LOA, limits of agreement; PASP pulmonary artery systolic pressure; and RHC, right heart catheterization.

Comparison of MeanBetween theand Simultaneous Echocardiography

The mean PAP was calculated using the time–velocity integral method, incorporating our newly proposed criteria for estimating RAP. The bias between mean PAP derived from simultaneous echocardiography and catheterization was −1.34 mm Hg, with 95% LOA ranging from −12.55 to 9.88 mm Hg, and a good correlation between the 2 methods (r = 0.75).

### Functional tricuspid regurgitation in patients with pulmonary hypertension: is pulmonary artery pressure the only determinant of regurgitation severity? [^115DLAQD]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary hypertension is a common cause of functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR), but other factors play a role in determining TR severity. The objectives of our study were to determine the distribution of TR severity in relation to pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) and to define the determinants of TR severity.

Methods

The echocardiographic reports and selected echocardiographic studies of patients with echocardiographic estimation of PASP were reviewed. Patients with organic tricuspid valve (TV) disease were excluded from the analysis.

Results

Among 2,139 patients, the frequency of moderate or severe TR was progressively greater in patients with higher PASP. Nevertheless, TR was only mild in a substantial proportion of patients with high PASP (mild TR in 65.4% of patients with PASP 50–69 mm Hg and in 45.6% of patients with PASP ≥ 70 mm Hg). By multivariate analysis, age, female gender, PASP (odds ratio, 2.26 per 10-mm Hg increase; 95% confidence interval, 1.95 to 2.61), pacemaker lead, right atrial (RA) and right ventricular enlargement, left atrial enlargement, and organic mitral valve disease were independently associated with greater degrees of TR. In patients with PASP ≥ 70 mm Hg, RA size, tricuspid annular diameter, and TV tethering area were greater in patients with greater degrees of TR.

Conclusions

PASP is a strong determinant of TR severity, but many patients with pulmonary hypertension do not exhibit significant TR. In addition to PASP, demographic characteristics, mechanical factors, remodeling of the right heart cavities, and other factors (possibly reflecting the presence of atrial fibrillation or occult organic TV disease) are predictive of TR severity.

### Pulmonary artery pressure in young healthy subjects [^1171DC5J]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) is frequently measured noninvasively using transthoracic echocardiography. Normal values of PASP are based on studies performed in heterogeneous populations. The normal values of PASP in young healthy subjects are poorly defined. The aim of this study was to describe the distribution and clinical and morphologic correlates of PASP values in young healthy subjects.

Methods

Echocardiography is routinely performed for aircrew candidates for the Israeli Air Force. All echocardiographic examinations performed between 1994 and 2010 in which tricuspid regurgitation was present, a prerequisite for echocardiographic PASP measurement, were collected. Subjects with morphologic abnormalities were excluded. PASP was calculated using the simplified Bernoulli equation, with right atrial pressure assumed to be 5 mm Hg. The associations between PASP and clinical and echocardiographic characteristics were studied.

Results

Subjects were healthy young adults aged 17 to 29 years. Evidence of tricuspid regurgitation was found in 1,900 of 6,598 subjects. The estimated mean PASP value was 31.2 ± 4.5 mm Hg, and the upper 95th percentile was 34 mm Hg. In univariate analysis, PASP was correlated with left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters. A multivariate linear regression model including age; diastolic blood pressure; echocardiographic measurements of aortic root, left atrial, and left ventricular end-diastolic diameters; and left ventricular mass explained only 7% of the variability in PASP.

Conclusions

PASP in young, physically fit subjects may be higher than previously reported in the general population and is poorly explained by age, blood pressure, and other echocardiographic parameters.

### Echocardiographic assessment of pulmonary artery systolic pressure and outcomes in ambulatory heart failure patients [^114N168m]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Our study has several limitations. First, echocardiograms were not performed specifically for the purposes of this study. As a result, tissue Doppler‐based measures of right ventricular function, including tricuspid annular systolic velocity and myocardial performance index, were not consistently available in our study. However, acquisition follows a standardized protocol in our institution. Also, we read the echocardiograms independently for the purposes of the current study to reduce interpretation bias. Second, the number of major clinical events was relatively small and did not allow us to reliably evaluate the effect of PASP on outcomes in patients with preserved LVEF. Also, our multivariable models included a large number of covariates relative to events, leading to wide confidence intervals. However, our estimates were stable in the various model iterations. Third, PASP in patients with HF has a dynamic component dependent on volume status. To reduce variability related to this component, we only considered data derived from patients in stable condition without recent hospitalizations or changes in medical treatment. Fourth, severely reduced right ventricular systolic function may lead to underestimation of PASP. However, we observed an approximately linear association of PASP with adverse events in our study. Taken together with the nature of our study population, which included only stable, ambulatory patients on medical treatment, contamination by falsely low PASP is probably minimal in this study. Fifth, the PASP cut‐off points that optimized prediction in our study were not validated externally. Finally, our patients are cared for in a referral HF clinic, and thus there is potential for selection bias. However, there is no reason to believe that similar degrees of PASP elevation confer lower risk in a community‐based sample. In a tertile‐based analysis in our data (not shown), the risk for all‐cause mortality in the upper versus the lower tertile of PASP was similar to that reported in a community‐based study.

In conclusion, our data suggest that echocardiography is a feasible and practical noninvasive alternative to identify stable patients with HF and elevated PASP. Importantly, these patients are at substantially increased risk for adverse events. Therefore, echocardiographically determined PASP can be used to select patients for clinical trials with novel agents targeting pathophysiological pathways of secondary PH in HF. Further studies are needed to assess the role of serial changes in PASP over time using echocardiography.

### Impact of tricuspid regurgitation on postoperative outcomes after non-cardiac surgeries [^116i9VMd]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Impact of PASP and ventricular function

In a subgroup of 4289 patients with TR jet velocity, patients with moderate/severe TR and elevated PASP had higher mortality compared with patients with ≤ mild TR and normal PASP (p < 0.001). In addition, patients with moderate/severe TR and normal PASP also had higher mortality compared with patients with ≤ mild TR and normal PASP (p < 0.009) (figure 3A). On multivariate analysis, the factors associated with an increased 30-day mortality were elevated PASP (OR 1.88; 95% CI 1.12 to 3.16; p = 0.017) and RV dysfunction (OR 4.47; 95% CI 1.74 to 11.48; p = 0.002), see online supplementary table 3.

In patients with 30-day mortality, RV dysfunction was more common compared with patients without 30-day mortality (38.9% vs 10.4%, p < 0.001). Similarly, a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was more common in patients with 30-day mortality when compared with patients without 30-day mortality (38.9% vs 17.4%, p = 0.02) (table 2).

The median follow-up time was 49.9 months (IQR 19.5–91.6). Long-term mortality was higher in patients with severe TR (HR 1.87; 95% CI 1.40 to 2.50) and moderate TR (HR 1.55; 95% CI 1.31 to 1.82) when compared with no/trivial TR on multivariate analysis (table 3).

Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) — diagnosis centers on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), which is indicated to evaluate presence and severity, determine etiology, measure right-sided chamber and inferior vena cava sizes, assess right ventricular (RV) systolic function, estimate pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and characterize associated left-sided heart disease.

Data collection

Baseline demographic, clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic variables as well as medications were collected at the time of the diagnosis of severe STR. All echocardiographic images were recorded on digital media storage at each institution and were prospectively re‐analysed by local expert echocardiographers, blinded to patient's clinical data and outcome. Cardiac chamber quantification and evaluation of systolic and diastolic function were performed according to the most recent international guidelines of the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) and the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI). All RV measurements were performed on a RV‐focused four‐chamber apical view. RV end‐diastolic mid diameter (RV EDD) and indexed end‐diastolic areas (RV EDAi) were used to identify RV dilatation. RV fractional area change (RV FAC) was derived from RV end‐systolic area and RV EDA. Additionally, RV myocardial deformation analysis was performed using Autostrain RV (TOMTEC‐ARENA 2020, TomTec Imaging System GmbH, Unterschleissheim, Germany); the RV free wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS) was calculated by averaging the strain values of the three free wall segments, as recommended by the joint EACVI/ASE consensus document. Right atrial (RA) size was measured at end‐systole on an apical four‐chamber view, RA volume was calculated using the single‐plane disk summation method and indexed for body surface area. Moreover, integrative assessment of TR severity was performed through a multi‐parametric approach including qualitative, semi‐quantitative, and quantitative parameters and were graded into severe, massive, and torrential according to recent classification (Tricuspid Valve Academic Research Consortium).

Pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) was estimated from the TR jet peak velocity applying the Bernoulli equation and adding RA pressure. RA pressure was estimated based on the inferior vena cava diameter and its collapsibility during breathing.

### Mild pulmonary hypertension is associated with increased mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116X984w]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Data from this study address controversy on the mPAP level required to capture clinical risk in patients referred for RHC or echocardiography using a meta‐analysis, which is the optimal research tool for determining aggregate risk across study populations. 26 We report that mildly elevated PA pressures, estimated by either echocardiography or invasive catheterization, are associated with 19% increased risk of mortality over 5 years. Despite analyzing both community‐based and referral populations with varying underlying comorbidities, there was only mild statistical heterogeneity of risk across the included studies. This suggests a truly generalizable association between mild PH and mortality. These data support the ongoing efforts to identify optimal cutoffs for hemodynamic parameters in PH, including pulmonary arterial hypertension, to identify at‐risk populations earlier. 27

A notable finding of this study is the consistent association between mild PH and increased mortality when PA pressure was measured by either RHC or echocardiography. Although RHC is the only test available to diagnose PH, echocardiography is the preferred screening test for at‐risk patients. 6 Current guidelines recommend further evaluation of patients for PH if the tricuspid regurgitation velocity is > 2.9 m/s (corresponding to PASP > ≈40 mm Hg). 6 However, our findings demonstrate that PA pressure assessed by echocardiography, at levels considered currently to be below the range of clinical significance (tricuspid regurgitation velocity ≈ > 2.5 m/s, PASP > 35 mm Hg) across both community‐based and referral populations, is, in fact, a valid predictor of mortality. Thus, our data suggest that when PA pressure can be measured by echocardiography, this is an effective screening tool for detecting patients at risk for mild PH who may benefit from further evaluation, close follow‐up, and risk reduction interventions. 17, 20 Nonetheless, a recent study in patients with PH (mPAP > 25 mm Hg) demonstrated modest correlation and poor agreement between echocardiography‐derived and RHC‐measured PASP and mPAP. 28 Fisher et al 29 showed that approximately half of the cases of PASP overestimation are related solely to right atrial pressure overestimation by echocardiography. Thus, although we used an assumed right atrial pressure of 5 mm Hg for calculating PASP in echocardiography studies that reported only tricuspid regurgitation velocity or gradient, concern for misclassification remains when relying on echocardiography alone for the diagnosis of PH (or mild PH). Furthermore, the effect sizes of mild PH, as estimated by RHC and echocardiography on mortality, although different, are not directly comparable to suggest different clinical recommendations for patients with mild PH diagnosed via these 2 modalities.

Table 1.
Echocardiographic Evaluation in Patients With Pulmonary Hypertension Resulting From Severe Mitral Regurgitation

When TRV measurement appears unreliable, the modified Bernoulli's equation can be applied using the pulmonary regurgitant velocity (PRV) in early diastole and end diastole to calculate mean PAP and pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, respectively. However, PRV measurement often itself may be unreliable when a parallel Doppler intercept angle cannot be achieved. Other echocardiographic indices, such as RV outflow tract (RVOT) acceleration time and noninvasively estimated PVR may also be used to screen for pulmonary hypertension, but studies show variable degrees of correlation with invasively measured parameters.

Assessment of RV structure and function is an important part of the echocardiographic evaluation of patients with pulmonary hypertension resulting from MR because of its added prognostic significance. Tissue Doppler measurement of the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) provides a quantitative index of RV systolic function and has been shown to be predictive of perioperative and long‐term mortality risk. The presence of significant tricuspid regurgitation (3+ or greater) and elevated indexed right atrial area are also associated with increased risk of perioperative mortality.RV eccentricity index, a quantitative measure of RV remodeling, has been shown to predict long‐term mortality in patients with PAH, but its value in patients with MR has not been studied.

Exercise echocardiography can also provide valuable information in the evaluation of patients with MR. Because of the adverse effect of resting pulmonary hypertension and manifest left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) on operative mortality, there is increased emphasis on early detection of patients at risk of developing these sequelae of chronic MR. Exercise‐induced increase in PASP and MR has been shown to be associated with occult LVDand reduced symptom‐free survival. Other indices of LVF during exercise, such as end‐systolic volume (ESV) and contractile reserve (exercise‐induced increase in EF or longitudinal strain) appear to predict postoperative ventricular function more accurately than resting indices. – Thus, in addition to providing an objective assessment of functional capacity, exercise echocardiography may help identify asymptomatic patients with severe MR and apparently normal resting LVF in the transitional phase who would benefit from immediate referral to mitral valve surgery.

Assessment of pulmonary vascular pathophysiology

An assessment of PA pressures is essential for understanding TR pathophysiology. Precapillary pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with severe TR has also been associated with worse outcomes following T-TEER. Echocardiography estimates of PA systolic pressure correlate well with invasive measurement in patients with nonsevere TR, but may underestimate PA systolic pressure when there is rapid equilibration of RA and RV pressures, which may occur with severe TR with or without a noncompliant RA.

Recent PH guidelines recommend confirmation of PA pressures with invasive right heart catheterization. The routine assessment of invasive pulmonary vascular hemodynamics in patients with TR is even more important given the discordance that may occur in some patients with severe disease. A recent study showed that high PA pressures by invasive measurement with discordant low estimated pressures by echocardiography is associated with poor outcomes following T-TEER. Variables that should be obtained by right heart catheterization are listed in Supplemental Table 4. The pulmonary artery pulsatility index, defined as the ratio of PA pulse pressure to RA pressure, has emerged as a predictor of RV failure and worse survival in patients with moderate or greater TR without pulmonary hypertension.

Because of the sensitivity of the RV to afterload, an index of ventricular contractility to afterload may further characterize RV function compensation to specific loading conditions. RV-PA coupling describes a hemodynamic state where mechanical stroke work is most efficiently transferred to the pulmonary vasculature, whereas uncoupling suggests the RV can no longer maintain forward cardiac output. Multiple noninvasive measures of RV function have been coupled to estimates of PA pressure; however, TAPSE/systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) has been the most frequently studied. In contrast to TAPSEor sPAP alone, TAPSE/sPAP is associated with outcomes among patients undergoing transcatheter TV repair. Thus, despite the inaccuracies of sPAP measurements in some patients with TR, these studies suggest that TAPSE/sPAP by echocardiography may predict outcomes. The use of invasively measured sPAP in assessing RV-PA coupling may have additional predictive benefit. Another estimate of RV-PA coupling is RV stroke volume indexed to RV end-systolic volume, whether measured by computed tomographyor by 3-dimensional echocardiography. The latter method avoids the use of echocardiographic estimates of sPAP. Which measures and what cutoffs of RV function should be used to determine a patient's suitability for surgical or transcatheter therapy is unknown.

### 10 issues for the clinician in tricuspid regurgitation evaluation and management: 2025 ACC expert consensus decision pathway: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^111U7xBi]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Consequences of progressive tricuspid regurgitation and right ventricular dysfunction — The development of right-sided heart failure (HF) and progressive TR is associated with increased mortality, more HF hospitalizations, and reduced quality of life, and most patients with severe TR have left-sided heart disease. Over time, with TV annular dilatation and worsening TR, the right ventricle dilates further and ultimately fails, leading to increased RV diastolic pressure. In advanced, severe TR with RV failure, the interventricular septum shifts toward the left ventricle, leading to decreased LV cavity size and restricted LV filling, further increasing the already elevated LV diastolic and pulmonary artery pressures, likely exacerbating RV-PA uncoupling. The resulting elevated left atrial and right atrial pressures can lead to an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, irreversible RV failure, and death, and earlier medical and procedural management of TR is essential to avoid deleterious downstream effects, such as cardiorenal and cardiohepatic syndromes, which can exclude candidacy for advanced therapies.

### Echocardiographic progression of peak tricuspid regurgitant velocity among Medicare beneficiaries [^116cfZ13]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH), whether primary or secondary in nature, is an independent predictor of mortality. The presence of a resting mean pulmonary artery pressure even marginally above the upper limit of normal is a driver of hospitalizations and mortality across a wide variety of medical comorbidities. Consequently, screening for PH is essential for early diagnosis and management, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the modality of choice for screening. Echocardiographic assessment of the peak tricuspid regurgitant velocity (TRV) allows for calculation of a tricuspid regurgitant gradient utilizing the modified Bernoulli equation with a consequent estimation of the pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP).

While abnormal resting values of TRV are associated with increased all-cause mortality and higher rates of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, limited information is available on expected changes in TRV with serial echocardiography, the association between changes in TRV and baseline demographic and clinical factors, and the independent association of changes in TRV demonstrated via serial echocardiography on survival. Such information may be valuable for identifying individuals with rapid progression in PH and to elucidate potentially modifiable factors that contribute to rapid progression.

Consequently, we performed a retrospective, multidecade analysis of a large cohort of patients referred for TTE to: 1) describe rates of progression in TRV with serial echocardiography; 2) assess for any associations of demographic and clinical factors with TRV progression; and 3) evaluate for any independent association between TRV change and all-cause mortality.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography and for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction diagnosis: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^111qoCDY]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — algorithm for estimation of mean left atrial pressure (LAP) applies four primary parameters and branching rules. Primary parameters are: Mitral E velocity ≥ 100 cm/s; Septal E/e′ ratio ≥ 11; tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity ≥ 2.8 m/s or PASP > 35 mm Hg; and deceleration time (DT) ≤ 160 ms. Branches are labeled "None or 1 of above", "2 of above", and "3 or more of above", with terminal outcomes "Normal LAP", "Indeterminate", or "Elevated LAP". For the "2 of above" branch, adjunct findings are assessed — "LARS < 18%", "Pulm vein S/D ratio < 1", and "BMI > 30 kg/m²" — such that "2/3 or 3/3" yields "Elevated LAP", whereas "1 only or not available or not reliable" yields "Indeterminate".

### Accuracy of echocardiography to estimate pulmonary artery pressures with exercise: a simultaneous invasive-noninvasive comparison [^113FwaYv]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Exercise echocardiography is often applied as a noninvasive strategy to screen for abnormal pulmonary hemodynamic response, but it is technically challenging, and limited data exist regarding its accuracy to estimate pulmonary arterial pressure during exercise.

Methods and Results

Among 65 patients with exertional intolerance undergoing upright invasive exercise testing, tricuspid regurgitation (TR) Doppler estimates and invasive measurement of pulmonary arterial pressure at rest and peak exercise were simultaneously obtained. TR Doppler envelopes were assessed for quality. Correlation, Bland-Altman, and receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses were performed to evaluate agreement and diagnostic accuracy. Mean age was 62 ± 13 years, and 31% were male. High-quality (grade A) TR Doppler was present in 68% at rest and 34% at peak exercise. For grade A TR signals, echocardiographic measures of systolic pulmonary arterial pressure correlated reasonably well with invasive measurement at rest (r = 0.72, P < 0.001; bias, -2.9 ± 8.0 mmHg) and peak exercise (r = 0.75, P < 0.001; bias, -1.9 ± 15.6 mmHg). Lower quality TR signals (grade B and C) correlated poorly with invasive measurements overall. In patients with grade A TR signals, mean pulmonary arterial pressure-to-workload ratio at a threshold of 1.4 mmHg/10 W was able to identify abnormal pulmonary hemodynamic response during exercise (> 3.0 mmHg/L per minute increase), with 91% sensitivity and 82% specificity (area under the curve, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.77–1.0; P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Agreement between echocardiographic and invasive measures of pulmonary pressures during upright exercise is good among the subset of patients with high-quality TR Doppler signal. While the limits of agreement are broad, our results suggest that in those patients, sensitivity is adequate to screen for abnormal pulmonary hemodynamic response during exercise.

### Reliability of noninvasive assessment of systolic pulmonary artery pressure by Doppler echocardiography compared to right heart catheterization: analysis in a large patient population [^114AxoQK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Potential sources of error for the sPAP assessment with Doppler echocardiography were already discussed by Yock and Popp, and commented on in the subsequent studies. In our study, we could document a series of sources of error in an offline analysis of all cases, with significant overestimation or underestimation (Table 6). Contrary to former assertions, characteristics of the inferior vena cava were not the main reason for inaccuracy, but rather were due to the many pitfalls inherent to the Doppler method. Thus, optimal settings when assessing tricuspid regurgitation velocities should be taken into account. Further pitfalls should be kept in mind. Stenosis of the right ventricular outflow tract, pulmonary valve, or the pulmonary trunk may lead to systematic overestimation of right ventricular systolic pressure. Severe tricuspid insufficiency may lead to underestimation as pressure gradients decrease with increasing effective regurgitant orifice area. Furthermore, since the absence of tricuspid regurgitation does not rule out PH, the presence of indirect signs must be observed.

Sources of sPAP Overestimation or Underestimation Leading Correspondingly to Overdiagnosis or Underdiagnosis of Pulmonary Hypertension

Based on our experience, the following aspects should be considered for best results: (1) since angle between ultrasound beam and direction of flow must be kept to a minimum, tricuspid regurgitation should first be detected with color Doppler from the best ultrasound view and multiple transducer positions may be necessary; (2) settings should be corrected, a colored spectral wave should be chosen, gain for optimal signal‐to‐noise ratio, velocity range allowing waves to fill at least two thirds of spectral depiction, and sweep velocity set to 100 to 200 mm/s should be attempted; (3) only signals extended for at least half of the systole should be measured, and incomplete or absent tricuspid regurgitation may be avoided by increasing blood pool volume with a strategy as simple as drinking a cup of water before examination; (4) maximal velocities in the presence of atrial fibrillation should be averaged; and (5) maximal velocities should be measured at the best spectral‐wave boundary, avoiding including Doppler artifacts ("fringes").
