## Question

What is the incidence of a duplicated inferior vena cava?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the incidence of a duplicated inferior vena cava (DIVC) is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the embryologic definition and how DIVC differs from other IVC variants. Then, I should gather the best prevalence estimates and verify the highest-quality source. Next, I will review heterogeneity by modality and population to explain the range. After that, I should reconcile conflicting statements about "most common" anomalies and self-check the comparative prevalences. Finally, I will connect the epidemiology to surgical, interventional, and diagnostic implications and deliver a concise, defensible conclusion anchored to the meta-analysis.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and embryologic basis. Duplicated IVC arises from persistence of both supracardinal veins, producing paired infrarenal trunks; typically, the left IVC drains into the left renal vein, which then joins the orthotopic suprarenal IVC, a pattern distinct from a solitary left-sided IVC or an interrupted IVC with azygos/hemiazygos continuation [^113p2D4p] [^116fDcZb].

> Now, I need to check the strongest prevalence estimate and its precision. The best-quality signal comes from a 2019 meta-analysis pooling 39 studies, which reports an overall DIVC prevalence of 0.7% with a 95% CI of 0.5–0.9%, and minimal publication bias; notably, anatomy studies detect more cases than imaging or surgical series, which already hints at modality-driven heterogeneity [^116vWmyT].

> Next, I should review the broader range reported across reviews and case series to see how it compares. Multiple narrative sources consistently cite a 0.2–3.0% prevalence band, which likely reflects differences in detection methods and case-mix rather than true biological divergence, and some single-center reports say "up to 2.8–3%", whereas others restate the meta-analytic point estimate of 0.7% as a representative figure for the general population [^116fDcZb] [^112hocXr] [^113FAARE] [^116KRMK8] [^114ycTBE].

> Hold on, I should verify real-world imaging cohorts to ensure the meta-analytic figure generalizes. In a multicenter CT study, duplication was 1.0% in asymptomatic screening and 0.3% in symptomatic patients, aligning with the notion that prevalence depends on who gets scanned and why; older MDCT series also show that "all IVC anomalies" on routine abdominal CT are around 0.5%, implying that duplication is a subset within that smaller pool when strict definitions are applied [^113hbMLp] [^114QCsKG].

> I will now examine why estimates vary and whether methodology explains the spread. The meta-analysis itself found higher detection in anatomical/dissection series compared with clinical imaging or surgical series; beyond modality, population selection, definitions of complete versus partial duplication, and small-sample variance all contribute to the 0.2–3% band, with modern multi-detector CT increasing incidental capture in recent decades [^116vWmyT] [^116fDcZb].

> Wait, let me verify comparative prevalences to avoid an overstatement about "most common" IVC anomalies. I initially noted that duplication is the most frequent infrarenal IVC variant, but I should double-check left-sided IVC and interrupted IVC rates. Left-sided IVC is usually quoted at 0.2–0.5%, while classic suprarenal interruption with azygos continuation sits around 0.6%; given the 0.7% pooled estimate for duplication, it is reasonable to conclude that duplication slightly edges out interrupted IVC and exceeds left-sided IVC in frequency in aggregate data, though individual series will vary by ascertainment strategy [^111x6LmW] [^115Lg1Ds] [^116vWmyT]. Hmm, wait a minute, some pictorial reviews loosely list overall "IVC variations" at higher composite rates; that does not contradict the above because those compilations aggregate multiple anomalies rather than ranking single entities, so I will keep the nuance explicit [^114xmXkS].

> Next, I should connect prevalence to practical implications so clinicians understand why this matters. Missed DIVC can precipitate major hemorrhage during retroperitoneal and aortic surgery; preoperative recognition changes exposure and reconstruction strategy, and several surgical series emphasize meticulous imaging review to avert complications [^112Q3oVw] [^114Akude]. Let me also consider venous thromboembolism: IVC anomalies, including duplication and interruption, are over-represented among younger iliofemoral DVT patients, and management may require dual infrarenal filters or alternative strategies when anticoagulation is contraindicated, with venography mapping essential to avoid incomplete protection or maldeployment [^112gxcCh] [^112UFaza] [^114JLz4C]. I should also confirm imaging pitfalls: the left IVC or preaortic trunk can mimic retroperitoneal adenopathy or a mass; pattern recognition on contrast-enhanced CT or MRI prevents overstaging and misdiagnosis, especially in oncologic contexts [^116fDcZb] [^117Vzoy1].

> But wait, what if clinicians are planning a single suprarenal filter instead of dual infrarenal devices in DIVC; is that supported? Case-based literature notes this as a theoretical option post-confluence, but most reported DIVC cases utilized dual infrarenal filters tailored to anatomy, underscoring the need for individualized venography-based planning and procedural expertise to minimize time and complications [^114JLz4C] [^114qZm6y].

> Let me synthesize and state the take-home clearly. The most reliable point estimate for duplicated IVC in the general population is approximately 0.7% with a 95% CI of 0.5–0.9% from a robust meta-analysis, while the broader literature spans 0.2–3.0% due to modality, population, and definitional heterogeneity; in comparative context, duplication likely slightly exceeds interrupted IVC and clearly exceeds left-sided IVC, though series-level variability can invert ranks depending on ascertainment, which I needed to double-check before concluding [^116vWmyT] [^116fDcZb] [^111x6LmW] [^115Lg1Ds]. Clinically, recognizing DIVC before surgery, venous interventions, and cancer staging averts hemorrhage, avoids misdiagnosis as lymphadenopathy, and informs DVT management, including the potential need for dual filters or alternative strategies when anticoagulation is not feasible [^112Q3oVw] [^116fDcZb] [^112UFaza] [^114JLz4C].

The incidence of duplicated inferior vena cava (IVC) is approximately 0.2–3% in the general population [^116fDcZb] [^112hocXr], with a pooled prevalence of 0.7% (95% CI 0.5–0.9%) per meta-analysis [^116vWmyT]. Most cases are asymptomatic and detected incidentally on imaging; however, recognition is essential for surgical and interventional planning to avoid complications [^116TQo4S] [^114At6HV] [^112Q3oVw].

### The inferior vena cava: anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^116fDcZb]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Anatomical variants of the inferior vena cava (IVC) primarily result from abnormal regression or persistence of embryological veins. Although most anomalies are asymptomatic incidental findings, they can cause lower extremity venous insufficiency, deep vein thrombosis, pelvic congestion syndrome, and affect planning of vascular procedures. The most common anomalies include duplicated IVC, left-sided IVC, and interruption of the IVC.

- **Duplicated IVC**: A duplicated IVC is formed by an abnormal persisting left supracardinal vein, resulting in duplicated infrarenal IVC segments. This variant has a prevalence of 0.2–3%. The common iliac veins typically drain to their respective sides, with the left infrarenal IVC joining the left renal vein, which in turn crosses to join the orthotopic suprarenal IVC. Some studies subclassify this anomaly by differences in the calibre of the duplicated infrarenal IVC segments. In addition, a bridging vein may connect the common iliac veins at the inferior origin of the duplicated IVC. Rarely, the duplicated segment can continue as the hemiazygos vein and drain directly into the superior vena cava. Case reports have described associations with retrocaval ureters, horseshoe kidneys, and malrotation of the gut. In this review, we present a rarely described case of duplicated IVC and crossed renal ectopia, with both renal veins draining into the orthotopic IVC. A duplicated IVC can also be mistaken for adenopathy or lymph nodes if its tubular nature is not recognized. Lastly, if this anomaly is not recognized during procedures, complications may arise.

### Inferior vena cava anomalies and variations: Imaging and rare clinical findings [^114At6HV]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of this paper is to summarize imaging findings of some frequent and infrequent inferior vena cava (IVC) anomalies and variations.

IVC anomalies should be suspected in patients presenting with pulmonary emboli, chronic pain, and deep vein thrombosis. To correctly characterize and classify IVC anomalies and variations is of crucial importance for proper planning of surgical interventions and thus for avoiding serious complications.

- **Key points**:
	- IVC anomalies should be suspected in patients with pulmonary emboli, pain, and venous thrombosis.
	- Awareness of IVC anomalies and variations is crucial for clinical and surgical procedures.
	- Unawareness of these anomalies may lead to severe and deadly complications.

### Duplication and transposition of inferior vena cava: A meta-analysis of prevalence [^116vWmyT]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The primary aim of this article was to establish the actual prevalence of transposition and duplication of the inferior vena cava and to increase awareness about them.

A meta-analysis of prevalence was conducted using cases obtained from PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. A total of 48 studies contained data that allowed us to estimate the prevalence of these variants, with 39 studies for duplication and 32 for transposition.

The overall prevalence of duplication was 0.7%, with a 95% confidence interval between 0.5% and 0.9%. For transposition, the prevalence was 0.3%, with a 95% confidence interval between 0.2% and 0.5%. The publication bias was minimal. Duplication prevalence was significantly higher in anatomy studies compared to imaging and surgery studies; however, for transposition, there were no statistically significant differences by detection technique.

The overall prevalence of duplication of the inferior vena cava is 0.7%; for transposition, it is 0.3%. Even if they are obviously rare conditions, their presence must be suspected by practitioners as they can have important clinical consequences, may require changes in the surgery protocol, or can be associated with other congenital abnormalities.

### Upper ureteric obstruction secondary to entrapment between twin segments of inferior vena cava — an unusual occurrence [^111qH4px]. Urology (2012). Low credibility.

A retrocaval ureter is a rare congenital cause of upper ureteric obstruction that results from entrapment of the upper ureter by the inferior vena cava (IVC) as it courses posterior to the cava. We report an interesting scenario of upper ureteric obstruction secondary to entrapment between twin segments of the IVC.

### Vena cava anomalies in thoracic surgery [^112ZmyBa]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Vena cava anomalies are a rare group of anatomical variations arising from incorrect development of the superior or inferior vena cava during fetal life. These anomalies generally have no clinical relevance, with diagnosis often occurring due to associations with congenital heart diseases in most cases. However, preoperative identification of these anomalies is essential for proper surgical planning. Failure to recognize these anomalies may lead to lethal complications, as documented in literature.

- **Case presentation**: We report a case series involving three different unidentified vena cava anomalies in patients undergoing lung resection. These unrecognized anomalies resulted in minor complications in two cases and required thorough intraoperative evaluation in another.

A retrospective evaluation of preoperative radiological images revealed these anomalies.

- **Conclusions**: It is crucial for thoracic surgeons to carefully evaluate the vena cava anatomy in preoperative imaging to accurately plan surgery and avoid complications.

### The inferior vena cava: anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^116dGgYk]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

The inferior vena cava (IVC) is the main conduit for venous return from the pelvis, abdominal viscera, and lower extremities. A comprehensive understanding of IVC anatomy, congenital variants, and pathology is instrumental to accurate diagnosis and management. In this review, we discuss normal anatomy, embryogenesis, and present illustrated cases of congenital anomalies of the IVC, including duplicated IVC, left-sided IVC, absent infrarenal IVC, and interrupted IVC with azygos continuation. Diseases involving the IVC can be diagnostically challenging, with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) playing key roles in characterizing malignancy, tumor extent, caval wall invasion, and bland thrombus. This information is crucial for staging and surgical planning. Lastly, we discuss the imaging pitfall of mixed artifact masquerading as thrombus.

- **Normal IVC anatomy**: The IVC is a large retroperitoneal vein draining the lower extremities, pelvic, and abdominal viscera to the right atrium of the heart. It is typically formed by the confluence of the right and left common iliac veins behind the right common iliac artery at the level of the fifth lumbar vertebra. The IVC ascends along the right side of the vertebral column behind the duodenum, portal vein, and liver to pierce the diaphragmatic central tendon at the caval opening at the level of the eighth thoracic vertebra. This is followed by a short intrathoracic course prior to terminating at the right atrium. As it ascends, it receives many tributaries, including paired third and fourth lumbar veins.

### The inferior vena cava: Anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^111HNEgC]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

**Teaching points**: IVC anomalies are the result of abnormal persistence or regression of embryological veins. Pulmonary embolism following routine infrarenal IVC filter placement should raise suspicion of a duplicated IVC. Absent or interrupted IVC should be suspected in young patients with iliofemoral DVT. IVC variants and dilated collateral veins can be mistaken for malignancy. Tumor thrombus is differentiated from bland thrombus by filling defect enhancement, vessel lumen expansion, and contiguity with the mass. The extent of tumor thrombus is a key determinant of prognosis and surgical management, particularly in renal cell carcinoma.

### Management of acute lower extremity deep venous thrombosis in a patient with duplicated inferior vena cava and contraindication to anticoagulation: Case and review of the literature [^112hocXr]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Duplicated inferior vena cava (DIVC) is an uncommon phenomenon, with an incidence of 0.2%–3%. In the literature, only 14 prior cases of DIVC and caval interruption have been identified. Future clinicians and patients can benefit from publishing the management decisions made in real time, combined with a summary of the literature.

### The inferior vena cava: anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^117YDKQF]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

The inferior vena cava (IVC) is the largest vein in the body, draining blood from the abdomen, pelvis, and lower extremities. This pictorial review summarizes the normal anatomy and embryological development of the IVC. In addition, we highlight a wide range of anatomical variants, acquired pathologies, and a common pitfall in imaging of the IVC. This information is essential for clinical decision-making and to reduce misdiagnosis.

### Double venous compression due to duplicated inferior vena cava-induced right common iliac vein thrombosis [^115pJ9Fq]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Venous compression syndromes are caused by extrinsic venous compression of anatomical structures, such as the adjacent arteries and bones. Chronic venous compression and pulsative vibratory arterial pressure accelerate the development of deep vein thrombosis. Herein, we report the first case of double venous compressions due to a duplicated inferior vena cava-induced right-sided common iliac vein thrombosis. The thrombus was induced by left-sided inferior vena cava entrapment and right-sided common iliac vein compression, resembling nutcracker syndrome and May-Thurner syndrome, respectively. Bypass flow of the right inferior vena cava rendered the right lower extremity asymptomatic. Once daily anticoagulation edoxaban was effective. Congenital venous anomalies and bypass formations should be considered when a common iliac vein thrombus without symptoms in the lower extremities is observed, and a lifelong periodical follow-up is mandatory, even after remission.

### Inferior and superior vena cava reconstruction [^113uamhN]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction is often referred to as "SVC syndrome" in the literature and affects about 15,000 patients in the United States annually. Malignancy is the leading cause of SVC obstruction, accounting for up to 90% of all cases, predominantly due to lung cancer. Benign causes include non-malignant tumor compression, infectious diseases, or complications from indwelling intravascular devices. The increased use of catheters and pacemaker/defibrillator leads has particularly led to a rise in device-related SVC syndrome.

The exact numbers in Europe and worldwide are less well-known; however, the incidence of SVC syndrome ranges approximately from 1 in 650 to 1 in 3100 patients. Due to the lower implantation of hemodialysis catheters in Europe, the incidence of catheter-related SVC obstruction may be lower, shifting the ratio more towards a malignant etiology. The most common causative tumor is bronchial carcinoma, followed by tumors that frequently metastasize to the mediastinum and primary mediastinal tumors (such as thymomas or lymphomas).

In contrast to SVC obstruction, inferior vena cava (IVC) obstruction is infrequently referred to as "IVC syndrome" in the literature, as it is rarely associated with severe complications such as hypotension, tachycardia, end-organ failures, and death. The underlying pathologies leading to IVC obstruction are extremely diverse, making reliable estimates on epidemiology, especially regarding the nature of these obstructions, virtually impossible. While 4–15% of IVC obstructions appear to be…

### Double vena cava filter insertion in congenital duplicated inferior vena cava: a case report and literature review [^114qZm6y]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

The complex embryogenesis of the inferior vena cava (IVC) may result in several anomalies, often presenting as incidental radiological findings. Recognizing IVC defects is crucial for invasive procedures in addition to differentiating them from pathological lesions. This report describes a patient with right femoral vein thrombosis who could not receive anticoagulant therapy due to a concomitant acute cerebral hemorrhage. He was found to have an asymptomatic duplicated IVC with interiliac communication. A filter had to be inserted in each vena cava to prevent pulmonary embolism. A review of the literature detailing the few reported cases of filter insertion in congenital duplicated IVC is presented.

### Percutaneous orthotopic IVC construction in a pediatric patient with symptomatic IVC agenesis [^116LpUmh]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

Inferior vena cava agenesis is an uncommon condition usually attributed to embryologic dysgenesis. When symptomatic, unprovoked deep venous thrombosis and/or lower extremity venous congestion are the most frequent manifestations. Its rarity has precluded consensus regarding appropriate management. Symptomatic chronic venous congestion requires surgical construction of auxiliary venous pathways, which may involve substantial morbidity, prolonged recovery, and extensive scarring. We report successful minimally invasive management via percutaneous endovascular orthotopic inferior vena cava construction in a pediatric patient, thereby obviating the need for surgery and its associated morbidity.

### Congenital systemic venous return anomalies to the right atrium review [^111x6LmW]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Left-sided IVC (Fig. 7 a–c): Resulting from the persistence of the left supracardinal vein, in addition to the regression of the right one, it has a prevalence of about 0.2–0.5%. Usually, the left IVC joins the left renal vein, which crosses ventrally to join the right renal vein, resulting in a normal suprarenal segment of the IVC. This anomaly may complicate the placement of an IVC filter on the infrarenal segment via a transjugular access.

- **Fig. 7**:
	- a) Left-sided IVC schematic: Differs from duplication as the infrarenal segment of the right IVC is absent. The left IVC joins the left renal vein, which normally crosses ventrally to join the right renal vein, forming a normal suprarenal segment of the IVC.
	- b) Left-sided IVC embryology schematic: Results from the regression of the right supracardinal vein, along with the persistence of the left supracardinal vein.
	- c) Left-sided IVC imaging: Contrast-enhanced CT showing a left-sided IVC (L-IVC) joining the left renal vein, which normally crosses ventrally to join the right renal vein (asterisk), forming a normal suprarenal segment of the IVC.

Interruption of the infrarenal IVC with preservation of the suprarenal segment (Fig. 8): This is a rarer anomaly, resulting from abnormal embryologic development of the posterior cardinal and supracardinal veins, leading to the absence of the infrarenal segment of the IVC. Blood from the lower half of the body reaches the heart via the SVC through the azygos-hemiazygos system.

### The azygos vein pathway: An overview from anatomical variations to pathological changes [^1152Q7nk]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Several causes can induce inferior vena cava (IVC) obstruction, but the most important are membranous obstruction, Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) and neoplastic lesions. In the presence of IVC obstruction, intrahepatic venous, portocaval, and spider web collateral vessels develop to decompress the liver parenchyma. Extrahepatic collateral vessels commonly seen in membranous obstruction of intrahepatic IVC include the ascending lumbar veins, which drain into the azygos vein on the right side and into the hemiazygos vein on the left.

Nonvascular lesions may be found next to the azygos vein, particularly in the right paratracheal region or in the azygo-oesophageal recess (Fig. 9), mimicking an enlargement of the azygos vein. Lung cancer adenopathy, sarcoidosis, and lymphoma are the most common causes of enlargement of the right inferior paratracheal region. Other less common lesions are cysts of the pericardium and primary benign or malignant tumors.

### Procedural complications of inferior vena cava filter retrieval, an illustrated review [^111DDegt]. CVIR Endovascular (2020). Low credibility.

Annually, approximately 65,000 inferior vena cava (IVC) filters are placed in the United States (Ahmed et al. J Am Coll Radiol 15:1553–1557, 2018). Approximately 35% of filters are eventually retrieved (Angel et al. J Vasc Interv Radiol 22: 1522–1530 e1523, 2011). Complications during filter retrieval depend heavily on technique and filter position.

- **Review: Risk factors and incidence**: In this paper, we review risk factors and incidence of complications during IVC filter removal.
- **Avoidance and management**: We also discuss ways these complications could be avoided and the appropriate management if they occur.

### Duplicate inferior vena cava complicating the evaluation of primary aldosteronism [^1111wibb]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 64-year-old man with a known duplicate inferior vena cava (D-IVC) and resistant hypertension presented to our emergency department in a hypertensive crisis. He had a longstanding history of hypertension and unexplained hypokalemia treated with oral potassium supplementation. The patient was diagnosed with primary aldosteronism, and MRI of the abdomen revealed a left-sided adrenal adenoma. Adrenal venous sampling (AVS) lateralized aldosterone hypersecretion to the left adrenal gland. The patient subsequently underwent an uncomplicated laparoscopic left adrenalectomy. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged on a single antihypertensive medication on postoperative day 1. D-IVC is one of several rare IVC anatomical variants that have been well described in the literature. Knowledge of this patient's unique abdominal venous anatomy enabled successful AVS and appropriate surgical management. It is necessary to identify potential anatomical variants of abdominal venous anatomy that may complicate these invasive procedures.

### An unusual case of leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava in a patient with a duplicated inferior vena cava [^113xpC25]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Leiomyosarcoma of primary vascular origin is a rare primary soft tissue tumour, which arises mainly from the inferior vena cava (IVC). Clinical symptoms depend upon the size and location of the tumour, presenting usually with abdominal pain, palpable mass, and weight loss. Complete surgical resection with clear surgical margins plays a central therapeutic role. The effect of chemotherapy and radiation therapy remains to be evaluated.

We report a 64-year-old Chinese female who presented with an abdominal mass and pain associated with weight loss and was subsequently diagnosed with inferior vena cava leiomyosarcoma. She underwent successful surgical resection but, unfortunately, developed a recurrence of the tumour 12 months post-operatively. She was also found to have a duplicated inferior vena cava, which allowed reconstitution of venous return from the lower limbs after the surgical resection of the IVC tumour. We discuss the surgical treatment and results of leiomyosarcoma of the IVC.

### Ct of inferior vena cava filters: normal presentations and potential complications [^114qnjdx]. Emergency Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

With massive pulmonary embolism (PE) being the first or second leading cause of unexpected death in adults, protection against PE is critical in appropriately selected patients. The use of inferior vena cava (IVC) filters has increased over the years, paralleling the improved detection of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and PE through more advanced and widely available imaging techniques.

Use of IVC filters has become very common as an alternative and/or as a supplement to anticoagulation. These filters are often seen on routine abdominal CT, including in the emergency setting. Therefore, knowledge of the normal spectrum of findings of IVC filters on CT is critical for radiologists. Additionally, CT can specifically identify complications related to IVC filters and may demonstrate IVC filter-related problems not clinically anticipated.

With multiple IVC filters available on the US market, and even more outside the United States, it is important for emergency and general radiologists to recognize the different models, various appearances, and positioning on CT, as well as their potential complications. These complications may be related to venous access but also include thrombosis related to the filter, filter migration and penetration, and problems associated with filter deployment.

With the increasing number of inferior vena cava filters being placed, and their duration within patients increasing over time, it is critical for emergency and other radiologists to be aware of these findings on CT.

### Left-sided inferior vena cava: A retrospective study and literature review [^112q7tUX]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

The primary goal of this research is to delve into the clinical and pathological facets of the left-sided inferior vena cava (IVC) and to catalog and condense its radiological and clinical attributes, thereby furnishing valuable references for pertinent clinical diagnosis and therapeutic procedures.

- **Methods**: We collated and scrutinized the general clinical features, radiological characteristics, and diagnostic and therapeutic strategies of 30 patients diagnosed with left-sided IVC (LIVC) in our hospital from July 2014 through February 2024.

- **Results**: A majority of patients were asymptomatic and were only identified during diagnostic procedures for other ailments. CT scans revealed anomalies in the anatomical configuration of the LIVC. The radiological presentations primarily showcased the right common iliac vein traversing the lumbar vertebrae to amalgamate with the left common iliac vein, forming the IVC. The IVC ascended on the left side of the abdominal aorta, accepted the left renal vein, and then transitioned to the right side of the abdominal aorta. In 3 instances, the IVC was witnessed ascending on the left side of the abdominal aorta, permeating through the diaphragm, converging with the azygos vein and abdominal aorta, and making its way into the right atrium. In these cases, the hepatic segment of the IVC was missing, and there was an absence of the IVC inferior to the hepatic vein, a condition we refer to as complete LIVC.

- **Conclusions**: LIVC is predominantly asymptomatic but carries significant anatomical implications during abdominal, retroperitoneal surgery, and imaging procedures.

### Venous anomalies in renal transplantation: an accessory left-sided IVC in a live kidney donor [^114ycTBE]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Duplication of the inferior vena cava (IVC) resulting in an accessory left-sided IVC is a relatively rare vascular anomaly with a reported prevalence of 0.7%. Radiologically, a duplicated left-sided IVC is usually seen as a continuation of the left common iliac vein, crossing anterior to the aorta at the level of the renal vein to join the right-sided IVC. We present a rare case in which an accessory left-sided IVC was discovered intraoperatively in a 47-year-old living donor, posing significant intraoperative challenges regarding extraction and subsequent transplantation.

### Management of acute lower extremity deep venous thrombosis in a patient with duplicated inferior vena cava and contraindication to anticoagulation: case and review of the literature [^112UFaza]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

On hospital day 7, the acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) was treated with a high-intensity unfractionated heparin drip. However, 12 hours later, the patient developed copious bloody secretions during suctioning of the tracheostomy. Due to the extent of the bleeding, anticoagulation was stopped, and interventional radiology was consulted for the placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. On day 9, a mapping venogram was performed, revealing a duplicated IVC (DIVC) with the continuation of the left IVC into the azygos and hemiazygos system.

On day 10, the patient underwent placement of two infrarenal IVC filters, one in each IVC.

### Obstructive lesions of the inferior vena cava: Clinical features and endovenous treatment [^114rSRvF]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructions of the inferior vena cava (IVC) are associated with many unusual features. Even total occlusions may remain entirely silent or present late with acute symptoms. Renal dysfunction is rare. Many patients have chronic symptoms, but often only one limb is affected. We describe the clinical features in a series of 120 patients seen over a 10-year period and the results of successful stent placement in 99 limbs.

- **Methods**: Patients with acute onset of symptoms due to distal thromboses underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis. Patients with significant chronic symptoms were investigated using duplex, venous function tests, transfemoral venography, and finally, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Stenotic segments were balloon dilated, and occluded segments were recanalized when feasible; stents were placed under IVUS control.

- **Results**: In the asymptomatic group, 10 patients with total occlusions had transient or no occlusive symptoms. In the acute symptom group, four patients with chronic IVC occlusions presented with acute onset of deep venous thrombosis distal to the occlusion but became asymptomatic when the clot was lysed. In the chronic symptom group, 97 patients (99 limbs) had symptoms of chronic venous disease of variable distribution and intensity. In two-thirds of cases, limb symptoms were unilateral. Pathology was total occlusion in 14%, and the rest were stenoses. The lesion extended above the renal vein in 18%. Common iliac obstruction was identified in 93%. Distal reflux was present in 66%. Modifications of the basic stent technique were required in the recanalization process.

### Inferior vena cava agenesis: a rare cause of deep vein thrombosis [^117RUm4i]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis considered included chronic IVC occlusion, based on the original CT findings. However, upon specialist radiology consultant review, the images indicated a lack of any demonstrable thrombus superior to the iliac veins. Furthermore, the presence of well-developed azygous collateral venous drainage was characteristic of a diagnosis of IVC agenesis (IVCA).

### Abdominal aortic surgery in the presence of inferior vena cava anomalies: A case series [^112Q3oVw]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Left-sided inferior vena cava (LIVC) and duplicated inferior vena cava (DIVC) are rare asymptomatic congenital abnormalities. When unrecognized, these anomalies can cause major injuries and serious, life-threatening bleeding complications, especially during abdominal aortic surgery.

- **Methods**: Retrospective data for patients with two major inferior vena cava (IVC) anomalies who underwent aortic surgery over a 13-year period were collected. Recorded data included patient demographics, type of aortic disease and caval anomaly, surgical approach, type of aortic reconstruction associated with the procedure on the caval vein, postoperative complications, and in-hospital mortality.

- **Results**: There were nine patients with IVC anomalies who underwent aortic surgery. All patients were men, with a median age of 66.2 years. Seven had an LIVC, and two had DIVC. Five patients were operated on due to abdominal aortic aneurysm, and four due to aortoiliac occlusive disease. In all cases, a midline transperitoneal aortic approach was performed. In five cases, the left IVC had to be temporarily resected and later reconstructed; in the other four, it was just mobilized. There were no postoperative complications except in one patient who developed deep vein thrombosis in the left calf; this was successfully treated with anticoagulant therapy.

- **Conclusion**: Due to favorable results and low incidence of perioperative complications, in the absence of other associated abdominal pathology, we propose the midline transperitoneal approach with mobilization or temporary resection of LIVC.

### Imaging of partial right double vena cava with ureter crossing through its split, confirmed at surgery [^112kvkWw]. Clinical Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

A complex development process occurs during the embryogenesis of the inferior vena cava (IVC), involving the formation of several anastomoses between three paired embryonic veins, which may result in a wide range of congenital abnormalities of the IVC. We report a case, not described before, of partial double right IVC with a circumcaval ureter crossing through the divide in the IVC.

### Radiographic characterization of inferior vena cava and its reaction following filter placement: A single-center retrospective study [^116N5RJd]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2025). Low credibility.

To classify the radiographic characterization of the inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter, as well as to quantitatively describe the dimensional alternations in response to variations in filter placement, using cross-sectional computer tomographic venography (CTV) imaging, a single-center retrospective study was conducted. Eligible patients who underwent CTV of the IVC both before and after the placement of spindle-shaped filters from September 2018 to June 2023 were included. Baseline data, IVC diameter and orientation pre- and post-filter placement, IVC enlargement rate, and related complications were analyzed.

A total of 70 eligible patients were included, with distributions as follows: 52 (74.3%) with type 1 IVC, 11 (15.7%) with type 2, 4 (5.7%) with type 3, 3 (4.3%) with type 4, and none with type 5. An accompanying morphological alteration transformed the IVC into a quasi-round shape with a Lin Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of 0.870. The orientation was significantly altered after filter placement. In patients with type 1, 3, and 4 IVCs, the mean diameter of the IVC increased almost 1.5-fold in the minor axis (95% confidence intervals [CIs] = -7.77 to -5.83, p < 0.05). A greater IVC enlargement rate was observed in the diameter of the minor axis than in the major axis (95% CI = 40.31 to 65.12, p < 0.001). Notably, regional clots around the filter were found in 22 (31.4%) patients. Among these, 14 (20.0%) were located on the anterior or posterior walls of the caval minor axis, 5 (7.1%) in the lateral walls, and 3 (4.3%) in the central part of the IVC filter.

### Wilms tumor with inferior vena cava duplication: A rare case report [^1112A8zS]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Wilms tumor (WT) is the most common renal tumor in childhood. Duplication of the inferior vena cava (IVC) is an uncommon anomaly. Although it is asymptomatic and often detected incidentally by imaging, IVC duplication may represent a hazard for bleeding during surgery, such as nephrectomy. In the present study, we present a case of WT with IVC duplication, which has not been reported previously.

### Wilms tumor with inferior vena cava duplication: A rare case report [^113VUZYn]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Wilms tumor is the most common renal tumor of childhood. Duplication of the inferior vena cava is an uncommon anomaly. In this study, we present a case of Wilms tumor with inferior vena cava duplication, which has not been previously reported.

- **Case presentation**: A 14-month-old female presented with an enlarging abdominal mass. Computed tomography imaging demonstrated a large mass in the right kidney, duplication of the inferior vena cava below the renal veins, and compression of the right inferior vena cava caused by the mass. A right radical nephrectomy was performed, and final pathology was consistent with Wilms tumor. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was administered. Computed tomography at three months postoperatively showed the right inferior vena cava played a dominant role, and the left inferior vena cava was not clearly detected. During an 18-month follow-up, no local recurrence or metastasis was observed.

- **Conclusion**: It is important to recognize cases of Wilms tumor with inferior vena cava duplication to avoid injury to retroperitoneal venous anomalies and life-threatening hemorrhage during surgery through preoperative computed tomography.

### Giant adrenal pseudocyst in patient with duplicated inferior vena cava: A case report [^116ydMvn]. Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Adrenal pseudocysts are rare entities in clinical practice and many are picked up incidentally. The incidence of congenital anomaly of the inferior vena cava is estimated to range from 0.2% to 3.0% in the general population. We report an exceptional case of a giant right-sided adrenal pseudocyst with inferior vena cava duplication to illustrate the clinical and histopathological features of this entity.

### Inferior vena cava duplication and deep venous thrombosis: case report and review of literature [^113FAARE]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Duplications of the inferior vena cava (IVC) are observed with an incidence ranging from 0.2% to 3.0%. Symptomatic duplications are rare, with only six reported cases of IVC duplication associated with deep venous thrombosis. We present a 78-year-old Caucasian woman with an IVC duplication who developed a deep venous thrombosis.

The etiologies of IVC duplication include the failure of anastomosis between the primitive cardinal veins and the failure of regression of the left supracardinal vein. When asymptomatic, treatment options include observation, placement of filters in both venous systems, or coil embolization of the duplicated segment plus placing a filter in the right IVC. For our patient, we chose to coil-embolize the communication to the duplicated segment as well as place a filter in the main right IVC system.

### Right double inferior vena cava associated with retrocaval ureter: Computed tomographic findings in two cases [^115cfe17]. Clinical Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Two cases of right double inferior vena cava (RDIVC) were observed on computed tomography. In one case, the duplicated IVCs were both located to the right of the abdominal aorta and were nearly on the same coronal plane. In the other case, the right IVC showed partial duplication. The right ureter coursed posterior to the lateral IVC, then emerged between the duplicated IVC in both cases. The findings from the two cases presented in this report showed novel anatomical differences, likely attributable to different embryologic processes, as compared to previously reported cases of RDIVC.

### Persistent left superior vena cava: Clinical importance and differential diagnoses [^1138ZwGD]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) is the most common thoracic venous anomaly and may be a component of complex cardiac pathologies. While it is often asymptomatic, it can lead to significant issues such as arrhythmias and cyanosis. Additionally, it can cause serious complications during vascular interventional procedures or the surgical treatment of cardiac anomalies (CA).

The clinical significance of PLSVC depends on the drainage site and the accompanying CA. This article describes the epidemiology, embryology, and anatomic variations of PLSVC. Possible accompanying CA and heterotaxy spectrum are reviewed with the aid of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) images. Radiological pitfalls, differential diagnoses, and the clinical importance of PLSVC are highlighted.

### Venous variants and anomalies on routine abdominal multi-detector row CT [^114QCsKG]. European Journal of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

This study aims to determine the types and prevalence rates of anatomic variations of the hepatic veins, portal vein, inferior vena cava, and renal veins, and to establish statistical correlations between various anomalies and frequency differences between males and females using multi-detector row computed tomography (CT).

One thousand one hundred and twenty patients (588 men, 532 women) were evaluated with routine abdominal CT. Frequencies of different variants were noted and compared, and correlations between three categories of variation were tested.

In total, 1,261 abdominal vein variants and anomalies were identified in 756 (67.5%) of 1,120 patients. Six hundred and forty-two hepatic vein variants were detected in 468 (41.8%) patients. One or more inferior right hepatic veins were identified in 356 (31.8%) individuals, and tributary hepatic veins were detected in 147 (13.1%) patients. Portal vein variations and anomalies were observed in 307 (27.4%) cases, the most frequent being trifurcation (139 patients, 12.4%). A total of 311 inferior vena cava and renal vein variants were identified in 258 (23%) cases. Six patients (0.5%) exhibited inferior vena cava anomalies, 62 (5.5%) had circumaortic renal veins, 53 (4.7%) had retroaortic renal veins, and 210 (18.8%) had multiple renal veins.

The prevalence of abdominal vein variations is high, and routine abdominal CT demonstrates these abnormalities very well. The data suggest that hepatic vein variants and multiple right renal veins are more frequent in women than in men.

### The inferior vena cava: anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^117Vzoy1]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

- **Duplicated IVC with symmetrical caliber**: Figure 3a presents a contrast-enhanced coronal CT revealing a duplicated inferior vena cava (IVC) (asterisk) with symmetrical caliber draining into the suprarenal IVC. Bilateral external iliac veins (arrows) both drain into cavae on their respective sides. Figure 3b provides an axial CT image illustrating the paired IVC trunks (arrows) positioned on either side of the abdominal aorta (arrowhead).

- **Duplicated IVC with asymmetrical caliber and bridging vein**: Figure 4a features a contrast-enhanced coronal CT showing a duplicated IVC (asterisk) of smaller caliber compared to the orthotopic IVC. It approaches and subsequently drains into the left renal vein (arrow). Figure 4b displays an axial CT image showing a bridging vein (arrow) connecting paired common iliac veins (arrowheads) positioned anterior to the L4 vertebral body and posterior to common iliac arteries.

- **Duplicated IVC with right-sided crossed fused renal ectopia**: Figure 5a shows a coronal CT image illustrating a duplicated IVC (asterisk) crossing the midline to drain into the right-sided suprarenal IVC. The right renal vein (arrow) and vein of the left ectopic kidney (arrowhead) join before draining into the orthotopic IVC. Figure 5b shows the right-sided crossed fused renal ectopia and its renal vein (arrow).

Left-sided IVC results from the abnormal regression of the right supracardinal vein and the persistence of the left supracardinal vein. This condition has a prevalence of 0.2–0.5% and involves bilateral common iliac veins draining into the left-sided IVC, which typically courses superiorly to join the left renal vein (Fig. 6). Known variants to this configuration include hemiazygos continuation.

### Inferior and superior vena cava reconstruction [^113x8Rzt]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Publications focusing on inferior vena cava (IVC) obstruction are notably rarer and exhibit the same limitations as previously described for superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction studies. Furthermore, the inclusion of cases involving (bilateral) thrombosis and confluence stenting complicates the analysis, diluting the data pertaining specifically to straightforward IVC stenting. Interestingly, patency data for IVC recanalization are comparable to those of the SVC when the obstruction is related to malignancy, ranging from 68% to 96.4%. However, when the obstruction is benign in origin, both primary and secondary patency rates for IVC obstructions are notably lower, ranging from 57% to 91%.

The lower patency rates observed in benign IVC obstructions could be attributed to factors such as the extended length of the obstruction, the number of stents required, or the configuration of confluence stenting that is often necessary when the iliac veins are implicated. Additionally, patients with benign conditions frequently exhibit post-thrombotic lesions in the iliac veins, which necessitate the use of long stents to ensure comprehensive treatment. Importantly, there is no evidence to suggest that crossing a vena cava filter during IVC stenting adversely affects patency rates.

In conclusion, endovascular recanalization of the SVC and IVC is a well-established technique characterized by high technical and clinical success rates, along with an acceptable risk profile. The ongoing advancements in deep venous interventions are likely to continue enhancing the outcomes of SVC and IVC procedures.

### Duplicated vena cava with tumor thrombus from renal cancer: Use of venogram for safer operative planning [^115AFFqj]. Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Renal and adrenal tumors can invade into the inferior vena cava (IVC) in 4%-10% of cases. Consequently, urologists must remain well versed in the anatomy of the IVC. The IVC develops embryologically from the coordinated growth and regression of a series of veins. Occasionally, these veins can persist, creating vena caval abnormalities. A completely duplicated caval system is one of these variations. We present a case of renal cell carcinoma with tumor thrombus extending into a duplicated IVC and show how understanding of venous drainage and pertinent imaging can aid with a successful outcome.

### The inferior vena cava: anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^116oRqcG]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) typically invades the portal venous system; however, involvement of the inferior vena cava (IVC) is not uncommon, occurring in 4.0–5.9% of patients either through extension of hepatic vein tumor thrombus or direct wall invasion. Tumor thrombus is uncommon in other hepatic malignancies and therefore should be considered a differentiating feature of HCC. IVC and right atrial involvement carries an extremely poor prognosis due to predisposition to metastatic disease, with a median survival of 1–5 months. Hepatic venous outflow obstruction may cause Budd–Chiari syndrome and clinical manifestations of portal hypertension. Tumor thrombus may also embolize and obstruct pulmonary arteries.

- **Contrast-enhanced imaging findings**:
	a) Coronal CT depicts direct invasion of the HCC (arrow) into the right atrium.
	b) Axial CT chest shows subsegmental right pulmonary artery dilation with internal filling defect (arrow), likely due to embolic tumor thrombus.
	c) Axial CT shows multifocal arterial enhancement in the liver, predominantly in segment 7 and 8. The IVC tumor thrombus also demonstrates arterial enhancement (arrow).
	d) Visualised as a partial filling defect (arrow) in the portal venous phase.
	e) Shows intermediate T2 signal (arrow) with extension into the hepatic IVC via the middle hepatic vein.

### The inferior vena cava: anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^117SyY6z]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

The inferior vena cava (IVC) is an important structure that can be affected by a wide range of congenital anomalies and acquired pathologies. It is crucial for radiologists to be familiar with the various appearances of the IVC in both benign and malignant pathologies. Recognizing the anatomical variants of the IVC is particularly important, especially prior to intervention. Imaging plays a key role in differentiating tumor extension from bland thrombus and in assessing the extent of tumor thrombus. Such information is essential for patient care and impacts staging, surgical planning, and medical therapy. Evaluation of the IVC should form a fundamental part of a radiologist's search pattern.

### Double inferior vena cava in a monochorionic twin pregnancy with selective fetal growth restriction [^111rMxSL]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Congenital anomalies of the infrarenal inferior vena cava (IVC) are well described in adult life; however, little information exists on their associations in fetal life. Here, we describe a case of a monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancy complicated by selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR) with an incidental finding of a double IVC in one child. In fetal life, variants of the infrarenal IVC are strongly associated with heart defects, which might suggest hemodynamic alterations or genetic causes, even more so in our case with MCDA twins complicated by sFGR.

### Congenital anomalies of the inferior vena cava [^116TQo4S]. Clinical Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Congenital anomalies of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and its tributaries are increasingly recognized in asymptomatic patients due to the more frequent use of cross-sectional imaging, particularly computed tomography (CT). IVC development is a complex process involving the formation of anastomoses between three pairs of embryonic veins between the 4th and 8th weeks of gestation. Various permutations occur in the basic venous plan of the abdomen and pelvis, resulting in variants such as isolated left IVC, double IVC, and retroaortic left renal vein.

While the majority of these anomalies are asymptomatic, they occasionally present clinically with thromboembolic complications. However, awareness of their existence is important to avoid critical diagnostic pitfalls and in preoperative surgical and interventional radiological planning.

### Thrombotic risk and features of patients with inferior vena cava agenesis: a multicentre, retrospective, observational study [^112b2LtN]. The Lancet Haematology (2024). Low credibility.

Inferior vena cava agenesis (IVCA) is a rare anomaly predisposing affected individuals to lower-limb venous thrombosis, with a low frequency of pulmonary embolism. Antenatal thrombosis and inherited thrombophilia have been suggested as causes of IVCA; however, there is little evidence on the clinical course and management of this condition. We designed a patient registry to assess the thrombotic risk and features of IVCA.

- **Methods**: In this multicentre, retrospective, observational study, we included patients with IVCA diagnosed by routine imaging from 20 hospitals in Spain (n = 18), Portugal (n = 1), and Italy (n = 1). Patients were identified from a systematic search in radiology databases using data extraction software (cohort A) and alternative searches in medical records for confirmed IVCA (cohort B), which was an option allowed when systematic approaches were inapplicable. Primary outcomes were clinical and imaging features, thrombotic risk, phenotype of IVCA-associated thrombosis, anticoagulant treatment, and the results of thrombophilia testing.

- **Findings**: We included patients with IVCA diagnosed by routine imaging studies conducted between Jan 1, 2010, and Dec 31, 2022. In the systematic search, 4,341,333 imaging exams were screened from the radiology databases of eight centers. A total of 122 eligible patients were enrolled in cohort A. A further 95 patients were identified by screening medical records at 12 centers, among whom 88 were eligible and included in cohort B, making a combined cohort of 210 patients. Of these, 96 (46%) were female and 200 (95%) were European or Hispanic.

### The inferior vena cava: anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^1173Kso8]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

An absent infrarenal inferior vena cava (IVC), also known as interruption of the infrarenal IVC or infrarenal agenesis of IVC with azygos continuation, is postulated to be caused by acquired intrauterine or perinatal venous thrombosis, rather than the failure of embryonic vein development. This leads to the failure of posterior cardinal and supracardinal vein development, resulting in external and internal iliac veins draining into the azygos–hemiazygos system via ascending lumbar veins, with a preserved suprarenal IVC segment. It is a rarely described anomaly with an unknown incidence. Affected patients are at risk of developing lower extremity venous insufficiency, deep vein thrombosis, varicose veins, and pelvic congestion syndrome. In the absence of adequate flow through ascending lumbar veins and the azygos system, other collateral pathways can form involving abdominal wall, pelvic, gonadal, and retroperitoneal vessels.

- **Absent infrarenal IVC with azygos continuation**: Paired common iliac veins continue cranially as bilateral ascending lumbar veins.
	- **Contrast-enhanced coronal CT**: Demonstrates the caudal end of the IVC.
	- **Coronal CT**: Shows the right ascending lumbar vein approaching and subsequently draining into the IVC. Tortuous paravertebral collateral veins are present adjacent to the aorta.
	- **Axial CT image**: The left renal vein crosses anterior to the aorta to drain into the renal IVC segment. The right renal vein also approaches the renal IVC segment.

### Management of acute lower extremity deep venous thrombosis in a patient with duplicated inferior vena cava and contraindication to anticoagulation: Case and review of the literature [^115bgdQz]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Duplication of the inferior vena cava (DIVC) is an uncommon embryological anatomic phenomenon. We report a 63-year-old woman with extensive right leg deep vein thrombosis who required an IVC filter due to contraindications for anticoagulation, but was found to have DIVC. This required the placement of two IVC filters with good results. This report will review and summarize past reports of DIVC management to provide a guide for future clinicians, and review the embryological development, diagnosis, and IVC filter placement options as they are based on the type of anatomic malformation encountered.

### Inferior vena cava anomalies and variations: Imaging and rare clinical findings [^115sNoAt]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Anomalies of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and its variations were first described by Abernethy in 1793 in a 10-month-old child with polysplenia and dextrocardia who presented with a congenital mesocaval shunt and continuation of IVC with the azygos vein (CCA). The IVC develops sequentially, primarily between the sixth and eighth gestational weeks, with the formation of anastomoses and posterior regression of three paired veins: subcardinal, supracardinal, and postcardinal. Because of this complexity in its embryogenesis, there are numerous anatomical forms and variations of IVC.

Anomalies of the IVC are usually visualized by noninvasive imaging techniques including multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In fact, these anomalies can be misdiagnosed as a mass lesion if variations and anomalies such as the double IVC, agenesis of infrarenal IVC, left IVC, and enlarged azygos vein are overlooked. Moreover, awareness of these variations is crucially important for cardiopulmonary surgeries. For instance, in cases with left IVC, the infrarenal placement of an IVC filter may be difficult to perform through the atransjugular approach.

In this article, we present the imaging findings and rare clinical variations of IVC anomalies with associated variations and diseases.

### Duplication of the inferior vena cava with thrombotic complication: Incidentally detected [^114apVos]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Although the duplication of the inferior vena cava (IVCD) is usually clinically silent and often detected incidentally by image analysis, it may have important relevance during retroperitoneal surgery and endovenous procedures. Furthermore, IVCD may represent the primary provocating factor of unilateral iliofemoral vein thrombosis in patients with hypoplasia or thrombosis of one of the caval veins. This was the case in a 37-year-old man with acute painful swelling of the right leg. The patient was treated successfully by endovenous reconstruction of the occluded caval vein. A review of the pathophysiology, clinical manifestation, and treatment of the IVCD is provided here.

### The inferior vena cava: anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^112gxcCh]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Thrombosis

IVC thrombosis carries significant morbidity and mortality, with a high risk for pulmonary embolism. Commonly reported causes include anomalous venous anatomy, extraluminal or intraluminal obstruction by malignancy, extension of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and unretrieved IVC filters. Approximately 5–16% of young patients presenting with iliofemoral DVT had IVC anomalies, with most cases attributed to IVC interruption/agenesis likely secondary to venous stasis from poor collaterals (Fig. 21). Up to 4% of patients with lower limb DVT experience IVC thrombosis (Fig. 22 a). Common predisposing factors such as malignancy, localized inflammation and coagulopathy cause hypercoagulable states (Fig. 22 b). In addition to malignancy-related hypercoagulability, tumor invasion by renal cell carcinoma is an additional independent risk factor for thrombogenesis.

- **Extensive venous thrombus**:
	- A 19-year-old man presented with a right lower limb DVT and underwent contrast-enhanced CT to assess the proximal extent of thrombus. He later developed a right ankle ulcer, likely contributed to by post-thrombotic syndrome.

	- **a. Coronal CT image**: Shows occlusive venous thrombus (arrows) in the common iliac veins and an adjacent paravertebral collateral vein (asterisk). Infrarenal and renal segments of the IVC are absent.
	- **b. Coronal CT demonstration**: The right renal vein (arrow) drains into a small caliber interrupted inferior vena cava (arrowhead).

### Wilms tumor with inferior vena cava duplication: a rare case report [^115sgKKz]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Wilms tumor is the most common renal tumor of childhood. Duplication of the inferior vena cava is an uncommon anomaly. In the present study, we present a case of Wilms tumor with the inferior vena cava duplication, which has not been reported previously.

- **Case presentation**: A 14-month-old female presented with an enlarging abdominal mass. Computed tomography imaging demonstrated a large mass in the right kidney, duplication of the inferior vena cava below the renal veins, and compression of the right inferior vena cava caused by the enormous mass. A right radical nephrectomy was performed. Final pathology was consistent with Wilms tumor. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was executed. Computed tomography imaging at 3 months postoperatively showed the right inferior vena cava played a dominant role, and the left inferior vena cava was not detected clearly. During the follow-up of 18 months, no local recurrence or metastasis has been observed.

- **Conclusion**: It is important to recognize the case of Wilms tumor with the inferior vena cava duplication to avoid injury of retroperitoneal venous anomalies and life-threatening hemorrhage during surgery through preoperative computed tomography.

### Dual inferior vena cava: Two inferior vena cava filters [^117RgmF1]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The formation of the venous drainage system of the human body is a complex process involving structures forming and regressing in a predefined order. Interruption of any one of these steps results in the formation of a congenital anomaly. Knowledge of these anomalies can prevent us from potential serious and sometimes fatal complications. Variations from the normal anatomy of the inferior vena cava (IVC) occur in 3% of the population.

The complex embryology of the IVC stems from three pairs of fetal veins:
1. Posterior cardinal veins
2. Subcardinal veins
3. Supracardinal veins

The cardinal veins constitute the main venous drainage system of the embryo. Although venous anomalies are rare, knowledge of them is crucial in diagnosis and treatment. These variations should not be mistaken for pathologic findings but should be viewed as normal findings of abnormal embryogenesis. We present a case here identifying a dual IVC, subsequently leading us to place two IVC filters.

### The inferior vena cava: anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^1125GB1c]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Koc et al. use a straightforward nomenclature that identifies all anomalies with absent or interrupted segments as 'interrupted IVC', followed by the level of interruption and associated collaterals, e.g. 'interrupted IVC (suprarenal level) with azygos continuation'. In this review, we report a rarely described case of interrupted IVC of the renal segment with azygos continuation. Instead of draining directly into the IVC, the left renal vein drains into a tortuous paravertebral collateral that eventually joins the hemiazygos vein, while the right renal vein continues to drain directly into the IVC. Paired common iliac veins continue as bilateral ascending lumbar veins to join a distended azygos–hemiazygos system. Lastly, acquired pathology, such as complete stenosis of the suprarenal IVC, results in anatomy similar to a congenital interrupted IVC, with the development of collateral pathways and preferential blood flow into the paravertebral, azygos, and hemiazygos systems.

- **Interrupted IVC (renal level) with azygos and hemiazygos continuation**: An anomaly was detected incidentally on imaging for a 55-year-old man with biopsy-proven renal cell carcinoma. The paired common iliac veins continue as bilateral ascending lumbar veins draining into the azygos–hemiazygos system.
	- Contrast-enhanced coronal CT shows the left renal vein (arrow) draining into a tortuous paravertebral collateral (asterisk).
	- The right renal vein (arrow) joins the suprarenal IVC (asterisk).
	- Axial CT image depicts a left-sided paravertebral collateral (arrow) that drains into the hemiazygos vein.

### The inferior vena cava: anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^115Lg1Ds]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Interrupted IVC with azygos continuation classically refers to the interruption of the suprarenal/infrahepatic segment and occurs due to the failure of the right subcardinal vein to anastomose with the vitelline vein. An interrupted IVC has been described in various ways, with 'interrupted' being interchanged for absence, anomalous, or agenesis. The suprarenal IVC reroutes to drain via the azygos vein, while the hepatic IVC only receives the hepatic veins. It carries a prevalence of 0.6% and is classically associated with polysplenia, cardiovascular malformations, and situs anomalies. Like an absent infrarenal IVC, an interrupted IVC without adequate collateral pathways can similarly result in vascular problems such as deep vein thrombosis and venous insufficiency. An enlarged azygos vein can be misinterpreted as retrocrural lymphadenopathy or a right paratracheal mass, while a distended hemiazygos vein may simulate a left-sided mediastinal mass. Prominent collateral vessels can also be mistaken for paraspinal masses. Preoperative awareness of this anomaly is important prior to thoracic and cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.

Distended collateral veins can be mistaken for a mass in the context of incidentally detected suprarenal IVC stenosis. In this case, a 54-year-old man had no previous history of IVC filter insertion or intra-abdominal surgery. A contrast-enhanced sagittal CT shows a pseudomass (arrow) immediately posteroinferior to complete stenosis (arrowhead) of the suprarenal IVC, with caudal segments of the IVC (asterisk) preserved.

### Vena cava anomalies in thoracic surgery [^114Akude]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Vena cava anomalies are a rare group of anatomical variations that arise from incorrect development of the superior or inferior vena cava during fetal life. Although they generally exhibit no clinical relevance, their diagnosis is often due to associations with congenital heart diseases. However, preoperative identification of these anomalies is crucial for surgeons to ensure proper surgical planning. If unrecognized, lethal complications may occur, as reported in the literature.

- **Case presentation**: We report a case series of three different unidentified vena cava anomalies in patients undergoing lung resection. These unrecognized anomalies led to minor complications in two cases and necessitated an accurate intraoperative evaluation in another. A careful retrospective evaluation of preoperative radiological images revealed the anomalies.

- **Conclusions**: A thorough evaluation of the vena cava anatomy in preoperative imaging is mandatory for thoracic surgeons to adequately plan the surgery and avoid complications.

### The inferior vena cava: anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^113TCM7d]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

The inferior vena cava (IVC) is the largest vein in the body, responsible for draining blood from the abdomen, pelvis, and lower extremities. This pictorial review summarizes the normal anatomy and embryological development of the IVC. Additionally, it highlights a wide range of anatomical variants, acquired pathologies, and a common pitfall in imaging of the IVC. This information is essential for clinical decision-making and for reducing misdiagnosis.

### Wilms tumor with inferior vena cava duplication: a rare case report [^1112qyCd]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Wilms tumor (WT) is the most common tumor of the urinary tract in individuals under the age of 15. Up to now, WT with inferior vena cava (IVC) duplication has not been reported. The development of the IVC is a complex embryological process occurring between weeks 6 and 10 of gestation; it involves the development, regression, anastomoses, and replacement of embryonic veins. Double IVC is a rare anomaly and occurs in 1.5% (range 0.2–3%).

- **Classification considerations**: According to the caliber of the duplicated IVC and the preaortic trunk, IVC duplication has been classified into three types. However, this classification may not be appropriate for the present case, considering the notable changes in the caliber of the duplicated IVC before and after the operation. The compression of the right IVC caused by the tumor resulted in the dominant venous drainage of the left IVC. After the tumor nephrectomy, the right IVC gradually took over the venous drainage. The left IVC might start to regress and could not be detected on a CT image taken 3 months postoperatively. To our knowledge, this is the first detection of the postnatal regression of the left IVC, which indicates that vena caval development might proceed beyond the embryonic period.

- **Clinical implications**: Although IVC duplication is usually asymptomatic, it might have significant clinical implications. As an uncommon anomaly, the duplication of the IVC can be misdiagnosed as a pathological lesion, such as ureteric dilatation or lymphadenopathy on CT images. The left side of a double IVC might be erroneously interpreted as enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, which might induce preoperative overstaging by radiographic imaging in WT.

### Use of a trellis device for endovascular treatment of venous thrombosis involving a duplicated inferior vena cava [^115F8Xgd]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Congenital anomalies of the inferior vena cava (IVC) are increasingly recognized with CT and venography techniques. Although many patients with IVC anomalies are asymptomatic, recent studies have suggested an association with venous thromboembolism. We report the case of a 62-year-old woman with extensive venous clot involving the infrarenal segment of a duplicated left IVC who underwent pharmacomechanical thrombectomy and tissue plasminogen activator catheter-directed thrombolysis with complete deep venous thrombosis resolution. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in the English literature of the use of a Trellis thrombectomy catheter in the setting of duplicated IVC.

### Prevalence of inferior vena cava anomalies and their significance and impact in clinical practice [^113hbMLp]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of inferior vena cava (IVC) anomalies in an asymptomatic healthy population and symptomatic patients.

- **Methods**: This was a multicenter retrospective observational study. Researchers reviewed the computed tomography (CT) images of 1,000 individuals from South Korea taken for a general medical check-up (group A) and 1,000 patients from the United States who visited with various symptoms for which CT was required (group B). A third group of 800 patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and CT from two US centers were used for comparison (group C). Twenty-eight patients with anatomical changes in the IVC due to intervention, extrinsic compression, trauma, other rare conditions, and poor image quality were excluded.

- **Results**: The mean age ± standard deviation of each group was 50 ± 6, 54 ± 11, and 54 ± 15 years in groups A, B, and C, respectively. In group A, duplication was the most common anomaly (10 cases, 1.0%), followed by left sided IVC (four cases, 0.4%), hypoplasia (three cases, 0.3%), and megacava (one case, 0.1%). In group B, the most common IVC anomaly was hypoplasia in six cases (0.6%); duplication in three patients, left sided IVC in three patients, aplasia in two patients, web formation in two patients, and megacava in two patients. In group C, hypoplasia was the most common type (32 cases, 4.0%). The prevalence of hypoplasia in patients younger than 50 years of age was significantly higher compared with older patients (12.7% [14/110] vs. 5.3% [10/190]; p = .027). The risk of hypoplasia or aplasia was significantly higher.

### Duplication of the inferior vena cava in a patient presenting for IVC filter placement [^116KRMK8]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2010). Low credibility.

Given the complex embryogenesis of the inferior vena cava (IVC), anatomic variations are commonly encountered. Duplication of the IVC occurs in up to 2.8% of the population. Although typically asymptomatic, a duplicated IVC has important clinical implications when attempting caval filtration. We present the case of a 45-year-old male with Factor V Leiden and protein C deficiency, who required cessation of warfarin anticoagulation in preparation for cervical laminectomy. The patient had a duplicated IVC and required placement of a caval filter in each IVC.

### Inferior vena cava anomalies during laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection [^117TMkaM]. Journal of Endourology (2008). Low credibility.

To report our experience with congenital inferior vena cava (IVC) anomalies found during laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (LRPLND), we studied two men with a mean age of 31.5 years (range 26–37 years). These patients underwent LRPLND for nonseminomatous germ-cell tumors (NSGCT) between December 2003 and July 2004 using a four-port technique. A left IVC anomaly was found in both patients. The operations were performed with no serious immediate complications and minimal blood loss. Congenital IVC anomalies were identified intraoperatively, and a left-sided template was modified due to anatomic variation.

The mean operative time was 95 minutes (range 60–130 minutes). Both patients remain without tumor recurrence at a median of 24.5 months of follow-up (range 15–34 months).

Although uncommon, IVC anomalies must be considered when performing LRPLND because of potential complications. Preoperative studies are essential in surgical planning.

### Complete infrahepatic inferior vena cava occlusion presenting as congenital absence [^1116T4Be]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) occlusion may have widely varying clinical presentations that overlap with congenital IVC anomalies. Nevertheless, appropriate diagnosis, including differentiation from congenital absence, is mandatory. Endovascular therapy of chronic occlusions appears to yield results comparable to those of open repair. We report a case of infrahepatic IVC occlusion misdiagnosed as congenital absence of the IVC. The IVC occlusion was successfully recanalized and treated with angioplasty and stent placement.

### An interesting case: bilateral superior vena cava in a patient with end stage renal disease [^114VdgqY]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

A left superior vena cava, present in 0.5% of the population, results from the persistence of the embryonic left anterior cardinal vein and is usually considered a normal variant. We present our experience of incidentally discovering bilateral superior vena cava during routine evaluation of suspected intra-fistula stenosis in a dialysis-dependent patient with end-stage renal disease. Our images showed a left-sided venous structure draining into the heart with an independent right-sided superior vena cava, as evidenced by fluoroscopy. There was also evidence of a 60% intra-fistula stenosis.

Twin superior vena cava may be present as draining vessels independent of each other or as part of a duplicate caval drainage. While persistent left superior vena cava has been associated with disturbances of cardiac impulse formation and conduction, no such significant associations have been found in cases of bilateral superior vena cava. However, the variant anatomy may complicate efforts during central venous catheterization and alter flow characteristics. It could also be postulated that this anatomy may affect the maturation of an arteriovenous fistula.

### Management of acute lower extremity deep venous thrombosis in a patient with duplicated inferior vena cava and contraindication to anticoagulation: Case and review of the literature [^114JLz4C]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

In addition to the three treatment options listed, another potential intervention for duplicated inferior vena cava (DIVC) includes the placement of a single suprarenal inferior vena cava (IVC) filter post the confluence of DIVC. However, none of the reported cases used that intervention.

In our case, the indication for the IVC filter over anticoagulation was tracheal bleeding secondary to traumatic suction. IVC filters are typically deployed below the renal veins using the femoral or jugular approach, both of which can also be used to retrieve a recoverable filter. Venography is performed prior to filter placement to determine the approach, and in this case, it detected the anomaly, allowing the clinical team to develop the proper plan for our patient. As our patient had a continuation of the left IVC into the azygos and hemiazygos system, two infrarenal IVC filters were placed, one in each IVC. The reasons were the size of the IVCs, and the interventional radiologist determined that, technically, this would offer the highest chance of successful filter deployment while avoiding the longer procedure time, fluoroscopy time, and complications associated with coil embolization. Our management was similar to 11 out of 14 previously reported cases that deployed two IVC filters, therefore, this summary offers information for future clinicians regarding the management of this uncommon finding.

- **Learning points**:
	- Duplication of the inferior vena cava (DIVC) is due to an uncommon embryologic anatomic phenomenon that can have various clinical implications.
	- DIVC is often diagnosed incidentally during a venogram prior to IVC filter placement, but when suspected…

### CT appearances of congenital and acquired abnormalities of the superior vena cava [^114htgq1]. Clinical Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

A wide spectrum of congenital and acquired abnormalities can affect the superior vena cava (SVC). Congenital anomalies can present either as incidental findings or be associated with underlying cardiac abnormalities. These anomalies include left-sided or double SVCs and anomalous venous drainages. Acquired conditions involving the SVC, including SVC obstruction syndrome, can be secondary to extrinsic compression or intrinsic occlusion. The CT appearances, incidence, and associations of these conditions are discussed.

### Wilms tumor with inferior vena cava duplication: a rare case report [^112ryzhd]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

A 14-month-old female was referred to our hospital with a history of an enlarging abdominal mass noted by her parents for 3 days. Physical examination revealed an abdominal mass with clear and smooth margins extending from the right upper quadrant to the right hemipelvis. Routine blood tests were normal apart from mild anemia, and urine analysis did not show hematuria. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed a unilateral 10.8 × 7.2 × 9.2 cm solid tumor in the right kidney, whereas the contralateral kidney was normal. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a large lesion arising from the inferior aspect of the right kidney, occupying the right flank and extending across the midline. Enhanced CT detected duplication of the inferior vena cava (IVC) below the renal veins and compression and displacement of the right IVC caused by the enormous tumor [see Additional file 1].

- **Figure 1**: Axial, coronal, and three-dimensional reconstruction computed tomography scan with contrast showing a large mass in the right kidney, duplication of the inferior vena cava below the renal veins, and compression and displacement of the right IVC. The straight arrow denotes the right inferior vena cava, and the curved arrow the left inferior vena cava.

Neither intravascular extension nor invasion to adjacent organs and regional lymph nodes was detected by CT. Chest radiography was reported normal. With the presumptive diagnosis of Wilms tumor (WT), a right-sided radical nephrectomy was performed. Final pathology was consistent with favorable histology, stromal형

### Congenital anomalies of the venae cavae: Embryological origin, imaging features and report of three new variants [^111G8VEY]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Due to the complexity of their developmental stages, the venae cavae may undergo numerous congenital anomalies. We report all known abnormalities, differentiating between those of the superior vena cava and the azygos system, those of the inferior vena cava, and the complex anomalies affecting the venous system as a whole.

Moreover, we present three new variants: a right double inferior vena cava with azygos continuation of the posterior-medial vein; an agenesis of the superior vena cava with drainage through the azygos and hemiazygos veins to the inferior vena cava; and a double inferior vena cava with hemiazygos and azygos continuation of the left one.

### Inferior and superior vena cava reconstruction [^113KVBkN]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Obstructions of the superior and inferior vena cava are prevalent etiologies of deep venous obstruction, presenting a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from life-threatening conditions to asymptomatic states. The etiological diversity inherent to these central venous obstructions necessitates a subtle approach to their diagnosis and management. This discrepancy in clinical presentations emphasizes the importance of a differentiated diagnostic and therapeutic strategy, tailored to the specific form of vena cava obstruction encountered. This article aims to delineate the various manifestations of vena cava obstruction and encourages specific diagnostic and treatment pathways.

### Anomalous inferior vena cava associated with horseshoe kidney on multidetector computed tomography [^113a2pFo]. Clinical Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

We evaluated the prevalence of anomalous inferior vena cava (IVC) associated with 205 patients with horseshoe kidney (HSK) and 1,990 patients without HSK on multidetector computed tomography, comparing the prevalence between both groups. We identified anatomical variations of the IVC in 8 patients (3.9%) with HSK, observing the following types: 1 preisthmic IVC with retrocaval ureter, 4 double IVCs, 2 left IVCs, and 1 IVC with azygos continuation. In patients without HSK, anatomical variations were identified in 12 patients (0.6%): 8 double IVCs, 3 left IVCs, and 1 IVC with azygos continuation. Anomalous IVC was significantly more frequent in patients with HSK than in those without it.

### Unusual duplication anomaly of the inferior vena cava with normal drainage of the right IVC and hemiazygous continuation of the left IVC [^113vK4PD]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Duplication of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and other IVC anomalies have been well described in the literature. Although they are often discovered incidentally in patients without symptoms, these anomalies can have significant clinical implications and must be recognized when they occur. In most cases of a duplicated IVC, the right and left iliac veins drain into the right and left IVC, respectively, and the left IVC ends at the level of the left renal vein, subsequently draining into the right IVC. This study describes a unique case of duplicated IVC with hemiazygous continuation of the left-sided IVC and normal drainage of the right-sided IVC into the right atrium.

### Management of acute lower extremity deep venous thrombosis in a patient with duplicated inferior vena cava and contraindication to anticoagulation: Case and review of the literature [^1158sVps]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Duplication of the inferior vena cava (DIVC) is an uncommon embryological anatomic phenomenon.

We report a 63-year-old woman with extensive right leg deep vein thrombosis who required an IVC filter due to contraindications for anticoagulation, but was found to have DIVC which required the placement of two IVC filters with good result. This report will review and summarise past reports of DIVC management to provide a guide for future clinicians, and review the embryological development, diagnosis, and IVC filter placement options as they are based on the type of anatomic malformation encountered.

### Inferior vena cava anomalies and variations: imaging and rare clinical findings [^114xmXkS]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Specific inferior vena cava (IVC) variations and anomalies, including associated venous variations such as continuous azygos (CA) and hemiazygos (CHA) veins and other collateral pathways (deep, portal, median, and superficial), were recorded using a standardized form.

In the literature, there is no consensus about the classification of IVC anomalies and variations. A study on the development of the IVC in the domestic cat conducted in 1920 by Huntington and McLure proposed a theoretical classification system for IVC anomalies and suggested that there could be 14 theoretical variations. In their paper, the authors stated that 11 of these 14 variants had been observed either in cats or humans. However, they also noted additional anomalies in humans, such as abnormal development of the prerenal division of the IVC and persistence of the renal collar.

Today, the most frequently encountered and published anomalies include retroaortic left renal vein, left IVC, double IVC, circumaortic left renal vein, interruption of IVC with azygos and hemiazygos continuation, absence of the infrarenal IVC, and circumcaval ureter. Generally, the prevalence of IVC anomalies is reported as 0.5% worldwide. In the present pictorial essay, we summarize imaging findings of ten patients with frequent and infrequent IVC anomalies, including the absence of infrarenal IVC, left IVC, double IVC, interruption of IVC with CA, left retroaortic vein, and accessory continuous hemiazygos vein. Of these ten patients, five were men and five women, with a mean age of 45 (range: 11–65 years).

### A literature review and case series of DVT patients with absent IVC treated with thrombolysis [^116QhBbP]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Congenital absence of the inferior vena cava is related to deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in 5% of cases with no other risk factors. DVT is normally diagnosed by duplex ultrasound, whereas computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is required to visualize this absence and is often missed. This absence should be considered in young patients. There are many existing cases in the literature illustrating this link, but these patients were often managed conservatively with anticoagulation.

- **Case series**: We report five cases presenting with a DVT who were found to have an absent inferior vena cava after imaging. These cases were treated successfully with thrombolysis and consequently managed with lifelong anticoagulation, between January 2014 and January 2019.

- **Conclusions**: Anomalies of the inferior vena cava can cause unprovoked DVT. These anomalies are often incidental findings after CT but could change the management plan in these patients. Treatment can be with anticoagulants only, thrombolysis, thrombectomy, balloon angioplasty or stents, and long-term or lifelong anticoagulation to prevent DVT recurrence.

### The inferior vena cava: anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^113p2D4p]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

The inferior vena cava (IVC) forms through a complex process involving the fusion and regression of embryological veins, specifically the posterior cardinal, subcardinal, supracardinal, and vitelline veins. During the fourth week of embryological development, the right and left horns of the sinus venosus receive paired common cardinal, umbilical, and vitelline veins, which drain blood from general tissue, the placenta, and the yolk sac, respectively.

- **Embryological development of the IVC**:
	- The sinus venosus receives paired common cardinal, umbilical, and vitelline veins, draining blood from general tissue, the placenta, and the yolk sac, respectively.

	- The right hepatocardiac channel, highlighted in purple, is formed by the right vitelline vein and persists to become the hepatic IVC. Paired subcardinal (red) and supracardinal veins (green) emerge and form multiple anastomotic channels, including the intersubcardinal anastomoses, suprasubcardinal anastomoses, and the fusion between the right subcardinal vein (red) and the developing hepatic IVC (purple). As the embryo matures, some of these anastomoses regress.

	- This illustration highlights vessels that persist to form the mature IVC and its tributaries.

### The inferior vena cava: anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^113rimrR]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

At the same time, the cranial end of the right subcardinal vein forms the suprarenal segment of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and fuses with the developing hepatic IVC. Gonadal and suprarenal veins are also derived from the subcardinal veins. The caudal left supracardinal vein and left subcardinal veins regress, establishing right-sided dominance. Paired supracardinal veins and their anastomosis extend above the diaphragm to become the azygos and hemiazygos veins. Caudally, the right supracardinal vein persists as the infrarenal IVC, communicating with the paired iliac veins [Fig. 1c].

In summary, the mature IVC is composed of infrarenal (right supracardinal vein), renal (right suprasubcardinal and intersubcardinal anastomoses), suprarenal/infrahepatic (right subcardinal vein), and hepatic (vitelline veins) segments. Posterior cardinal veins persist as paired common iliac veins, while the supracardinal veins contribute to the azygos venous system.

- **Diagram description (Fig. 2)**: The mature IVC is composed of infrarenal (right supracardinal vein), renal (right suprasubcardinal and intersubcardinal anastomoses), suprarenal (right subcardinal vein), and hepatic (vitelline veins) segments. Renal and suprarenal segments are separated by the dashed line. Posterior cardinal veins persist as paired common iliac veins, which join to form the iliac confluence, while supracardinal veins contribute to the azygos venous system draining into the superior vena cava. The gonadal and suprarenal veins are derived from subcardinal veins.
