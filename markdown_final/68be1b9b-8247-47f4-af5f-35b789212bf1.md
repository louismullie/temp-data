## Question

tsh goal for graves disease patient taking antithyroid medications

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the TSH goal should be for a patient with Graves' disease who is being treated with antithyroid medications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether we are talking about treatment targets during therapy versus criteria for stopping therapy. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (ATA, ETA) say about TSH targets during titration and maintenance. Next, I will check special populations like pregnancy and pediatrics. After that, I need to review the role of TRAb in deciding when to stop therapy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical answer and clarify common pitfalls in interpreting TSH during treatment.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: in Graves' hyperthyroidism treated with antithyroid drugs, the therapeutic objective is biochemical euthyroidism, but TSH is often misleadingly suppressed early in therapy because pituitary thyrotroph suppression can persist for months even after free T4 normalizes, so I should not overinterpret a low TSH in the first few months of treatment [^112mXRxo].

> I will now examine the monitoring cadence and early targets. Wait, let me verify the timing of labs and what to prioritize: guidelines recommend checking free T4 and total T3 about 2–6 weeks after starting methimazole, adjusting the dose to normalize free hormones, and recognizing that TSH may remain suppressed for several months. Thus, early decisions should be driven by free T4 and T3 rather than TSH, with TSH becoming more informative once free hormones are stable and the patient is on a maintenance dose [^112mXRxo] [^1141NEjw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a numeric TSH target during therapy. I should confirm whether guidelines specify a number or a range. The ATA and ETA emphasize titrating to a euthyroid state using free T4 and T3 while allowing TSH to recover on its own; they do not prescribe a specific TSH number during active titration, and they caution that TSH can lag for months, so the practical goal is normalization of free T4 and T3 with the lowest effective methimazole dose, while TSH is expected to drift into the reference range over time as suppression resolves [^112mXRxo].

> Let me consider the maintenance phase. Once the patient is euthyroid on a stable, minimal dose, I should double-check the recommended monitoring interval and whether TSH is now useful. Guidelines suggest extending labs to every 2–3 months once euthyroid on a minimal dose, and in long-term therapy beyond 18 months, intervals can be increased to about every 6 months; at this stage, a normal TSH within the laboratory reference range is expected and appropriate, though still interpreted alongside free T4 and T3 to ensure stability [^112mXRxo].

> Next, I should review when to stop therapy, because that is where TSH becomes pivotal. I need to ensure I anchor this to the strongest recommendations: both ATA and ETA advise continuing methimazole for approximately 12–18 months and then discontinuing if TSH is normal and TRAb has normalized, as this combination predicts higher remission likelihood; conversely, if TRAb remains elevated, extending therapy or choosing definitive therapy can be considered [^116AbUPH] [^116JeDX7] [^112YhD1A] [^115sPa79].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or pediatric? I should confirm those nuances. In pregnancy, the maternal target is not a normal TSH; rather, the goal is to use the lowest effective ATD dose to keep maternal free T4 at or just above the pregnancy-specific reference range while accepting that TSH will often be suppressed, with closer monitoring early in treatment and TRAb assessment guiding fetal risk later in gestation [^1166CFcV] [^114AHVaJ] [^115rmtXB]. In children and adolescents, TSH suppression can persist for months after free T4 normalizes, so I should avoid overreacting to a low TSH if free hormones are controlled and focus on clinical and free hormone trends during titration [^1161CEte].

> I should double-check the role of TRAb because it modifies both duration and the chance of remission. Measuring TRAb before stopping therapy is recommended, as normalization portends better remission; persistent positivity argues for continued ATD or definitive therapy, and emerging risk tools that incorporate TRAb with clinical variables can further stratify recurrence risk, though these are adjunctive rather than replacing guideline-based decisions [^114hJbcX] [^112KpuEr] [^115V7jH8].

> Let me synthesize the practical answer now. During active titration with antithyroid drugs, there is no specific TSH numeric target; instead, titrate methimazole to normalize free T4 and T3 while anticipating TSH suppression to resolve gradually, then maintain on the lowest effective dose with periodic labs. Once stable and approaching 12–18 months, a normal TSH within the lab reference range becomes a key criterion for considering discontinuation, but only alongside normalization of TRAb, which together predict remission; outside pregnancy, a normal TSH is generally 0.4–4.0 mIU/L depending on the assay, but the actionable goal is "within the reference range" rather than a single number during maintenance and as a stopping rule [^112mXRxo] [^116AbUPH] [^116JeDX7] [^112JaoNb].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied a universal TSH target of 2.5 mIU/L during therapy. That would be incorrect outside specific contexts like certain pregnancy scenarios or hypothyroidism management, so I should correct that and reaffirm that the euthyroid target during ATD therapy is best operationalized as normal free T4 and T3 on a minimal dose with TSH allowed to normalize over time, culminating in a normal TSH plus negative TRAb before stopping treatment [^111ApyFT] [^112JaoNb] [^116AbUPH] [^112KpuEr].

---

The TSH goal for Graves' disease patients on antithyroid drugs is to **normalize TSH within the laboratory reference range** (typically 0.4–4.0 mIU/L) [^112JaoNb] while maintaining free T4 and T3 at the low-normal range. TSH normalization is the key biochemical endpoint for **remission** [^112KpuEr] and guides tapering or discontinuation of antithyroid therapy after 12–18 months [^116AbUPH] if TSH and TRAb are normal [^116JeDX7]. TSH may remain suppressed for months after free T4 normalizes, so **early monitoring should prioritize free T4 and T3** [^112mXRxo], with TSH guiding long-term maintenance and discontinuation decisions [^113tdQeH].

---

## Clinical significance of TSH normalization

TSH normalization is a critical biochemical endpoint in Graves' disease management, reflecting restoration of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and indicating biochemical remission. Persistent TSH suppression suggests ongoing thyrotoxicosis or incomplete disease control, whereas normalization indicates effective suppression of thyroid hormone synthesis and release [^116JeDX7].

---

## Recommended TSH target range

The primary goal of antithyroid drug therapy in Graves' disease is to **achieve and maintain TSH within the laboratory reference range**, typically 0.4–4.0 mIU/L [^112JaoNb]. This range aligns with the general population's normal TSH values and serves as a standard benchmark for euthyroidism [^1119MaBD].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of antithyroid drug therapy

Regular monitoring of thyroid function tests is essential to guide therapy adjustments and ensure TSH normalization. The following schedule is recommended:

- **Initial monitoring**: Assess serum free T4 and total T3 every 2–6 weeks after initiating antithyroid drug therapy [^112mXRxo]. TSH may remain suppressed for several months after free T4 normalization, so free T4 and T3 are the primary early indicators of response [^1161CEte].

- **Maintenance monitoring**: Once euthyroidism is achieved, monitor thyroid function tests every 2–3 months [^112mXRxo]. Adjust the antithyroid drug dose to maintain free T4 and T3 at the low-normal range, allowing TSH to normalize gradually [^112mXRxo].

- **Long-term monitoring**: If long-term antithyroid drug therapy is continued beyond 18 months, monitoring intervals can be extended to every 6 months [^112mXRxo].

---

## Factors influencing TSH normalization

Several factors influence the time course and likelihood of TSH normalization in Graves' disease:

- **Disease severity**: Higher initial free T4 and T3 levels, larger goiter size, and higher TSH receptor antibody (TRAb) titers are associated with delayed TSH normalization and higher relapse risk [^notfound].

- **Patient demographics**: Younger age, female sex, and non-smoking status are associated with higher remission rates and faster TSH normalization [^notfound].

- **Treatment duration**: Longer antithyroid drug therapy duration (12–18 months) is associated with higher remission rates and sustained TSH normalization [^notfound].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with TSH normalization

Achieving TSH normalization is associated with several positive clinical outcomes, including:

- **Remission**: Normalization of TSH, free T4, and T3 for at least one year after discontinuing antithyroid drug therapy is defined as remission, with reported remission rates of 20–30% after 12–18 months of therapy [^112YhD1A].

- **Reduced relapse risk**: Sustained TSH normalization significantly reduces the risk of relapse after antithyroid drug withdrawal [^116NMdfZ].

- **Improved quality of life**: Restoration of euthyroidism improves symptoms, cardiovascular health, bone density, and overall quality of life [^111KjnMS].

---

## Special considerations

Certain clinical scenarios require **individualized TSH targets** and monitoring strategies:

- **Pregnancy**: During pregnancy, the goal is to maintain maternal free T4 at the upper limit of normal or slightly above, using the lowest effective antithyroid drug dose. TSH may remain suppressed, and frequent monitoring is essential [^1166CFcV].

- **Elderly patients**: In elderly patients, cautious titration of antithyroid drugs is recommended to avoid overtreatment and iatrogenic hypothyroidism [^notfound].

- **Patients with cardiovascular disease**: Beta-blockers may be used concurrently to control symptoms while antithyroid drugs normalize thyroid function [^notfound].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Tsh target** | **Monitoring frequency** | **Additional considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| General adult patients | 0.4–4.0 mIU/L | Every 2–3 months | Adjust antithyroid drug dose to maintain free T4 and T3 at low-normal range |
| Pregnancy | Suppressed TSH acceptable | Every 2–4 weeks | Maintain free T4 at upper limit of normal or slightly above |
| Long-term therapy (> 18 months) | 0.4–4.0 mIU/L | Every 6 months | Consider TRAb measurement to guide discontinuation |
| Remission criteria | Normal TSH, free T4, and T3 for ≥ 1 year after discontinuation | N/A | TRAb normalization increases likelihood of remission |

The TSH goal for Graves' disease patients on antithyroid drugs is to **achieve and maintain TSH within the laboratory reference range** (0.4–4.0 mIU/L) [^112JaoNb], with therapy adjustments based on regular monitoring of free T4 and T3. TSH normalization is a key indicator of biochemical remission and guides decisions regarding antithyroid drug withdrawal and long-term management [^112YhD1A].

### Efficacy of anti-thyroid medications in patients with Graves' disease [^113HD8Qu]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study's findings demonstrated that a significant proportion of patients achieved remission with ATD. Patients with lower levels of free T4 and TRAb at diagnosis had higher remission rates. The female gender, mild ophthalmopathy, and shorter durations of thionamide treatment are factors associated with remission. Conversely, higher thyroid uptake on 99mTc-pertechnetate scan at baseline and longer ATD treatment duration were associated with an increased risk of relapse. These findings have implications for personalized treatment approaches and highlight the necessity of monitoring specific biomarkers and clinical characteristics to optimize treatment outcomes and long-term prognosis in GD patients.

### Strategies of radioiodine therapy for Graves' disease [^114CExBM]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2002). Low credibility.

Several therapeutic options are available for the treatment of Graves' disease (GD), including long-term antithyroid drug medication (ATD), near-total resection (NTR) and radioiodine therapy (RIT). These treatments are used with different frequencies depending on geographical location, size of the goitre, age of the patient and experience of the physician. It should be noted that RIT is still being applied more frequently in the United States than in Europe. Despite the fact that RIT was introduced as long ago as 1941, several questions are still the subject of debate: Should a fixed dose or a calculated dose be used. If the dose is calculated, how many Grays (Gy) should be delivered to the thyroid? What is the goal of RIT in GD? Which factors, including ATD, influence the outcome of RIT? Is RIT appropriate in GD with Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO)? Although not all these questions have been answered yet, conclusions can be derived regarding a general strategy for use of RIT in GD. As with surgery, the goal of RIT in GD is euthyroidism with or without L-thyroxine medication. There is a clear advantage of dose calculation over use of a fixed dose because the only factor influencing the outcome is the dose delivered to a certain thyroid volume. To minimise recurrent hyperthyroidism, an ablative approach using a delivered dose of 250 Gy is widely accepted. Beside pretherapeutic T(3) levels, thyroid volume and 24-h thyroid uptake, ATD may influence the outcome of RIT. Today it is accepted by most thyroidologists that, if ATD medication is necessary in overt hyperthyroidism, it should be withdrawn at least 2 days before RIT. In patients with GD and GO, RIT may worsen GO. If RIT is performed in GO it should be done under a 3-month steroid medication regimen. In conclusion, RIT can be considered an appropriate and cost-effective therapy in GD, although the decision regarding treatment should be taken on an individual basis, paying due respect to the course and severity of disease, the presence of GO and, last but not least, the wishes of the patient.

### Diagnosis and management of Grave's disease: a global overview [^116EYyFb]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by goitre, hyperthyroidism and, in 25% of patients, Graves ophthalmopathy. The hyperthyroidism is caused by thyroid hypertrophy and stimulation of function, resulting from interaction of anti-TSH-receptor antibodies (TRAb) with the TSH receptor on thyroid follicular cells. Measurements of serum levels of TRAb and thyroid ultrasonography represent the most important diagnostic tests for Graves disease. Management of the condition currently relies on antithyroid drugs, which mainly inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis, or ablative treatments ((131)I-radiotherapy or thyroidectomy) that remove or decrease thyroid tissue. None of these treatments targets the disease process, and patients with treated Graves disease consequently experience either a high rate of recurrence, if receiving antithyroid drugs, or lifelong hypothyroidism, after ablative therapy. Geographical differences in the use of these therapies exist, partially owing to the availability of skilled thyroid surgeons and suitable nuclear medicine units. Novel agents that might act on the disease process are currently under evaluation in preclinical or clinical studies, but evidence of their efficacy and safety is lacking.

### What is the best definitive treatment for Graves' disease? A systematic review of the existing literature [^116saTAT]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for Graves' disease (GD) include any of the following modalities: (131)I therapy, antithyroid medication, or thyroidectomy. No in-depth analysis has been performed comparing the treatment options, even though a single treatment option seems to be universally accepted.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature was performed to examine contemporary literature between 2001 and 2011 evaluating the management options of GD. We compiled retrospective and prospective studies analyzing surgery and radioactive iodine. Outcomes of interest included postoperative hypothyroidism, euthyroidism, and persistent or recurrent hyperthyroidism without supplementation. Success was defined as postoperative euthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Failure was defined as persistent or recurrent hyperthyroidism.

Results

Of the 14,245 patients, 4,546 underwent surgery [3,158 patients had subtotal thyroidectomy (STT) and 1,388 had total thyroidectomy (TT)] and 9,699 had radioactive iodine. The radioactive iodine group consisted of 2,383 patients receiving 1–10 mCi, 1,558 patients receiving 11–15 mCi, 516 patients receiving > 15 mCi, and 5,242 patients receiving an unspecified amount. Surgery was found to be 3.44 times more likely to be successful than radioactive iodine (p < 0.001). STT and TT were found to be 2.33 and 94.45 times more likely to be successful than radioactive iodine (p < 0.001), respectively.

Conclusions

On the basis of the outcomes analyzed, surgery appears to be the most successful in the management of GD, with TT being the preferred surgical option.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^112JaoNb]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Thyroid hormone replacement targets — serum thyrotropin (TSH) in primary hypothyroidism should be within the reference range and is the therapeutic target, with "a value within the reference range (0.4–4.0 mIU/L) should be considered the therapeutic target". In subclinical hypothyroidism, "an increase in mortality has been observed in individuals with TSH levels > 10mIU/L, with potential effects of values > 7mIU/L", and "fewer ischemic heart disease events were associated with treatment of SCH in those under age 70 years". Aiming for "a target TSH in the lower tertile of the laboratory reference range" has been proposed, but "a randomized cross-over study of 8 weeks' duration did not show changes in well-being or quality of life with TSH titration within the normal and subnormal range". After thyroidectomy, when T3 is used as a target it "is reasonable to tailor therapy to achieve circulating levels of T3 similar to the pre-surgery values while maintaining the TSH value within the range of normal", and during LT4 therapy "Levels of FT4 above the reference range are often observed…; no evidence yet exists indicating that this condition is associated with adverse events or poor outcome".

### New therapeutic horizons for Graves' hyperthyroidism [^116Un3xX]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Graves' hyperthyroidism is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies that stimulate the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), resulting in uncontrolled secretion of excessive thyroid hormone. Conventional treatments, including antithyroid medication, radioiodine, or surgery have remained largely unchanged for the past 70 years and either lack efficacy for many patients, or result in lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy, in the case of the latter 2 options. The demand for new therapeutic options, combined with greater insight into basic immunobiology, has led to the emergence of novel approaches to treat Graves' hyperthyroidism. The current therapies under investigation include biologics, small molecules, and peptide immunomodulation. There is a growing focus on TSHR-specific treatment modalities, which carry the advantage of eliciting a specific, targeted approach, with the aim of avoiding disruption of the functioning immune system. These therapies present a new opportunity to supersede the inadequate treatments currently available for some Graves' patients, offering hope of successful restoration of euthyroidism without the need for ongoing therapy. Several of these therapeutic options have the potential to translate into clinical practice in the near future. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the recent advances and various stages of development of the novel therapeutic approaches to treat Graves' hyperthyroidism.

### Relapse of Graves' disease after successful outcome of antithyroid drug therapy: results of a prospective randomized study on the use of levothyroxine [^116NMdfZ]. Thyroid (2002). Low credibility.

Antithyroid drugs are effective in restoring euthyroidism in Graves' disease, but many patients experience relapse after withdrawal. Prevention of recurrence would therefore be a desirable goal. In a prospective study, patients with successful outcome of 12 to 15 months antithyroid drug therapy were stratified for risk factors and randomly assigned to receive levothyroxine in a variable thyrotropin (TSH)-suppressive dose for 2 years or no treatment. The levothyroxine group was randomized to continue or discontinue levothyroxine after 1 year. End points included relapse of overt hyperthyroidism. Of 346 patients with Graves' disease enrolled 225 were euthyroid 4 weeks after antithyroid drug withdrawal and were randomly assigned to receive levothyroxine (114 patients) or no treatment (controls, 111 patients). Of those not randomized, 39 patients showed early relapse within 4 weeks, 61 endogenous TSH suppression, 7 TSH elevation, and 14 had to be excluded. Dropout rate during the study were 13.3%. Kaplan-Meier analyses showed relapse rates to be similar in the levothyroxine group (20% after 1 year, 32% after 2 years) and the randomized controls (18%, 24%), whereas relapses were significantly more frequent in the follow-up group of patients with endogenously suppressed TSH (33%, 49%). Levothyroxine therapy did not influence TSH-receptor antibody, nor did it reduce goiter size. The best prognostic marker available was basal TSH determined 4 weeks after withdrawal of antithyroid drugs (posttreatment TSH). The study demonstrates that levothyroxine does not prevent relapse of hyperthyroidism after successful restoration of euthyroid function by antithyroid drugs and characterizes posttreatment TSH as a main prognostic marker.

### Management of Graves' disease: an overview and comparison of clinical practice guidelines with actual practice trends [^111XStBF]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Over the last century, much has been learned about the pathogenesis, manifestations, and management of Graves' disease leading to the establishment of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. The joint clinical practice guidelines from the American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists give recommendations on both the diagnosis and treatment of hyperthyroidism. A survey of clinicians performed that same year, however, revealed that current practices diverge from these recently published guidelines in multiple areas. These differences will need to be assessed serially to determine the impact of the guidelines on future clinical practice and perhaps vice versa.

### Approach to the patient considering long-term antithyroid drug therapy for Graves' disease [^117FySjy]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Antithyroid drugs (ATD) are the treatment of choice for the majority of patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism worldwide. However, relapse of hyperthyroidism after withdrawal of arbitrarily chosen conventional 12 to 18 months of therapy is very common. In the last 2 decades, many studies have shown that treatment with long-term ATD (LT-ATD) is effective and safe in the maintenance of euthyroidism. In addition, it has been reported that serum TSH receptor antibody may not decrease permanently before 5 to 6 years of ATD treatment, and clinical trials have shown that ≥ 5 years of ATD treatment is accompanied by remission in the majority of patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism. The objective of this article is to discuss the optimal time to withdraw of conventional ATD therapy, to illustrate the decision-making of the management of recurrent hyperthyroidism, to review the proper management of LT-ATD, and to generate suggestions for lifelong ATD treatment by discussing 4 scenarios of decision-making in patients with Graves' disease.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112MTEEc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening for thyroid dysfunction — population is nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults; recommendation is "No recommendation. Grade: I statement (insufficient evidence)". Risk factors for an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level include female sex, advancing age, white race, type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome, family history of thyroid disease, goiter, previous hyperthyroidism, and external-beam radiation in the head and neck area; risk factors for a low TSH level include female sex; advancing age; black race; low iodine intake; personal or family history of thyroid disease; and ingestion of iodine-containing drugs, such as amiodarone. The primary screening test is serum TSH testing, and multiple tests over 3 to 6 months should be performed to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 level) and overt (abnormal T4 level) thyroid dysfunction. Hypothyroidism is treated with oral T4 monotherapy (levothyroxine sodium); consensus is lacking on the appropriate point for clinical intervention, especially for TSH levels < 10.0 mIU/L. Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications (e.g., methimazole) or nonreversible thyroid ablation therapy (e.g., radioactive iodine or surgery), and treatment is generally recommended for patients with a TSH level that is undetectable or < 0.1 mIU/L, particularly those with overt Graves disease or nodular thyroid disease. The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

### Radioiodine therapy versus antithyroid medications for Graves' disease [^11121NKU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. Both antithyroid medications and radioiodine are commonly used treatments but their frequency of use varies between regions and countries. Despite the commonness of the diagnosis, any possible differences between the two treatments with respect to long-term outcomes remain unknown.

Objectives

To assess the effects of radioiodine therapy versus antithyroid medications for Graves' disease.

Search Methods

We performed a systematic literature search in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and EMBASE and the trials registers ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. The date of the last search was September 2015 for all databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of radioiodine therapy versus antithyroid medications for Graves' disease with at least two years follow-up.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance. One author carried out screening for inclusion, data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment and a second author checked this. We presented data not suitable for meta-analysis as descriptive data. We analysed the overall quality of evidence utilising the GRADE instrument.

Main Results

We included two RCTs involving 425 adult participants with Graves' disease in this review. Altogether 204 participants were randomised to radioiodine therapy and 221 to methimazole therapy. A single dose of radioiodine was administered. The duration of methimazole medication was 18 months. The period of follow-up was at least two years, depending on the outcome measured. For most outcome measures risk of bias was low; for the outcomes health-related quality of life as well as development and worsening of Graves' ophthalmopathy risks of performance bias and detection bias were high in at least one of the two RCTs. Health-related quality of life appeared to be similar in the radioiodine and methimazole treatment groups, however no quantitative data were reported (425 participants; 2 trials; low quality evidence). The development and worsening of Graves' ophthalmopathy was observed in 76 of 202 radioiodine-treated participants (38%) and in 40 of 215 methimazole-treated participants (19%): risk ratio (RR) 1.94 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40 to 2.70); 417 participants; 2 trials; low quality evidence. A total of 35% to 56% of radioiodine-treated participants and 42% of participants treated with methimazole were smokers, which is associated with the risk of worsening or development of Graves' ophthalmopathy. Euthyroidism was not achieved by any participant being treated with radioiodine compared with 64/68 (94%) of participants after methimazole treatment (112 participants; 1 trial). In this trial thyroxine therapy was not introduced early in both treatment arms to avoid hypothyroidism. Recurrence of hyperthyroidism (relapse) in favour of radioiodine treatment showed a RR of 0.20 (95% CI 0.01 to 2.66); P value = 0.22; 417 participants; 2 trials; very low quality evidence. Heterogeneity was high (I² = 91%) and the RRs were 0.61 or 0.06 with non-overlapping CIs. Adverse events other than development of worsening of Graves' ophthalmopathy for radioiodine therapy were hypothyroidism (39 of 41 participants (95%) compared with 0% of participants receiving methimazole, however thyroxine treatment to avoid hypothyroidism was not introduced early in the radioiodine group - 104 participants; 1 trial; very low quality evidence) and drug-related adverse events for methimazole treatment (23 of 215 participants (11%) reported adverse effects likely related to methimazole therapy - 215 participants; 2 trials; very low quality evidence). The outcome measures all-cause mortality and bone mineral density were not reported in the included trials. One trial (174 participants) reported socioeconomic effects: costs based on the official hospital reimbursement system in Sweden for patients without relapse and methimazole treatment were USD 1126/1164 (young/older methimazole group) and for radioiodine treatment USD 1862. Costs for patients with relapse and methimazole treatment were USD 2284/1972 (young/older methimazole group) and for radioiodine treatment USD 2760.

Authors' Conclusions

The only antithyroid drug investigated in the two included trials was methimazole, which might limit the applicability of our findings with regard to other compounds such as propylthiouracil. Results from two RCTs suggest that radioiodine treatment is associated with an increased risk of Graves' ophthalmopathy. Our findings suggest some benefit from radioiodine treatment for recurrence of hyperthyroidism (relapse) but there is uncertainty about the magnitude of the effect size.

Rating of the recommendations — GRADE approach and strength labels: The task force elected to rate the recommendations according to the system developed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (Group). The strength of a recommendation is indicated as a strong recommendation (for or against) that applies to most patients in most circumstances with benefits of action clearly outweighing the risks and burdens (or vice versa), or a weak recommendation or a suggestion that may not be appropriate for every patient, depending on context, patient values, and preferences, and the quality of evidence is indicated as low-quality evidence, moderate-quality evidence, or high-quality evidence. In several instances, the evidence was insufficient to recommend for or against a test or a treatment, and the task force made a statement labeled "no recommendation", and each recommendation is preceded by a description of the evidence and, in some cases, followed by a remarks section including technical suggestions on issues such as dosing and monitoring.

Results

Study sample characteristics

Out of 227 patients diagnosed with GD during the study period, 189 patients met the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. The majority of the study sample (72%) was female, and the patients' ages ranged from 18 to 80 years old. Around 71.3% of the study sample had mild Graves' ophthalmopathy. The TRAb titer ranged from 0.9 to 36 Iu/l. The median thyroid uptake on the 99mTc-pertechnetate scan was 10.0 (4.20, 16.69), consistent with GD diagnosis. The median follow-up period for the patients was 22.0 months (9, 36). All the patients except one were treated with methimazole with a median initial dose of 15 mg (10, 20) with gradual titration as per the treating endocrinologist. Table 1 shows the study sample's clinical characteristics.

### New therapeutic horizons for Graves' hyperthyroidism [^113ejbie]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

ESSENTIAL POINTS

The conventional therapeutic options for Graves' disease have not improved over the past 70 years, despite substantial unmet clinical need and a significant lack of efficacy for many patients.
The demand for innovative therapeutic options has led to the emergence of novel approaches in the treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism, including biologic, small molecule, and peptide immunomodulation, several of which have translational potential into clinical practice in the near future.
Targeting the direct cause of hyperthyroidism in Graves' disease using TSHR-specific modalities, has a clear advantage in providing a targeted approach while avoiding disruption of a functioning immune system.
The introduction of novel therapeutics may lead to the restoration of a euthyroid state without the requirement for ongoing therapy, but the potential risk of immunocompromise and cost implications needs careful consideration.

The therapeutic options available for patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism have remained largely unchanged for the past 70 years, despite the current treatments having either limited efficacy or significant drawbacks. The classical approach to treating Graves' hyperthyroidism involves the administration of antithyroid drugs to block thyroid hormone synthesis, or alternatively, destruction or removal of the thyroid by radioiodine or surgery. Unfortunately, relapse occurs in over half of adults after stopping antithyroid drugs, and the lack of functional thyroid tissue following definitive treatment with radioiodine or surgery results in hypothyroidism with a lifelong requirement for levothyroxine replacement and associated clinical and biochemical monitoring. Patients with active Graves' orbitopathy (GO) are frequently managed with high-dose glucocorticoids, a treatment that has also been the mainstay of therapy for more than 50 years. Unfortunately, significant patient dissatisfaction with outcome and a reduced quality of life remains a concern despite improved surgical rehabilitation, and advances in this field are the subject of a recent review. This review summarizes the emergence of novel targeted therapies that are paving the way for a new era in the treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism.

### Antithyroid drug regimen for treating Graves' hyperthyroidism [^114GoVxz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Antithyroid drugs are widely used in the therapy of hyperthyroidism. There are wide variations in the dose, regimen or duration of treatment used by health professionals.

Objectives

To assess the effects of dose, regimen and duration of antithyroid drug therapy for Graves' hyperthyroidism.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Central), MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, CINAHL, HEALTHSTAR, Current Controlled Trials and reference lists. We contacted investigators and hand searched conference abstracts. Most recent search: June 2002.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials of antithyroid medication for Graves' hyperthyroidism were used.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial allocation to included, excluded and awaiting assessment categories was made by consensus. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Pooling of data for primary outcomes, and select exploratory analyses were undertaken.

Main Results

Nineteen randomised trials involving 2233 participants were included. Overall the quality of trials as reported was poor; specifically in terms of allocation concealment, assessor blinding and loss to follow-up. Four trials examined the effect of duration of therapy on relapse rates of Graves' hyperthyroidism. In one trial using the Titration regimen, longer duration therapy (18 months) had significantly fewer relapses (37% vs 58%) than six month therapy (Odds ratio (OR) = 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.96). In one quasi-randomised trial using the Block-Replace regimen, there was no significant difference between the six and 12 month (relapses rates 41% versus 35%) arms of the study. Extending the duration of therapy to over 18 months was not associated with improved relapse rates (Peto OR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.43). Ten trials examined the effect of Block-Replace versus Titration regime. Relapse rates were similar in both groups at 54% in the Block-Replace group and 58% in the Titration group (Peto OR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.10). Participants reporting rashes (11% versus 5%) and withdrawing due to side effects (16% versus 9%) were significantly higher in the Block-Replace group compared to the Titration group respectively. Three studies considered the addition of thyroxine after initial therapy with antithyroid drugs. There was significant heterogeneity between the studies and the difference between the two groups were not significant (Odds ratio = 0.58, 95% CI 0.05 to 6.21).

Reviewers' Conclusions

The evidence (based on three studies) suggests that the optimal duration of antithyroid drug therapy for the Titration regimen is 12 to 18 months. The six month Block-Replace regimen was found to be as effective as the 12 month treatment in one quasi-randomised study. The Titration (low dose) regimen had fewer adverse effects than the Block-Replace (high dose) regimen and was no less effective in trials (based on 10 trials) of equal duration. The incidence of hypothyroidism was not reported and there were no deaths in the study populations.

### Ten year outcome of anti-thyroid drug treatment for first episode Graves' thyrotoxicosis: the predictive importance of TRAb [^113a4MHc]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

In contrast to other reports, we did not find thyroid hormone levels at presentation to be significantly associated with recurrence risk. Relatively straightforward (and easily measured) metrics such as time to normalisation of TSH and fT4 were associated with recurrence risk but not independently of TRAb. We did not have reliable access to metrics which have previously been associated with recurrence risk such as goitre size, ophtlamopathy and smoking status. Incorporating multiple features into a risk score improves prognostic performance but arguably not decisively enough to influence management beyond consideration of TRAb alone. More sophisticated scoring systems which incorporate HLA subtypes appear to have superior prognostic performance but these have not, to date, been incorporated into routine clinical practice. This study specifically reports outcomes in people who have completed a course of ATD and, to broaden generalisability, it would be of value to assess long‐term outcomes in a cohort including all individuals commencing ATD, not just those deemed suitable for discontinuation at 12–18 months. This was an evaluation of a single centre's outcomes which raises questions of generalisability but outcomes are, in general, broadly consistent with the current literature.

The key strength of this study is robust assessment of thyroid outcomes over a long period of follow‐up. The information presented is likely to be relevant to healthcare professionals and patients when considering treatment options, including predicted time course of recurrence and chances of avoiding long‐term medication.

### How do you approach the problem of TSH elevation in a patient on high-dose thyroid hormone replacement? [^114JDqUJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Persistent elevation of TSH levels in patients under treatment for hypothyroidism is a relatively common clinical problem in endocrinology practice. The most common cause for this phenomenon is poor patient compliance with their thyroid hormone tablets. In the compliant patient, however, multiple aetiologies are possible and a methodological and stepwise approach to the patient's problem will uniformly identify a cause, or at least a resolution.

### Screening and management of thyroid disease… [^111TPnZE]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Persons found to have subclinical hyperthyroidism are at increased risk for atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis and progression to overt disease. The optimal management of patients without goiter or ocular findings of Graves' disease is uncertain, but the author recommends repeat measurements of TSH, T 4 and T 3 every six to 12 months. Persons with subclinical hypothyroidism are at increased risk for hypercholesterolemia and progression to overt hypothyroidism. The effectiveness of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is uncertain; three small unrandomized trials yielded conflicting results. Observation is appropriate for persons with TSH levels between 5 and 10 μU per mL.

A TSH of greater than 10 μU per mL or a high antithyroid antibody titer is associated with an increased risk of complications, and levothyroxine therapy may be appropriate. The author notes that previous studies suggested that the addition of thyroid hormone to long-term methimazole or propylthiouracil therapy in patients with Graves' disease increased the likelihood of remission when antithyroid drug therapy was discontinued. More recently, several large randomized studies have failed to confirm that levothyroxine promotes remission in patients receiving antithyroid therapy. The author believes the concomitant use of thyroid hormone in these patients is unjustified, especially in light of the higher likelihood of serious adverse effects with higher doses of antithyroid drugs. Evidence supports the use of methimazole over propylthiouracil. Methimazole has been associated with higher cure rates, and this agent requires less frequent doses and may carry a lower risk for agranulocytosis.

In the author's opinion, a one-year course of TSH-suppressive therapy can be started in younger patients and continued only if nodule size has decreased. In older patients, in whom thyroid supplementation may decrease bone mineral density or increase the risk of atrial fibrillation and cardiac hypertrophy, the potential adverse effects of TSH suppression may outweigh any benefit.

### Hyperthyroidism… [^111JYzWe]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

One RCT found a similar proportion of persons who relapsed and who became euthyroid between high-and low-dose thiamazole. However, it found that adverse effects were lower with titration regimens. There have been concerns about bone marrow suppression, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis with antithyroid drugs. The doses of antithyroid drugs reported in the studies are higher than are generally used in practice. Thyroidectomy We found no RCTs comparing surgery with placebo in persons with hyperthyroidism, although there is consensus that treatment is beneficial. One systematic review and subsequent RCT found that total thyroidectomy decreased hyperthyroidism and increased euthyroidism and hypothyroidism compared with subtotal thyroidectomy.

However, another subsequent RCT found no significant difference among bilateral subtotal, unilateral total, and contralateral subtotal, and total thyroidectomy in improvement in Graves' ophthalmopathy. What are the effects of treatments for subclinical hyperthyroidism. LIKELY TO BE BENEFICIAL Any Antithyroid Treatment One controlled clinical trial found that thyroid-stimulating hormone and bone mineral density were higher in women given radioiodine compared with no treatment in women with no compression symptoms from a nodular goiter. It found that low serum TSH concentrations were associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation at 10 years, based on data from screening studies, estimated that each year 1. 5 percent of women and

Antithyroid drug dosing regimens for methimazole (MMI), carbimazole, and propylthiouracil (PTU): MMI and carbimazole, which is rapidly converted to MMI in the serum (10 mg of carbimazole is metabolized to approximately 6 mg of MMI), work in a virtually identical fashion. At the start of MMI therapy, higher doses are advised (10–20 mg daily) to restore euthyroidism, followed by titration to a maintenance level (generally 5–10 mg daily). PTU is usually administered two or three times daily, starting with 50–150 mg three times daily, with reduction to a maintenance PTU dose of 50 mg two or three times daily as thyroid function normalizes. Higher-dose "block and replace" combinations with l-thyroxine are not generally recommended, as they have been shown to result in a higher rate of ATD side effects.

### British thyroid association survey of Graves' disease management in the UK [^112mfCLW]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Graves' disease affects about 0.5%–1.0% of the population, and is predominantly more common in women. The pathological hallmark is the presence of circulating thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TRAbs) which induce hyperthyroidism through stimulation of its receptor on the thyroid cells. Uncontrolled hyperthyroidism carries significant morbidity and exerts a toll on quality of life and reproductive outcomes. About 10%–30% of patients with Graves' disease have thyroid eye disease (TED) which affects physical and psychological well‐being. In addition, hyperthyroidism increases cardiovascular risk including cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and strokes. In recent decades, the diagnosis and monitoring of Graves' disease has been simplified by the use of sensitive TRAb assays, together with automated assays for measuring thyroid hormones, that is, free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Current treatment options, namely antithyroid drugs (ATD), radioactive iodine (RAI) and thyroidectomy, have been used successfully for decades, with established efficacy and side effect profiles. More recently, insights have emerged on treatment related outcomes including cardiovascular disease, quality of life and feto‐maternal health.

Antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy — monitoring schedule and dose adjustment: An assessment of serum free T4 and total T3 should be obtained about 2–6 weeks after initiation, and serum T3 should be monitored because serum free T4 may normalize despite persistent elevation of serum total T3; serum TSH may remain suppressed for several months and is therefore not a good early monitoring parameter. Once euthyroid, methimazole (MMI) dose can be decreased by 30%–50% with biochemical testing repeated in 4–6 weeks; once euthyroid on the minimal dose, evaluation can be undertaken at intervals of 2–3 months, and if receiving long-term MMI (> 18 months), the interval can be increased to 6 months.

### Best practices in the laboratory diagnosis, prognostication, prediction, and monitoring of Graves' disease: role of TRAbs [^115V7jH8]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

A scoring system was constructed and validated for predicting the risk of recurrent GD after 18 months of antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy using four baseline variables: age, serum fT4, TRAbs, and goitre size; the resultant GREAT (Graves' Recurrent Events After Therapy) score of 0–1, 2–3, and 4–6 were associated with a recurrence risk of 16%, 44%, and 68% respectively. Thus, by considering baseline TRAbs in addition to clinical variables such as age, gender, thyroid volume, and severity of hyperthyroidism, it is possible to identify and stratify patients into categories with low or high risk of remission following treatment, as well as predict the prognosis and recurrence of GD.

As an extension to this observation, recording of baseline TRAbs will also help in counselling patients about the possible duration of therapy, importance of medication adherence, and treatment outcomes, thereby allowing an informed decision-making on the part of the patient about the most appropriate format of thyrotoxicosis therapy.

Treatment monitoring and follow up

Treatment of thyrotoxicosis arising from GD hinges on the principles of reducing T3 and T4 synthesis from the thyroid gland, by using modalities such as the antithyroid drugs (ATDs) methimazole (MMI), carbimazole (CBZ) and propylthiouracil (PTU), or thyroid ablation using radioactive iodine (RAI) or thyroidectomy. ATDs are the first-line therapy for GD in most patients, especially among younger patients, and also for achieving euthyroid status prior to RAI or thyroidectomy. Upon initiation of ATD therapy, secondary to their suppression of T3 and T4 production by the thyroid, there is a fall in the serum levels of T3, T4, and consequently of TSH as well. Optimal ATD dose is achieved by monitoring fT4 and TSH levels usually every 3–4 weeks; in fact, a large proportion of patients become clinically and biochemically euthyroid within 3–4 weeks of treatment initiation.

### Therapy insight: management of Graves' disease during pregnancy [^115BAj6k]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of Graves' disease in pregnancy can be complex because of normal gravid physiologic changes in thyroid hormone metabolism. Mothers with active Graves' disease should be treated with antithyroid drugs, which impact both maternal and fetal thyroid function. Optimally, the lowest possible dose should be used to maintain maternal free thyroxine levels at or just above the upper limit of the normal nonpregnant reference range. Fetal thyroid function depends on the balance between the transplacental passage of thyroid-stimulating maternal antibodies and thyroid-inhibiting antithyroid drugs. Elevated levels of serum maternal anti-TSH-receptor antibodies early in the third trimester are a risk factor for fetal hyperthyroidism and should prompt evaluation of the fetal thyroid by ultrasound, even in women with previously ablated Graves' disease. Maternal antithyroid medication can be modulated to treat fetal hyperthyroidism. Serum TSH and either total or free thyroxine levels should be measured in fetal cord blood at delivery in women with active Graves' disease, and those with a history of (131)I-mediated thyroid ablation or thyroidectomy who have anti-TSH-receptor antibodies. Neonatal thyrotoxicosis can occur in the first few days of life after clearance of maternal antithyroid drug, and can last for several months, until maternal antibodies are also cleared.

2.3 Data Extraction

Two investigators searched and screened the literature according to inclusion and exclusion criteria independently. First, literature was excluded based on document type, such as reviews, case reports, and conference abstracts. Subsequently, articles were discarded through scrutiny of titles and abstracts if they were clearly irrelevant. Finally, full‐text reading was conducted to determine eligibility for inclusion in the analysis. Data extraction was carried out using a uniformly created Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, followed by cross‐checking. And any discrepancies were resolved through discussion with a third investigator.

For each study, the following characteristic information was recorded: first author, hospital, publication year, country, recruitment period of study subjects, study design, sample size, gender distribution, age at diagnosis, thyroid hormone levels at diagnosis, TSH receptor antibody (TRAb) levels, prescribed antithyroid medication, initial dosage, treatment duration, follow‐up duration, number of patients who discontinued medication, number of patients undergoing definitive therapy (radioactive iodine therapy or surgery) before discontinuation, definition of remission, number of patients achieving remission, and the number of participants experiencing adverse events.

2.4 Study Quality Assessment

Bias risk assessment utilised the Methodological Index for Non‐Randomised Studies (MINORS), which consists of 12 items. Since items 9 through 12 pertain specifically to studies with a control group, this research selected items 1 through 8 for evaluating the quality of the included literature. In the scoring system, each item was assigned a score of 0 if not reported, 1 if reported but insufficiently, and 2 if reported adequately. The overall quality was categorised as low if the total score ranged from 0 to 5, moderate if it fell between 5 and 10, and high if it was within the range of 11−16.

### Update on the management of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism… [^11349HZi]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Long-term antithyroid drug therapy is only appropriate for Graves hyperthyroidism, since this disorder has the potential to enter a spontaneous remission. It is generally considered the treatment of choice for young patients with a small goiter or patients with active ophthalmopathy. Antithyroid drugs are not indicated as long-term therapy in toxic nodular goiter, since hyperthyroidism does not remit. The likelihood of a long-term remission is positively influenced by the duration of antithyroid drug therapy, and a duration of 1 to 2 years is recommended, with reported remission rates ranging from 37% to 70%. Initial work had suggested that adding levothyroxine sodium to long-term antithyroid drug therapy in patients with Graves disease resulted in a greater likelihood of remission when the antithyroid drug was withdrawn. Radioiodine.

131I is the treatment of choice for patients with Graves hyperthyroidism who relapse after long-term antithyroid drug therapy, for patients with severe thyrocardiac disease, for most patients with toxic multinodular or uninodular goiter, and for patients with a major adverse reaction to antithyroid drugs. The dose of 131I used to treat Graves hyperthyroidism ranges from 185 to 555 MBq, depending on the size of the goiter and the magnitude of uptake of an antecedent tracer dose of 131I. With toxic nodular goiter, larger doses are required to achieve a euthyroid state. The patient must be restored to a euthyroid state before surgery to forestall postoperative thyrotoxic crisis. This is accomplished with propylthiouracil or methimazole as described earlier, and in the 7 to 10 days before surgery for Graves hyperthyroidism, inorganic iodide is added to further reduce thyroid vascularity.

Subclinical hypothyroidism refers to the state in which an increased serum thyrotropin level is accompanied by a normal serum FT4 level in an asymptomatic patient. 24 Progression to overt hypothyroidism is likely if the serum thyrotropin level exceeds 10 mIU/L or if thyroid antibodies are present in high titer. Accordingly, if either of these findings is present, a case can be made for levothyroxine replacement. Moreover, some of these patients will have an abnormal serum lipid profile that may be corrected by replacement therapy.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations? [^116SUZCg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is defined by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration in the presence of normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). However, it is helpful to distinguish between those with a detectable but low TSH value (in the 0.1–0.4 mU/l range) and those with a fully suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mU/l), and we suggest the designation of grade I and grade II SH, respectively. Together, these patterns of thyroid function tests are found in 1–3% of the elderly population, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in longitudinal epidemiological surveys. There are a number of causes for this picture, which include endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects and concomitant nonthyroidal illness. Treatments commonly employed in the management of thyrotoxicosis are effective at correcting the biochemical abnormalities of SH but have not been shown to improve clinical outcome or symptoms. There is little good quality evidence available to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance about whether we should treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

Graves' disease (GD) hyperthyroidism — initial treatment modalities and patient-centered decision-making: Patients with overt Graves' hyperthyroidism should be treated with any of the following modalities: 131I therapy; antithyroid medication, or thyroidectomy. Once it has been established that the patient is hyperthyroid and the cause is GD, the patient and physician must choose between three effective and relatively safe initial treatment options: 131I therapy (radioactive iodine), anti-thyroid drugs (ATD), or thyroidectomy. In the United States, radioactive iodine has been the therapy most preferred by physicians, whereas in Europe and Japan there has been a greater physician preference for ATDs and/or surgery, and the long-term quality of life (QoL) following treatment for GD was found to be the same in patients randomly allocated to one of the three treatment options. Technical remarks state that once the diagnosis has been made, the treating physician and patient should discuss each of the treatment options, including the logistics, benefits, expected speed of recovery, drawbacks, potential side effects, and cost.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — initial L‑thyroxine dosing: With initial thyroid hormone replacement, replacement therapy requires approximately 1.6 μg/kg of L‑thyroxine daily; patients who are athyreotic and those with central hypothyroidism may require higher doses, while patients with subclinical hypothyroidism or after treatment for Graves' disease may require less. In subclinical hypothyroidism, doses of 25–75 μg daily are usually sufficient for achieving euthyroid levels. One randomized controlled trial assigned starting doses by baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as 25 μg for TSH 4.0–8.0 mIU/L, 50 μg for TSH 8–12 mIU/L, and 75 μg for TSH > 12 mIU/L, and after 2 months only minimal further adjustments were required to achieve euthyroidism.

Methimazole (MMI) dosing for Graves' disease — At the start of MMI therapy, initial doses of 10–30 mg daily are used to restore euthyroidism, and the dose can then be titrated down to a maintenance level (generally 5–10 mg daily). The task force suggests the following as a rough guide to initial MMI daily dosing: 5–10 mg if free T4 is 1–1.5 times the upper limit of normal; 10–20 mg for free T4 1.5–2 times the upper limit of normal; and 30–40 mg for free T4 2–3 times the upper limit of normal; serum T3 levels are important to monitor initially because some patients normalize their free T4 levels with MMI but have persistently elevated serum T3, and adverse drug reactions are more frequent with higher MMI doses.

Graves' disease (GD) — thyroidectomy selection and perioperative management is outlined as follows: In exceptional circumstances when euthyroidism cannot be achieved before surgery, when surgery is urgent, or when the patient is allergic to antithyroid medication, the patient should be adequately treated with beta-blockade and potassium iodide in the immediate preoperative period, and the surgeon and anesthesiologist should have experience in this situation. If surgery is chosen as the primary therapy for GD, near-total or total thyroidectomy is the procedure of choice, and the patient should be referred to a high-volume thyroid surgeon. Following thyroidectomy for GD, we suggest that serum calcium or intact parathyroid hormone levels be measured, and that oral calcium and calcitriol supplementation be administered based on these results. Antithyroid drugs should be stopped at the time of thyroidectomy for GD, and beta-adrenergic blockers should be weaned following surgery. Following thyroidectomy for GD, L-thyroxine should be started at a daily dose appropriate for the patient's weight (0.8 μg/lb or 1.7 μg/kg), and serum TSH measured 6–8 weeks postoperatively.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — interventions and treatment thresholds: The principal treatment for hypothyroidism is oral monotherapy (levothyroxine sodium). Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications (such as methimazole) or nonreversible thyroid ablation therapy (for example, radioactive iodine or surgery). Although definitive data are lacking, treatment is generally recommended for patients with a TSH level that is undetectable or less than 0.1 mIU/L, particularly those with overt Graves disease or nodular thyroid disease, whereas treatment is typically not recommended for patients with TSH levels between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or when thyroiditis is the cause.

5 Conclusions

Measurement of TRAb is useful both as a diagnostic and prognostic tool and can help inform shared decision making regarding the optimal therapy choice in Graves' thyrotoxicosis. High TRAbs suggest a greater likelihood of recurrence but an individual may value the opportunity to avoid long‐term medication despite this; these data suggest that chance is approximately 50% in those who complete a course of ATD.

### Comparison of long-term antithyroid drugs versus radioactive iodine or surgery for Graves' disease: a review of the literature [^111KjnMS]. Clinical Endocrinology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of Graves' disease (GD) in the US is shifting towards increased use of anti-thyroid drugs (ATD). If patients fail to achieve remission after a standard course of therapy of 12–18 months, long-term treatment with ATD (≥ 24 months) may be chosen over definitive therapy with radioiodine (RAI) or surgery. Clinicians will need to contrast this strategy to ablative therapies as they help patients in decision making.

Summary

Review of the literature illustrates that long-term ATD delivers euthyroidism with minimal complications, low financial cost and with an advantageous profile regarding quality of life (QoL) and other biological outcomes.

Conclusions

Long-term ATD is a viable alternative to ablative therapies in the management of GD offering advantages across multiple patient centred outcomes. Decision making must factor differences in this approach compared to ablative therapies and ultimately be tailored to individualized patient situations.
