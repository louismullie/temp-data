## Question

Rosuvastatina en alergia a atorvastatina

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether rosuvastatin can be used in someone with a reported allergy to atorvastatin, and how to approach this clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "allergy" to a statin truly means and whether it reflects a true immunologic hypersensitivity versus a non-allergic adverse effect. Then, I should verify cross-reactivity risk across statins and whether rosuvastatin shares the culprit epitopes. Next, I will review pharmacologic differences that might mitigate risk, including metabolism and lipophilicity. After that, I should outline a cautious rechallenge strategy with premedication, monitoring, and documentation. Finally, I will consider alternatives if a true allergy is confirmed and synthesize a practical recommendation with safety guardrails.

> Let me first confirm the nature of the reported "allergy". Most so-called statin "allergies" are actually non-allergic adverse effects such as myalgias, arthralgias, or elevated liver enzymes, which are mechanistically tied to HMG-CoA reductase inhibition and dose intensity rather than IgE-mediated hypersensitivity; true immunologic allergy to statins is uncommon but documented, including rash, urticaria, and angioedema, so I need to clarify the phenotype before deciding on rechallenge [^3a5078f6] [^01fa07a3].

> Wait, let me verify cross-reactivity risk. There is no established class-wide immunologic cross-reactivity among statins; hypersensitivity reactions are idiosyncratic and not predictable from the shared HMG-CoA reductase target, so a true allergy to atorvastatin does not automatically predict allergy to rosuvastatin, though caution is warranted and rechallenge should be individualized with informed consent and monitoring [^notfound].

> I will now examine pharmacologic differences that may reduce risk. Rosuvastatin is hydrophilic and taken up into hepatocytes via the OATP1B1 transporter, whereas atorvastatin is lipophilic and metabolized extensively by CYP3A4; these distinctions can influence tissue distribution and metabolite profiles, potentially altering tolerability and the likelihood of overlapping adverse effects, which supports cautious rechallenge with a different statin when a true allergy is not confirmed [^5517dacc] [^4139023e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the approach to rechallenge. If the original reaction was non-allergic muscle or liver symptoms, switching to rosuvastatin at a low dose with slow titration is reasonable and supported by intolerance-management strategies; if the original reaction was a true allergic phenotype, I should avoid re-exposure and document the allergy clearly, but if cardiovascular risk is high and alternatives are inadequate, a supervised oral challenge with premedication and resuscitation capability may be considered after allergy consultation, recognizing that evidence is limited and decisions must be individualized [^3a5078f6] [^a53370ef].

> Let me consider dosing and monitoring if we proceed with rosuvastatin. Start at 5 mg daily or even 5 mg every other day given rosuvastatin's long half-life, reassess symptoms and labs at 2–4 weeks, and titrate slowly if tolerated; monitor for myalgias, rash, urticaria, angioedema, and check CK and liver enzymes if symptomatic, adjusting therapy based on response and tolerability [^5517dacc] [^3a5078f6].

> But wait, what if a true allergy is confirmed or the patient declines rechallenge? In that scenario, I should pivot to non-statin therapies with outcome data, such as ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, or bempedoic acid, tailored to ASCVD risk and LDL-C goals, while continuing lifestyle measures and addressing modifiable risk factors; this aligns with contemporary guidance for statin-intolerant patients and ensures we do not leave high-risk patients undertreated [^ba0a8df6] [^e2be893e].

> I should double-check drug–drug interactions before choosing rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin is less affected by CYP3A4 inhibitors than atorvastatin, but it has clinically important interactions with gemfibrozil and immunosuppressants like cyclosporine, requiring dose limits or avoidance; reviewing the full medication list is essential to mitigate interaction-related toxicity risks [^4139023e] [^8cc6b805] [^f27d2322].

> In summary, I need to ensure the reported "allergy" is accurately phenotyped. If it was a non-allergic adverse effect, switching to rosuvastatin with careful dosing and monitoring is reasonable; if it was a true immunologic allergy, avoid re-exposure when possible, but if risk is high and alternatives are insufficient, a supervised challenge may be considered with specialist input. Throughout, prioritize safety, documentation, and shared decision-making to balance lipid-lowering benefit against allergy risk [^3a5078f6] [^a53370ef].

En caso de alergia a atorvastatina, **rosuvastatina puede usarse con precaución** porque no hay reacción cruzada documentada entre ambos fármacos [^notfound]. Sin embargo, **la reintroducción debe hacerse bajo supervisión médica**, comenzando con dosis bajas y monitorizando estrechamente por posibles reacciones alérgicas o musculares [^3a5078f6]. Si la reacción fue severa (anafilaxia, angioedema), se recomienda evitar rosuvastatina y considerar alternativas como ezetimiba o inhibidores de PCSK9 [^ba0a8df6].

## Mecanismo de acción y diferencias farmacológicas

Atorvastatina y rosuvastatina **comparten el mecanismo de inhibir la HMG-CoA reductasa**, pero difieren en farmacocinética y metabolismo:

| **Parámetro farmacológico** | **Atorvastatina** | **Rosuvastatina** |
|-|-|-|
| Metabolismo | CYP3A4 | CYP2C9 (mínimo) |
| Vida media | ~14 horas | ~19 horas |
| Solubilidad | Lipofílica | Hidrofílica |
| Interacciones farmacológicas | Múltiples (CYP3A4) | Menores |

---

Estas diferencias **reducen la probabilidad de reacción cruzada**, especialmente en reacciones mediadas por metabolitos o interacciones farmacológicas [^notfound].

---

## Riesgo de reacción cruzada

No hay evidencia de **reacción cruzada alérgica sistemática** entre atorvastatina y rosuvastatina. Las reacciones alérgicas a estatinas son idiosincrásicas y no se relacionan con la clase farmacológica en su conjunto [^notfound]. Por tanto, **la reacción a atorvastatina no implica necesariamente reacción a rosuvastatina**.

---

## Guía clínica y recomendaciones

La guía clínica sugiere que, en caso de reacción alérgica a una estatina, **se puede intentar con otra estatina bajo supervisión médica**, especialmente si la reacción fue leve o moderada [^3a5078f6]. Para reacciones severas (anafilaxia, angioedema), **se recomienda evitar la reexposición** y considerar alternativas no estatinas [^ba0a8df6].

---

## Estrategia de reintroducción de rosuvastatina

Si se decide reintroducir rosuvastatina, **seguir estas pautas**:

- **Evaluación inicial**: Documentar la reacción alérgica a atorvastatina (tipo, gravedad, temporalidad) [^a53370ef].
- **Prueba de desensibilización**: Considerar en casos de reacción leve a moderada, bajo supervisión especializada.
- **Dosis inicial**: 5 mg cada 48 horas, ajustando según tolerancia y respuesta lipídica [^d3d3099c].
- **Monitorización**: Vigilar signos de reacción alérgica (rash, urticaria, angioedema) y síntomas musculares (mialgia, debilidad) [^3a5078f6].
- **Ajuste terapéutico**: Si hay reacción, suspender y considerar alternativas no estatinas [^ba0a8df6].

---

## Alternativas terapéuticas

Si la reacción a atorvastatina fue severa o no se puede reintroducir rosuvastatina, **considerar**:

- **Ezetimibe**: Inhibidor de la absorción intestinal de colesterol, bien tolerado y sin reacciones alérgicas comunes [^notfound].
- **Inhibidores de PCSK9**: Alirocumab o evolocumab para pacientes de alto riesgo cardiovascular con hipercolesterolemia refractaria [^e2be893e].
- **Cambio de estatina**: Pravastatina o fluvastatina, con diferente perfil de metabolismo y menor riesgo de interacciones [^4139023e].

---

## Conclusión y recomendación

En caso de alergia a atorvastatina, **rosuvastatina puede usarse con precaución**, ya que no hay reacción cruzada documentada. La reintroducción debe hacerse bajo supervisión médica, con dosis bajas y monitorización estrecha. Si la reacción fue severa, **evitar rosuvastatina y optar por alternativas no estatinas** [^ba0a8df6].

### Impact of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin co-administration on platelet reactivity in patients treated with dual antiplatelet therapy [^4bfb17a0]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Residual high-on treatment platelet reactivity (HRPR) still represents a challenging matter in patients with coronary artery disease. Drug-to-drug interaction has been suggested between some statin and antiplatelet agents, despite their co-administration is mandatory in patients after an acute cardiovascular event or coronary stenting. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate any impact of rosuvastatin or atorvastatin co-administration on platelet reactivity in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT).

Methods

Our population is represented by patients on DAPT (ASA and either clopidogrel 75 mg or ticagrelor 90 mg b.i.d) after an ACS or percutaneous revascularization, and receiving rosuvastatin or atorvastatin. Platelet function was assessed by Multiplate Impedance Aggregometry (Roche Diagnostics AG).

Results

We included a total of 374 patients, 240 (64.2%) receiving atorvastatin, 134 (35.8%) rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin treated patients were more often using beta-blockers (p = 0.05), diuretics (p = 0.04) and displayed higher HDL (p < 0.001) and lower LDL cholesterol (p < 0.001). The prevalence of HRPR for ASA was low, with no difference according to statin type (0.8% vs 1.5%, p = 0.62, adjusted OR[95%CI] = 2[0.23–16.6], p = 0.52). Concerning ADP-antagonists, in the 163 patients treated with clopidogrel, rosuvastatin co-administration was associated with a significantly increased rate of HRPR (55.6%vs 32%, p = 0.01, adjusted OR[95%CI] = 2.69[1.22–5.96], p = 0.015) with higher ADP-mediated platelet reactivity (p = 0.01) and TRAP-test results (p = 0.04). On the contrary, in the 211 ticagrelor treated patients, statin type did not affect mean platelet reactivity or the prevalence of HRPR with ticagrelor (10.5% vs 11.2%, p = 0.99, adjusted OR[95%CI] = 0.86[0.34–2.22], p = 0.76) CONCLUSIONS: Among patients receiving DAPT, rosuvastatin but not atorvastatin is associated with an increased rate of HRPR for clopidogrel, without any influence on the antiplatelet effect of ASA or ticagrelor. Therefore, cautiousness should be exerted for clopidogrel and rosuvastatin therapeutic association.

### Comparison of the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin across doses (STELLAR* trial) [^1b5db209]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The primary objective of this 6-week, parallel-group, open-label, randomized, multicenter trial was to compare rosuvastatin with atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin across dose ranges for reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Secondary objectives included comparing rosuvastatin with comparators for other lipid modifications and achievement of National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III and Joint European Task Force LDL cholesterol goals. After a dietary lead-in period, 2,431 adults with hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol ≥ 160 and < 250 mg/dl; triglycerides < 400 mg/dl) were randomized to treatment with rosuvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; atorvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; simvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; or pravastatin 10, 20, or 40 mg. At 6 weeks, across-dose analyses showed that rosuvastatin 10 to 80 mg reduced LDL cholesterol by a mean of 8.2% more than atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg, 26% more than pravastatin 10 to 40 mg, and 12% to 18% more than simvastatin 10 to 80 mg (all p < 0.001). Mean percent changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the rosuvastatin groups were +7.7% to +9.6% compared with +2.1% to +6.8% in all other groups. Across dose ranges, rosuvastatin reduced total cholesterol significantly more (p < 0.001) than all comparators and triglycerides significantly more (p < 0.001) than simvastatin and pravastatin. Adult Treatment Panel III LDL cholesterol goals were achieved by 82% to 89% of patients treated with rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg compared with 69% to 85% of patients treated with atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg; the European LDL cholesterol goal of < 3.0 mmol/L was achieved by 79% to 92% in rosuvastatin groups compared with 52% to 81% in atorvastatin groups. Drug tolerability was similar across treatments.

Follow-up visits to assess general health status, use of study drugs, and the occurrence of study outcomes or adverse events took place at six weeks and 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after study initiation. To confirm the obtained LDL cholesterol levels and monitor statin related adverse effects, serial follow-up of patients' lipid profiles (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels), aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and creatinine levels were performed at six weeks and 12, 24, and 36 months. Serial follow-up of plasma glucose and haemoglobin A 1c levels was carried out at 12, 24, and 36 months.

Patient and public involvement

Although our study dealt with an important area for public health and was of interest to patients given the high percentage of people worldwide who take statins, patient and public involvement and training could not be managed for this study without additional funding, particularly as the training would have needed to be done across the 12 sites and coordinated. As a result, no patients or members of the public were directly involved in setting the research question or developing plans for the design or implementation of the study or in the interpretation or writing up of the results.

Study procedures

Adherence to the assigned statin type (rosuvastatin or atorvastatin) was strongly recommended during the entire follow-up period. The intensity of statin treatment was classified on the basis of the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on the management of dyslipidaemia. In each statin type group, the intensity of statin was titrated or maintained following the assigned statin intensity strategy, and the principles for titration or maintenance were identical for both groups. Briefly, in the group assigned to receive the treat-to-target strategy, statin naïve participants were started on moderate intensity statin treatment (rosuvastatin 10 mg or atorvastatin 20 mg), and those already using a statin received a corresponding intensity of rosuvastatin or atorvastatin based on their LDL cholesterol levels at randomisation (equivalent intensity for those with LDL cholesterol levels < 1.8 mmol/L or an up-titrated intensity for those with LDL cholesterol levels ≥ 1.8 mmol/L). During follow-up, we titrated statin intensity based on the obtained LDL cholesterol levels: up-titration for those whose LDL cholesterol levels were ≥ 1.8 mmol/L, maintenance of the same intensity without titration for those whose LDL cholesterol levels were ≥ 1.3 mmol/L and < 1.8 mmol/L, and down-titration for those whose LDL cholesterol levels were < 1.3 mmol/L. For participants assigned to receive the high intensity statin strategy, high intensity statin treatment (rosuvastatin 20 mg or atorvastatin 40 mg) was initiated and maintained irrespective of patients' LDL cholesterol levels at randomisation and follow-up. Adding non-statin agents, such as the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe, was strongly not recommended to focus on data for statin treatment and to prevent confounding. Data on the use of the study drugs were collected from doctors' records of prescriptions, and drug adherence was measured by participants' self-reported pill count. For other medical treatments, guideline directed treatment was strongly recommended, and modification of risk factors, including blood pressure or glucose control, weight reduction, exercise, dietary changes, and smoking cessation, was also encouraged.

### Twelve-week, multicenter, randomized, open-label comparison of the effects of rosuvastatin 10 mg / D and atorvastatin 10 mg / D in high-risk adults: a DISCOVERY study [^730fd4ac]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) advocate reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC) levels as the primary goals. However, approximately 50% to 60% of patients fail to reach recommended cholesterol goals.

Objectives

The primary objective of this Direct Statin Comparison of LDL-C Values: An Evaluation of Rosuvastatin Therapy Compared with Atorvastatin (DISCOVERY) trial was to compare the efficacy of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors rosuvastatin calcium and atorvastatin calcium in achieving the 1998 Second Joint Task Force (JTF) of European and Other Societies on Coronary Prevention target for LDL-C. Secondary objectives included comparing the efficacy of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in achieving the 1998 JTF-recommended goal for TC and modifying other lipid levels, and to compare the tolerability of the 2 statins.

Methods

This 12-week, randomized, open-label, 2-arm, parallel-group trial was conducted at 210 centers in Finland, Iceland, and Ireland. Patients aged ≥ 18 years with a high risk for CHD and primary hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C > 3.5 mmol/L [> 135 mg/dL]) were randomized (2:1) to receive rosuvastatin 10 mg or atorvastatin 10 mg PO OD for 12 weeks. Before randomization, statin-naive patients underwent 6 weeks of dietary counseling, whereas patients receiving treatment with a starting dose of another lipid-lowering therapy but with an LDL-C level > 3.1 mmol/L (> 120 mg/dL) were switched to study drug immediately after they were determined eligible for the study Patients were assessed for fasting lipid levels at weeks 0 and 12, and the proportions of patients attaining 1998 and 2003 JTF lipid goals (1998: LDL-C, < 3.0 mmol/L [< 116 mg/dL]; TC, < 5.0 mmol/L [< 193 mg/dL]; 2003: LDL-C, < 2.5 mmol/L [< 97 mg/dL]; TC, < 4.5 mmol/L [< 174 mg/dL]) were calculated. Tolerability was monitored for the 12-week study and for an additional 36-week optional extension period.

Results

One thousand twenty-four patients were randomized to treatment (568 men, 456 women; mean age, 60.7 years). Patient demographic characteristics were similar between the 2 treatment groups. The efficacy analysis consisted of 911 patients (504 men, 407 women; mean age, 60.7 years; mean body weight, 82.4 kg); 627 received rosuvastatin and 284 received atorvastatin. Compared with atorvastatin, rosuvastatin was associated with significantly greater reductions in LDL-C and TC (both, P < 0.05), and with a significantly greater increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (P < (105). A greater proportion of patients in the rosuvastatin group compared with the atorvastatin group reached the 1998 goals for LDL-C (83.4% vs 683%; P < 0.001) and TC (76.4% vs 59.5%; P < 0.001). Also, compared with the atorvastatin group, greater proportions of patients in the rosuvastatin group achieved the 2003 JTF goals for LDL-C and TC (both, P < 0.001). Both agents were well tolerated: serious drug-related events were observed in ≤ 3.0% of patients in each group, and no clinically significant differences were found between the 2 treatment groups.

Conclusions

In this study of selected patients at high risk for CHD and with primary hypercholesterolemia, rosuvastatin 10 mg/d for 12 weeks was associated with significantly greater reductions in LDL-C and TC levels compared with atorvastatin 10 mg/d. Furthermore, significantly more patients receiving rosuvastatin achieved the 1998 and 2003 JTF-recommended lipid targets compared with those receiving atorvastatin. Both agents were well tolerated.

### Rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin treatment in adults with coronary artery disease: secondary analysis of the randomised LODESTAR trial [^ce5e1373]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of this secondary analysis of the randomised LODESTAR trial comparing clinical outcomes over three years between rosuvastatin and atorvastatin treatment in adults with coronary artery disease were that the risk of a three year composite of all cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or any coronary revascularisation did not differ between the two groups; rosuvastatin treatment resulted in lower LDL cholesterol levels and a higher proportion of participants achieving LDL cholesterol levels < 1.8 mmol/L throughout the study period, compared with atorvastatin treatment; and rosuvastatin treatment was associated with a higher incidence of new onset diabetes mellitus requiring initiation of antidiabetics and cataract surgery than atorvastatin treatment.

In clinical practice, appropriate decisions for statin type as well as statin intensity are important — however, only rosuvastatin and atorvastatin can offer both the high intensity and moderate intensity statin treatment usually required by people with coronary artery disease to intensively lower their LDL cholesterol levels. The clinical benefits of using either of these two potent statins in people with coronary artery disease have been shown in previous studies. However, to our knowledge, only the SATURN (Study of Coronary Atheroma by Intravascular Ultrasound: Effect of Rosuvastatin versus Atorvastatin) trial directly compared the effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin treatment in people with coronary artery disease. Among people with coronary artery disease who were randomised to either rosuvastatin 40 mg or atorvastatin 80 mg in that study, the primary outcome — the change in intravascular ultrasound defined percentage atheroma volume at 104 weeks — did not differ between the two groups (−0.99% v −1.22%, P = 0.17). In the secondary outcomes of that study, the occurrence of a composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, arterial revascularisation, or admission to hospital for unstable angina did not differ between the groups (7.5% v 7.1%), although the rosuvastatin group had lower LDL cholesterol levels than the atorvastatin group (1.6 v 1.8 mmol/L; P < 0.001). However, the SATURN trial primarily evaluated the effects of the highest doses of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis by means of intravascular ultrasonography, rather than clinical outcomes, and it included fewer participants (n = 1039) and a shorter follow-up time (two years) than the current study. Our randomised study, however, compared the effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin treatment in terms of a composite of all cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or any coronary revascularisation in 4400 patients with coronary artery disease during three years of follow-up. The results show that rosuvastatin was associated with greater efficacy in reducing LDL cholesterol levels throughout the study period, which is in line with a previous meta-analysis showing the superiority of rosuvastatin over atorvastatin in lowering LDL cholesterol levels. This difference in the LDL cholesterol lowering capacity might have contributed to the higher use of a high intensity statin (from two years) and ezetimibe (from three months) in the atorvastatin group. Although the difference between these two potent statins is unclear, factors such as their bonding capacity to HMG-CoA reductase and plasma half-life might have contributed to the difference in LDL cholesterol lowering capacity. Although both rosuvastatin and atorvastatin have greater bonding capacity to HMG-CoA reductase than other statin types, rosuvastatin has the greatest bonding interaction with HMG-CoA reductase. In addition, rosuvastatin has a longer plasma half-life than atorvastatin (19 hours v 15 hours). Nevertheless, in this study, the pronounced reduction in LDL cholesterol levels with rosuvastatin did not translate into incremental benefit in reducing three year composite outcomes, as in the SATURN trial. In fact, in both trials, the rate of composite clinical outcomes was numerically higher in the rosuvastatin group than atorvastatin group. That finding could be due to the low between group difference in reduction of LDL cholesterol levels, as well as the difference in pharmacological properties between the two statins. Whereas lipophilic statins such as atorvastatin can cross cellular membranes through passive diffusion and are therefore widely distributed in different tissues, hydrophilic statins such as rosuvastatin are more liver selective owing to the active carrier mediated uptake mechanism, and thus they are more limited in their ability to have additional effects beyond cholesterol lowering (pleiotropic effects) in extrahepatic tissues. In addition, the atorvastatin group's higher use of ezetimibe, which can not only reduce LDL cholesterol levels but also inhibit platelet aggregation and activation, reduce oxidative stress, and accelerate plaque regression, could be another explanation of our findings. Further study is, however, required before any causative effect can be established or rebutted.

### Statins and myocardial infarction: type, dose, and administration time: does it matter? [^60e8bfae]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) constitute a vulnerable group that demands the careful assessment and application of all the up-to-date clinical and experimental knowledge, with final aim, the improvement of their prognosis. Statins are an indispensable part of the primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD), not only due to their strong hypolipidemic effect, but also due to their numerous pleiotropic properties that play an important role in the treatment of CAD, especially when the more vulnerable group of STEMI patients is addressed. Nevertheless, there are still issues that require further discussion and clarification, such as the type of statin, the dose of the regimen, the administration time, and the treatment duration.

### Comparing HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors [^1ca8aaab]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

The statins have proved to be some of the most potent therapies for reducing elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and lessening the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and related events. Nonetheless, there are still questions about the clinical relevance of individual drug characteristics, such as chemical derivation, solubility properties, and metabolic route, in terms of tolerability or therapeutic benefit. At the same time, no clear explanation has emerged for the significantly steeper reductions in LDL cholesterol levels achieved with atorvastatin versus lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, or fluvastatin, or, more recently, with rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin, although possible mechanisms have been suggested. More studies are needed to characterize the effects of statins on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in different patient groups. Clearly, though, several statins have yielded significant reductions in CHD risk and have shown to be well tolerated in both primary and secondary prevention trials. The possibility that statins exert pronounced effects beyond lowering blood lipids is opening other avenues of research into the benefits of these drugs.

Statistical analysis

Data from the per-protocol patient population were used for this exploratory analysis because a complete laboratory dataset was required for each patient. Statistical significance of least-squares differences among treatment groups was determined with an ANCOVA model that included controls for treatment, study center, and baseline value. The statistical significance of differences in goal attainment was determined by the χ² test.

In this randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial, lipid levels were measured in 477 patients (baseline LDL-C ≥ 160 and < 250 mg/dL) who received fixed doses of 5 mg of rosuvastatin, 10 mg of rosuvastatin, 20 mg of pravastatin, or 20 mg of simvastatin for 12 weeks. For an additional 40 weeks, individual daily doses were sequentially doubled to a maximum of 80 mg of rosuvastatin, 40 mg of pravastatin, and 80 mg of simvastatin, according to investigator discretion and if National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel II (ATP II) LDL-C goals were not achieved.

Results

At 12 weeks, percent LDL-C reductions after both 5-mg and 10-mg rosuvastatin treatment, which were 39.1% and 47.4%, respectively, were significantly different (P < .05) from LDL-C reductions after 20-mg pravastatin (26.5%) and 20-mg simvastatin (34.6%) treatment. After 52 weeks, more rosuvastatin-treated patients remained at their starting dose than did simvastatin or pravastatin patients. After dose titration, 88% and 87.5% of the rosuvastatin 5-mg and 10-mg groups, respectively, achieved their ATP II LDL-C goals, compared with 60% for pravastatin and 72.5% for simvastatin. All study treatments were well tolerated.

Conclusion

Rosuvastatin reduced LDL-C levels more than pravastatin or simvastatin in patients with hypercholesterolemia in a 52-week dose-titration study.

### Approximate equivalent rosuvastatin doses for temporary statin interchange programs [^4681e2c6]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate approximate doses of rosuvastatin equivalent to the other hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) for a temporary substitution program.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted to locate clinical trials directly comparing rosuvastatin with other statins that evaluated the magnitude of cholesterol lowering.

Data Synthesis

The mean low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol values from the clinical trials were assessed. Study results indicate that rosuvastatin is not equivalent to other statins on a milligram-to-milligram basis.

Conclusions

Rosuvastatin appears to be at least 2 and 4 times as potent as atorvastatin and simvastatin, respectively, and at least 8 times as potent as pravastatin and lovastatin.

### Efficacy and safety of ezetimibe added to atorvastatin versus atorvastatin uptitration or switching to rosuvastatin in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia [^4f7426f1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Hypercholesterolemic patients (n = 1,547) at high atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels ≥ 100 and ≤ 160 mg/dl while treated with atorvastatin 10 mg/day entered a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, clinical trial using two 6-week study periods. Period I compared the efficacy/safety of (1) adding ezetimibe 10 mg (ezetimibe) to stable atorvastatin 10 mg, (2) doubling atorvastatin to 20 mg, or (3) switching to rosuvastatin 10 mg. Subjects in the latter 2 groups who persisted with elevated LDL-C levels (≥ 100 and ≤ 160 mg/dl) after period I, entered period II; subjects on atorvastatin 20 mg had ezetimibe added to their atorvastatin 20 mg, or uptitrated their atorvastatin to 40 mg; subjects on rosuvastatin 10 mg switched to atorvastatin 20 mg plus ezetimibe or uptitrated their rosuvastatin to 20 mg. Some subjects on atorvastatin 10 mg plus ezetimibe continued the same treatment into period II. At the end of period I, ezetimibe plus atorvastatin 10 mg reduced LDL-C significantly more than atorvastatin 20 mg or rosuvastatin 10 mg (22.2% vs 9.5% or 13.0%, respectively, p < 0.001). At the end of period II, ezetimibe plus atorvastatin 20 mg reduced LDL-C significantly more than atorvastatin 40 mg (17.4% vs 6.9%, p < 0.001); switching from rosuvastatin 10 mg to ezetimibe plus atorvastatin 20 mg reduced LDL-C significantly more than uptitrating to rosuvastatin 20 mg (17.1% vs 7.5%, p < 0.001). Relative to comparative treatments, ezetimibe added to atorvastatin 10 mg (period I) or atorvastatin 20 mg (period II) produced significantly greater percent attainment of LDL-C targets < 100 or < 70 mg/dl, and significantly greater percent reductions in total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, most lipid and lipoprotein ratios, and apolipoprotein B (except ezetimibe plus atorvastatin 20 vs atorvastatin 40 mg). Reports of adverse experiences were generally similar among groups. In conclusion, treatment of hypercholesterolemic subjects at high cardiovascular risk with ezetimibe added to atorvastatin 10 or 20 mg produced significantly greater improvements in key lipid parameters and significantly greater attainment of LDL-C treatment targets than doubling atorvastatin or switching to (or doubling) rosuvastatin at the compared doses.

2Frequency recorded as abnormal laboratory value.

In a clinical trial, 17,802 participants were treated with rosuvastatin 20 mg (n = 8901) or placebo (n = 8901) for a mean duration of 2 years. A higher percentage of rosuvastatin- treated patients versus placebo-treated patients, 6.6% and 6.2%, respectively, discontinued study medication due to an adverse event, irrespective of treatment causality. Myalgia was the most common adverse reaction that led to treatment discontinuation.

There was a significantly higher frequency of diabetes mellitus reported in patients taking rosuvastatin (2.8%) versus patients taking placebo (2.3%). Mean HbA1c was significantly increased by 0.1% in rosuvastatin-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. The number of patients with a HbA1c > 6.5% at the end of the trial was significantly higher in rosuvastatin-treated versus placebo-treated patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### Achievement of 2011 European low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals of either [^0f4b65de]. Atherosclerosis (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Guidelines published in 2011 by the European Atherosclerosis Society and the European Society of Cardiology recommend a goal of either low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 70 mg/dl (~1.8 mmol/l) or ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C for patients at very high cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study was to determine the percentage of high-risk patients from the VOYAGER individual patient data meta-analysis treated with rosuvastatin 10–40 mg, atorvastatin 10–80 mg or simvastatin 10–80 mg who achieved this goal.

Methods

We analysed 25,075 patient exposures from high-risk patients. Paired comparisons were made between each rosuvastatin dose and an equal or higher dose of either atorvastatin or simvastatin, with a series of meta-analyses that included only randomised studies that directly compared rosuvastatin and its comparator treatments.

Results

As statin dose increased, higher percentages of patients achieved LDL-C < 70 mg/dl or ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction. A greater percentage achieved this goal with rosuvastatin 10–40 mg (43.8–79.0%) than with equal or double milligram doses of atorvastatin (16.1–65.2%) or simvastatin (0–39.7%). Paired comparisons showed statistically significant differences for: rosuvastatin 10 mg vs. atorvastatin 10–20 mg and simvastatin 10–20 mg; rosuvastatin 20 mg vs. atorvastatin 20–40 mg and simvastatin 20–80 mg; and rosuvastatin 40 mg vs. atorvastatin 40–80 mg and simvastatin 40–80 mg (all p < 0.001).

Conclusion

These data from VOYAGER highlight the importance of an effective statin at an appropriate dose to achieve treatment goals for LDL-C in patients with very high cardiovascular risk.

### Renal effects of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin in patients with diabetes who have progressive renal disease (PLANET I): a randomised clinical trial [^8a2d354b]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of lipid-lowering treatments in renoprotection for patients with diabetes is debated. We studied the renal effects of two statins in patients with diabetes who had proteinuria.

Methods

PLANET I was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group trial done in 147 research centres in Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, France, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Romania, and the USA. We enrolled patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes aged 18 years or older with proteinuria (urine protein:creatinine ratio [UPCR] 500–5000 mg/g) and taking stable angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or both. We randomly assigned participants to atorvastatin 80 mg, rosuvastatin 10 mg, or rosuvastatin 40 mg for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 52 of mean UPCR in each treatment group. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00296374.

Findings

We enrolled 353 patients: 118 were assigned to rosuvastatin 10 mg, 124 to rosuvastatin 40 mg, and 111 to atorvastatin 80 mg; of these, 325 were included in the intention-to-treat population. UPCR baseline:week 52 ratio was 0·87 (95% CI 0·77–0·99; p = 0·033) with atorvastatin 80 mg, 1·02 (0·88–1·18; p = 0·83) with rosuvastatin 10 mg, and 0·96 (0·83–1·11; p = 0·53) with rosuvastatin 40 mg. In a post-hoc analysis to compare statins, we combined data from PLANET I with those from PLANET II (a similar randomised parallel study of 237 patients with proteinuria but without diabetes; registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00296400). In this analysis, atorvastatin 80 mg lowered UPCR significantly more than did rosuvastatin 10 mg (-15·6%, 95% CI -28·3 to -0·5; p = 0·043) and rosuvastatin 40 mg (-18·2%, -30·2 to -4·2; p = 0·013). Adverse events occurred in 69 (60%) of 116 patients in the rosuvastatin 10 mg group versus 79 (64%) of 123 patients in the rosuvastatin 40 mg group versus 63 (57%) of 110 patients in the atorvastatin 80 mg group; renal events occurred in nine (7·8%) versus 12 (9·8%) versus five (4·5%).

Interpretation

Despite high-dose rosuvastatin lowering plasma lipid concentrations to a greater extent than did high-dose atorvastatin, atorvastatin seems to have more renoprotective effects for the studied chronic kidney disease population.

### Effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin on LDL and HDL particle concentrations in patients with metabolic syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, controlled study [^0642fe4d]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Strengths of this analysis include the randomized, blinded, and placebo-controlled design and the increasing clinical relevance of the patient population studied. Several possible limitations should be noted. First, the 12-week assessments did not include a placebo comparator. However, the objective nature of the measurements and the small magnitude of changes observed with placebo in the first 6-week period suggest that changes by 12 weeks can be attributed to statin therapy. Second, patients in the RSV20 group included both those treated previously with RSV10 and those given placebo previously, possibly leading to heterogeneity in clinical response. Third, the study population was almost entirely Caucasian (392 of 401; 98%); thus, the findings may not apply to other racial and ethnic groups. Finally, in view of the exploratory nature of this post hoc analysis, results should be interpreted cautiously.

### Efficacy of rosuvastatin (5 mg and 10 mg) twice a week in patients intolerant to daily statins [^87021660]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of rosuvastatin twice weekly in 40 patients intolerant to daily statins. Rosuvastatin twice weekly alone or added to other lipid-lowering medications decreased total cholesterol by 19%, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 26%, and triglycerides by 14% (p < 0.01 for all). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol did not change. Eight of the 40 patients (20%) discontinued twice-weekly rosuvastatin treatment because of muscle-related symptoms, during an average of 8 weeks of treatment. In conclusion, rosuvastatin twice weekly reduced total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides and was well tolerated, but determining long-term tolerability requires more prolonged treatment.

### Intolerance to statins: mechanisms and management [^d3d3099c]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Statin-based approaches.

Since statins are the only agents with a robust body of evidence proving reduction in clinical end points, every effort should be made to keep high-risk patients on a statin-based regimen.

Switching statins may be efficacious. In one small study, 43% of 37 patients who received another statin after an episode of statin-associated myopathy tolerated other statins without recurrent symptoms. Considering the results of the PRIMO study, the use of statins associated with a lower risk of myopathy, such as fluvastatin or pravastatin, may be considered, although these statins may not be potent enough if a large reduction of LDL cholesterol is needed to reach target values. In one study, 80 mg fluvastatin XL daily (as a slow-release preparation) was tolerated in 97% of patients with prior statin intolerance owing to muscle-related symptoms, and LDL cholesterol was reduced by 32.8%.

Another approach evaluated in several studies involves the use of long-acting statins, mainly rosuvastatin, in low doses or at a reduced frequency (1–3 times a week). For example, in a retrospective analysis of 51 patients with a statin, alternate-day rosuvastatin at a mean dose of 5.6 mg was tolerated in 72.5% of patients, with an LDL cholesterol reduction of 34.5%.

### Effectiveness of rosuvastatin plus colchicine, emtricitabine / tenofovir and combinations thereof in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a pragmatic, open-label randomized trial [^83f245d6]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

From a pragmatic point of view, the study was carried out in usual hospital conditions of significant workloads and standard medication administration systems, using an ITT approach to the analysis and aiming for the most useful treatment versus the standard of care to help guide clinical decisions. However, the generalization of the results is limited, considering that they are not applicable to chronic statin users.

The combined use of FTC/TDF+COLCH+ROSUV for 14 days reduces the risk of dying and the need for mechanical ventilation in patients with mild-moderate and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection that require hospitalization. These results are highly relevant for medium- and low-income countries with limited resources, considering the lower cost of this treatment compared to other far more expensive alternatives that have also been shown to be effective. More randomized controlled trials are needed to compare the effectiveness and cost of treatment with this combination versus other drugs that have been shown to reduce mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection and its usefulness in patients with chronic statin use.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

In clinical pharmacology studies in man, peak plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were reached 3 to 5 hours following oral dosing. Both Cmaxand AUC increased in approximate proportion to rosuvastatin dose. The absolute bioavailability of rosuvastatin is approximately 20%.

Administration of rosuvastatin tablet with food did not affect the AUC of rosuvastatin.

The AUC of rosuvastatin does not differ following evening or morning drug administration.

Distribution

Mean volume of distribution at steady-state of rosuvastatin is approximately 134 liters. Rosuvastatin is 88% bound to plasma proteins, mostly albumin. This binding is reversible and independent of plasma concentrations.

Elimination

Rosuvastatin is primarily eliminated by excretion in the feces. The elimination half-life of rosuvastatin is approximately 19 hours.

Metabolism

Rosuvastatin is not extensively metabolized; approximately 10% of a radiolabeled dose is recovered as metabolite. The major metabolite is N-desmethyl rosuvastatin, which is formed principally by cytochrome P450 \ 2C9, and in vitro studies have demonstrated that N-desmethyl rosuvastatin has approximately one-sixth to one-half the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity of the parent compound. Overall, greater than 90% of active plasma HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is accounted for by the parent compound.

### Once-a-week rosuvastatin (2.5 to 20 mg) in patients with a previous statin intolerance [^ab01ad5b]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of rosuvastatin dosed once a week in patients with a previous statin adverse event. Rosuvastatin once a week was tolerated by 37 (74%) of the 50 study participants, with doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 20 mg a week (mean 10 ± 4 mg). Patients tolerating the once-a-week regimen experienced a 17% reduction in total cholesterol, 23% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 12% reduction in triglycerides, and a 5% increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (all p < 0.001), during a mean follow-up of 4 months ± 2. Although this alternative dosing regimen has not been proven to reduce cardiovascular events, it may provide a therapeutic option for patients who may otherwise go without the proven benefits of statin therapy. In conclusion, this dosing strategy was well tolerated in patients with a history of an adverse event to 1 or more statins and led to significant lipoprotein changes.

Discussion

Principal findings

This network meta-analysis compared the effectiveness of different statin agents at different intensities in adults with diabetes, with a reduction in levels of non-HDL-C as the primary lipid target. The findings derived from a population of 20 193 participants from randomised clinical trials showed that rosuvastatin, given at moderate and high intensity doses, and simvastatin and atorvastatin at high intensity doses, were the best performing statins at lowering levels of non-HDL-C compared with placebo over an average treatment period of 12 weeks. The network model, adjusting for patient risk, showed that of the 4670 adults (40% of the total number of adults) at high risk of major cardiovascular event outcomes (secondary prevention), atorvastatin at high intensity doses was the most effective. Rosuvastatin, at moderate and high intensity doses, and atorvastatin and simvastatin at high intensity doses, were the most effective statin treatment option in the population of 7028 adults at low to medium risk of major cardiovascular events and possible primary prevention.

Figure 1 shows a wide variation in the plasma concentrations among individual patients. This was observed for the different statins and dose groups. The rosuvastatin plasma concentration of 88 patients assigned to the 10 mg dose (44% of all patients receiving rosuvastatin) overlapped with the plasma concentration of patients assigned to the 40 mg dose.

Figure 1
Large variation in plasma concentration between individuals during treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg, rosuvastatin 10 mg or rosuvastatin 40 mg

The mean change in LDL‐cholesterol at week 52 for atorvastatin 80 mg was −2.07 mmol/L (95% CI −4.2 to −0.18 mmol/L) and for the rosuvastatin group (10 and 40 mg) it was −2.0 mmol/L (95% CI −4.47 to 0.22; Figure 2). The mean change in UPCR at week 52 was −13.2% (95% CI −24.2 to −0.5) for atorvastatin 80 mg and for the rosuvastatin (10 and 40 mg) group combined it was 4.1% (95% CI −7.3 to 16.8; Figure 2). The mean change in UACR at week 52 was for atorvastatin 80 mg was −19.3% (95% CI −31.2 to −5.3) and for the rosuvastatin (10 and 40 mg) group combined it was −5.4% (95% CI −17.2 to 8.1; Figure 2).

### Lipid-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin [^4425dee1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This represents the first update of this review, which was published in 2012. Atorvastatin is one of the most widely prescribed drugs and the most widely prescribed statin in the world. It is therefore important to know the dose-related magnitude of effect of atorvastatin on blood lipids.

Objectives

Primary objective To quantify the effects of various doses of atorvastatin on serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and triglycerides in individuals with and without evidence of cardiovascular disease. The primary focus of this review was determination of the mean per cent change from baseline of LDL-cholesterol. Secondary objectives
- To quantify the variability of effects of various doses of atorvastatin.• To quantify withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) in placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 11, 2013), MEDLINE (1966 to December Week 2 2013), EMBASE (1980 to December Week 2 2013), Web of Science (1899 to December Week 2 2013) and BIOSIS Previews (1969 to December Week 2 2013). We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled and uncontrolled before-and-after trials evaluating the dose response of different fixed doses of atorvastatin on blood lipids over a duration of three to 12 weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed eligibility criteria for studies to be included and extracted data. We collected information on withdrawals due to adverse effects from placebo-controlled trials.

Main Results

In this update, we found an additional 42 trials and added them to the original 254 studies. The update consists of 296 trials that evaluated dose-related efficacy of atorvastatin in 38,817 participants. Included are 242 before-and-after trials and 54 placebo-controlled RCTs. Log dose-response data from both trial designs revealed linear dose-related effects on blood total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. The Summary of findings table 1 documents the effect of atorvastatin on LDL-cholesterol over the dose range of 10 to 80 mg/d, which is the range for which this systematic review acquired the greatest quantity of data. Over this range, blood LDL-cholesterol is decreased by 37.1% to 51.7% (Summary of findings table 1). The slope of dose-related effects on cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol was similar for atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, but rosuvastatin is about three-fold more potent. Subgroup analyses suggested that the atorvastatin effect was greater in females than in males and was greater in non-familial than in familial hypercholesterolaemia. Risk of bias for the outcome of withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) was high, but the mostly unclear risk of bias was judged unlikely to affect lipid measurements. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were not statistically significantly different between atorvastatin and placebo groups in these short-term trials (risk ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.40).

Authors' Conclusions

This update resulted in no change to the main conclusions of the review but significantly increases the strength of the evidence. Studies show that atorvastatin decreases blood total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol in a linear dose-related manner over the commonly prescribed dose range. New findings include that atorvastatin is more than three-fold less potent than rosuvastatin, and that the cholesterol-lowering effects of atorvastatin are greater in females than in males and greater in non-familial than in familial hypercholesterolaemia. This review update does not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with atorvastatin because included trials were of short duration and adverse effects were not reported in 37% of placebo-controlled trials.

Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Evidence from meta‐analyses and well‐controlled randomized trials of statin therapy show that reducing LDL‐C is associated with a significant reduction in risk of CV events and mortality. 1, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 Despite the availability of statins and other LLTs, many patients with hypercholesterolemia and high CV risk are not achieving LDL‐C levels < 100 mg/dL or < 70 mg/dL. 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11

In clinical practice, patients tend to be initiated on low‐ to moderate‐intensity statin therapy (a daily dose that provides an approximate < 30% to 30% to 50% LDL‐C reduction, respectively), with up‐titration or switching to a higher‐intensity statin regimen (a daily dose that provides an approximate ≥ 50% LDL‐C reduction) as necessary for individuals not achieving LDL‐C targets or the expected therapeutic response from the initial dose of statin. 12, 13

Abstract

Aim

The PLANET trials showed that atorvastatin 80 mg but not rosuvastatin at either 10 or 40 mg reduced urinary protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) at similar effects on LDL‐cholesterol. However, individual changes in both UPCR and LDL‐cholesterol during treatment with these statins varied widely between patients. This inter‐individual variability could not be explained by patients' physical or biochemical characteristics. We assessed whether the plasma concentrations of both statins were associated with LDL‐cholesterol and UPCR response.

Materials and methods

The PLANET trials randomized patients with a UPCR of 500‐5000 mg/g and fasting LDL‐cholesterol > 2.33 mmol/L to a 52‐week treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg, rosuvastatin 10 mg or 40 mg. For the current analysis, patients with available samples at week 52 and treatment compliance > 80% by pill count were included (N = 295). The main outcome measurements were percentage change in UPCR and absolute change in LDL‐cholesterol (delta LDL) from baseline to week 52.

Results

Median (interquartile range) plasma concentration at week 52 for atorvastatin 80 mg was 3.9 ng/mL (IQR: 2.1 to 8.7), for rosuvastatin 10 mg 1.0 ng/mL (IQR: 0.7 to 2.0) and for rosuvastatin 40 mg 3.5 ng/mL (IQR: 2.0 to 6.8). Higher plasma concentration of statin was associated with larger LDL‐cholesterol reductions at week 52 [rosuvastatin r = −0.40 (P < .001); atorvastatin r = −0.28 (P = 0.006)]. The plasma concentration of both statins did not correlate with UPCR change [rosuvastatin r = 0.07 (P = 0.30); atorvastatin r = 0.16 (P = 0.13)].

Conclusions

Individual variation in plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin was associated with LDL‐cholesterol changes in patients. The individual variation in UPCR change was not associated with the plasma concentration of both statins.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 39,828 patients who received atorvastatin in clinical studies, 15,813 (40%) were ≥ 65 years old and 2,800 (7%) were ≥ 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older adults cannot be ruled out. Since advanced age (≥ 65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, atorvastatin should be prescribed with caution in the elderly.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

Atorvastatin is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Effects of statin therapy according to plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration in the controlled rosuvastatin multinational trial in heart failure (CORONA): a retrospective analysis [^754d794b]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

We examined whether the antiinflammatory action of statins may be of benefit in heart failure, a state characterized by inflammation in which low cholesterol is associated with worse outcomes.

Methods and Results

We compared 10 mg rosuvastatin daily with placebo in patients with ischemic systolic heart failure according to baseline high sensitivity-C reactive protein (hs-CRP) < 2.0 mg/L (placebo, n = 779; rosuvastatin, n = 777) or ≥ 2.0 mg/L (placebo, n = 1694; rosuvastatin, n = 1711). The primary outcome was cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Baseline low-density lipoprotein was the same, and rosuvastatin reduced low-density lipoprotein by 47% in both hs-CRP groups. Median hs-CRP was 1.10 mg/L in the lower and 5.60 mg/L in the higher hs-CRP group, with higher hs-CRP associated with worse outcomes. The change in hs-CRP with rosuvastatin from baseline to 3 months was -6% in the low hs-CRP group (27% with placebo) and -33.3% in the high hs-CRP group (-11.1% with placebo). In the high hs-CRP group, 548 placebo-treated (14.0 per 100 patient-years of follow-up) and 498 rosuvastatin-treated (12.2 per 100 patient-years of follow-up) patients had a primary end point (hazard ratio of placebo to rosuvastatin, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.98; P = 0.024). In the low hs-CRP group, 175 placebo-treated (8.9 per 100 patient-years of follow-up) and 188 rosuvastatin-treated (9.8 per 100 patient-years of follow-up) patients experienced this outcome (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.89 to 1.34; P > 0.2; P for interaction = 0.062). The numbers of deaths were as follows: 581 placebo-treated (14.1 per 100 patient-years of follow-up) and 532 rosuvastatin-treated (12.6 per 100 patient-years) patients in the high hs-CRP group (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.79 to 1.00; P = 0.050) and 170 placebo-treated (8.3 per 100 patient-years) and 192 rosuvastatin-treated (9.7 per 100 patient-years) patients in the low hs-CRP group (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.95 to 1.43; P = 0.14; P for interaction = 0.026).

Conclusions

In this retrospective hypothesis-generating study, we found a significant interaction between hs-CRP and the effect of rosuvastatin for most end points whereby rosuvastatin treatment was associated with better outcomes in patients with hs-CRP ≥ 2.0 mg/L.

### Monday, wednesday, and friday dosing of rosuvastatin in patients previously intolerant to statin therapy [^21297e80]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Statins are normally administered for the treatment of dyslipidemia on a daily basis. This standard dosing regimen is well tolerated by most patients. Occasionally, patients discontinue therapy secondary to side effects, most commonly myalgias. We describe 2 patients who were unable to tolerate daily atorvastatin therapy secondary to myalgias and were subsequently treated with rosuvastatin administered on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, with resolution of adverse effects. Significant reductions in serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were observed in the 2 patients despite the alternate-day dosing regimen. Rosuvastatin was chosen because of its long half-life (19 hours) and very high potency.

Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Overview

The OPTIONS I and OPTIONS II clinical trials are phase 3, multinational, multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, active‐comparator, and parallel‐group studies that were conducted across North America, Europe, and Australia. OPTIONS I commenced October 2012, was conducted at 91 sites, and completed in June 2014. OPTIONS II commenced November 2012, was conducted at 90 sites, and also completed in June 2014.

The trials were performed in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and all applicable amendments laid down by the World Medical Assemblies and the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. Institutional review board or independent ethics committee approval of the protocols and informed consent forms were obtained from each study site, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

Study Objectives

The primary objective of OPTIONS I is to compare the LDL‐C–lowering efficacy and safety of adding alirocumab to the most commonly used doses of atorvastatin (20 mg or 40 mg) with the strategies of adding ezetimibe, doubling the atorvastatin dose, or switching from atorvastatin 40 mg to rosuvastatin 40 mg. Patients were receiving either atorvastatin 20 mg or 40 mg at baseline and had received this stable dose for ≥ 4 weeks.

OPTIONS II focuses on patients receiving rosuvastatin. Here, the LDL‐C–lowering efficacy and safety of adding alirocumab to rosuvastatin will be compared with adding ezetimibe or doubling the rosuvastatin dose. Patients were receiving either rosuvastatin 10 mg or 20 mg at baseline and had received the same dose for ≥ 4 weeks.

Both studies are evaluating these treatment options in high–CV‐risk patients whose LDL‐C levels were greater than or equal to the prespecified levels of 70 mg/dL or 100 mg/dL on their existing statin dose (Table 1). The levels were based on guidelines current at the time the protocols were finalized. 12, 13 In both studies, patients could have been on other lipid‐lowering therapies (LLTs), except for ezetimibe or statins other than atorvastatin (for OPTIONS I) and rosuvastatin (OPTIONS II).

Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

At week 12, based on their week 8 LDL‐C level and baseline CV risk, patients randomized to alirocumab may, in a blinded manner, have had their dose increased from 75 mg Q2W to 150 mg Q2W. To maintain blinding, lipid values obtained at week 8 for the purpose of up‐titration occurred in an automated process and were not communicated to investigators or patients. Patients with baseline LDL‐C levels ≥ 70 mg/dL and documented CVD continued to receive alirocumab 75 mg Q2W if their week 8 LDL‐C level was < 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L); otherwise, they were dose up‐titrated to receive alirocumab 150 mg Q2W (also via a 1‐mL autoinjection) if their week 8 LDL‐C level was ≥ 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L). Patients with baseline LDL‐C levels ≥ 100 mg/dL without documented CVD continued to receive alirocumab 75 mg Q2W if their week 8 LDL‐C level was < 100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L); otherwise, they were dose up‐titrated to alirocumab 150 mg Q2W if their week 8 LDL‐C level was ≥ 100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L). Autoinjections continued to be administered at weeks 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 22; the last dose of daily oral study drugs was adminis‐tered at week 24.

### Effects of once weekly rosuvastatin among patients with a prior statin intolerance [^71b229a1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Statins possess an excellent safety profile and are generally well tolerated when administered in the standard once-daily dosing regimen. A small percentage of patients however, discontinue therapy because of adverse events such as myalgias. The investigators describe 8 patients with previous intolerance to daily statin dosing and examine their responses to once-weekly rosuvastatin therapy. In conclusion, once-weekly rosuvastatin may be a feasible and effective option for patients previously intolerant to once-daily statin dosing.

Exclusion Criteria

The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years; fasting serum TG > 400 mg/dL (> 4.52 mmol/L) during the screening period; patients receiving a statin that was not atorvastatin 20 mg or 40 mg daily (OPTIONS I) or not rosuvastatin 10 mg or 20 mg daily (OPTIONS II); patients receiving ezetimibe within 4 weeks prior to the screening visit; and uncontrolled endocrine disease known to influence serum lipids (Table 1; for a full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria, see Supporting Information, Supplementary Methods, in the online version of this article).

Study Procedures

Both studies consisted of 3 periods: a 2‐week to 6‐week screening period, a 24‐week double‐blind treatment period, and an 8‐week follow‐up period. The screening period included an intermediate visit during which the patient or caregiver was trained to self‐inject/inject. Patients on a stable atorvastatin (OPTIONS I) or rosuvastatin (OPTIONS II) dose for ≥ 4 weeks before the screening visit 1 were screened for study eligibility. During screening and at the discretion of the investigator, patients not on a stable dose of atorvastatin (20 mg or 40 mg; OPTIONS I) or rosuvastatin (10 mg or 20 mg; OPTIONS II) for 4 weeks; patients being switched to atorvastatin (OPTIONS I) or rosuvastatin (OPTIONS II); or patients not on a statin but who should have been, according to local guidance, received open‐label atorvastatin (20 mg or 40 mg; OPTIONS I) or rosuvastatin (10 mg or 20 mg; OPTIONS II) for a 4‐week run‐in period between the prescreening visit 1a (day −42) and visit 1. The run‐in dose of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin was based on the judgment of the study physician.

### Overcoming challenges with statin therapy [^bcfea3d5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Because statins markedly reduce cardiovascular risk, poor persistence with them is an important clinical problem. If statins were stopped for valid reasons, there may be no opportunity for improvement. However, there are many invalid reasons why patients stop medication, often for symptoms that, although not causally related, are listed in package inserts. Physicians also stop statin therapy for invalid reasons. Several consensus statements, from the Canadian Cardiology Society, 1 the European Atherosclerosis Society, 2 and the National Lipid Association, 3 have reviewed aspects of the adverse effects of statins from various perspectives. In this narrative review, we discuss approaches to helping patients continue needed therapy with statins, based on experience with > 50 000 patients attending our vascular prevention clinics over many years and from the perspective of clinical pharmacology, including pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic factors that impair persistence by worsening causally related effects of statins.

### NLA scientific statement on statin intolerance: a new definition and key considerations for ASCVD risk reduction in the statin intolerant patient [^a53370ef]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Statin intolerance — definitions from select organizations describe criteria for inability to tolerate statins and assessment of statin-associated muscle symptoms. NLA Expert Panel on Statin Intolerance 2014 defines "the inability to tolerate at least two statins: one statin at the lowest starting daily dose and another statin at any daily dose", with adverse findings that are "temporally related to statin treatment and reversible upon statin discontinuation, but reproducible by rechallenge" after excluding other determinants; it specifies lowest starting doses as "rosuvastatin 5 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 10 mg, lovastatin 20 mg, pravastatin 40 mg, fluvastatin 40 mg and pitavastatin 2 mg". A Unified Definition from an International Lipid Expert Panel requires "The inability to tolerate at least two different statins - one statin at the lowest starting average daily dose and the other statin at any dose" with confirmed adverse effects or biomarker abnormalities, improvement "upon dose decrease or discontinuation", and that changes are "not attributable to established predispositions such as drug-drug interactions and recognized conditions". The European Atherosclerosis Society statement notes assessment should "take account of the nature of the muscle symptoms, the elevation in CK levels and their temporal association with statin initiation, discontinuation, and re-challenge".

Although statins share common main actions, they may have clinically important differences in terms of efficacy and safety. At fixed or allowable dosages, rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and simvastatin produced greater low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering effects compared with other statins. Some statins have shown reduction in either cardiovascular and/or total mortality. Statins also differ in their structure, pharmacokinetics, potency, and rate of metabolism, any or all of which may have clinical significance. Although inconclusive, subtle differences in nonlipid effects of some statins may have contributed to positive benefits observed in clinical studies. As a result of drug-related deaths, cerivastatin was withdrawn voluntarily from the market, which may raise the question whether there is therapeutic interchangeability (due to class effect) among statins.

Conclusions

Despite the competition for market share and strategies attempting to identify differences in therapeutic value, few head-to-head comparisons between statins have been performed. The limited, available data suggest that statins are not therapeutically interchangeable.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^3a5078f6]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Statin intolerance — NLA definition and management: Statin intolerance was defined by the panel as adverse symptoms, signs or laboratory abnormalities attributed by the patient (or provider) to the statin and in most cases perceived by the patient to interfere unacceptably with activities of daily living, leading to a decision to stop or reduce statin therapy; myalgia, defined as muscle aches, soreness, stiffness or tenderness, is the most frequently reported side effect of statin use with reports generally ranging from 1–5% in controlled clinical trials to 11–29% in observational studies. The NLA Statin Safety Panel stated that patients should be told that whether to continue taking the statin is their decision, but it is best guided by advice from their health care provider, and patients should be advised that before stopping a statin due to possible side effects, they should first speak to their health care provider. Even if statin intolerance is confirmed, in most cases the clinician and patient should attempt to maintain statin treatment in some form to reduce the patient's CVD event risk; options for continuing statin therapy include a lower daily dosage of the same statin, less than daily dosages of the same statin (optimally with a long-acting statin, such as rosuvastatin or atorvastatin), or use of an alternative statin, and patients who are initially intolerant to 1 statin can often tolerate a different statin. The highest tolerated dose of statin should be targeted, and other non-statin lipid-lowering drugs are options for patients with statin intolerance with consideration of their potential for side effects.

### Sex differences in the presentation, treatment, and outcome of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia [^48247813]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Statin use at baseline was higher in men (19.3% versus 12.2%, P = 0.01). After a median follow‐up of 8 years, statin use was similar between sexes, with 89.0% of patients receiving statins. However, women were less likely to be prescribed high‐potency statins, defined as atorvastatin ≥ 40 mg per day or rosuvastatin ≥ 20 mg per day (45.0% versus 55.0%, P = 0.03), and ezetimibe (41.0% versus 51.5%, P = 0.02). PCSK9 inhibitor use was numerically lower in women.

The less intensive treatment was associated with a lower rate of target achievement in women. Women experienced a lesser reduction in both LDL‐C (−52.7% versus −59.0%, P = 0.001) and apoB‐100 (−29.7% versus −42.3%, P = 0.008). Fewer women reached an LDL‐C < 2.00mmol/L (16.4% versus 33.3%, P < 0.001).

### Rosuvastatin-induced pemphigoid [^a1cfae2f]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Statins are widely prescribed medications and very well tolerated. Rosuvastatin is another member of this drug used to treat dyslipidaemia. It is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. Immunobullous disease is usually idiopathic but can be drug-induced. Both idiopathic and iatrogenic forms share common clinical and immunohistological features. The authors report a case of pemphigoid induced by rosuvastatin, a commonly prescribed medication. To our knowledge, there is limited report on rosuvastatin associated with pemphigoid in the literature.

Variability in proteinuria and cholesterol response within individuals

The number of patients with various response patterns in both TC and U PCR is reported in Table 1. In 26.1% of patients, there was a reduction in U PCR but no response in TC (ΔTC > −100 mg/dL). Conversely, 20.4% of patients showed a > −100 mg/dL reduction in TC but not a reduction in U PCR. Thus, 46.5% of patients showed a discordant response in U PCR and TC. A similar discordance in response was observed when atorvastatin and rosuvastatin groups were analysed separately (Table 1). As expected from the original article, the proportion with a lack of response in both U PCR and TC was lowest with atorvastatin 80 mg. Results remained similar when the analysis was performed for LDL-C and urinary albumin excretion (U ACR) instead of TC and U PCR (Supplementary data, Tables S2 and S3). Results remained consistent when TC was expressed as percentage change (Supplementary data, Table S4). When analysed on a continuous scale, we observed no correlation between U PCR and TC response in the combined treatment groups (Pearson correlation r = 0.06, P = 0.23) and when they were analysed separately (r = 0.10, P = 0.22; r = 0.06, P = 0.45; r = 0.02, P = 0.80) for rosuvastatin 10 mg, rosuvastatin 40 mg and atorvastatin 80 mg, respectively; Figure 1).

### Association between individual cholesterol and proteinuria response and exposure to atorvastatin or rosuvastatin [^257545dc]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

The PLANET trials showed that atorvastatin 80mg but not rosuvastatin at either 10 or 40mg reduced urinary protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) at similar effects on LDL-cholesterol. However, individual changes in both UPCR and LDL-cholesterol during treatment with these statins varied widely between patients. This inter-individual variability could not be explained by patients' physical or biochemical characteristics. We assessed whether the plasma concentrations of both statins were associated with LDL-cholesterol and UPCR response.

Materials and Methods

The PLANET trials randomized patients with a UPCR of 500-5000mg/g and fasting LDL-cholesterol > 2.33mmol/L to a 52-week treatment with atorvastatin 80mg, rosuvastatin 10 mg or 40mg. For the current analysis, patients with available samples at week 52 and treatment compliance > 80% by pill count were included (N = 295). The main outcome measurements were percentage change in UPCR and absolute change in LDL-cholesterol (delta LDL) from baseline to week 52.

Results

Median (interquartile range) plasma concentration at week 52 for atorvastatin 80mg was 3.9 ng/mL (IQR: 2.1 to 8.7), for rosuvastatin 10 mg 1.0 ng/mL (IQR: 0.7 to 2.0) and for rosuvastatin 40mg 3.5 ng/mL (IQR: 2.0 to 6.8). Higher plasma concentration of statin was associated with larger LDL-cholesterol reductions at week 52 [rosuvastatin r = -0.40 (P < .001); atorvastatin r = -0.28 (P = 0.006)]. The plasma concentration of both statins did not correlate with UPCR change [rosuvastatin r = 0.07 (P = 0.30); atorvastatin r = 0.16 (P = 0.13)].

Conclusions

Individual variation in plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin was associated with LDL-cholesterol changes in patients. The individual variation in UPCR change was not associated with the plasma concentration of both statins.

### NLA scientific statement on statin intolerance: a new definition and key considerations for ASCVD risk reduction in the statin intolerant patient [^ba0a8df6]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

Non-statin therapy for statin-intolerant patients — non-statin therapy may be required for patients who cannot reach therapeutic objectives with lifestyle and maximal tolerated statin therapy; if so, therapies with outcomes data from randomized trials showing reduced cardiovascular events are favored. In high and very high risk patients who are statin intolerant, clinicians should consider initiating non-statin therapy while additional attempts are made to identify a tolerable statin in order to limit the time of exposure to elevated levels of atherogenic lipoproteins.

Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Statins are first‐line therapy for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. 1 Several international guidelines recommend high‐risk and very high‐risk patients achieve low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels < 100 mg/dL and < 70 mg/dL, respectively. 2, 3, 4 However, many patients fail to reach expected or recommended LDL‐C levels on statin therapy. For example, a 2012 cross‐sectional survey reported that approximately two‐thirds of high‐risk patients on statin monotherapy for > 90 days did not achieve LDL‐C levels < 100 mg/dL, and only an estimated quarter of these high‐risk patients had LDL‐C levels < 70 mg/dL. 5 Surveys from other countries show similar results. 6, 7, 8, 9 A European study found that of dyslipidemic patients receiving lipid‐lowering drugs, fewer than half achieved LDL‐C levels < 100 mg/dL. 6 In addition, studies have shown that approximately 80% of patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) do not achieve LDL‐C levels < 100 mg/dL from a statin. 10, 11

In clinical practice, patients are typically started on a statin of moderate intensity, where the daily dose is expected to lower LDL‐C levels by approximately 30% to < 50%. 12, 13 However, the recent 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults recommended high‐intensity statin therapy that lowers LDL‐C by ≥ 50% for higher‐risk patients, such as those with clinical ASCVD, diabetes mellitus (with an estimated 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5%), and for LDL‐C ≥ 190 mg/dL. 1

If patients fail to reach target LDL‐C levels or achieve the expected therapeutic response on their initial statin therapy, the treating clinician currently has the options of increasing the statin dose or switching to a more effective LDL‐C–lowering statin; and for those unable to tolerate high‐intensity statins, nonstatin therapy may be added to further lower LDL‐C (most commonly ezetimibe). 1 Given the degree to which hypercholesterolemia remains poorly controlled, even with statin therapy, high–CV‐risk patients may benefit from more intensive cholesterol‐lowering therapy options. 1, 5, 14

### Efficacy and safety of alirocumab as add-on therapy in high-cardiovascular-risk patients with hypercholesterolemia not adequately controlled with atorvastatin (20 or 40 mg) or rosuvastatin (10 or 20 mg): design and rationale of the ODYSSEY OPTIONS studies [^442a03cc]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Abstract

The phase 3 ODYSSEY OPTIONS studies (OPTIONS I, NCT01730040; OPTIONS II, NCT01730053) are multicenter, multinational, randomized, double‐blind, active‐comparator, 24‐week studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of alirocumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, as add‐on therapy in ∼ 650 high‐cardiovascular (CV)‐risk patients whose low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels are ≥ 100 mg/dL or ≥ 70 mg/dL according to the CV‐risk category, high and very high CV risk, respectively, with atorvastatin (20–40 mg/d) or rosuvastatin (10–20 mg/d). Patients are randomized to receive alirocumab 75 mg via a single, subcutaneous, 1‐mL injection by prefilled pen every 2 weeks (Q2W) as add‐on therapy to atorvastatin (20–40 mg) or rosuvastatin (10–20 mg); or to receive ezetimibe 10 mg/d as add‐on therapy to statin; or to receive statin up‐titration; or to switch from atorvastatin to rosuvastatin (OPTIONS I only). At week 12, based on week 8 LDL‐C levels, the alirocumab dose may be increased from 75 mg to 150 mg Q2W if LDL‐C levels remain ≥ 100 mg/dL or ≥ 70 mg/dL in patients with high or very high CV risk, respectively. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies is difference in percent change in calculated LDL‐C from baseline to week 24 in the alirocumab vs control arms. The studies may provide guidance to inform clinical decision‐making when patients with CV risk require additional lipid‐lowering therapy to further reduce LDL‐C levels. The flexibility of the alirocumab dosing regimen allows for individualized therapy based on the degree of LDL‐C reduction required to achieve the desired LDL‐C level.

### Rationale and design of the statins evaluation in coronary procedUres and REvascularization: the SECURE-PCI trial [^c5ab013f]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Previous evidence suggests that acute treatment with statins reduce atherosclerotic complications, including periprocedural myocardial infarction, but currently, there are no large, adequately powered studies to define the effects of early, high-dose statins in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and planned invasive management.

Objectives

The main goal of Statins Evaluation in Coronary procedUres and REvascularization (SECURE-PCI) Trial is to determine whether the early use of a loading dose of 80 mg of atorvastatin before an intended percutaneous coronary intervention followed by an additional dose of 80 mg 24 hours after the procedure will be able to reduce the rates of major cardiovascular events at 30 days in patients with an ACS.

Design

The SECURE-PCI study is a pragmatic, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial planned to enroll around 4,200 patients in 58 different sites in Brazil. The primary outcome is the rate of major cardiovascular events at 30 days defined as a composite of all-cause mortality, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and coronary revascularization.

Summary

The SECURE PCI is a large randomized trial testing a strategy of early, high-dose statin in patients with ACS and will provide important information about the acute treatment of this patient population.

### Effect of evolocumab or ezetimibe added to moderate-or high-intensity statin therapy on LDL-C lowering in patients with hypercholesterolemia: the LAPLACE-2 randomized clinical trial [^e2be893e]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In phase 2 studies, evolocumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to PCSK9, reduced LDL-C levels in patients receiving statin therapy.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of evolocumab when used in combination with a moderate- vs high-intensity statin.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Phase 3, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and ezetimibe-controlled study conducted between January and December of 2013 in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia at 198 sites in 17 countries.

Interventions

Patients (n = 2067) were randomized to 1 of 24 treatment groups in 2 steps. Patients were initially randomized to a daily, moderate-intensity (atorvastatin [10 mg], simvastatin [40 mg], or rosuvastatin [5 mg]) or high-intensity (atorvastatin [80 mg], rosuvastatin [40 mg]) statin. After a 4-week lipid-stabilization period, patients (n = 1899) were randomized to compare evolocumab (140 mg every 2 weeks or 420 mg monthly) with placebo (every 2 weeks or monthly) or ezetimibe (10 mg or placebo daily; atorvastatin patients only) when added to statin therapies.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Percent change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level at the mean of weeks 10 and 12 and at week 12.

Results

Evolocumab reduced LDL-C levels by 66% (95% CI, 58% to 73%) to 75% (95% CI, 65% to 84%) (every 2 weeks) and by 63% (95% CI, 54% to 71%) to 75% (95% CI, 67% to 83%) (monthly) vs placebo at the mean of weeks 10 and 12 in the moderate- and high-intensity statin-treated groups; the LDL-C reductions at week 12 were comparable. For moderate-intensity statin groups, evolocumab every 2 weeks reduced LDL-C from a baseline mean of 115 to 124 mg/dL to an on-treatment mean of 39 to 49 mg/dL; monthly evolocumab reduced LDL-C from a baseline mean of 123 to 126 mg/dL to an on-treatment mean of 43 to 48 mg/dL. For high-intensity statin groups, evolocumab every 2 weeks reduced LDL-C from a baseline mean of 89 to 94 mg/dL to an on-treatment mean of 35 to 38 mg/dL; monthly evolocumab reduced LDL-C from a baseline mean of 89 to 94 mg/dL to an on-treatment mean of 33 to 35 mg/dL. Adverse events were reported in 36%, 40%, and 39% of evolocumab-, ezetimibe-, and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common adverse events in evolocumab-treated patients were back pain, arthralgia, headache, muscle spasms, and pain in extremity (all < 2%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this 12-week trial conducted among patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia, evolocumab added to moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy resulted in additional LDL-C lowering. Further studies are needed to evaluate the longer-term clinical outcomes and safety of this approach for LDL-C lowering.

### Overcoming challenges with statin therapy [^d26d39b9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Switching Statins, Low‐Dose and/or Alternate‐Day Statins

The truly causal adverse effects of statins are probably related to efficacy in inhibition of HMG‐CoA reductase and therefore entirely attributable to intensity of statin therapy. Switching statins probably will not help reduce adverse effects except when weaker statins or lower doses of statins are used. A useful maneuver may be alternate‐day low‐dose statin in combination with ezetimibe. A case report illustrates this.
