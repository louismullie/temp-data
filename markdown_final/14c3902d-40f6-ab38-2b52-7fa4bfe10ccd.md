## Question

thrombosed hemorrhoidectomy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about thrombosed hemorrhoidectomy, specifically when to operate, how to operate, and how to manage patients who present beyond the early window. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical entity and diagnostic confirmation. Then, I should verify the timing threshold for intervention. Next, I will compare surgical excision versus conservative management and weigh benefits and risks. After that, I need to review procedural technique and anesthesia choices. Finally, I should consider special populations, follow-up, and synthesize a practical algorithm with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and diagnostic approach. Thrombosed external hemorrhoids present as a painful, firm, bluish mass at the anal verge, typically arising from a sudden thrombosis of the external hemorrhoidal plexus; diagnosis is clinical and usually requires no additional testing unless there is concern for alternative pathology or concomitant disease, in which case anoscopy or colon evaluation may be indicated depending on age and risk factors [^115VqfZd] [^113Lu5Sw].

> I need to check the timing threshold for intervention. Multiple high-quality guidelines converge on a 72–96 hour window: ACG recommends excision or evacuation if seen within about 4 days, AAFP advises excision within 2–3 days, and ASCRS supports early excision in selected patients, with randomized data showing faster pain relief and lower recurrence with excision versus thrombectomy or topical therapy in the early period [^115KHWEx] [^1139mGGp] [^111wfR2E] [^111VpRR5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal excision. I should verify the comparative benefits of surgery versus conservative care. Excision provides faster symptom resolution (about 3.9 days vs 24 days with conservative therapy), lower recurrence (approximately 6.3% vs 25.4%), and longer time to recurrence, albeit with procedural risks; meta-analytic data also show superior short-term pain control with surgery in the first 4–10 days, with convergence thereafter, reinforcing the importance of timing and patient selection [^112zbyiz] [^113hV3Ws].

> Next, I should review the procedure itself and anesthesia. Excision is typically performed as an ellipse over the thrombosed hemorrhoid, removing the entire diseased plexus in one piece while avoiding injury to the underlying sphincter; this can be done under local anesthesia in the office or emergency setting, with low recurrence and high satisfaction in large outpatient series, and postoperative care emphasizes stool softeners and hygiene to prevent suture-line disruption [^114oBmgs] [^117TAg3q] [^112A2DgF].

> Wait, let me verify the role of simple incision and drainage. I initially thought incision and evacuation might suffice in select cases, but I should double-check guideline direction. Contemporary guidance advises against simple incision and drainage because of higher bleeding and recurrence; randomized data show worse pain outcomes with thrombectomy compared with excision, supporting complete excision when intervention is pursued early [^116rKskB] [^111VpRR5].

> I will now examine management beyond the early window. After 72–96 hours, the thrombus begins to organize and pain often improves spontaneously; conservative therapy with fiber, fluids, sitz baths, topical analgesics, and stool softeners is reasonable, reserving excision for refractory pain, large persistent mass, or recurrent thrombosis, acknowledging that organized thrombus is harder to evacuate and recurrence risk remains higher with nonoperative care [^116N2x7f] [^112zbyiz].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant, immunocompromised, or on anticoagulation. In pregnancy, conservative management is first-line given fetal considerations, though excision under local anesthesia can be considered if pain is severe and refractory; in immunocompromised patients, recent data suggest office-based and surgical procedures, including thrombosed hemorrhoid excision, can be performed safely with attention to infection risk; for patients on anticoagulation, individualized risk–benefit assessment and coordination with prescribing clinicians are essential, and some guidelines allow excision with local measures to mitigate bleeding [^116sx9fa] [^111N2qmL].

> Next, I should review follow-up and recurrence prevention. Patients should be counseled on dietary fiber, hydration, and toileting habits to reduce recurrence; if excision is performed, wound care and stool softeners are standard, and patients should be warned about expected pain in the first week and the possibility of a residual skin tag; long-term recurrence after excision is low, but new thromboses can occur, particularly with constipation or straining [^112MKBGH] [^117TAg3q].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against the evidence. Within 72–96 hours of symptom onset, offer excisional hemorrhoidectomy under local anesthesia for most patients after discussing faster relief and lower recurrence versus procedural risks; beyond 72–96 hours, default to conservative therapy and reserve excision for persistent severe pain, large mass, or recurrence; throughout, tailor decisions to comorbidities, anticoagulation, pregnancy, and patient preference, and avoid simple incision and drainage given inferior outcomes [^116N2x7f] [^1139mGGp] [^111wfR2E] [^116rKskB].

> Finally, I should confirm key takeaways and ensure internal consistency. Early excision of thrombosed external hemorrhoids within 72–96 hours accelerates symptom resolution, reduces recurrence, and is safe in appropriately selected patients; beyond this window, conservative management is reasonable, with surgery reserved for select cases; shared decision-making is essential, and clinicians should explicitly counsel on timing-dependent benefits and trade-offs to align treatment with patient goals [^111VpRR5] [^112zbyiz] [^116N2x7f].

---

Thrombosed hemorrhoidectomy is indicated for **acute thrombosed external hemorrhoids within 72 hours** [^116N2x7f] of symptom onset to provide rapid pain relief, reduce recurrence, and shorten recovery [^112zbyiz]. Excision under local anesthesia is preferred over incision and drainage because it lowers recurrence and bleeding risk [^111VpRR5] [^116rKskB]. Beyond 72 hours, conservative management is reasonable as pain often improves and thrombus organizes, though excision remains an option for persistent symptoms [^116N2x7f] [^115KHWEx]. Complications are uncommon but include bleeding, infection, and rare incontinence; recurrence is lower with excision than with conservative care [^112zbyiz] [^117TAg3q].

---

## Indications and timing

- **Indications**: Thrombosed external hemorrhoids causing severe pain, swelling, or bleeding [^116N2x7f].
- **Timing**: Excision is most beneficial within 72 hours of symptom onset [^116N2x7f]; after this, thrombus organizes and pain often improves, making conservative management reasonable [^115KHWEx].
- **Patient selection**: Consider excision in patients with severe pain, large thrombosis, or failure of conservative therapy [^116N2x7f].

---

## Surgical techniques

| **Technique** | **Description** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Excisional hemorrhoidectomy | Complete removal of the thrombosed hemorrhoid and overlying skin | - Rapid pain relief <br/> - Low recurrence <br/> - Short recovery | - Postoperative pain <br/> - Bleeding <br/> - Infection |
| Incision and drainage | Simple incision to evacuate the thrombus | Quick procedure | - Higher recurrence <br/> - Persistent bleeding <br/> - Infection |
| Stapled hemorrhoidopexy | Circumferential stapling to reposition hemorrhoidal tissue | Less postoperative pain | Not routinely recommended for thrombosed external hemorrhoids [^notfound] |

---

Excisional hemorrhoidectomy is **preferred** over incision and drainage due to lower recurrence and better symptom control [^111VpRR5] [^112zbyiz].

---

## Outcomes and complications

- **Pain relief**: Excision provides rapid pain relief, often within 24–48 hours [^notfound].
- **Recurrence**: Lower recurrence with excision (6.3%) vs conservative care (25.4%) [^112zbyiz].
- **Recovery**: Faster return to normal activities with excision (mean 3.9 days) vs conservative care (mean 24 days) [^112zbyiz].
- **Complications**: Rare but include bleeding, infection, urinary retention, and rare incontinence [^114sJ4Wd] [^117TAg3q].

---

## Postoperative care

- **Pain management**: NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and topical anesthetics [^111DKR4P].
- **Bowel regimen**: Stool softeners and fiber to prevent constipation and straining [^114oBmgs].
- **Hygiene**: Sitz baths and gentle cleansing to promote healing [^114MqQ26].
- **Follow-up**: Routine check-in within 2–4 weeks to assess healing and address complications [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with conservative management

Conservative management includes stool softeners, fiber, topical analgesics, and sitz baths [^114MqQ26]. It is effective for mild symptoms or when surgery is contraindicated, but symptom resolution is slower (mean 24 days) and recurrence is higher (25.4%) than with excision [^112zbyiz]. Excision is **superior for rapid relief and durability**, especially within 72 hours [^111VpRR5].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Conservative management is first-line; excision under local anesthesia is reserved for severe, refractory cases [^116sx9fa].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Procedures are generally safe, but monitor closely for infection and wound healing issues [^111N2qmL].
- **Anticoagulation**: Coordinate anticoagulation management perioperatively to balance bleeding and thrombotic risks [^11234kF6].

---

Thrombosed hemorrhoidectomy is a **targeted excision** of thrombosed external hemorrhoids, most beneficial within 72 hours, providing rapid pain relief, low recurrence, and quick recovery. It is preferred over conservative care for severe or refractory cases, with complications that are uncommon and manageable.

### Hemorrhoidectomy: does age make a difference? [^112aoFxM]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Grade II and III hemorrhoids often require a multimodal approach that may ultimately culminate in surgical resection. Age and overall medical conditioning around the time of diagnosis can often impact the decision.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate patients with a diagnosis of symptomatic grade II or grade III hemorrhoids and determine progression to hemorrhoidectomy based on age and the time interval between diagnosis and surgical intervention.

Design

A retrospective cohort study.

Settings

Group practice at a single institution.

Patients

Patients aged 18 to 75 years with grade II or grade III internal hemorrhoids between 2015 and 2020 were included. Patients with thrombosed hemorrhoids or surgical contraindications to hemorrhoidectomy were excluded. A total of 961 patients met inclusion criteria for grade II (n = 442) and III (n = 519) hemorrhoids.

Intervention

Treatments included hemorrhoidectomy, in-office procedures, and/or medical management.

Main Outcome Measures

Baseline demographics, treatment choices, and time to hemorrhoidectomy (if applicable) were stratified and analyzed on the basis of hemorrhoid grade (grade II and III) and age groupings that were predetermined by the authors (18–30, 31–50, and 51–75 years).

Results

Patients with grade III versus grade II hemorrhoids were more likely to choose hemorrhoidectomy as the initial treatment management (27.6% vs 4.1%). Patients in the age groups of 18 to 30 and 30 to 50 years were more likely to choose hemorrhoidectomy as the initial treatment management compared to those in the age group of 51 to 75 years (23.5% and 22% vs 12.8%). In patients who were initially treated with medical management or office-based procedures and then progressed to hemorrhoidectomy, no significant differences in the length of time to hemorrhoidectomy were noted on the basis of hemorrhoid grade or age.

Limitations

Data only looked at age groups and their treatment selection. Personal biases of surgeon and patient may alter results.

Conclusions

Our study shows that the younger population tends to seek hemorrhoidectomy first over the older population. See Video Abstract.

### Hemorrhoidectomy for thrombosed external hemorrhoids [^114oBmgs]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

External hemorrhoids represent distended vascular tissue in the anal canal distal to the dentate line. Persons with thrombosed external hemorrhoids usually present with pain on standing, sitting or defecating. Acutely tender, thrombosed external hemorrhoids can be surgically removed if encountered within the first 72 hours after onset. Hemorrhoidectomy is performed through an elliptic incision over the site of thrombosis with removal of the entire diseased hemorrhoidal plexus in one piece. Caution must be exercised to avoid cutting into the muscle sphincter below the hemorrhoidal vessels. Infection after suture closure is rare secondary to the rich vascular network in the anal area. Stool softeners must be prescribed postoperatively to help prevent tearing at the suture line. Training and experience in general and skin surgery are necessary before the physician attempts this procedure unsupervised.

### Comparison of efficacy and safety between surgical and conservative treatments for hemorrhoids: a meta-analysis [^114NHaVw]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis highlights the trade-offs between surgery and conservative treatment. Although surgical intervention provides better symptom relief, faster recovery, and less recurrence, it also carries some specific post-treatment complications. On the other hand, conservative treatment is a safer and less invasive approach, but it provides slower symptom relief and higher recurrence rates. For special populations such as pregnant women with hemorrhoids, the decision to undergo surgical treatment remains a clinical challenge. Due to concerns about fetal safety and limited evidence, further research is needed to guide optimal treatment strategies in this group.

Limitation

Although this study provides valuable evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of surgical and conservative treatments in hemorrhoid management, it has certain limitations. First, the hemorrhoid grading of included patients was not uniformly and explicitly reported, the duration and definition of follow-up also varied across studies. This heterogeneity might introduce confounding effects on the study results, limiting the generalizability of the conclusions. Second, although our initial goal was to include more RCTs to enhance methodological rigor, only seven studies met the inclusion criteria, and among them, only three were strictly randomized controlled trials. The scarcity of RCTs directly comparing surgical and completely non-invasive conservative treatments likely reflects ethical and practical challenges in randomizing patients to treatment options. As a result, we included high-quality observational studies to ensure sufficient sample size and comprehensive outcome assessment. While this approach broadens the evidence base, it may also introduce inherent biases associated with non-randomized study designs, despite our efforts to rigorously assess study quality. Moreover, because the overall number of included studies was limited (< 10), formal assessment of publication bias was not conducted. However, we qualitatively reviewed study characteristics and found no obvious indications of selective reporting, though the possibility of publication bias cannot be ruled out. Besides, among the included studies, only one article investigated TEH in an acute setting. Other studies focused on symptomatic hemorrhoids without specifying whether treatment was elective or emergent. Therefore, the majority of our analysis pertains to mixed clinical settings, and findings may not be directly extrapolated to acute thrombosed cases. Lastly, there was considerable variation in the follow-up periods of the studies included, which could lead to bias in interpreting conclusions across different timeframes. These issues highlight directions for future research.

Thrombosed external hemorrhoid — urgent management — most patients who present urgently (within ~3 days of onset) with a thrombosed external hemorrhoid benefit from excision (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence), and most excisions can be safely performed in the office or emergency room, with an injection of a local anesthetic.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of hemorrhoids [^111VpRR5]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). High credibility.

External hemorrhoid thrombosis (EHT) urgent/emergent care — 6. Select patients with thrombosed external hemorrhoids may benefit from early surgical excision. Strength of recommendation: conditional based on low-quality evidence. In a randomized series of 50 patients, hemorrhoid excision reduced pain versus topical glyceryl trinitrate (p < 0.001) or thrombectomy (p < 0.01) on day 4, with no symptomatic difference at 1-month follow-up; at 1 year, recurrence was significantly lower after excision versus thrombectomy (p < 0.05) or topical glyceryl trinitrate (p < 0.05). In a retrospective review, 48.5% were treated surgically and 97.3% of these underwent excision of the thrombosed hemorrhoid or thrombectomy, while 51.5% received nonoperative care. Time to resolution of presenting symptoms was shorter with surgery (3.9 vs 24 days; p < 0.001). For nonoperative care in 504 consecutive EHT patients, the median time to symptom improvement was 5 days (range, 1–23 days) and to complete resolution was 8 days (range, 1–45 days).

### Hemorrhoids: diagnosis and treatment options [^114MqQ26]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Many Americans between 45 and 65 years of age experience hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoidal size, thrombosis, and location (i.e., proximal or distal to the dentate line) determine the extent of pain or discomfort. The history and physical examination must assess for risk factors and clinical signs indicating more concerning disease processes. Internal hemorrhoids are traditionally graded from I to IV based on the extent of prolapse. Other factors such as degree of discomfort, bleeding, comorbidities, and patient preference should help determine the order in which treatments are pursued. Medical management (e.g., stool softeners, topical over-the-counter preparations, topical nitroglycerine), dietary modifications (e.g., increased fiber and water intake), and behavioral therapies (sitz baths) are the mainstays of initial therapy. If these are unsuccessful, office-based treatment of grades I to III internal hemorrhoids with rubber band ligation is the preferred next step because it has a lower failure rate than infrared photocoagulation. Open or closed (conventional) excisional hemorrhoidectomy leads to greater surgical success rates but also incurs more pain and a prolonged recovery than office-based procedures; therefore, hemorrhoidectomy should be reserved for recurrent or higher-grade disease. Closed hemorrhoidectomy with diathermic or ultrasonic cutting devices may decrease bleeding and pain. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy elevates grade III or IV hemorrhoids to their normal anatomic position by removing a band of proximal mucosal tissue; however, this procedure has several potential postoperative complications. Hemorrhoidal artery ligation may be useful in grade II or III hemorrhoids because patients may experience less pain and recover more quickly. Excision of thrombosed external hemorrhoids can greatly reduce pain if performed within the first two to three days of symptoms.

### Comparison of efficacy and safety between surgical and conservative treatments for hemorrhoids: a meta-analysis [^113hV3Ws]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Hemorrhoids, a common anorectal condition, can be managed through surgical or conservative treatments. The aim of this meta-analysis is to compare the efficacy and safety of surgical and conservative treatments for hemorrhoids.

Methods

A systematic search was conducted from of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from their inception to September 25, 2024. Eligible studies compared surgical treatments with non-invasive conservative treatments in hemorrhoids. Statistical analyses included pooled odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences (MDs)/standard mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

Seven studies, including 760 patients, were analyzed. Surgery achieved higher rates of complete symptom resolution than conservative therapy (OR = 2.96, 95% CI: 1.66–5.28, p < 0.001). Overall pain scores favored surgery (SMD = -0.93, 95% CI: 1.73 to -0.13, p = 0.02). Subgroup analysis showed clear superiority within four days (SMD = -1.26, 95% CI -1.84 to -0.68) but parity beyond ten days (SMD = 0.00, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.44; p = 0.99). Comparable patterns were observed in pregnant women with thrombosed external hemorrhoids. Rates of postoperative bleeding (OR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.42 to 2.82, p = 0.86; I2 = 41%, p = 0.15) and urinary retention (OR: 1.75; 95% CI: 0.30 to 10.31, p = 0.54; I2 = 45%, p = 0.18) did not differ significantly between groups. Surgical-specific adverse events were infrequent (incontinence 3%, persistent pain 5%, watery discharge 6%). Surgery shortened recovery in pregnant thrombosed cases by approximately seven days (MD: -6.80; 95% CI: -7.64 to -5.96, p < 0.001; I2 = 55%, p = 0.14) and reduced overall recurrence (95% CI: 0.10 to 0.37, p < 0.001; I2 = 0%, p = 0.97).

Conclusion

Surgical treatments provide superior symptom relief, faster recovery, and lower recurrence but with some specific post-treatment complications, while conservative treatments are safer and less invasive but with provides slower symptom relief and higher recurrence rates. Individualized treatment should consider symptom severity, patient preferences, and risk tolerance.

Evaluation — history and examination: "A disease-specific history and physical examination should be performed, emphasizing the degree and duration of symptoms and risk factors. Strength of recommendation: strong based on low-quality evidence". The diagnosis of hemorrhoids is typically clinical, with "The cardinal sign of internal hemorrhoids is painless bleeding with bowel movements; patients may also complain of intermittent tissue protrusion", while "External hemorrhoids may be difficult to clean, resulting in prolonged contact of fecal material with the perianal skin and local irritation", and "Thrombosed external hemorrhoids present as painful, nonreducible lumps at the anal verge".

### Hemorrhoids [^111DKR4P]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Most patients with hemorrhoids experience only mild symptoms that can be treated with nonprescription topical preparations. Patients usually seek treatment when symptoms increase. Internal hemorrhoids typically present with prolapse or painless rectal bleeding. External hemorrhoids also bleed and can cause acute pain if thrombosed. Medical therapy should be initiated with stool softeners plus local therapy to relieve swelling and symptoms. If medical therapy is inadequate, surgical intervention is warranted. Rubber band ligation is the treatment of choice for grades 1 and 2 hemorrhoids. Rubber band ligation, excisional hemorrhoidectomy, or stapled hemorrhoidopexy can be performed in patients with grade 3 hemorrhoids. Rubber band ligation causes less postoperative pain and fewer complications than excisional hemorrhoidectomy and stapled hemorrhoidopexy, but has a higher recurrence rate. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy or stapled hemorrhoidopexy is recommended for treatment of grade 4 hemorrhoids. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy has a faster postoperative recovery, but a higher recurrence rate. Postoperative pain from excisional hemorrhoidectomy can be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, fiber supplements, and topical antispasmodics. Thrombosed external hemorrhoids can be treated conservatively or excised.

### Hemorrhoidal disease: a review [^112MKBGH]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hemorrhoidal disease, pathology of the tissue lining of the anal canal, affects approximately 10 million individuals in the US. Hemorrhoidal disease may impair quality of life due to bleeding, pain, anal irritation, and tissue prolapse.

Observations

Hemorrhoids are classified as internal, external, or mixed (concurrent internal and external hemorrhoidal disease). Internal hemorrhoids originate above the dentate line, the boundary between the upper and lower anal canal, and may cause rectal bleeding, discomfort, and tissue prolapse from the anal canal. Internal hemorrhoid prolapse is classified as grade I (into anal canal), grade II (beyond the anus with spontaneous reduction), grade III (requiring manual reduction), and grade IV (irreducible). External hemorrhoids, arising below the dentate line, cause rectal pain when engorged or thrombosed. Initial treatment of all hemorrhoidal disease involves increasing intake of dietary fiber and water and avoiding straining during defecation. Phlebotonics (eg, flavonoids [thought to improve venous tone]) reduce bleeding, rectal pain, and swelling, although symptom recurrence reaches 80% within 3 to 6 months after treatment cessation. If dietary modification and phlebotonics are ineffective, grade I to grade III internal hemorrhoidal disease can be treated with office-based interventions. Rubber band ligation-placing a band around the base of hemorrhoid tissue during anoscopy to restrict blood flow-resolves symptoms in 89% of patients, but repeated banding is needed in up to 20%. Sclerotherapy, which induces fibrosis with a sclerosant injection, is efficacious in the short term (weeks to months) among 70% to 85% of patients, but long-term remission occurs in only one-third of patients. Infrared coagulation uses heat to coagulate hemorrhoidal tissue, yielding 70% to 80% success in reducing bleeding and prolapse. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy, for disease unresponsive to office-based therapy or for mixed hemorrhoidal disease, achieves low recurrence (2%-10%), although with longer recovery (9–14 days). External hemorrhoidal disease rarely requires surgery unless acutely thrombosed. Outpatient clot evacuation within 72 hours of onset of a thrombosed external hemorrhoid is associated with decreased pain and reduced risk of repeat thrombosis. Patients presenting more than 72 hours after external hemorrhoid acute thrombosis should receive medical treatment (eg, stool softeners, oral and topical analgesics such as 5% lidocaine).

Conclusions and Relevance

Hemorrhoidal disease affects 10 million people in the US. First-line treatment is increased fiber intake, avoidance of straining during defecation, and phlebotonics. In-office rubber band ligation for grade I to III internal hemorrhoid disease is first-line procedural treatment for persistent symptoms despite conservative therapies. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy is recommended for grade III to IV prolapse, thrombosis, or mixed hemorrhoidal disease that does not improve with less invasive approaches.

### Stapled technique for acute thrombosed hemorrhoids: a randomized, controlled trial with long-term results [^115Hnu1f]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study was designed to compare stapled vs. conventional hemorrhoidectomy for patients with acute thrombosed hemorrhoids.

Methods

Forty-one patients with acute thrombosed hemorrhoids were randomized into: 1) stapled hemorrhoidectomy (PPH group; n = 21), and 2) open hemorrhoidectomy (open group; n = 20). Emergency surgery was performed with perioperative data and complications were recorded. Patients were followed up by independent assessors to evaluate pain, recurrence, continence function, and satisfaction at regular intervals.

Results

The median follow-up for the PPH group and open group were 59 and 56 weeks, respectively. There was no significant difference in terms of the hospital stay, complication rate, and continence function; however, the mean pain intensity in the first postoperative week was significantly less in the PPH group (4.1 vs. 5.7, P = 0.02). Patients in the PPH group recovered significantly faster in terms of the time to become analgesic-free (4 vs. 8.5 days, P < 0.01), time to become pain-free (9 vs. 20.5 days, P = 0.01), resumption of work (7 vs. 12.5 days, P = 0.01), and time for complete wound healing (2 vs. 4 weeks, P < 0.01). On long-term follow-up, significantly fewer patients in the PPH group complained of recurrent symptoms (0 vs. 5, P = 0.02). The overall symptom improvement and patients' satisfaction were significantly better in the PPH group (90 vs. 80 percent, P = 0.03 and +3 vs. +2, P < 0.01 respectively).

Conclusions

Stapled hemorrhoidectomy is safe and effective for acute thrombosed hemorrhoids. Similar to elective stapled procedure, emergency stapled excision has greater short-term benefits compared with conventional excision: diminished pain, faster recovery, and earlier return to work. Long-term results and satisfaction were excellent.

### Guidelines, guidelines and more guidelines for haemorrhoid treatment: a review to sort the wheat from the chaff [^113RZqJA]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Eligibility criteria

Articles were eligible if they were guidelines following the Institute of Medicine definition.

We focused on guidelines published from January 2011 to the date of the last search of 1 October 2021, with the most up to date guideline version being selected if there was more than one. We excluded guidelines not focused solely on haemorrhoids, expert reviews, other forms of recommendations (e.g. quality indicators) and guidelines published in a language other than English.

Search

The electronic databases used for the search included Embase, MEDLINE and CINAHL. The search strategy included words relating to haemorrhoids, guidelines, clinical standards and quality standards (combination of keywords tailored to each database). See Data S1 for the exact syntax searches. An additional search of the grey literature was carried out on Guidelines International Network, CPG InfoBase, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network and Google Scholar (first 80 pages).

Study selection process

Four reviewers (HTM, AC, BB, CG) independently screened the title and abstracts of the papers for eligibility, with questions and disagreements referred to a clinical specialist (SRB). Full texts of potentially eligible papers were retrieved and screened against the eligibility criteria.

Data extraction

Four reviewers (HTM, AC, BB, AES) independently reviewed and extracted descriptive data from the guidelines. Data were extracted on organization and country. Recommendations were classified under medical therapy (lifestyle, laxatives, phlebotonics, sitz baths and topical), office therapy (banding, sclerotherapy, others), surgery (excisional haemorrhoidectomy, haemorrhoidopexy, haemorrhoidal artery ligation, others) and special situations (pregnancy, thrombosed haemorrhoids, anticoagulants, impaired immunity, Crohn's, radiation proctitis, portal hypertension).

### Thrombosed external hemorrhoids: outcome after conservative or surgical management [^112zbyiz]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Few data exist on the actual recurrence rates of thrombosed external hemorrhoids. We wished to determine the incidence of recurrence, intervals to recurrence, and factors predicting recurrence of thrombosed external hemorrhoids after conservative or surgical management.

Methods

Two hundred and thirty-one consecutive patients with thrombosed external hemorrhoids treated from 1990 to 2002 were identified. Recurrence was defined as complete resolution of the index lesion with subsequent return of a thrombosed external hemorrhoid and did not include patients with chronic symptoms. Data were gathered retrospectively. Multiple potential risk factors were reviewed.

Results

The index thrombosed external hemorrhoid was managed conservatively in 51.5 percent of cases and surgically in 48.5 percent. There were no differences between groups in gender, age, or race, and 44.5 percent of all patients had a prior history of thrombosed external hemorrhoid. A prior history was less common in the conservative group than in the surgical group (38.1 percent vs. 51.3 percent; P < 0.05). The frequency of pain or bleeding as the primary complaint was higher in the surgical group (P < 0.001 and P < 0.002). In addition, the surgical group was more likely to report all three symptoms of pain, bleeding, and a lump (P < 0.005). Mean follow-up was 7.6 months, with the range extending to 7 years. Time to symptom resolution averaged 24 days in the conservative group vs. 3.9 days in the surgical group (P < 0.0001). The overall incidence to recurrence was 15.6 percent-80.6 percent in the conservative group vs. 19.4 percent in the surgical group. The rate of recurrence in the conservative group was 25.4 percent (4/29; 14 percent were excised) whereas only 6.3 percent of the surgical patients had recurrence (P < 0.0001). Mean time to recurrence was 7.1 months in the conservative group vs. 25 months in the surgical group (P < 0.0001). Survival analysis for time to recurrence of thrombosed external hemorrhoid indicated that time to recurrence was significantly longer for the surgical group (P < 0.0001). Logistic regression analysis of multiple factors (including diverticular disease, constipation, straining, benign prostatic hypertrophy, diarrhea, skin tags, history of travel, anoreceptive sex, anal fissures, internal hemorrhoids, and obesity) was performed to determine the outcome of each group. None of these variables were significant predictors of recurrence.

Conclusions

Patients whose initial presentation was pain or bleeding with or without a lump were more like to be treated surgically. Surgically treated patients had a lower frequency of recurrence and a longer time interval to recurrence than conservatively treated patients. None of the variables analyzed were significant predictors of a particular treatment, except for a prior history of thrombosed external hemorrhoids, which may represent patient choice. Although most patients treated conservatively will experience resolution of their symptoms, excision of thrombosed external hemorrhoids results in more rapid symptom resolution, lower incidence of recurrence, and longer remission intervals.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^112zEGJi]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Focusing on thrombosed hemorrhoids, the studies comparing non-operative management (NOM) and surgery led to contrasting results. A prospective study from Allan et al. compared the outcome of urgent hemorrhoidectomy with conservative treatment for prolapsed thrombosed internal hemorrhoids and found that conservative treatment was associated with shorter patient stay and less anal sphincter damage compared with operative treatment. On the other hand, other studies suggest that surgery may be superior to conservative management, but the correct duration of NOM and the timing for surgery are not known, as confirmed by the literature research performed by Chan et al. Patients treated conservatively will eventually have a resolution of symptoms, but recurrence rate is high and there is some evidence that surgical excision may result in more rapid symptom resolution, lower incidence of recurrence, and longer remission intervals. Simple incision of thrombosed hemorrhoids with clot removal used to be a popular procedure but has been abandoned by most specialists because of persistent bleeding and the significantly higher recurrence rates seen. A randomized prospective study by Cavcić et al. divided 150 patients with acutely thrombosed hemorrhoids into three different arms: topical application of 0.2% nitroglycerin, incision and evacuation of thrombus, and excision of the hemorrhoid; the analysis of pains scores on day 4 after treatment showed that thrombus evacuation provided the worst results. Another study from Greenspoon et al. retrospectively reviewed 231 patients who underwent treatment for external hemorrhoid thrombosis from 1990 to 2002, of which 51.5% was managed conservatively and 48.5% underwent surgical treatment. Interestingly, they found a significantly shorter time to symptom resolution in patients treated surgically (3.9 days vs 24 days), as well as a reduced incidence of recurrence (6.3% vs 25.4%). In this study, patients were allowed to choose between excision or conservative therapy and the authors stated that "the decision to manage patients surgically reflects both patient and physician preference". Jongen et al. retrospectively analyzed 340 patients undergoing excision of thrombosed external hemorrhoids under local anesthesia between 1995 and 2000 and concluded that outpatient excision under local anesthesia can be safely performed with a low recurrence and complication rate. On the other hand, Ceulemans et al. compared results after elective and emergency hemorrhoidectomy and found that early complications, reoperation, and late anal stenosis were more common after emergency than elective hemorrhoidectomy. Older work by Eu et al. confirm the increased rate of late anal stenosis after emergency hemorrhoidectomy, but found similar results in terms of recurrence and other complications. A couple of other studies tried to answer the question of whether stapled hemorrhoidectomy was comparable to conventional hemorrhoidectomy for thrombosed hemorrhoids. These four studies are prospective and randomized but are based on small cohorts of patients (maximum 40 patients per arm); their conclusions are similar, reporting better results after stapled hemorrhoidectomy in terms of less postoperative pain, shorter operation time and hospital stay, and earlier return to normal activity.

### Benign anorectal disease: hemorrhoids, fissures, and fistulas [^116THuDu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Surgical treatment

Surgical treatment is indicated for grade III or IV internal hemorrhoids and for thrombosed external hemorrhoids with persistent symptoms. Excision is recommended within the first 48 h of symptoms for thrombosed external hemorrhoids. Incision and drainage is ineffective, and complete excision of the hemorrhoid with the associated external skin is advised. This procedure can take place in the clinic or in an emergency care setting with local anesthesia. A retrospective review of 231 patients comparing excision to non-operative treatment of thrombosed external hemorrhoids showed that excision symptoms resolved on average in 3.9 days (vs. 24 days in the non-operative group) and were less likely to recur.

Acute hemorrhoid crisis is rare, and will appear as beefy red, ulcerated or necrotic hemorrhoids on examination. This occurs when internal hemorrhoids prolapse and become incarcerated as a result of sphincter spasm and warrants hospital admission. It is not uncommon to have concurrent thrombosed external hemorrhoids. Most patients with acute hemorrhoid crisis benefit from hospitalization and conservative management, including bowel rest, pain control and sitz baths. Necrotic hemorrhoids and/or perineal sepsis are indications for urgent exploration and excision.

### Prospective randomised study of urgent haemorrhoidectomy compared with non-operative treatment in the management of prolapsed thrombosed internal haemorrhoids [^115Rn5fA]. Colorectal Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the outcome of urgent haemorrhoidectomy with conservative treatment for prolapsed thrombosed internal haemorrhoids.

Methods

A prospective randomised study of 50 patients with prolapsed thrombosed internal haemorrhoids was carried out using clinical and ultrasonic outcome measures. Peri-operative bed occupancy and the presence of symptoms at 6 and 24 months were compared. Endoanal ultrasonic scanning was carried out to investigate anal sphincter integrity in those patients willing to be studied.

Results

The median length of hospital stay for the group treated conservatively; 2 nights (range 1–9 nights) was significantly shorter than for the group treated by urgent haemorrhoidectomy; 4 nights (range 1–12 nights, P < 0.01). There was no difference between treatment groups in the number of patients with symptoms at six or 24 months. Urgent haemorrhoidectomy was associated with a significantly higher incidence of endosonographically detected anal sphincter damage in 18 patients: 66%vs 0% (P = 0.009).

Conclusion

Conservative treatment for prolapsed thrombosed internal haemorrhoids is associated with shorter in patient stay and less anal sphincter damage compared with operative treatment.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^114oZaux]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

No recommendation can be made regarding the role of office-based procedures (i.e. rubber band ligation, sclerotherapy, infrared coagulation) in complicated hemorrhoids, based on the available literature.

The literature regarding the utilization of office-based procedures (i.e. rubber band ligation, injection sclerotherapy, infrared coagulation, cryotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, laser therapy, etcetera) is significant but generally heterogeneous and of low quality: the number of published studies is enormous and the definition of bleeding or symptomatic hemorrhoids is always unclear. Regarding sclerotherapy, there are anecdotal reports of its application in patients with acutely bleeding hemorrhoids.

For these reasons, there is not enough quality data to make any recommendation regarding the application of office-based procedures to manage complicated hemorrhoids.
3.F - in patients with complicated hemorrhoids, what are the indications for surgical treatment and what is the appropriate timing for surgery?

In patients with thrombosed hemorrhoids, we suggest to base the decision between non-operative management and early surgical excision on local expertise and patient's preference (weak recommendation based on low quality evidence, 2C).

In patients with thrombosed hemorrhoids, we suggest against the use of incision and drainage of the thrombus (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

No recommendation can be made regarding the role of surgery in patients with bleeding hemorrhoids, based on the available literature.

Despite the high incidence of complicated hemorrhoids among the general population, there are only few studies on the surgical treatment of thrombosed hemorrhoids and none on bleeding hemorrhoids. Furthermore, the definitions of "thrombosed hemorrhoids", "hemorrhoidal crisis", "prolapsed hemorrhoids", and "bleeding hemorrhoids" are multiple and confusing, and most of the currently available studies focus on chronic complaints and elective procedures. The evidence is thus scarce and of low quality, making it extremely difficult to provide evidence-based recommendations.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^111g48kP]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, based on the paucity of available studies and on the small numbers of patients included, we believe that hemorrhoidectomy can be beneficial in selected patients and the decision between NOM and early surgical excision should be based on physician's expertise and patient's preference; furthermore, we suggest against the use of incision and drainage of the thrombus, given the higher incidence of bleeding and relapse of symptoms. The evidence about stapled hemorrhoidectomy is scarce and, also given the potential for life-threatening complications of this procedure in the elective setting, we do not make any recommendation for its application in an acute care - emergency setting.

This literature review could not identify any data regarding the role of surgery for bleeding hemorrhoids, so we cannot make any recommendations in this setting.
3.G - in patients with complicated hemorrhoids, what is the role of angiography?

No recommendation can be made regarding the role of angiography in complicated hemorrhoids, based on the available literature.

There is growing evidence that angiography and angioembolization could have a role for the treatment of hemorrhoids in an elective setting. The reported results are encouraging, but there are not enough data to make any recommendation regarding its application to an acute care - emergency setting.
4) Bleeding anorectal varices 4. A - in patients with suspected bleeding anorectal varices, what is the role of clinical examination and biochemical investigations?

In patients with suspected bleeding anorectal varices, we suggest to collect a focused medical history and to perform a complete physical examination, including a digital rectal examination, to rule out other causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

Haemorrhoids

Question 9.11

How should acutely thrombosed piles be managed in the emergency setting?

Recommendation: Acutely thrombosed or strangulated haemorrhoids should initially be managed non‐operatively in the majority of cases.

Level of evidence IV

Grade of recommendation D

Consensus: 100% (SA 100%)

Recommendation: In a very small number of patients who have ulcerated or ischaemic haemorrhoids a limited acute haemorrhoidectomy could be considered by an appropriately competent surgeon.

Level of evidence IV

Grade of recommendation D

Consensus: 100% (SA 66.8%, A 33.3%)

Haemorrhoids may become acutely thrombosed or strangulated and cause considerable pain. This is usually an acute event on a background of known haemorrhoidal disease and has a natural history with a peak of symptoms during the first week although symptoms may persist for much longer. The venous congestion and oedema associated with acute strangulation drive a conservative approach to management which includes bed rest, topical analgesia, ice packs, stool softeners and a myriad other interventions (warm baths, topical sugar, Trendelenburg position etc.).

### Hemorrhoids: what are the options in 2018? [^115TLNVQ]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Efforts continue to improve the treatment of patients with symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease by interventions designed to improve efficiency and effectiveness, including by reducing intraoperative and postoperative pain, decreasing operating times, minimizing blood loss and controlling symptoms and recurrence rates. Simultaneously, there are also renewed efforts to minimize the number of patients who will require procedural intervention by focusing on conservative measures that encourage better bowel regulation and habits. The purpose of this brief report is to review the current status of the diagnosis and treatment of patients with hemorrhoidal disease. Overall, new procedures or procedural refinements to existing techniques continue to be introduced with promising short-term outcomes - at least in some instances. In most instances, long-term follow-up or equivalency data are still being accumulated such that a definitive, unequivocal answer to what is truly the best alternative to traditional hemorrhoidectomy remains controversial. One of the challenges is heterogeneity as regards diagnosis, intervention and, especially, outcomes measures such that comparing therapies is too difficult. A recent initiative to standardize metrics has promise.

Recent Findings

Recent studies largely appear to suggest that conservative treatment approaches and managing patient expectations are critically important in which a primary objective should be to minimize the progression to symptomatic disease and complications in patients who are diagnosed with hemorrhoids. The pace of change as regards the development of new or improved surgical techniques appears may be accelerating.

Summary

Progress is being made and the knowledge base is being expanded as regards the treatment options for patients with hemorrhoids and expected outcomes. A key initiative to standardize the approaches to diagnosis and treatment about staging, procedural interventions and outcomes will facilitate comparative analytics, if successful.

### Guidelines, guidelines and more guidelines for haemorrhoid treatment: a review to sort the wheat from the chaff [^114HYDSc]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Synthesis of results

There was significant variation in all aspects of key recommendations for each of the nine guidelines and these are summarized in Table 2. Particular areas are commented on below.

TABLE 2
Summary of guideline variation for individual recommendations

Note

Non‐operative management

Topical agents are recommended for symptom relief by all guidelines except the Belgian guidelines. Only the Portuguese and Indian guidelines emphasize avoiding long‐term topical agents. A sitz bath is only recommended by four guidelines.

Whilst the use of phlebotonics is recommended by most guidelines the European and Belgian guidelines comment on the weakness of the evidence and phlebotonics are not mentioned in the Japanese or Danish guidelines.

Office procedures

Rubber band ligation is mentioned by all. However, there is some variation in recommendation based on individual grade of haemorrhoids. All appear to agree that grade II haemorrhoids are an indication. The treatment is recommended for grade I haemorrhoids by some but not by others. Whilst some guidelines recommend rubber band ligation for all grade III haemorrhoids, others recommend selective treatment or treatment is not recommended.

There is variation in the recommendation of injection sclerotherapy, with one guideline not recommending use at all. There was no consensus amongst the other guidelines as to which grade of haemorrhoid that injection sclerotherapy should be used.

Surgical management

Surgical management was mentioned in all but one guideline. However, there was significant variation in the grade of haemorrhoid recommended for surgical interventions. This included haemorrhoidopexy being recommended for only grade III haemorrhoids, only grades II–III haemorrhoids or all grades Similarly, haemorrhoidectomy was recommended for grades III–IV haemorrhoids in some guidelines, yet recommended for all grades in another. For Doppler‐guided haemorrhoidal artery ligation, half the guidelines recommended this procedure for grades III–IV haemorrhoids, one suggested the procedure was not appropriate for grade IV two guidelines recommended the procedure for grades II and III haemorrhoids and one made no recommendation.

Special situations

In general, there was consensus that conservative management was recommended for special situations, such as haemorrhoids in pregnancy, inflammatory bowel disease, portal hypertension, immunocompromised, post irradiation therapy and thrombosed external haemorrhoids. Nevertheless, mention of these situations was completely absent in one guideline. The detail within recommendations varied. For example, recommendations for the treatment for patients on anticoagulants ranged from extensive to brief to absent.

### Circumferential excisional hemorrhoidectomy for extensive acute thrombosis: a 14-year experience [^113oRDsL]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrence and/or complications after 3-quadrant hemorrhoidectomy or stapled hemorrhoidopexy still remain a challenging problem. This challenge is even greater for massive hemorrhoidal thrombosis leading to edema, ulceration, and/or gangrene. To address this challenge, we developed a further modification of the Whitehead procedure termed circumferential excisional hemorrhoidectomy. The proposed procedure allows access to a submucoanodermal/skin workspace that provides a "view from inside" the hemorrhoidal disease, and therefore facilitates the precise excision of even each hemorrhoidal vein while preserving the overlying normal tissues.

Objective

This study aimed to describe the circumferential excisional hemorrhoidectomy procedure and to demonstrate its results in patients presenting with total hemorrhoidal thrombosis. DESIGN, SETTINGS, PATIENTS: This prospective, descriptive study was conducted with 294 consecutive patients who underwent urgent circumferential excisional hemorrhoidectomy at our coloproctological center from January 1996 to June 2009.

Intervention

Circumferential excisional hemorrhoidectomy involves the stripping and excision of hemorrhoids from the submucoanodermal space with reconstruction of the anal canal by the use of an undermined irregular/zigzag-shaped mucoanodermal flap and accurately trimmed skin.

Main Outcome Measures

The main outcome measures were the surgical outcomes and complications.

Results

The mean patient age was 41.7 for both sexes. There were 215 men and 79 women. The mean operative time was 26.4 (range, 17–43) minutes. In terms of postoperative complications, there were 39 (13.2%) urinary retentions, 1 (0.3%) fecal impaction, and 3 (1%) delayed complete wound epithelization. The mean hospital stay was 3.1 (range, 2–5) days, and the mean time off from work was 10 (range, 7–18) days. At the fifth week after surgery, digital rectal examination revealed easily dilated mild stricture in 26 (8.8%) patients. At a mean follow-up of 6.8 (range, 2–14) years, 271 (92.2%) accessible patients were actually symptom-free.

Limitation

This study did not have a control group.

Conclusion

Circumferential excisional hemorrhoidectomy is an anatomically safe surgical procedure with a low rate of complications and no recurrences, even after a long-term follow-up.

Hemorrhoids — diagnostic assessment and grading — gastroenterologists and other providers should diagnose hemorrhoids by history and physical examination, and if there is bleeding, the source often requires confirmation by endoscopic studies (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Physical examination should include visual inspection of the anus, both at rest and while straining, and digital examination for other anal pathology, and internal hemorrhoids can be assigned a functional grade based on their history: first-degree hemorrhoids do not prolapse, second-degree hemorrhoids prolapse but self-reduce, third-degree hemorrhoids protrude and require manual reduction, and fourth-degree hemorrhoids protrude and cannot be reduced. Laboratory testing is almost never helpful, and the clinical diagnosis of hemorrhoids usually includes hemorrhoid-pattern bleeding that mandates at least sigmoidoscopy to rule out other sources of bleeding; in patients over the age of 50 years or with a suggestive family history, this may be the occasion for evaluation of the entire colon, usually by colonoscopy. Hemorrhoids without symptoms are not diagnosed by flexible endoscopy, and a thrombosed external hemorrhoid is easily recognized on physical examination as a usually tender blue lump at the anal verge, and no other workup or classification is needed.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of hemorrhoids [^11234kF6]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). High credibility.

Rubber band ligation (RBL) for hemorrhoids — In a 2005 Cochrane review of 3 RCTs (n = 202), surgical hemorrhoidectomy was associated with increased pain (RR 1.94; 95% CI, 1.62–2.33) and complications (RR 6.32; 95% CI, 1.15–34.89) compared with RBL. A meta-analysis found RBL significantly better than sclerotherapy for treatment response and no different in complication rates (p = 0.35); patients treated with sclerotherapy (p = 0.031) or infrared coagulation (IRC; p = 0.0014) were more likely to require further therapy than those treated with RBL, although pain was greater after RBL (p = 0.03 vs sclerotherapy; p < 0.0001 vs IRC). In a single-center retrospective study of 2635 patients, 86.7% were asymptomatic at their 8- week follow-up visit; 22.5% had complications (16.1% pain; 2.8% mild to significant bleeding), and at 2-year follow-up 15.5% reported symptomatic recurrence with repeat RBL in 66.9% or surgical hemorrhoidectomy in 33.1%. Severe bleeding is noted as a rare (~1%) major complication. For patients on antithrombotic therapy, a 2017 systematic review suggested increased risk of massive bleeding, whereas a retrospective case-control cohort of 82 patients undergoing 153 bandings on clopidogrel found no significant difference in bleeding events (3.7% vs 2.7%; p = 0.73). The risk of bleeding should be weighed against thrombotic risk, and clinicians should consider, when possible, pausing antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy; in selected patients on anticoagulant, alternative treatment such as injection sclerotherapy can be considered.

### Hemorrhoidectomy and excision of skin tags in IBD: harbinger of doom or simply a disease running its course? [^115ALy6H]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Controversy in performing hemorrhoidectomy and anal skin tag excision in patients with IBD stems from dated reports of nonhealing wounds resulting in proctectomy.

Objective

This study aimed to determine the safety of interventional management of hemorrhoids or anal skin tags in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.

Design

This study is a retrospective review of patient records from 2000 to 2017.

Setting

The patient records were retrieved from a multistate health system.

Patients

Adult patients with IBD undergoing interventional management of hemorrhoids or skin tags were included.

Main Outcome Measure

The primary outcome measured was the long-term requirement of proctectomy.

Results

Ninety-seven patients (n = 49 Crohn's disease, 48 ulcerative colitis) underwent interventional management of hemorrhoids or anal skin tags (n = 35 rubber band ligation, 27 anal skin tag excision, 21 hemorrhoidectomy, 14 excision/incision of thrombosed hemorrhoid). Thirty-day complications were observed in 5 patients (n = 4 urinary retention, 1 perianal abscess). Five patients with Crohn's disease eventually required proctectomy at a median of 7 years after skin tag excision (range, 6 months to 10 years), but none were secondary to impaired wound healing. Two patients with ulcerative colitis who had previously undergone IPAA were subsequently diagnosed with Crohn's disease of the pouch after skin tag excision. No other long-term complications were seen in patients with ulcerative colitis.

Limitations

The study's retrospective design does not allow identification of patients with IBD who underwent only medical management of their hemorrhoids. There is also selection bias in which patients were selected for interventional management of their disease.

Conclusions

The requirement for proctectomy after hemorrhoidectomy/skin tag excision appears to be secondary to the natural disease course of perianal Crohn's disease rather than perianal intervention. Selective hemorrhoidectomy and skin tag excision in patients with well-controlled luminal disease should be considered. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/B55.

Cinco pacientes con enfermedad de Crohn requirieron proctectomía en una media de 7 años después de la excisión de los plicomas ano-cutáneos (rango, 6 meses a 10 años), pero ninguno fue secundario a la mala cicatrización de la herida. Dos pacientes con colitis ulcerosa que previamente se habían sometido a una anastomosis colo-anal protegia por ilestomía fueron diagnosticados posteriormente con enfermedad de Crohn localizada en la ostomía después de la excisión de plicomas ano-cutáneos. No se observaron complicaciones a largo plazo en pacientes con colitis ulcerosa. El diseño retrospectivo del estudio no permite la identificación de pacientes con enfermedad inflamatoria intestinal que se sometieron únicamente al tratamiento médico de las hemorroides. También existe un sesgo de selección de pacientes escogidos para tratamiento instrumental de la enfermedad hemorroidaria. El requisito de proctectomía después de la hemorroidectomía / excisión de plicomas anocutáneos parece ser secundario al curso de la enfermedad natural de la enfermedad de Crohn perianal en el sitio de la intervención perianal. Se debe considerar la hemorroidectomía selectiva y la excisión de plicomas ano-cutáneos solo en pacientes con enfermedad endoluminal controlada.

### Laser hemorrhoidoplasty versus hemorrhoidectomy in the treatment of surgically indicated hemorrhoids in inflammatory bowel patients: a randomized comparative clinical study [^117TFRoM]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Indications for surgery included failure and non-compliance of medical treatment, severe pain and bleeding, and previous attacks of thrombosed hemorrhoids.

Perioperative and operative steps:

An outpatient with hemorrhoids underwent a pre-operative examination to assess the grade and number of hemorrhoids. Patients fasted for 6 h and were admitted for day-case surgery without bowel preparation. Patients received spinal anesthesia and were placed in the lithotomy position. Group I underwent laser hemorrhoidoplasty. Group II underwent ligation and excision for hemorrhoids (hemorrhoidectomy). All cases operated by the same surgeon.

Laser hemorrhoidoplasty was performed in pulsed mode using a curved laser fiber probe. Laser fiber was delivered directly to the hemorrhoidal node from outside at the mucocutaneous junction and then passed into the sub-mucosal plane until reaching the dentate line. The hemorrhoidal plexus was coagulated in a sequential manner using pulsed mode. Ice packs were applied to beamed areas, which had a cooling effect, resulting in reduced pain and edema. The shrinkage of hemorrhoids was noticed immediately. Each hemorrhoid required approximately 250–300 J in pulsed mode. Anal packing was unnecessary.

Certainty of evidence — GRADE framework determined the final grade of recommendation and level of evidence using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The certainty of evidence reflects the extent of our confidence in the estimates of effect, and evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) start as high certainty while evidence from observational studies start as low certainty. For each outcome, the evidence is graded as high, moderate, low, or very low, recommendations are influenced by risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias, and the certainty of evidence based on observational studies can be rated up when there is a large magnitude of effect or dose–response relationship.

### Guidelines, guidelines and more guidelines for haemorrhoid treatment: a review to sort the wheat from the chaff [^113YGjpP]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

Guidelines benefit patients and clinicians by distilling evidence into easy-to-read recommendations. The literature around the management of haemorrhoids is immense and guidelines are invaluable to improve treatment integrity and patient outcomes. We identified current haemorrhoid guidelines and assessed them for quality and consistency.

Methods

A systematic search of the literature from January 2011 to October 2021 was carried out. Guidelines identified were assessed for quality using the AGREE II instrument and for consistency in terms of tabulated treatment recommendations.

Results

During this period nine guidelines were identified worldwide. The general quality was poor with only one guideline considered of high enough quality for use. In general, expert selection criteria for guideline development groups were vaguely defined. There were inconsistencies in the interpretation of the published evidence leading to variation in treatment recommendations.

Discussion

Fewer, higher quality guidelines, with more consistent results, are needed. Particular attention should be given to defining the selection of experts involved.

### Surgical outcomes of ligaSure hemorrhoidectomy in the elderly population: a retrospective cohort study [^116kAxJi]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Ethics statement

This study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital and registered under the Declaration of Helsinki. Furthermore, all the study protocols have been reported in line with the STROCSS criteria.

Study population

Patients whose symptomatic prolapsed hemorrhoids were managed by the LigaSure hemorrhoidectomy in our hospital between January 2015 and May 2017 was retrospectively reviewed. Among these patients, 1075 were aged under 65 years (group 1), and 163 were aged 65 years old or older (group 2). Both groups were compared for baseline characteristics (sex, hemorrhoids grade, ASA grade, and preoperative hemoglobin) and surgical outcomes (operative time, postoperative pain score, analgesic consumption, hospital stay, follow-up times, complications, re-admission, and re-operation rates). Patients who had acute thrombosed or strangulated hemorrhoids, previous perianal surgery, recurrent cases, or any other anorectal disorders such as fistula or fissure were excluded.

The grading system (I-V) of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) was used to evaluate the general condition of the patients before surgery. If the patients had a history of cardiovascular disease and were receiving anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs, they were instructed to discontinue taking the medication for at least 1 week before surgery. They did not restart the medication until 1 week after the operation.

### Excision of thrombosed external hemorrhoid under local anesthesia: a retrospective evaluation of 340 patients [^117TAg3q]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study was a retrospective analysis of complication rates, symptom recurrence, long-term results, and patient satisfaction after outpatient excision (local anesthesia) of thrombosed external hemorrhoids.

Methods

From 1995 to 2000, 340 patients (166 males) underwent office-based excision of thrombosed external hemorrhoids under local anesthesia. Data regarding complications, operations because of recurrence, residual symptoms, patient's satisfaction with anesthesia, and wound treatment were obtained by questionnaire. Response was solicited at a minimum of 9 months postprocedure.

Results

Complete follow-up data was available in 88 percent of patients (mean follow-up, 17.3 months). Recurrent thrombosed external hemorrhoid requiring a procedure developed in 22 (6.5 percent) patients. Other complications that required operative intervention were one (0.3 percent) incidence of postoperative bleeding and seven (2.1 percent) perianal abscess/fistula. The majority of patients (66 percent) had no anal complaints at follow-up. Local anesthesia would be preferred if a repeat excision was required in 79 percent, whereas 11 percent would prefer another form of anesthesia and 10 percent were unsure.

Conclusion

Outpatient excision under local anesthesia of a thrombosed external hemorrhoid can be safely performed with a low recurrence and complication rate while offering a high level of patient of acceptance and satisfaction.

No recommendation can be made regarding the role of biochemical investigations in patients with suspected thrombosed or strangulated hemorrhoids, based on the available literature.

In patients with suspected bleeding hemorrhoids, we suggest to collect a focused medical history and to perform a complete physical examination, including a digital rectal examination, to rule out other causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

In patients with suspected bleeding hemorrhoids, we suggest to check vital signs, to determine hemoglobin and hematocrit, and to assess coagulation to evaluate the severity of the bleeding (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C). In case of severe bleeding, we suggest blood typing and cross-matching (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidence, 2D).

### Insights into the management of anorectal disease in the coronavirus 2019 disease era [^111vVFAe]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Anorectal emergencies

The American College of Surgeons recognize acute hemorrhoidal thrombosis/necrosis, peri- anal/perirectal abscess, and Fournier gangrene (perineal necrotizing fasciitis) as surgical emergencies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The conditions should be managed with emergency surgery as there is no substitute treatment, and any delay in the procedure will increase hospital stay, morbidity, and mortality. If there are limited resources in hospital during the pandemic, then these cases should be transferred early to facilities with the capacity to perform emergency surgery. Other notable emergent conditions are bleeding rectal varices, foreign body, and rectal obstruction with cancers. The management of these conditions should not deviate from standard treatments.

Urgent hemorrhoidectomy is recommended for acute hemorrhoid thrombosis and strangulation. The perianal/perirectal abscess should be drained in the operating theater if the abscess is deep. If the operating room is unavailable then outpatient percutaneous drainage should be considered. Early surgical debridement with intravenous hydration and antibiotics are the standard treatment for perineal necrotizing fasciitis. Diversion colostomy is required in few cases to avoid fecal contamination.

Rectal varices can sometimes present with massive lower GI bleeding, requiring emergent volume resuscitation, correction of coagulopathy, and blood transfusion. The endoscopic management of rectal varices can be challenging, and is usually done with band ligation or sclerotherapy with high recurrence rate. The trans-jugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) procedure is considered in severe cases to decrease portal pressure.

The rectal foreign body is also seen as a traumatic rectal emergency. It can be caused due to accident, sexual pleasure, and/or assault. Diagnosis can be difficult as sometimes patients do not provide the complete history. It can complicate to rectal perforation, infection, pain, and bleeding. Rectal examination and radiology testing can be helpful. The foreign body should be removed trans-anally, endoscopically, or surgically with goal of minimizing trauma.

Antibiotic treatment of FG should be prompt and aggressive, starting empiric antimicrobial therapy as soon as the diagnosis is considered. Initial coverage should be broad, including for gram-positive, gram-negative, aerobic and anaerobic organisms and, based on local epidemiology, an anti-methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) agent. Microbiological samples must be sent at the index operation to obtain an antibiogram, thus allowing modification of the drug regimen based on the specific cultured pathogens. If inflammatory markers do not improve, it is mandatory to rule out an alternative or additional source of infection or a residual area of gangrene with further surgical exploration advised. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may help in treating soft tissue infections. For a detailed discussion of the management of skin and soft-tissue infections, we refer to the WSES/SIS-E guidelines.

Complaints secondary to hemorrhoidal disease have been treated by health care providers for centuries. Most symptoms referable to hemorrhoidal disease can be managed nonoperatively. When symptoms do not respond to medical therapy, procedural intervention is recommended. Surgical hemorrhoidectomy is usually reserved for patients who are refractory to or unable to tolerate office procedures. This article reviews the pathophysiology of hemorrhoidal disease and the most commonly used techniques for the nonoperative and operative palliation of hemorrhoidal complaints.

### Safety of hemorrhoid procedures in patients who are immunocompromised: the mayo clinic experience [^111N2qmL]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemorrhoidal disease and immunosuppression are prevalent. Management of hemorrhoidal disease in this patient population is challenging. Most societies recommend conservative management due to the presumed risks of morbid complications, including sepsis and impaired healing. Data on the risks of office-based and operative procedures in immunocompromised patients is scant.

Objective

To evaluate postoperative outcomes after both office-based procedures and operative intervention for hemorrhoidal disease in immunocompromised patients.

Design

Retrospective chart review.

Settings

Single-center, tertiary referral center.

Patients

Adult patients with hemorrhoidal disease and primarily medication-induced immunosuppression undergoing an office-based procedure or operative intervention for hemorrhoidal disease while on immunosuppression at Mayo Clinic in Rochester between 2010 and 2023.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was development of infectious complications or wound complications.

Results

Fifty-five immunocompromised patients, with a median age of 60, underwent a total of 68 hemorrhoidal procedures during the study time frame. All patients had immunosuppression induced by medication, except for one patient with bone marrow failure syndrome. The most common reason for immunosuppression was rheumatoid arthritis, followed by prior kidney transplant. The most common medications were chronic corticosteroids and methotrexate in over a third of patients each. Of 68 total interventions, hemorrhoidectomy (32%) and excision of a thrombosed hemorrhoid (26%) were the two most common operations performed. Sixteen adverse events were reported in 14 (25%) patients. Three cases of postoperative cellulitis were documented after thrombosed external hemorrhoid excision, hemorrhoidopexy, and Whitehead hemorrhoidectomy. No postoperative intravenous antibiotics were administered. No cases of pelvic sepsis were documented.

Limitations

The retrospective nature of the study and the heterogeneity of the study population.

Conclusions

These data suggest that office-based and surgical procedures are safe and feasible in patients with immunosuppression. See Video Abstract.

### Guidelines, guidelines and more guidelines for haemorrhoid treatment: a review to sort the wheat from the chaff [^1163GGSC]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Advances in medical research have reduced the level of uncertainty in clinical practice. Guidelines complement this progress by providing recommendations. These recommendations should be informed by a systematic review of the evidence with assessment of the certainty of this evidence, providing the end user with a simple guide to decision making. Such guidelines should be rigorous in their review of evidence, have transparency in their development process and involve appropriate stakeholders.

Whilst guideline adherence benefits the patient and clinician by generally improving treatment integrity and patient outcomes the benefit is only as good as the quality of the guidelines themselves. To improve the quality various 'guidelines for guidelines' have been developed and national bodies attempt to coordinate such guidance. The AGREE enterprise provides an instrument and a checklist that allows evaluation of the quality of each guideline.

A clinical condition where guidelines are essential is haemorrhoidal disease. Haemorrhoids are common and symptoms lead to a significant socioeconomic burden worldwide. Whilst there are numerous treatment options, many have potential drawbacks that include dubious efficacy, high cost or prominent side effects, in particular pain. Perhaps spurred on by the widespread incidence and lack of a universal highly effective and painless treatment, a large number of surgical innovations have occurred. These have in turn resulted in an overabundance of literature, with over 43 000 publications (search keyword 'haemorrhoids') available in PubMed in the last 20 years (accessed 18 November 2021), making guidelines essential to distil this literature and aid practice. However, the plethora of publications has been followed by a plethora of guidelines, with different organizations and countries producing their own interpretation of the literature. Variation in practice may be valid where there are variations in capacity — in terms of resources or proficiency — and where evidence is equivocal or contextually inapplicable. However, there is a danger of confusion to the end user if the guideline development is substandard and variation relates to non‐valid reasons such as conflicts of interest and lack of awareness, ignoring or poor appraisal of relevant evidence.

The aim of this review were to identify current guidelines for the treatment of haemorrhoidal disease, assess the overall quality of each guideline, and identify whether conflicting advice is prevalent and whether any variation can be justified.

### Inflammatory polyps: a cause of late bleeding in stapled hemorrhoidectomy [^1155nqVA]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Stapled hemorrhoidectomy has become a popular treatment of hemorrhoids, mainly because of the benefits of greatly reduced postoperative pain. However, complications unique to the new procedure have been reported. This study was designed to review our series of 82 patients with a focus on complications, with particular focus on late bleeding caused by inflammatory polyps at the staple line.

Methods

A review of 82 patients who underwent stapled hemorrhoidectomy was conducted. Indications included bleeding in 29 patients, prolapse in 19, combined bleeding and prolapse in 31, and pain in 3. The procedure was performed in an outpatient setting with the Ethicon ILS 33 stapler in the standard fashion.

Results

Late bleeding as a result of inflammatory polyps was encountered in nine patients (11 percent). Bleeding was mild, and all cases resolved after excision of the polyps. Other complications occurred with the following frequency: urinary retention (4.9 percent), submucosal hematoma (2.4 percent), early bleeding (1.2 percent), recurrent hemorrhoids (2.4 percent), thrombosed external hemorrhoids (2.4 percent), and fecal urgency (3.7 percent).

Conclusions

Bleeding from inflammatory polyps occurs in a significant number of patients undergoing stapled hemorrhoidectomy. Mild bleeding several weeks or months after the procedure should prompt a search for inflammatory polyps at the staple line. Simple excision of the polyps was adequate treatment and has not resulted in rebleeding.

### Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation for the treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids: early and three-year follow-up results in 100 consecutive patients [^113maDWy]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Doppler-guided ligation of the hemorrhoidal arteries was described as an alternative to hemorrhoidectomy. The authors report their experience with this procedure.

Methods

From 2002 to 2004, 100 consecutive patients underwent hemorrhoidal artery ligation procedure for symptomatic hemorrhoids and were reviewed at one month and at three years.

Results

There were 54 females. Seventy-eight patients had Grade III hemorrhoids. Eighteen patients had previously been treated for the disease. The mean operative time was 28 minutes. On average, 8.4 ligatures were placed. Seventy-nine patients were discharged the same day. Six patients presented with early complication: isolated pain in one, pain and bleeding in three, isolated bleeding in one, and obstructed defecation in one. Late complications occurred in six patients: anal pain in one, fissure in two, and thrombosis of residual hemorrhoids in three. Twelve patients presented with a recurrence at a mean delay of 12.6 months, which was treated by repeat hemorrhoidal artery ligation (n = 1), hemorrhoidopexy (n = 7), and hemorrhoidectomy (n = 4).

Conclusions

Hemorrhoidal artery ligation procedure is safe, easy to perform, and should be considered as an alternative for the treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids, even with a recurrence rate of 12 percent, which can be treated by the same technique or another.

### Guidelines, guidelines and more guidelines for haemorrhoid treatment: a review to sort the wheat from the chaff [^115i46oT]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

The problem of redundant and overlapping guidelines is similar to that observed in systematic reviews, where variable methodological quality and coverage result in different estimates of effect sizes for the same question. There is often overlap between the scopes of different systematic reviews, without them being coterminous, because some cover broad and other narrow topic areas. In our review even guidelines that were restricted to surgery had different patterns of attention, while other guidelines also covered alternative management strategies. In systematic reviews there are legitimate reasons for overlapping reviews, including differences in purpose, emergence of new evidence, concern about the robustness of previous work and differences in methodological standards. A broader scope does not necessarily equate to quality, because simple clinical guidelines can be more effective than complex guidelines. Like systematic review authors, guideline committees should acknowledge the existence of previous or ongoing work and justify the need for new guidance. Whilst guidelines have the potential to underpin safe practice and provide safeguards for both patients and clinicians, expert and consensus approaches can go beyond high quality evidence, sometimes resulting in inappropriate recommendations. However, evidence‐based medicine demands 'the integration of best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values' while basing recommendations on small‐scale or poorly designed trials without the application of expertise and patient values, leading to poor policy.

We hope that journal editors will carefully consider the need for publication of guidelines when adequate guidelines may already exist, and will ensure the guidelines that they publish follow the most rigorous standards available. Professional bodies and journal editors should consider mandatory registration of guidelines using facilities such as the Guidelines International Network library to avoid unnecessary duplication. For 'end users' we urge consideration of available high quality haemorrhoid guidance in preference to mainly national guidelines that do not meet current standards, taking into account availability and affordability in different healthcare systems. Finally given the difficulties in selection of 'expert' panels we encourage further quality research in haemorrhoids to reduce the reliance on 'expert' opinion, allowing more consistent recommendations.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^117PnUQH]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Severe anal pain is the most common symptom associated with acute thrombosed external hemorrhoids; internal anal sphincter hypertonicity is both deriving from and causing this excruciating pain. Furthermore, the spasm of anal sphincter worsens the congestion of the prolapsed piles. For these reasons, the use of muscle relaxant, like topical nitrates and calcium channels antagonists, has been proposed for the treatment of thrombosed hemorrhoids. The role of calcium antagonists was studied in 2001 in a prospective randomized study by Perrotti et al. that enrolled 98 patients with thrombosed hemorrhoids: the study group (50 patients) received topical 0.3% nifedipine and 1.5% lidocaine ointment every 12 h for 2 weeks, while the control group (48 patients) received only topical 1.5% lidocaine ointment. The authors found a sharp increase in resolution rate of acute thrombosed external hemorrhoids after 14 days of therapy with topical Nifedipine (92% resolution rate in the study group as opposed to 45.8% in the control group), without observing any systemic side effect. The small number of enrolled patients obviously limits the power of this study, but the results are encouraging. The effects of topical nitrates were analyzed in another prospective study and showed good results, but these drugs are burdened by a high incidence of headache that may limit their use.

The role of topical anti-thrombotic is not yet clear. Only one study focused specifically on the use of topical anti-thrombotic therapy for acute hemorrhoids and heparin treatment was found to significantly improve healing and resolution of acute hemorrhoids. However, the small number of patients included in this study does not consent to make any recommendation regarding the role of this drugs in the treatment of complicated hemorrhoids.

Steroid cream should be applied for no more than 7 days, and a long-term use should be avoided because of potential thinning of perianal and anal mucosa and increasing risk of injury. There are no scientific data evaluating either NSAIDS, cortisone, and its derivates or injection of local anesthetics for the treatment of complicated hemorrhoids.
3.E - in patients with complicated hemorrhoids, what is the role of office-based procedures?

### Transanal suture mucopexy for hemorrhoids [^113Xa791]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhoids are a common medical condition affecting 4.4% to 36.4% of the population. Milligan and Morgan described hemorrhoidectomy in 1937, which is accepted as the gold standard procedure; however, it is a painful procedure.

The major vascular contribution of hemorrhoids is derived from the terminal branches of the internal hemorrhoidal plexus of the superior rectal artery and middle hemorrhoid artery. The vascular plexus is located submucosally, extending from the upper border of the anatomical anal canal to the dentate line. Patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids exhibit significantly larger blood vessels, increased blood flow, and increased velocity compared to those of healthy volunteers. The hemorrhoid grades correlate with arterial caliber and blood flow. The porto-systemic, arteriovenular anastomosis, and sinusoids form a complete cylindrical sheet called the corpora-cavernorsa recti.

Normal positioning of hemorrhoidal cushions is maintained by Treitz's muscle, which is comprised of two distinct parts: the anal submucosal muscle, whose fibers fix the cushions to the floor (internal sphincter) of the hemorrhoids‚ and the mucosal suspensory ligament (Park's ligament), which penetrates the internal sphincter to fix the cushions to the conjoined longitudinal muscle. Fragmentation of Treitz's muscle may be caused by shearing forces during prolonged and repeated downward straining at defecation. The causative factors for the prolapse of hemorrhoids are those associated with excessive straining and/or increased intra-abdominal pressure due to constipation and hard stools. The theory of sliding of the anal canal lining is well accepted. Grade II to IV hemorrhoids are an excellent example of prolapsing hemorrhoids.

The change from anal cushions to hemorrhoids gives rise to many pathological changes, including venous dilation, thrombosis, degeneration of collagen and fibroelastic tissues, and distortion and rupture of the anal subepithelial muscle. Histopathological examination of the hemorrhoidal specimens reveals ulcerated mucosa, a severe inflammatory reaction involving the vascular wall and surrounding connective tissue, ischemic necrosis, and oedema. With blockage of an artery at one site, there is dilation of proximal and shrinkage of distal branches, resulting in positive and negative pressure in these vessels. Naturally, small and side branches join to form collaterals. The hypervascularity remains the same after hemorrhoidectomy.

A comprehensive study of hemorrhoids revealed that the following core factors are necessary to address in the treatment of hemorrhoids: engorgement of hemorrhoids, prolapse, recurrence, and pain.

### Evaluation and management of common anorectal conditions [^114LS5VF]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

The prevalence of benign anorectal conditions in the primary care setting is high, although evidence of effective therapy is often lacking. In addition to recognizing common benign anorectal disorders, physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for inflammatory and malignant disorders. Patients with red flags such as increased age, family history, persistent anorectal bleeding despite treatment, weight loss, or iron deficiency anemia should undergo colonoscopy. Pruritus ani, or perianal itching, is managed by treating the underlying cause, ensuring proper hygiene, and providing symptomatic relief with oral antihistamines, topical steroids, or topical capsaicin. Effective treatments for anal fissures include onabotulinumtoxinA, topical nitroglycerin, and topical calcium channel blockers. Symptomatic external hemorrhoids are managed with dietary modifications, topical steroids, and analgesics. Thrombosed hemorrhoids are best treated with hemorrhoidectomy if symptoms are present for less than 72 hours. Grades I through III internal hemorrhoids can be managed with rubber band ligation. For the treatment of grade III internal hemorrhoids, surgical hemorrhoidectomy has higher remission rates but increased pain and complication rates compared with rubber band ligation. Anorectal condylomas, or anogenital warts, are treated based on size and location, with office treatment consisting of topical trichloroacetic acid or podophyllin, cryotherapy, or laser treatment. Simple anorectal fistulas can be treated conservatively with sitz baths and analgesics, whereas complex or nonhealing fistulas may require surgery. Fecal impaction may be treated with polyethylene glycol, enemas, or manual disimpaction. Fecal incontinence is generally treated with loperamide and biofeedback. Surgical intervention is reserved for anal sphincter injury.

Results

General characteristics

The systematic search identified 2,584 studies, of which 1,373 remained after duplicates were removed. Following title and abstract screening, 1,355 studies were excluded for not meeting inclusion criteria. Among the 18 articles assessed, one article could not be obtained in full text, and 10 were excluded due to inappropriate study design, irrelevant outcomes, or non-English language. Finally, 7 studies were included in the meta-analysis (Fig. 1). These studies, comprising 3 RCTs, 3 retrospective cohort study and a prospective observational cohort study, involved a total of 760 patients. The general characteristics of these studies were presented in Table 1. Risk of bias of non-RCT studies was assessed using the NOS (Table 2). NOS scores ranged from 5 to 8, indicating moderate to high quality for most studies. Risk of bias of RCT studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's bias assessment tool (Fig. 2 A and B). All three RCTs were assessed as having low risk in random sequence generation and selective reporting. However, due to the nature of the interventions, all were judged to be at high risk for performance bias resulting from lack of blinding. Other domains were generally rated as low or unclear risk.

### ACG clinical guidelines: management of benign anorectal disorders [^11228Bk3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Hemorrhoids — surgical referral criteria and options — gastroenterologists and other providers should refer for surgical operations (hemorrhoidectomy, stapled hemorrhoidopexy, and Doppler-assisted hemorrhoidal artery ligation) those patients who are refractory to or cannot tolerate office procedures, who have large, symptomatic external tags along with their hemorrhoids, who have large third-degree hemorrhoids, or who have fourth-degree hemorrhoids (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Traditional hemorrhoidectomy remains very effective, stapled hemorrhoidopexy shows slightly lower complication rates but higher long-term recurrence rates compared with standard hemorrhoidectomy and is an established alternative in most cases, and for Doppler-assisted hemorrhoidal artery ligation success rates are comparable to hemorrhoidectomy and stapled hemorrhoidopexy although comparative studies are lacking.

### Rubber band ligation of hemorrhoids: is the procedure effective for the immunocompromised, hemophiliacs and pregnant women? [^116sx9fa]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The story is totally different regarding HIV-positive patients; they mainly refused anesthesia/surgery for strictly personal, psychosocial reasons, although the underlying disease raises no contraindication for surgery in the majority of cases. This is why this study group exhibited very similar effectiveness in symptom resolution, undergoing a mean of 2.68 sessions in relation to matched comparisons (2.53 sessions), the arbitrary but not statistically significant difference in the number of ligation sessions rather being attributed to possible anal sphincter laxity, allowing the hemorrhoids to protrude. Some authors in the past considered these patients as being at increased risk of anorectal sepsis and poor tissue healing, thus advising adequate colonic preparation, although no evidence exists for antibiotic prophylaxis for RBL, or even for sclerotherapy, which is much more invasive and entails a higher risk for tissue necrosis. Moore et al reported 11 patients who underwent a median of 2 (range 1–4) RBLs per patient, without complication, including bleeding, severe pain, or pelvic infection.

The third study group of pregnant women is a totally different entity. The development or aggravation of hemorrhoidal disease during pregnancy is related to increased pressure in rectal veins caused by restriction of venous return by the enlarged uterus, as well as by pregnancy-related constipation — perhaps aggravated by hormonal factors such as progesterone — which tends to lower the strength of venous wall muscle. For that young female group, it is understood from the beginning that general anesthesia is prohibited; moreover, hemorrhoids will often regress after delivery. Thus, a minimally invasive procedure such as RBL would be the gold standard. However, the European Society of Coloproctology Guidelines suggest, as expert opinion and not as evidence-based, that in pregnant and postpartum women conservative treatment (i.e. laxatives, topical treatments, phlebotonics, and analgesics) should be used. If a patient is thrombosed and unresponsive, surgical procedures to treat thrombosis can be considered. Despite the guidelines, we effectively applied RBL in 45 pregnant women, in whom there was a statistically significant difference in the ratio between the severity of hemorrhoids, with grade II predominating in relation to the initial pool of patients (66.7% vs. 50.2%, P = 0.029).

### Cost-effectiveness of rubber band ligation versus hemorrhoidectomy for the treatment of grade III hemorrhoids: analysis using evidence from the HOLLAND randomized controlled trial [^115x1S4Z]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study provides a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and CUA of RBL versus hemorrhoidectomy for grade III hemorrhoids using data from the HOLLAND trial. Although RBL has lower upfront costs (cost savings of €1984 per patient), hemorrhoidectomy offers superior clinical outcomes, and it appears to be the more cost-effective option, with probabilities ranging from 45.5% to 83.9% depending on societal willingness-to-pay thresholds. At these thresholds, the likelihood of hemorrhoidectomy being cost-effective for recurrence avoidance is close to 100%. These findings underscore the need to balance cost savings against clinical outcomes when considering treatment strategies.

This study is the first prospective cost-effectiveness comparison of RBL and hemorrhoidectomy. Previous studies focused on other treatments, used retrospective designs, or lacked clinical applicability, contributing to the ongoing ambiguity in guidelines. The robust design of this trial, with high patient involvement and response rates, provides valuable insights to guide clinical decisions.

With a growing and aging population, rising health care costs demand attention to both clinical and economic outcomes. Previous literature has reported varying cost-effectiveness results for hemorrhoid treatments. The Hubble trial demonstrated that hemorrhoidal artery ligation (HAL) was not cost-effective compared to RBL, whereas the eTHoS trial favored hemorrhoidectomy over stapled hemorrhoidopexy. Other studies showed that Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation is less effective and more costly than stapled hemorrhoidopexy. However, other research found insufficient evidence to recommend stapled hemorrhoidopexy over RBL, highlighting the ongoing debate about the optimal treatment approach.

These findings are relevant in light of recent policy shifts aimed at reducing hemorrhoidectomy reimbursements to allocate operating room resources for other surgical priorities. For instance, the UK National Health Service limits hemorrhoidectomy access to cut costs, favoring outpatient treatments such as RBL. Although such policies promote cost-saving measures, our findings suggest that the superior clinical outcomes of hemorrhoidectomy should be carefully considered before RBL is adopted as the first-line treatment for grade III hemorrhoids. The potential long-term costs of higher recurrence rates and additional surgeries after RBL, together with the impact on quality of life, must be weighed against the immediate savings.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^117Jgd2B]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

In patients with suspected complicated hemorrhoids, we suggest to perform imaging investigation (CT scan, MRI, or endoanal ultrasound) only if there is suspicion of concomitant anorectal diseases (sepsis/abscess, inflammatory bowel disease, neoplasm) (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

The literature regarding complicated hemorrhoids is extremely scarce, and none of the studies investigate the role of imaging techniques in this specific subset of patients. Acute anal pain is the typical manifestation of multiple anal diseases, including hemorrhoidal crisis, anorectal abscesses, and anal fissures. The presence of an associated anorectal mass may further complicate the scenario, considering that not only thrombosed and prolapsed hemorrhoids could present as an anorectal mass, but also condylomas, abscesses, polyps, anorectal prolapse, or anorectal cancer can present in the same way. Lastly, it is important to remember that acute complicated hemorrhoids could be the clinical manifestation of a concomitant inflammatory anal and perianal condition, as demonstrated by the reported incidence of symptomatic hemorrhoids in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) ranging from 3.3 to 20.7%. Therefore, a thorough medical history and a complete physical examination are key factors to drive the diagnostic workup of acute anal pain. Imaging studies should be considered when there is suspicion of an underlying diseases. The only study investigating the role of EUS in hemorrhoidal disease is from Poen et al. and concluded that hemorrhoids are associated with endosonographic thickening of submucosal tissue, internal and external anal sphincter, but EUS changes cannot predict treatment outcome or symptom recurrence. The conclusions of the abovementioned studies regarding imaging techniques in anorectal abscesses can be extended to complicated hemorrhoids workup, even if they were not aimed to analyze specifically the role of imaging in hemorrhoidal disease; however, the recommendations are weak.

### Clinical features… [^115KHWEx]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

THROMBOSED EXTERNAL HEMORRHOIDS Thrombosed external hemorrhoids cause acute, severe pain. Without intervention, the pain typically improves over two to three days, with continued improvement as the thrombus gradually absorbs over several weeks. Analgesics and stool softeners may be beneficial. Topical therapy with nifedipine and lidocaine cream is more effective for pain relief than lidocaine alone. 7 In patients with severe pain from thrombosed hemorrhoids, excision or incision and evacuation of the thrombus within 72 hours of symptom onset provide more rapid pain relief than conservative treatment. 8 Both procedures can be performed under local anesthesia, and the resulting wound can be left open or sutured. 9 HEMORRHOIDS IN PREGNANCY Pregnancy predisposes women to symptomatic hemorrhoids that usually resolve after delivery. Surgical intervention is contraindicated because of the risk of inducing labor.

Conservative treatment is recommended, with excision of thrombosed external hemorrhoids if necessary. 10 The procedure involves placing a rubber band around a portion of redundant anorectal mucosa. This causes strangulation of the blood supply to the hemorrhoid, resulting in tissue necrosis and sloughing of the hemorrhoid in five to seven days. Healing of the small residual ulcer provides fixation of the local mucosa to underlying muscle. EXCISIONAL HEMORRHOIDECTOMY In excisional hemorrhoidectomy, an elliptical incision is made over the hemorrhoidal complex, which is then mobilized from the underlying sphincter and excised. The wound is closed with sutures. 20 Several randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have shown that excisional hemorrhoidectomy is the most effective treatment to reduce recurrent symptoms in patients with grade 3 or 4 hemorrhoids.

23 The device removes a circumferential column of mucosa and submucosa immediately above the hemorrhoids, thus interrupting the blood supply. The ring of staples fixes the downwardly displaced vascular cushions back into their original locations to restore anatomy and function. 24 Postoperatively, patients have a circular staple line above the dentate line, which becomes buried within the mucosa over time. Staples can be noted within the rectum for many months after the procedure and can cause rectal bleeding.

### Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation: an alternative to hemorrhoidectomy [^112EZ9MZ]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Postoperative pain is the main adverse effect of formal hemorrhoidectomy. A new technique based on Doppler-guided ligation of the terminal branches of the superior hemorrhoidal artery was introduced in 1995 as an alternative to hemorrhoidectomy. The authors report a preliminary experience with this procedure.

Methods

The Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation technique uses a special proctoscope bearing a Doppler transducer that allows identification and suture ligation of the hemorrhoidal arteries. Sixty-eight consecutive patients (mean age, 48 years; range, 21–74 years) with Grade 3 hemorrhoids were treated.

Results

Intraoperative discomfort was measured by a visual analog scale (1–10) and resulted in a mean score of 2.3 (range, 1.3–2.8). Only 38 percent of patients required postoperative analgesia. Patients were examined at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months and every 6 months thereafter. The mean follow-up was 11 (range, 3–18) months. Bleeding resolved in 91 percent of patients, pain in 73 percent, and prolapse in 94 percent. Complications were recorded in five patients and included persistent pain for more than two days in two patients (3 percent), swelling and thrombosis of one of the hemorrhoids in two patients (3 percent), and a secondary hemorrhage in one patient (1.5 percent).

Conclusion

Doppler-guided ligation of the hemorrhoidal artery is a safe and effective alternative to hemorrhoidectomy and is associated with minimal discomfort and low risk of complications.

### Hemorrhoids screening and treatment prior to LVAD: is it a necessity? [^1166bScK]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

In Case 1, patient had HAL post LVAD implant, yet this was complicated by cardiac arrest and death despite many efforts to resuscitate the patient. That being said, in Case 2 we opted for hemorrhoidal artery ligation (HAL) before LVAD implantation, despite the patient's clinical status. Thus avoided any fatal complications related to bleeding or a second procedure (e.g. HAL) post LVAD implant.

HAL is an operation started in 1996 by Morinaga et al. for the surgical treatment of moderate grade and prolapsed hemorrhoids. It centers around the treatment of hemorrhoids by cutting off the blood supply with guidance from a Doppler probe. Hence, this procedure is a low risk, less invasive and efficacious procedure, making it a good alternative to conventional haemorrhoidectomy or stapled haemorrhoidopexy in the short and medium term as endorsed by the National Institute for Health and Care (NICE). According to the 2014 ESC/ESA Guidelines on non-cardiac surgery, heart failure is a well-recognized factor for peri-operative and post-operative cardiac events, while patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 30% might be at a greater risk. However since HAL is less invasive than conventional open hemorrhoidectomy, it was the procedure of choice in our patient considering the potential for a related GI complication before LVAD implantation. It should be noted, that Jeong et al, in there one year follow up of patients post dopppler-guided HAL, noted a recurrence rate including re-bleeding of 14%. However this large number was higher than previously published reports.

Secondary prevention strategies for GI bleed post LVAD implantation had been discussed, including treating Helicobacter pylori, daily proton pump inhibitor use, limiting non steroidal anti inflammatory use and sub cutaneous octreotide injection to treat angiodysplasia. Also lowering pump speed was suggested as an approach to limit bleeding. Based on the 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Guidelines for Mechanical Circulatory Support: "reducing the pump speed for continuous flow pumps in the setting of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding due to arteriovenous malformations may be considered". Considering that angiodysplasia is caused by reduced pulsatility, thus decreasing pump speed can result in increase pulsatility and decreased angiodysplasia formation. Also repeated transfusion of vWF has been reported to control bleeding caused by angiodysplasia, however it is not recommended yet.

### Long-term outcome of rubber band ligation for symptomatic primary and recurrent internal hemorrhoids [^11134Jwd]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Rubber band ligation therapy for symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease has been used for many years and is a well-accepted treatment modality, but information on long-term outcome is limited. Our goals were to determine safety and long-term efficacy of this treatment.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of patients undergoing rubber band ligatures for symptomatic internal hemorrhoids in a single practice was conducted. Information on presenting symptoms, number of bands applied, response to therapy, complications encountered, length of follow-up, interval to recurrent symptoms when applicable, and subsequent therapy were documented. Supplemental information was obtained from telephone follow-up. Outcome was categorized as success or failure, in which success was defined as: permanent relief of symptoms for follow-up period; marked improvement in symptomatology with rare manifestation of bleeding (≤ 1/month); symptom relief for a limited period of time (≥ 100 days), and failure was defined as: modest improvement (decreased but not relief of symptoms); or no improvement in symptoms.

Results

A total of 805 patients underwent 2,114 rubber band ligatures. Most common presenting symptoms were bleeding in 731 patients (90.8 percent) and prolapsing in 382 patients (47.5 percent). The median number of bands placed was two (range, 1–17). The median time between bandings was 4.7 (range, 1.1–35.6) weeks. Median follow-up time was 1,204 (range, 14–9,571) days. Excluding 104 patients lost to follow-up (never returned after initial treatment), success was obtained in 70.5 percent (494/701) and failure in 29.5 percent (207/701) of patients. Success rates were similar for all degrees of hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoidal disease requiring the placement of four or more bands was associated with a trend in higher failure rates and greater need for subsequent hemorrhoidectomy. Complications per treatment series included bleeding (2.8 percent), thrombosed external hemorrhoids (1.5 percent), and bacteremia (0.09 percent). Higher bleeding rates were encountered with the use of acetylsalicylic acid/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and warfarin. Time to recurrence was less with subsequent treatment courses. Treatment of recurrent symptoms with rubber band ligation resulted in success rates of 73.6, 61.4, and 65 percent for first, second, and third recurrences respectively. This resulted in a cumulative success rate of 80.2 percent for this method of treatment.

Conclusions

Rubber band ligatures are safe and effective therapy for symptomatic internal hemorrhoids. It can be used to treat all degrees of hemorrhoids with similar effectiveness. The likelihood of success is lower if more than four bands are needed to eliminate symptoms. The use of acetylsalicylic acid/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and warfarin is associated with higher bleeding rates. Rubber band ligatures for recurrence of symptoms is effective; however, time to recurrence is less with subsequent treatments.

Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation

Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation, also called transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization, is a non-excisional surgical method to produce hemorrhoidal shrinkage that uses a Doppler probe to identify the 6 main feeding arteries in the anal canal and ligates the ones feeding the symptomatic hemorrhoids. The redundant tissue may also be plicated to perform a mucopexy during the procedure. Initial studies showed promising results for this method, but randomized trials have now demonstrated more mixed results. Two randomized trials comparing Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation to open hemorrhoidectomy showed less postoperative pain in the hemorrhoidal artery ligation group and no significant difference in recurrence at one year. In contrast, a third randomized trial showed no difference in postoperative pain, complications or recurrence between the hemorrhoidal artery ligation and open hemorrhoidectomy groups.

It remains unclear what the best treatment for hemorrhoids is, as there is significant heterogeneity in the methodologies applied and the study endpoints examined in all the aforementioned studies. Additionally, surgeon bias affects the techniques used, and indications depend on the operator and their experience. Another confounding factor in these studies is that patients and providers often define recurrence differently after treatment, but the European Society of Coloproctology has recently developed a Core Outcome Set to address this shortcoming of the current literature. A meta-analysis of 98 randomized clinical trials concluded that, although hemorrhoidectomy is associated with higher reported postoperative pain than hemorrhoidal artery ligation and stapled hemorrhoidopexy, it yields the lowest recurrence rates. Overall, the authors concluded formal hemorrhoidectomy should be considered the standard for surgical care of hemorrhoidal disease, but surgical treatment should be tailored to each patient's symptoms and exam findings.

### Benign anorectal disease: hemorrhoids, fissures, and fistulas [^114kBTp8]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Internal hemorrhoids most often present with painless bleeding during bowel movements and/or prolapse. Prolapse may be associated with mild fecal incontinence, mucous drainage, perianal fullness, and painful skin irritation. Although rare, prolapsed internal hemorrhoids can strangulate, causing significant pain. Thrombosed external hemorrhoids tend to be more painful, given their somatic innervation, and patients present with a tender perianal mass that can bleed if it ulcerates. Thrombosed external hemorrhoids usually degenerate into perianal skin tags over time. The diagnosis of hemorrhoidal disease is based on history and physical exam. It is important to not blindly attribute painless rectal bleeding to hemorrhoids without a proper physical exam and further workup. Anoscopy is necessary to visualize internal hemorrhoids and identify anorectal pathology on exam. In the US, common practice is that painless rectal bleeding with a normal anoscopic evaluation is followed by diagnostic colonoscopy.

Medical treatment

Symptomatic hemorrhoids tend to be self-limiting and often respond well to conservative medical treatment: increasing fluid and fiber intake, regular exercise, avoiding constipation and straining, and spending less time on the toilet. A meta-analysis of 7 randomized trials comparing fiber supplementation (7–20 g/day) to no fiber showed that fiber supplementation decreases bleeding symptoms by 50%, but had little effect on prolapse, pain, and itching from hemorrhoids. There is no evidence to support the use of popular topical over-the-counter remedies like Preparation H or topical corticosteroids.

Excisional hemorrhoidectomy (EH) indications, comparative effectiveness, and complications — 7. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy should typically be offered to select patients with external hemorrhoids or patients with symptomatic combined internal and external hemorrhoids (grades III–IV). Strength of recommendation: strong based on high-quality evidence. Surgical excision is an effective approach for patients who fail, cannot tolerate, or are not candidates for office-based procedures or who have concomitant external hemorrhoidal disease. In a meta-analysis of 11 RCTs (n = 1326), the closed approach versus open had decreased postoperative pain, faster wound healing, and decreased risk of postoperative bleeding, with similar postoperative complications, hemorrhoid recurrence, and infectious complications. Energy devices show mixed advantages: a meta-analysis of 5 studies (n = 318) found bipolar energy devices faster, with less postoperative pain and comparable complication rates to closed hemorrhoidectomy using electrocautery; a meta-analysis of 8 studies (n = 468) found ultrasonic shears associated with earlier return to work, decreased postoperative pain, and fewer postoperative complications, but an RCT of 60 patients found similar postoperative pain scores and no differences in clinical outcomes versus electrocautery. Serious complications are rare; postprocedural hemorrhage occurs in 1%–2% in most large series, and acute urinary retention occurs in 1% to 15% and is the most common reason for delayed discharge; risk may be mitigated by decreasing intraoperative intravenous fluids to < 750 mL and using adequate analgesia. Long-term complications can include anal stricture and incontinence.

### Milligan-morgan hemorrhoidectomy combined with rubber band ligation and polidocanol foam sclerotherapy for the management of grade III / IV hemorrhoids: a retrospective study [^115m57MS]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A conservative approach is typically used at the initial stage of hemorrhoids, which includes toilet training, high-fiber nutrition, and topical and pharmacological treatments (e.g. laxatives, venotropics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and non-opioid analgesics). When conservative treatment fails, interventional treatment methods are used. Grade III and IV hemorrhoids are a more serious anal and rectal disease in the later stage of hemorrhoid development, accompanied mainly by external hemorrhoids (skin tags) forming mixed hemorrhoids, which have a significant impact on the patient's life and work. When conservative treatment is ineffective, they generally require surgical treatment.

Currently, there are numerous surgical procedures for hemorrhoids, including hemorrhoidectomy, stapled hemorrhoidectomy, and Doppler-guided hemorrhoid art alignment (DG-HAL)/transanal hemorrhoid dearterialization (THD). Among them, hemorrhoidectomy is the most widely used and recommended surgical technique for grade III and IV hemorrhoids by the guidelines from multiple countries. The aim of hemorrhoidectomy is to ligate the vascular pedicles and excise the enlarged hemorrhoidal tissue both above and below the dentate line. Depending on the surgical wound treatment techniques, the most famous representative surgical methods are open hemorrhoidectomy (Milligan–Morgan procedure) and closed hemorrhoidectomy (Ferguson procedure). MMH is a surgical procedure based on the theory of "varicose veins" with definite efficacy, especially for high-grade hemorrhoids (grade III/IV), which has been confirmed by numerous randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews. Although DG-HAL/THD is minimally invasive and can reduce postoperative pain, bleeding, and complications, the long-term recurrence rate may be very high. Altomare DF et al. evaluated the changes in the treatment of 32,458 hemorrhoid patients in Italy over the last 17 years and found that the proportion of MMH has remained between 65 and 70% and that MMH remains the most frequently performed procedure for grade III hemorrhoids. However, hemorrhoidectomy has some disadvantages, which may be related to early and late complications, such as postoperative pain, urinary retention, long recovery period, delayed bleeding, anal stenosis, and fecal incontinence. Banding and sclerotherapy are commonly used clinical procedures for the treatment of grade I–II and selective grade III hemorrhoids. RBL has the advantages of being quick, relatively painless, and generally well tolerated due to its application in an area lacking somatic sensitivity (at the base of the hemorrhoids above the dentate line). However, RBL has shown variable success rates and a considerable risk of recurrence, which may require further intervention. The common complications of RBL technology include pain, bleeding, and thrombosis. Still, there are some rare but serious complications, such as liver abscess, massive secondary rectal hemorrhage, perineal septicemia, and death. Polidocanol, a detergent-type sclerosant and local anesthetic, is one of the emerging sclerosant agents for the treatment of hemorrhoids. The apparent advantage of polidocanol foam is that it increases the proportion of active drugs on endothelial cells, resulting in uniform distribution of drug microbubbles, higher adhesion to the endothelium, and greater hardening ability. Moser KH et al. evaluated the efficacy and safety of polidocanol foam compared with liquid polidocanol for the treatment of hemorrhoids, and the results showed that polidocanol foam was more effective than liquid polidocanol and that patients had higher satisfaction with equivalent safety. Polidocanol is well tolerated locally and has a low incidence of systemic reactions, but clinicians should know about the possibility of uncommon but life-threatening adverse reactions, such as severe anaphylactic reactions and cardiac arrest. Currently, the concentration of polidocanol used for treating hemorrhoids in clinical practice is not standardized, with commonly used concentrations ranging from 1 to 3%. In our study, a low concentration of 1% polidocanol was injected into each ligated nodule to avoid potential side effects and ensure patient safety.

Strength of recommendation: conditional based on moderate-quality evidence. SH uses a circular stapling device to create a mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis by excising the submucosa proximal to the dentate resulting in cephalad fixation of the anal cushions and interruption of the feeding arteries, and although effective for prolapsing internal hemorrhoids, it does not address external hemorrhoids. In a randomized trial of 777 patients, SH produced less pain and better quality of life within 6 weeks (p = 0.02), but the EH group had fewer recurrent symptoms (OR 2.96; 95% CI, 2.02–4.32), lower tenesmus/incontinence rates (p = 0.01), and higher 24‑month quality of life. A Cochrane review showed SH patients were more likely to have recurrent hemorrhoids than those with excisional hemorrhoidectomy (12 trials, 955 patients; OR 3.22; 95% CI, 1.59–6.51), and more symptomatic prolapse at all time points (13 studies, 1191 patients; OR 2.65; 95% CI, 1.45–4.85).

Regarding therapeutic procedures for hemorrhoids, more specifically with respect to office-based procedures, ACG 2021 guidelines recommend to offer office-based procedures, such as a rubber band ligation or infrared coagulation, sclerotherapy, and bipolar coagulation as alternatives, in patients with symptomatic grade I-II internal hemorrhoids failed medical therapy.

Hemorrhoids — office procedures recommendation — gastroenterologists and other providers should consider patients with first- to third-degree hemorrhoids that remain symptomatic after dietary modifications for office procedures such as banding, sclerotherapy, and infrared coagulation, and ligation is probably the most effective option (strong recommendation, moderate-quality of evidence).

### Randomized, clinical trial of ligasure vs conventional diathermy in hemorrhoidectomy [^112BtNUG]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Hemorrhoidectomy is frequently associated with significant postoperative pain, and new techniques to reduce this pain are constantly under evaluation. The present study was conducted to determine the usefulness of the Ligasure system and compare it with conventional diathermy for hemorrhoidectomy.

Methods

Thirty-four consecutive patients with Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhoids requiring surgery were recruited and randomized into two groups by preoperative assignment of sealed envelopes. Patients with coexisting perianal disease, previous perianal surgery, or thrombosed hemorrhoids were excluded. All patients were anesthetized and operated on by a single team. In one group, monopolar diathermy in the coagulation mode was used to dissect hemorrhoidal tissue from the internal sphincter. In the second group, tissue was coagulated by Ligasure and then divided with scissors. Operating time was documented by theater staff. Postoperatively, pain scores and Cleveland Clinic incontinence scores were documented.

Results

Seventeen patients were randomized into each group. There were no significant differences in age, gender, or clinical symptoms between the groups. The mean operating time in the Ligasure group was 6 (range, 4–10) minutes compared with 11 (range, 7–20) minutes in the other group, and this was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Patients in the Ligasure group reported significantly less pain with first defecation and at postoperative Days 1 and 14 (P < 0.001). The mean hospital stay in both groups was one (range, 1–5) day, and there was no difference in the incontinence scores.

Conclusions

Ligasure diathermy provides a superior alternative to conventional diathermy in hemorrhoidectomy by reducing operating time and postoperative pain.

### Comparison of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids grade III: a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^115xWbsd]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhoidal disease is a common anorectal condition characterized by symptoms such as bleeding, pain, itching, soiling, and prolapse, which can significantly affect quality of life (QoL). In the Netherlands, its prevalence is 13.4 per 1000 patients. The Goligher classification system categorizes hemorrhoids by the degree of hemorrhoidal prolapse and guides treatment strategies.

Grade III hemorrhoids represent a particularly complex management scenario due to inconclusive guidelines regarding optimal treatment strategy. Although hemorrhoidectomy is traditionally considered the criterion standard, rubber band ligation (RBL) offers a simpler, less invasive outpatient alternative with fewer complications and lower patient burden. However, RBL has a recurrence rate of up to 50%, potentially requiring repeat procedures. Although hemorrhoidectomy generally has lower recurrence rates, it is associated with more postoperative discomfort and a longer recovery period.

A consensus on the best treatment strategy for grade III hemorrhoids is lacking, leading to variability in clinical practice. – In 2016, 2 large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compared stapled hemorrhoidopexy with hemorrhoidectomy and hemorrhoidal artery ligation with RBL. However, a direct comparison of RBL with hemorrhoidectomy is still missing. The present study aimed to address this gap by evaluating the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of RBL versus hemorrhoidectomy in grade III hemorrhoids, focusing on health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) and recurrence rates, and incorporating patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) to determine patient preferences.

FIGURE 1.
Cost-effectiveness plane showing the societal cost differences between RBL and hemorrhoidectomy vs the difference in cost per QALYs. Of note, 97.2% of the dots from the bootstrap samples are situated in the upper right quadrant. QALY = quality-adjusted life year; RBL = rubber band ligation.

Figure 2 presents the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, illustrating the probability that hemorrhoidectomy is more cost-effective than 2× RBL at varying willingness-to-pay thresholds per QALY gained. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of €20,000 per QALY, the probability of cost-effectiveness for hemorrhoidectomy was 45.5%, whereas at a threshold of €50,000 per QALY, this probability increased to 83.9%. The more society is willing to pay per extra QALY, the more acceptable hemorrhoidectomy becomes as the more expensive strategy.

FIGURE 2.
Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showing the probability that hemorrhoidectomy is cost-effective vs willingness to pay per cost per QALY. The blue line corresponds to the societal perspective, and the red line corresponds to to the health care perspective. QALY = quality-adjusted life year.

The point-estimated ICER was €5918 (95% BCa CI, 719–22,566) per recurrence avoided from a societal perspective in the base-case scenario. Figure 3 illustrates the cost-effectiveness plane, showing the mean societal costs against the number of prevented recurrences in the RBL group compared to the hemorrhoidectomy group, based on 1000 bootstrap simulations. The majority (97.6%) of the bootstraps fell within the upper-right quadrant, indicating that hemorrhoidectomy is more expensive but again more effective than RBL.

### Benign anorectal conditions: evaluation and management [^115ApB1e]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Common anorectal conditions include hemorrhoids, perianal pruritus, anal fissures, functional rectal pain, perianal abscess, condyloma, rectal prolapse, and fecal incontinence. Although these are benign conditions, symptoms can be similar to those of cancer, so malignancy should be considered in the differential diagnosis. History and examination, including anoscopy, are usually sufficient for diagnosing these conditions, although additional testing is needed in some situations. The primary treatment for hemorrhoids is fiber supplementation. Patients who do not improve and those with large high-grade hemorrhoids should be referred for surgery. Acutely thrombosed external hemorrhoids should be excised. Perianal pruritus should be treated with hygienic measures, barrier emollients, and low-dose topical corticosteroids. Capsaicin cream and tacrolimus ointment are effective for recalcitrant cases. Treatment of acute anal fissures with pain and bleeding involves adequate fluid and fiber intake. Chronic anal fissures should be treated with topical nitrates or calcium channel blockers, with surgery for patients who do not respond to medical management. Patients with functional rectal pain should be treated with warm baths, fiber supplementation, and biofeedback. Patients with superficial perianal abscesses not involving the sphincter should undergo office-based drainage; patients with more extensive abscesses or possible fistulas should be referred for surgery. Condylomata can be managed with topical medicines, excision, or destruction. Patients with rectal prolapse should be referred for surgical evaluation. Biofeedback is a first-line treatment for fecal incontinence, but antidiarrheal agents are useful if diarrhea is involved, and fiber and laxatives may be used if impaction is present. Colostomy can help improve quality of life for patients with severe fecal incontinence.

Methodology — An organized search of MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was performed for articles from January 2003 through December 2016. 1904 titles were screened, and 312 references were directly reviewed, ultimately yielding 79 references for consideration. A similar but colorectal and pelvic surgery-targeted search was performed, yielding an additional 19 unique references. In addition, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was searched for deep venous thrombosis, resulting in 65 titles, which were again screened and yielded 5 references for inclusion. When agreement was incomplete regarding the evidence base or treatment guideline, consensus from the committee chair, vice chair, and 2 assigned reviewers determined the outcome. In general, each ASCRS Clinical Practice Guideline is updated every 5 years.

### Comparison of rubber band ligation and hemorrhoidectomy in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids grade III: a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled noninferiority trial [^1169jBsw]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The HollAND trial was the first RCT to compare RBL and hemorrhoidectomy for grade III hemorrhoids, assessing both effectiveness and patient perspectives. Results showed that the RBL group did not meet the noninferiority criteria for HR-QoL compared to the hemorrhoidectomy group after 12 months. This may be attributed to the sample size not being reached, potentially limiting analysis power. Although hemorrhoidectomy had higher mean QALY scores, the design limits any conclusion of its superiority over RBL. Nevertheless, the QALY differences suggest hemorrhoidectomy may offer better symptom control and improve QoL more effectively.

At baseline, both groups had similar HR-QoL scores. Although the RBL group reported higher scores shortly after treatment, likely due to greater impact of hemorrhoidectomy on daily life and postoperative pain, hemorrhoidectomy showed greater improvement from 6 weeks onward. By 24 months, both treatments had a positive effect on patients, with no significant difference in long-term HR-QoL.

Certainty of evidence and recommendation grading — grades were determined using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system, in which evidence from randomized controlled trials starts as high certainty and evidence from observational studies starts as low certainty, with outcomes graded as high, moderate, low, or very low. Recommendations consider risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias, and observational-study evidence can be rated up when there is a large magnitude of effect or dose–response; per GRADE, recommendations are labeled as "strong" or "conditional".

Surgical Procedure

All of the procedures were performed by specialist colorectal surgeons with a minimum experience of 30 PSH procedures. CSH was performed according to the technique as described by Longo et al. The details of the PSH technique have been reported previously. After removal of the stapler, staple-line bleeding was controlled with absorbable 3/0 Vicryl Z sutures. Skin tag excision was performed at the surgeon's discretion. Postoperative management was standardized and consisted of basic nursing care, dietary modifications, sitz baths, and conventional postoperative analgesia.

Intraoperative data included the operative time (time between the beginning of the operation and the application of the dressing, recorded with a digital timer and accurate to the minute) and the intraoperative blood loss (based on the number of gauzes used, where each gauze represented 5 mL of blood loss). The mean vertical height of the resected specimen in PSH cases and the height of the resected doughnut in the CSH cases were recorded. All of the resected specimens were examined histologically. The primary outcome measured was the rate of recurrent prolapse at the median follow-up of 5 years. Secondary outcomes included incidence and severity of postoperative pain, fecal urgency, anal continence, and the frequency of specific complications, including rectal stenosis and rectovaginal fistula. If recurrence was reported by the patients, they were examined by 2 senior surgeons to rule out skin tags or thrombosed hemorrhoids. Postoperative pain was assessed at 12 hours and then at 1, 2, 3, and 7 days postoperatively, as well as during the first defecation, using a visual analog scale (VAS), where 0 = no pain and 10 = the most severe pain. Urgency was determined at the same time points and was considered present if patients were unable to defer defecation for > 15 minutes. Rectal stenosis was defined as the loss of compliant natural elasticity of the anal opening, which then became abnormally tight and fibrous. Outlet-obstructed constipation (as distinct from anorectal stenosis) was defined as difficulty in defecation after stapled hemorrhoidopexy because of the reduced rectal compliance caused by the circumferential stapled anastomosis rather than by rectal stenosis. Continence was assessed with the Jorge-Wexner incontinence score before surgery and at 1 and 3 postoperative months.

### Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation and rectoanal repair (HAL-RAR) for the treatment of grade IV hemorrhoids: long-term results in 100 consecutive patients [^1163e8Up]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation is a minimally invasive technique for the treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids that has been applied successfully for grade II and III hemorrhoids but is less effective for grade IV hemorrhoids. Development of a special proctoscope enabled the combination of hemorrhoidal artery ligation with transanal rectoanal repair (mucopexy), which serves to lift and then secure the protruding hemorrhoids in place.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to describe our experience with this combined procedure in the treatment of grade IV hemorrhoids.

Design

Prospective observational study.

Setting

Outpatient colorectal surgery unit.

Patients

Consecutive patients with grade IV hemorrhoids treated from April 2006 to December 2008.

Intervention

Hemorrhoidal artery ligation-rectoanal repair.

Main Outcome Measures

Operating time, number of ligations, number of mucopexies and associated procedures, and postoperative symptoms were recorded. Pain was graded on a visual analog scale. Follow-up was at 2, 6, and 12 months after surgery, and then annually.

Results

A total of 100 consecutive patients (64 women, 36 men) with grade IV hemorrhoids were included. Preoperative symptoms were bleeding in 80 and pain in 71 patients; 19 patients had undergone previous surgical treatment for the disease. The mean operative time was 35 (range, 17–60) minutes, with a mean of 9 (range, 4–14) ligations placed per patient. Eighty-four patients were discharged on the day of the operation. Nine patients developed early postoperative complications: pain in 6, bleeding in 4, dyschezia in 1, and thrombosis of residual hemorrhoids in 3. Late complications occurred in 4 patients and were managed conservatively. Recurrence was observed in 9 patients (9%), with a mean follow-up of 34 (range, 14–42) months.

Limitations

The 2 main weaknesses of the study were the lack of very long-term follow-up and the absence of a comparison with hemorrhoidectomy or hemorrhoidopexy.

Conclusion

Doppler-guided hemorrhoidal artery ligation with rectoanal repair is safe, easy to perform, and should be considered as an effective option for the treatment of grade IV hemorrhoids.
