## Question

Umberical antibiotic plan therapy for septic arthritis in children

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about antibiotic therapy plans for septic arthritis in children. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate assessment and whether to start empiric antibiotics before joint aspiration. Then, I should verify the diagnostic workup sequence, including blood and joint cultures and the role of molecular testing. Next, I will consider empiric antibiotic selection by age and local epidemiology, followed by definitive therapy adjustments once cultures return. After that, I need to check duration, IV-to-oral transition criteria, and monitoring. Finally, I should review special populations, treatment failure pathways, and stewardship principles, and then synthesize a concise algorithmic summary with dosing anchors and safety checks.

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment priorities: distinguish ill-appearing or rapidly progressive disease from stable presentations, because that determines whether to start antibiotics immediately or to delay until after joint aspiration, and I should not jump to conclusions before verifying severity and trajectory of illness [^111bGsmj] [^111KGRKz].

> Hold on, I should verify the timing of empiric antibiotics relative to cultures. In ill-appearing children or those with rapidly progressive infection, I need to obtain blood cultures if feasible and start empiric IV antibiotics immediately, proceeding to joint aspiration as soon as possible even if antibiotics have begun, given the strong association between delayed antimicrobials and worse outcomes in pediatric sepsis cohorts and the low likelihood that brief pre-antibiotic cultures materially alter synovial fluid yield in pooled observational analyses [^111bGsmj] [^112JFUWR] [^115GBKvC].

> Wait, let me verify the approach for stable, non–ill-appearing children. In this group, I should withhold antibiotics under careful observation until after the initial joint aspirate is obtained for diagnostic purposes, balancing the risk of delayed therapy against the value of maximizing culture yield. I need to ensure close monitoring and readiness to pivot if the child deteriorates [^111bGsmj] [^1164KsKQ].

> I need to check the diagnostic sequence next. Before antibiotics when feasible, obtain blood cultures and perform urgent joint aspiration for Gram stain, culture, and cell count; molecular diagnostics, particularly for Kingella kingae, can substantially increase pathogen detection and should be considered in the appropriate age group, and I should remember that blood cultures identify the organism in about 20% of cases and do not replace the need for joint sampling [^1146TZsy] [^112MN44H] [^111yTBfU].

> Let me think about empiric antibiotic selection. I should confirm that all children require coverage for Staphylococcus aureus, with MRSA coverage considered based on local CA-MRSA prevalence and illness severity. In infants and preschool-aged children (6–48 months), I should add empiric coverage for Kingella kingae because it is the most common pathogen in that age band, and I must tailor choices to local antibiograms and patient-specific risk factors such as immunization status and exposure history [^1145n3J2] [^113iSKre] [^112cjJba].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "add rifampin routinely for MRSA", but I should double-check that. Routine rifampin combination is not recommended for empiric therapy; rifampin may be considered in select MRSA scenarios per organism-specific guidance, but it is not a blanket recommendation for pediatric septic arthritis, so I should correct that and avoid reflexively adding rifampin up front [^117K27am] [^117DMf2M].

> I will now examine practical empiric regimens. For MSSA, cefazolin or an anti-staphylococcal penicillin such as nafcillin or oxacillin are appropriate. For MRSA risk, vancomycin or clindamycin are reasonable empiric options, with clindamycin preferred when local clindamycin resistance is low and the child is stable, while vancomycin remains a mainstay when resistance is high or the child is ill-appearing. For 6–48 month olds, I should ensure activity against K. kingae, often with a beta-lactam such as cefazolin or ampicillin-sulbactam, recognizing that clindamycin lacks activity against K. kingae and would require adjustment if that pathogen is suspected [^111MrCFQ] [^117DMf2M] [^112cjJba].

> Next, I should review definitive therapy once cultures and susceptibilities return. I need to ensure de-escalation to the narrowest effective agent with the best tolerability profile, maintaining a spectrum comparable to the empiric regimen that produced clinical response if no pathogen is identified. I should confirm organism-specific preferences such as penicillin G or ampicillin for Group A Streptococcus, and I must avoid routine combination therapy unless there is a specific indication like severe infection requiring broader coverage pending clarification [^1139hWJL] [^113xASJx] [^116ZUMhy] [^117GGJvZ].

> Let me verify duration and the IV-to-oral transition. For uncomplicated primary septic arthritis without adjacent osteomyelitis, with rapid clinical improvement and a consistent CRP decline by day 7 to below about 20 mg/L, total therapy as short as 10–14 days is reasonable, typically after 2–4 days of IV therapy followed by high-dose oral therapy; longer courses of 21–28 days are reserved for slower clinical response, inadequate source control, or persistently elevated inflammatory markers, and I should confirm that these principles do not apply when osteomyelitis is present, in which case osteomyelitis-directed durations take precedence [^112ehes8] [^112H19yY] [^115ammvr] [^1175fypD].

> Hold on, I should verify the criteria for switching to oral therapy. Transition is appropriate when the child is afebrile, pain and joint function are improving, and CRP is declining. Oral agents should have reliable bioavailability and activity against the pathogen, with high-dose, time-dependent agents dosed frequently (for example, four times daily) to maintain pharmacodynamic targets, and I need to ensure adherence and close follow-up before discharge [^113G8vHX] [^116RBLPi].

> I need to ensure robust monitoring. Serial CRP measurements alongside clinical assessments provide the best combined signal of response; I should obtain an initial CRP and then trend it every few days early in therapy, recognizing that clinical improvement and CRP normalization correlate with successful outcomes and can support shorter total durations when the trajectory is favorable [^1138oLyG] [^115Y8G2X].

> But wait, what if the child is not improving as expected. Within 48–96 hours, if fever, pain, or CRP fail to improve, I should reassess the adequacy of source control, consider occult osteomyelitis or other foci, and obtain MRI if not previously done. If bacteremia persists beyond 48–72 hours, I should evaluate for undrained foci or deep vein thrombosis and adjust management accordingly rather than reflexively broadening antibiotics without a target [^113yecsg] [^115RRwP2] [^11151fz3].

> Let me consider special populations and scenarios. Neonates require distinct empiric coverage for gram-negative and enterococcal pathogens and are excluded from the main pediatric guideline scope, so I should follow neonatal-specific protocols. In unvaccinated children, I should consider Hib coverage. For immunocompromised hosts, broader empiric coverage and longer durations may be warranted. And for culture-negative cases, I should maintain the spectrum that produced clinical response and avoid unnecessary extension of therapy if the child is doing well [^11698SRD] [^116PJxL1] [^114REumw].

> I should confirm surgical source control principles. Early joint drainage is essential, particularly for hip and shoulder infections, and the need for repeat washout increases with delayed presentation, difficult-to-treat pathogens like MRSA, or lack of clinical progress despite appropriate antibiotics; I need to coordinate closely with pediatric orthopedics for timing and approach [^1128Y8nb] [^111J6Vcr].

> Next, I should review stewardship and safety. I need to avoid routine intra-articular antibiotics, as systemic therapy achieves excellent synovial levels and local instillation adds risk without proven benefit. I should also minimize PICC use by favoring early oral therapy when feasible and coordinate OPAT only when oral agents are not suitable, all while documenting clear stop criteria and follow-up plans [^11511KK7] [^113G8vHX] [^114hmAux].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm to ensure nothing is missed. Ill-appearing or rapidly progressive disease warrants immediate empiric IV therapy after blood cultures and urgent joint aspiration, whereas stable children should have joint aspiration before antibiotics; empiric regimens must cover S. aureus and, in 6–48 month olds, K. kingae; cultures guide de-escalation; total therapy is 10–14 days if response is brisk with CRP decline, otherwise 21–28 days; transition to oral therapy after 2–4 IV days when clinically appropriate; monitor with serial CRP and exams; reassess at 48–96 hours if response is suboptimal; and ensure close follow-up until completion of therapy and return of function [^111bGsmj] [^112ehes8] [^112H19yY] [^114ZHyL1].

> Finally, I should double-check dosing anchors and practical pearls. Typical empiric IV choices include cefazolin 100–150 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours for MSSA, vancomycin 15–20 mg/kg/dose every 6–8 hours for MRSA risk, and clindamycin 10–13 mg/kg/dose every 6–8 hours when local resistance permits; oral step-down options include cephalexin 100–150 mg/kg/day divided QID for MSSA, clindamycin 30–40 mg/kg/day divided TID–QID if susceptible, and amoxicillin or penicillin V for streptococcal disease, with the key principle being high-dose, frequent administration and assured adherence to maintain efficacy during the oral phase [^111MrCFQ] [^116RG4Bv].

---

Empiric therapy for pediatric septic arthritis should start with **IV antibiotics targeting Staphylococcus aureus** (including MRSA if local prevalence > 10–15%) [^11172zU9] [^111MrCFQ] and **Kingella kingae in children 6–48 months** [^112cjJba] [^1145n3J2]. Begin **IV therapy immediately after obtaining blood and joint fluid cultures** in ill-appearing or rapidly progressive cases [^115M1n1m] [^111bGsmj]; in stable children, obtain joint fluid before antibiotics when feasible [^1164KsKQ] [^113zv4NE]. Transition to oral therapy after 2–4 days of IV treatment if clinically improved, and treat for a total of 10–14 days if there is rapid clinical response and CRP decline; extend to 21–28 days for slow response or complications [^112ehes8] [^112H19yY] [^1175fypD]. Adjust therapy to culture results, monitor with serial CRP, and ensure close follow-up until full joint function returns [^1138oLyG] [^1142bhvR].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric antibiotic selection should be guided by the most likely pathogens, local resistance patterns, and patient-specific factors such as age and severity of illness [^111MrCFQ].

| **Pathogen** | **Age group** | **Empiric antibiotic recommendations** |
|-|-|-|
| Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA) | All ages | - IV cefazolin or anti-staphylococcal penicillin (e.g. nafcillin, oxacillin) <br/> - Add vancomycin or clindamycin if MRSA risk [^111MrCFQ] |
| Kingella kingae | 6–48 months | - IV ampicillin or ampicillin-sulbactam <br/> - Alternative: ceftriaxone [^notfound] |
| Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b | Unvaccinated children | - IV ceftriaxone or cefotaxime [^notfound] |
| Gram-negative organisms (e.g. Enterobacterales) | Neonates | - IV ampicillin plus gentamicin or cefotaxime [^notfound] |

---

Empiric therapy should be initiated **promptly after obtaining blood and joint fluid cultures** in ill-appearing children or those with rapidly progressive infection [^115M1n1m] [^111bGsmj]. In stable children, it is reasonable to withhold antibiotics until joint fluid is obtained for culture [^1164KsKQ] [^111bGsmj].

---

## Transition to oral antibiotic therapy

Transition to oral therapy is appropriate once the child is clinically improved, afebrile, and able to tolerate oral medications. High-dose oral therapy with excellent bioavailability is effective, including **cephalosporins (e.g. cephalexin) for MSSA**, clindamycin for MRSA, and amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate for K. kingae [^113G8vHX] [^111MrCFQ].

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The duration of therapy depends on clinical response and the presence of complications:

- **Uncomplicated cases**: 10–14 days total (2–4 days IV followed by oral therapy) if there is rapid clinical improvement and consistent CRP decline [^112ehes8] [^112H19yY].
- **Complicated cases**: 21–28 days (e.g. slow clinical response, persistent elevated CRP, adjacent osteomyelitis, or MRSA infection) [^1175fypD] [^117K27am].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Serial clinical evaluations and CRP measurements are essential to assess treatment response [^115Y8G2X]. Close follow-up should continue until completion of antibiotic therapy and return of full joint function [^1142bhvR].

---

## Adjustment of antibiotic therapy

Antibiotic therapy should be adjusted based on culture and sensitivity results. If the pathogen is not identified, continue empiric therapy guided by clinical response and local epidemiology [^1139hWJL] [^114REumw].

---

## Special considerations

- **MRSA**: Vancomycin or clindamycin are recommended empirically if local MRSA prevalence exceeds 10–15% [^111MrCFQ] [^116PJxL1].
- **Neonates**: Empiric therapy should cover Gram-negative organisms and include ampicillin plus gentamicin or cefotaxime [^116PJxL1].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Broader-spectrum empiric therapy may be necessary based on individual risk factors [^1145n3J2].

---

Empiric antibiotic therapy for pediatric septic arthritis should prioritize coverage for Staphylococcus aureus and Kingella kingae, with adjustments based on local resistance patterns and patient-specific factors. Transition to oral therapy and shorter total duration are appropriate with rapid clinical improvement and CRP decline, while **longer courses are reserved for complicated cases** [^113Rid9m].

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) in children — empiric antimicrobial therapy and organism targets: The panel judged that the benefit of empiric therapy active against Staphylococcus aureus outweighs harms and thus support a strong recommendation. For Kingella kingae, the available indirect evidence shows a possible but minimal clinical effect of empirically adding coverage for K. kingae, the certainty in the balance of benefits versus harms was low, and for infants, toddlers, and preschool-aged children (6 to 48 months of age) only a conditional recommendation was made. Appropriate choice of empiric therapy should be guided by local antibiotic resistance patterns (CA-MRSA) and/or hospital antibiogram as well as disease severity and immunization status; due to lack of published data for alternative options, this does not permit recommendations for their routine use at this time, and the committee did not provide a recommendation for starting treatment by the oral route of administration.

### Proceedings of the 29th European paediatric rheumatology congress [^111ENzzF]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Results: Septic arthritis is a rare clinical presentation of invasive GAS infection in the pediatric age. Fever with painful, swollen and limited joints are the most common symptoms: a monoarticular course is usual, although in 5–10% of cases more joints are simultaneously involved. Bacterial blood cultures should confirm diagnostic suspicion. A antibiotic combination of β-lactams and clindamycin is recommended as the best therapeutic strategy.

Conclusion: Our case, due to recent worldwide outbreak, would underline the importance to keep in mind this uncommon, but severe manifestation of misdiagnosed GAS infections. Prompt investigation and appropriate treatment in the presence of "red flags" ensure clinical remission with complete osteo-articular recovery and reduced long-term complications.

### Improved diagnosis and treatment of bone and joint infections using an evidence-based treatment guideline [^112zEdTK]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Our institution created a multidisciplinary guideline for treatment of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) and septic arthritis (SA) in response to updates in evidence-based literature in the field and existing provider variability in treatment. This guideline aims to improve the care of these patients by standardizing diagnosis and treatment and incorporating up to date evidence-based research into practice. The primary objective of this study is to compare cases before versus after the implementation of the guideline to determine concrete effects the guideline has had in the care of patients with AHO and SA.

Methods

This is an Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective study of pediatric patients age 6 months to 18 years hospitalized between January 2009 and July 2016 with a diagnosis of AHO or SA qualifying for the guideline. Cohorts were categorized: preguideline and postguideline. Exclusion criteria consisted of: symptoms > 14 days, multifocal involvement, hemodynamic instability, sepsis, or history of immune deficiency or chronic systemic disease. Cohorts were compared for outcomes that described clinical course.

Results

Data were included for 117 cases that qualified for the guideline: 54 preguideline and 63 postguideline. Following the successful implementation of the guideline, we found significant decrease in the length of intravenous antibiotic treatment (P < 0.001), decrease in peripherally inserted central catheter use (P < 0.001), and an increase in bacterial identification (P = 0.040). Bacterial identification allowed for targeted antibiotic therapy. There was no change in length of hospital stay or readmission rate after the implementation of the guideline.

Conclusion

Utilizing an evidence-based treatment guideline for pediatric acute hematogenous bone and joint infections can lead to improved bacterial diagnosis and decreased burden of treatment through early oral antibiotic use.

### Septic arthritis of facet joint in children: a systematic review and a 10-year consecutive case series [^1118HmMJ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Due to the low resolution of historical imaging technologies, descriptions of Septic Arthritis of Facet Joint (SAFJ) in children are scarce, though severe cases are known. We first aimed to estimate the incidence rate of SAFJ in children; we further aimed to specify SAFJ clinical, imaging and laboratory findings, and identify avenues for appropriate management.

Methods

A 10-year consecutive SAFJ case series using our imaging center database combined with a 50-year systematic review of literature cases.

Results

The mean ± SD incidence of pediatric SAFJ was 0.23 ± 0.4/100,000 children-years. The key symptoms were potty refusal (in toddlers) or painful sitting (78%) and lateralized signs (paravertebral tenderness and/or swelling, 88%). SAFJ diagnosis and extension were obtained using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (94%), and found an epidural extension in 8/16 cases. The mean duration of antibiotic treatment was 5.1 weeks. The compliance with guidelines was 79% for empiric and 62% for targeted antibiotic therapies.

Conclusions

SAFJ incidence in children is much greater than expected from the literature. Half of cases were complicated by an epidural infection. Simple clinical symptoms detected as early as the bedside allow a strong suspicion of SAFJ, justifying the use of a first-line MRI to confirm the diagnosis and precisely describe the extension. Focusing on simple clinical signs is key to justify the transfer of a child or the shortening of the delay to obtain an MRI. However, as MRI availability increases in most Western countries, and the capacity for diagnosis increases, the awareness of SAFJ must be spread to avoid missed cases.

### Management of a child with suspected acute septic arthritis [^11482TQy]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Acute septic arthritis of childhood is a potentially devastating disease that causes permanent disability and can result in death. Traditional treatment consists of a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics combined with aggressive surgery. However, this approach is challenged by trials showing satisfactory outcomes with shorter treatment and less invasive surgery. Diagnostic arthrocentesis alone and an antibiotic for a fortnight, including initial intravenous administration for 2–4 days, suffice in most non-neonatal cases. A good penetrating agent, such as clindamycin or a first-generation cephalosporin, exceptionally high doses, and administration four times a day are probably key factors. If the symptoms and signs subside within a few days, and the serum C-reactive protein level drops below 20 mg/l, the antibiotic can usually be safely discontinued. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a concern, but fortunately, most strains have retained susceptibility to clindamycin. The above guidance is not applicable to neonates and immunocompromised patients who may require a different approach.

### A clinical practice guideline for treatment of septic arthritis in children: efficacy in improving process of care and effect on outcome of septic arthritis of the hip [^1142XFWZ]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The development of clinical practice guidelines is a central precept of the evidence-based-medicine movement. The purposes of this study were to develop a guideline for the treatment of septic arthritis in children and to evaluate its efficacy with regard to improving the process of care and its effect on the outcome of septic arthritis of the hip in children.

Methods

A clinical practice guideline was developed by an interdisciplinary expert committee using evidence-based techniques. Efficacy was evaluated by comparing a historical control group of thirty consecutive children with septic arthritis of the hip managed before the utilization of the guideline with a prospective cohort group of thirty consecutive children treated with use of the guideline. Benchmark parameters of process and outcome were compared between groups.

Results

The patients treated with use of the guideline, compared with those treated without use of the guideline, had a significantly higher rate of performance of initial and follow-up C-reactive protein tests (93% compared with 13% and 70% compared with 7%), lower rate of initial bone-scanning (13% compared with 40%), lower rate of presumptive drainage (13% compared with 47%), greater compliance with recommended antibiotic therapy (93% compared with 7%), faster change to oral antibiotics (3.9 compared with 6.9 days), and shorter hospital stay (4.8 compared with 8.3 days). There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to other process variables, and there were no significant differences with regard to outcome variables, including readmission to the hospital, recurrent infection, recurrent drainage, development of osteomyelitis, septic osteonecrosis, or limitation of motion.

Conclusions

Patients treated according to the septic arthritis clinical practice guideline had less variation in the process of care and improved efficiency of care without a significant difference in outcome.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) — post-discharge nonresponse and persistent bacteremia: For children with secondary failure following hospital discharge, assessment of adherence is necessary and repeat imaging may be necessary; persistent bacteremia is often due to occult secondary foci of infection or an associated deep vein thrombosis, and evaluation for uncontrolled sources of infection should be considered; when bacteremia persists 48 to 72 hours into antimicrobial therapy, the panel suggests obtaining MRI of the site(s) of infection to detect a focus amenable to surgical drainage, and detection of deep vein thrombosis may require specialized imaging and may impact antibiotic regimen choice as well as route and duration.

### An in-housePCR in a large pediatric cohort: impact on diagnosis, antimicrobial stewardship, and clinical outcomes [^117C88xE]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig 3
Empiric antibiotic coverage by clinical diagnosis among KKIN-positive patients. The bar plot depicts the number of subjects with septic arthritis/ ABA (n = 23), osteomyelitis/ AHO (n = 15), ABA and AHO (n = 3), myositis (n = 2), and spondylodiscitis (n = 2) who were treated empirically with an antimicrobial regimen expected to have activity against K. kingae (gray), no activity against K. kingae (pink), or who received no empiric antimicrobial therapy prior to reporting of KKIN PCR/culture (red).

Across all subjects, KKIN PCR results made a direct impact on patient management in 93% (42/45) subjects, with antimicrobial changes and hospital discharge occurring on the same day of the KKIN PCR report in 84% (38/45) and 58% (26/45) subjects, respectively. Most antimicrobial modifications were de-escalations, as 62% (28/45) of the subjects were on combination therapy with broad-spectrum agents empirically, while no subjects remained on multiple agents, and only one subject remained on a broad-spectrum agent for targeted therapy (Table S1).

Subjects were treated for a median duration of 21 days (IQR; range: 21–28; 18–196). There was no difference in duration of therapy among subjects with K. kingae detection by culture versus PCR only (data not shown). Follow-up medical encounters were documented for 44/45 KKIN positive subjects, at a median (IQR) of 28 (18–78) days after discharge or sample collection for subjects not admitted. Despite the lack of susceptibility data for those subjects that were positive by only KKIN PCR (n = 36), all subjects were successfully treated with complete resolution of symptoms on follow-up and no evidence of treatment failure.

IMPACT OF HIB VACCINES ON MICROBIAL ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE

In addition to reduced morbidity and mortality from bacterial infections, antibacterial vaccines offer the possibility of reducing antibiotic resistance among organisms that colonize, and potentially infect, vaccine recipients. Indeed, Hib vaccine has been shown to significantly reduce Hib infections in Finland such that Hib resistant to β-lactam antibiotics need not be considered in the differential diagnosis of septic arthritis in immunized, young children [132]. Thus, narrower-spectrum empiric antibiotic therapy may be initiated.

Blood cultures — suspected acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) in children: Blood cultures performed before antibiotic administration will identify the etiology of infection in about 20% of cases and may provide the only positive diagnostic result; a positive blood culture does not obviate the need for an invasive diagnostic procedure with additional cultures. Blood cultures have relatively low cost and the primary undesirable effects are those associated with venipuncture, and false positive results due to contamination are often readily discernible and do not generate undesirable consequences once the organism is speciated. The panel made a strong recommendation for the use of blood cultures as part of the initial evaluation for potential ABA based on benefits that clearly outweigh risks. In circumstances where obtaining blood for culture cannot readily be accomplished and there are concerns for possible associated sepsis or rapid progression of infection, initiation of antimicrobial therapy should not be delayed.

PIDS/IDSA 2023 pediatric ABA without osteomyelitis — randomized trial comparing short vs long therapy: One prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial compared short (10 to 15 days) versus long (30 days) courses; both arms included two to four days of parenteral antibiotics followed by high dose oral antibiotics, and in the short-term group antibiotics were stopped when there was evidence of clinical recovery and the CRP had declined to < 20 mg/L. A total of 200 children aged 3 months to 15 years were randomized, with outcomes for 130 analyzed (47 excluded for lack of isolated organism and 23 for adjacent osteomyelitis); 63 were assigned to short-term (median 10 days total, IQR 10–15 days) and 67 to long-term (all 30 days), and both groups received IV therapy for a mean of 3 days before oral switch. At 2 weeks, more children in the short-term group experienced full clinical recovery compared with the long-term group (53/63 (84.1%) vs 46/67 (68.7%), P-value 0.04), and at 3 and 12 months all 130 had full recovery without recurrence or sequelae; the certainty of evidence was rated as low due to risk of bias and imprecision.

### Prospective evaluation of a shortened regimen of treatment for acute osteomyelitis and septic arthritis in children [^1168f5xU]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

We present the findings of a prospective, bi-center study to establish the appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy for acute, uncomplicated bone and joint infections in children. Historically, patients have been treated with prolonged courses of intravenous and oral therapy. Our hypothesis was that children could be safely treated with 3 days of high-dose intravenous therapy followed by 3 weeks of oral therapy.

Methods

We prospectively collected data from children presenting to Birmingham Children's Hospital and The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne who fitted our diagnostic criteria for septic arthritis and osteomyelitis over a 52-month period. Inclusion criteria for entry into the database were children ≤ 16 years of age who had no underlying disease or medical therapy predisposing to infection, and who had symptoms for less than 14 days before presentation. They were all started on intravenous antibiotics and a predetermined treatment algorithm was followed. All patients with septic arthritis also underwent joint washout. The patients were converted to oral antibiotics once they improved clinically and hematologically. Regular outpatient follow-up continued for 1 year with blood tests and x-rays.

Results

Our database included 70 consecutive, eligible children aged 2 weeks to 14 years. Staphylococci were the only organisms isolated in cases of osteomyelitis, whereas Streptococcal infection was more prevalent in patients with septic arthritis. Using our treatment protocol, we found that 59% of children could be converted to oral therapy after 3 days of intravenous therapy and 86% after 5 days. The median duration of inpatient stay was 5 days. We established that 3 weeks of oral therapy was appropriate for those patients who received 5 days or less intravenous treatment. We have identified temperature and C-reactive protein as the best quantitative means of monitoring response to therapy. All patients were clinically, hematologically, and radiologically normal before discharge 1 year post-presentation.

Conclusions

We have found that a shortened course of intravenous and oral antibiotic therapy is effective in the management of acute uncomplicated bone and joint sepsis in children.

Antibiotic duration guidance for acute bacterial arthritis indicates that shorter courses are appropriate when there is rapid clinical improvement with a consistent, progressive decrease in CRP by the end of the first week of treatment, whereas longer courses, such as 21 to 28 days, are reasonable when clinical improvement and reduction of the systemic inflammatory response occur more slowly.

### Pediatric septic arthritis [^112NYAhy]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Acute septic arthritis is a condition with the potential for joint destruction, physeal damage, and osteonecrosis, which warrants urgent identification and treatment. The organism most frequently responsible is Staphylococcus aureus; however, our understanding of pathogens continues to evolve as detection methods continue to improve. MRI has improved our ability to detect concurrent infections and is a useful clinical tool where available. The treatment course involves intravenous antibiotics followed by transition to oral antibiotics when clinically appropriate. The recommended surgical treatment of septic arthritis is open arthrotomy with decompression of the joint, irrigation, and debridement and treatment of concurrent infections.

### Impact of antibiotic pretreatment on cultures in children with osteomyelitis and septic arthritis: a retrospective review [^111ZhHKi]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Pretreatment of patients with antibiotics prior to culture was not associated with a significant change in culture yield, even as the duration of antibiotics increased. Routinely initiating antibiotics early in the illness course may enable reduction of variability and improve coordination of care as these infections often require a multidisciplinary approach. Prospective studies or trials are needed to determine if early initiation of antibiotics affects culture positivity or improves clinical outcomes.

### Etiology of septic arthritis in children: an update for the new millennium [^112gqfhN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to describe the causative organisms and joints involved in cases of pediatric septic arthritis in the post-Haemophilus influenzae type B and post-pneumococcal vaccine age and in the age of increasing infection with community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA).

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review of all children younger than 13 years presenting to our tertiary care pediatric emergency department between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2007, with the diagnosis of septic arthritis. We reviewed the results of synovial fluid Gram stain and synovial fluid and blood culture. We defined septic arthritis as any of these 3 tests being positive for a known pathogen. We report patient characteristics, joint(s) involved, and organisms identified in these cases.

Results

We describe 13 cases of septic arthritis. Fifteen joints were involved. The most common joint involved was the hip (6/15) followed by the elbow (3/15), knee (2/15), and ankle (2/15). The most common organism involved was methicillin-sensitive S aureus (6/13), followed by CA-MRSA (2/13) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (2/13).

Conclusion

Our results support continued concern for involvement of the hip and knee in cases of pediatric septic arthritis and consideration of other joints such as the elbow. Our data also suggest that empiric antibiotic coverage for CA-MRSA is indicated in cases of pediatric septic arthritis, as well as continued coverage for methicillin-sensitive S aureus and S pneumoniae.

### What's new in pediatric septic arthritis? A review of pertinent clinical questions [^111Y5hvG]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The evaluation and treatment of children with septic arthritis (SA) is challenging and requires an organized approach to address the spectrum of pathogens which appear to aggregate in age-specific groups. Although evidence-based guidelines have recently been published for the evaluation and treatment of children with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis, there is a relative dearth of literature devoted exclusively to SA.

Methods

Recently published guidance for the evaluation and treatment of children with SA was reviewed and evaluated with respect to pertinent clinical questions to summarize what is new in this area of practice for pediatric orthopaedic surgeons.

Results

Evidence suggests that there is a profound difference between children with primary SA and those who have contiguous osteomyelitis. This disruption of the commonly accepted paradigm of a continuum of osteoarticular infections has important implications in the evaluation and treatment of children with primary SA. Clinical prediction algorithms have been established to help determine the applicability of magnetic resonance imaging during the evaluation of children suspected to have SA. Antibiotic duration for SA has been recently studied with some evidence in favor of short-course parenteral followed by short-course oral therapy may be successful if the pathogen is not methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

Conclusion

Recent studies of children with SA have provided better guidance for evaluation and treatment to improve diagnostic accuracy, processes of evaluation, and clinical outcomes.

### Current concepts in pediatric septic arthritis [^111J6Vcr]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). Medium credibility.

Septic arthritis continues to present challenges regarding the clinical diagnosis, workup, and definitive management. Urgent management is essential, so treating surgeons must efficiently work through differential diagnoses, identify concomitant infections, and do a timely irrigation and débridement. The incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is increasing, typically resulting in a more rapid progression of symptoms with more severe clinical presentation. The diagnostic utility of MRI has resulted in improved detection of concomitant septic arthritis and osteomyelitis, although MRI must not substantially delay definitive management. Early diagnosis followed by urgent irrigation and débridement and antibiotic therapy are essential for satisfactory long-term outcomes. Antibiotics should not be administered until blood cultures and arthrocentesis fluid are obtained, except in rare cases of a septic or toxic patient. Once cultures are obtained, empiric antibiotic therapy should commence and provide coverage for the most likely pathogens, given the patient's age. Laboratory markers, especially C-reactive protein, should be followed until normalization and correlate with resolution of clinical symptoms. Definitive antibiotic selection should be shared with a pediatric infectious disease specialist, who can help guide the duration of treatment.

Transition to oral therapy or outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT) for hospitalized children with presumed or confirmed ABA — For children who responded to initial parenteral antibiotic therapy, "we suggest an early transition to an oral antibiotic regimen rather than OPAT when an appropriate, well-tolerated oral antibiotic option is available, and that antibiotic is active against the confirmed or presumed pathogen(s)". For children for whom oral therapy is not feasible, "we suggest transition from the acute-care hospital to OPAT, rather than remaining in the hospital for the total duration of therapy". Background notes that "ABA in children was once thought to require antimicrobial therapy for 21 to 28 days with at least 14 to 21 days via the intravenous route".

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) timing of empiric antimicrobials — In children with presumed ABA who are ill-appearing or have rapidly progressive infection, we recommend immediately starting empiric antimicrobial therapy (after blood cultures are obtained if possible) rather than withholding antibiotics until invasive diagnostic procedures are performed (strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence), and invasive diagnostic procedures should occur as soon as feasible, even if antibiotics have already been administered. In children with presumed ABA who do not appear clinically ill, we suggest withholding antimicrobial therapy, while under careful observation, until an initial joint aspirate is collected for diagnostic purposes (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). The decision to initiate antimicrobials prior to invasive diagnostic procedures depends on the severity of the clinical presentation, local accessibility to experts and resources or, if appropriate, the time required for transport to a higher level of care for additional diagnostic or debridement procedures. The ability to diagnose pathogens by molecular diagnostic techniques suggests that critical information on pathogen identity is now less dependent on obtaining bacterial cultures prior to starting antimicrobial therapy.

Pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) — rationale for reassessment when a child is not responding: Re-evaluation of the child should be considered, especially in scenarios of presumed ABA with no pathogen identified and without bone involvement, rather than empirically broadening antibacterial coverage or restarting antibiotics, which could place the child at unnecessary risk of additional antibiotic exposure and missed opportunities for appropriate management, and benefits of such reassessment are believed to be large and unequivocal.

### Impact of antibiotic pretreatment on cultures in children with osteomyelitis and septic arthritis: a retrospective review [^116cgf9z]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Though empiric antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment, the ideal time to initiate antibiotics is debated. Empiric antibiotics may decrease pathogen isolation thereby preventing targeted antimicrobial treatment, whereas delay in treatment may lead to increased complications. The optimal time to initiate antibiotics to prevent treatment delays while maximizing culture yield is not well studied in the pediatric population, and existing studies tend to be small. Several pediatric studies have found no difference in operative culture results between patients whose cultures were pretreated with antibiotics and those who did not receive antibiotics, though there was an association between longer duration of antibiotics and likelihood of having a negative culture. Identifying the effect of antibiotics on culture yield may help clinicians determine when to initiate antimicrobial therapy.

In this study, we sought to examine associations between laboratory values, duration of antibiotics prior to culture, and culture type on pathogen identification of blood, bone, joint, and "other" (wound, abscess, or fluid other than joint fluid) bacterial cultures. To our knowledge, this is the largest study performed to evaluate culture type and duration of antibiotic pretreatment on culture results in pediatric osteomyelitis and/or septic arthritis.

Pediatric acute bacterial arthritis — empiric antibiotics before joint fluid collection and patient outcomes: The guideline's review was unable to find prospectively collected data on risks and benefits of delaying empiric antimicrobial therapy in presumed ABA; instead, six retrospective observational studies with small samples and only unadjusted analyses evaluated empiric antibiotic administration prior to joint fluid collection. All six studies reported culture yield with or without antibiotic pre-treatment, and pooled analysis suggested a comparable yield of synovial fluid cultures with antibiotic pre-treatment (RD: 1.2% increased yield [95%CI: -12.0 to 14.5%]). Analyses of patient-important outcomes indicated that delaying antibiotics until after joint fluid collection may or may not have reduced complications (RD: -12.0%, 95%CI: -33.0 to 9.0%) and the requirement for repeat irrigation and debridement ("washouts") (RD: -4.0%, 95%CI: -25.3 to 17.0%), with certainty in the evidence judged very low due to very serious risk of bias, unadjusted analyses, and imprecision.

### Diagnosis and management of acute osteoarticular infections: summary of new guidelines [^115dxMMT]. Pediatrics in Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) and acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) are among the most common invasive bacterial infections in otherwise healthy children. The diagnosis of AHO and ABA requires a high index of suspicion in children presenting with fever and musculoskeletal pain and judiciously chosen laboratory and imaging studies. Choosing the appropriate empirical antibiotic requires familiarity with local susceptibility patterns, especially for Staphylococcus aureus. Typical antibiotic duration for osteoarticular infection is 2–4 weeks depending on the type of infection, response to therapy, and presence of complications. Transitioning from parenteral to oral antibiotics is guided by clinical and laboratory evidence of resolving infection. This review will provide an overview of the recommendations contained in the 2 recently published guidelines for the management of AHO and ABA.

### Impact of antibiotic pretreatment on cultures in children with osteomyelitis and septic arthritis: a retrospective review [^114FjH5R]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteomyelitis and septic arthritis are two diagnoses commonly encountered in pediatric hospital medicine with an incidence of 1 in 5000–10,000 and 1 in 2700–100,000, respectively. These diagnoses frequently require hospitalization for workup and initiation of treatment. Treatment involves prompt diagnosis, long-term antimicrobial therapy, and sometimes surgical debridement. Though there is a lack of universally-accepted diagnostic criteria for these infections, a combination of pathogen detection, imaging consistent with osteomyelitis and/or septic arthritis, and clinical data such as inability to bear weight, decreased range of motion, presence of fever, and elevated inflammatory markers or white blood cell (WBC) count is often used to confirm the diagnosis.

Pathogen detection is important to direct and narrow antimicrobial therapy, but patients may be treated for these infections even with negative cultures to avoid complications related to untreated infection. Cultures may not yield the causative organism, or the pathogen may only be isolated from the affected bone or joint. Rates of culture-negative pediatric musculoskeletal infection range from 16 to 42%. Initial blood cultures have been reported to be positive in 30–50% of children with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis, whereas bone biopsy cultures are reported to be positive in 50–70%. A systematic review and several other small studies of pediatric patients with acute osteomyelitis and/or septic arthritis found that pathogens were more likely to be isolated from culture samples at the source of infection (joint aspirate, bone biopsy, pus) than from blood culture.

Intra-articular antibiotic placement in pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) — the guideline issues "a strong recommendation against this practice, despite very low certainty of evidence", noting that "the potential additional risks of therapy and costs preclude a recommendation for routine surgical placement of antibiotics". Most antibiotics "achieve excellent concentrations in synovial fluid following parenteral or oral administration", pediatric data are lacking and "prospective data on the use of locally placed antibiotics for osteomyelitis or ABA have not been published", and adult reports include wound complications in 5/21 patients and a retrospective analysis of 51 adults with culture negative prosthetic joint infection receiving intra-articular antimicrobials with favorable cure rates; furthermore, outcomes in appropriately treated children are "not documented to be improved with the addition of intra-particularly placed antibiotics".

### Septic arthritis: diagnosis and treatment [^116ZQNFw]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Septic arthritis must be considered and promptly diagnosed in any patient presenting with acute atraumatic joint pain, swelling, and fever. Risk factors for septic arthritis include age older than 80 years, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, recent joint surgery, hip or knee prosthesis, skin infection, and immunosuppressive medication use. A delay in diagnosis and treatment can result in permanent morbidity and mortality. Physical examination findings and serum markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, are helpful in the diagnosis but are nonspecific. Synovial fluid studies are required to confirm the diagnosis. History and Gram stain aid in determining initial antibiotic selection. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen isolated in septic arthritis; however, other bacteria, viruses, fungi, and mycobacterium can cause the disease. After synovial fluid has been obtained, empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated if there is clinical concern for septic arthritis. Oral antibiotics can be given in most cases because they are not inferior to intravenous therapy. Total duration of therapy ranges from two to six weeks; however, certain infections require longer courses. Consideration for microorganisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Borrelia burgdorferi, and fungal infections should be based on history findings and laboratory results.

Acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) empiric antimicrobial selection — In children with suspected ABA, we recommend using empiric antimicrobial therapy active against S. aureus (strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). Antimicrobials with activity against community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) should be considered based on local susceptibility data and severity of disease, and adding empiric antimicrobial coverage for pathogens in addition to coverage for S. aureus may be warranted when other pathogens are suspected based on relevant aspects of immunization, exposure history, clinical presentation, or physical examination. In infants and preschool aged children (6 to 48 months of age) with suspected ABA, we suggest selecting empiric therapy to include activity against K. kingae rather than only targeting S. aureus (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence).

This pragmatic practice note aims to provide a consensus framework of best current practice prior to the availability of data from large national randomised controlled trials. For straightforward infection in previously normal children, recent trends suggest that shorter length of intravenous therapy with switch to oral treatment is acceptable, although this is not the case for the management of complex infections including those with multifocal disease, significant bone destruction, resistant or unusual pathogens, sepsis or in immunosuppressed children.

Imaging plays an integral role in the evaluation of suspected musculoskeletal infections in children, not only in the accurate identification of infection such as osteomyelitis or septic arthritis, but also in guiding management. Various diagnostic modalities serve different purposes in the assessment of suspected pediatric musculoskeletal infections. The purpose of this document is to provide imaging guidance in the most frequently encountered clinical scenarios in which osteomyelitis and/or septic arthritis are suspected, outside of the axial skeleton. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.

Antimicrobial duration for primary acute bacterial arthritis without adjacent osteomyelitis — In children with confirmed primary ABA with rapid clinical improvement and consistent, progressive decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) by the end of the first week of treatment, we suggest treating for a total duration of antimicrobial therapy (parenteral plus oral) as short as 10 to 14 days for common pathogens (S. aureus, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae type b), rather than longer courses of 21 to 28 days (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). In children with presumed primary ABA without adjacent osteomyelitis meeting the same response criteria, we suggest treating for a total duration of antimicrobial therapy (parenteral plus oral) as short as 10 to 14 days rather than for longer courses (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Comment language states that for slower clinical response, inadequate source control, or persistently elevated CRP, courses of therapy of 21 to 28 days may be preferred, that longer durations may be more commonly required for pathogens with relatively less antibiotic susceptibility or greater virulence, and that children with ABA with adjacent osteomyelitis should be treated according to the osteomyelitis guideline.

### Prospective, randomized trial of 10 days versus 30 days of antimicrobial treatment, including a short-term course of parenteral therapy, for childhood septic arthritis [^112UzQ9k]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The standard treatment for septic arthritis in children is antimicrobials for several weeks (initially administered intravenously) and arthrotomy (at least for the hip and shoulder joints). No sufficiently powered study has examined the true need for these treatments.

Methods

In a randomized, multicenter prospective trial in Finland, children aged 3 months to 15 years who had culture-positive septic arthritis were randomized to receive clindamycin or a first-generation cephalosporin for 10 days or 30 days (intravenously for the first 2–4 days). The number of surgical procedures was kept to a minimum. Illness was monitored with preset criteria. Antimicrobial therapy was discontinued when the clinical response was good and the C-reactive protein level decreased to 20 mg/L. The primary end point was full recovery without need for further administration of antimicrobial therapy because of an osteoarticular indication during the 12 months after therapy.

Results

Of the total 130 cases, 88% were caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, or Streptococcus pyogenes; 63 patients were in the short-term treatment group, and 67 were in the long-term treatment group. The median durations of antimicrobial treatment were 10 days and 30 days, respectively. Surgical procedures that were more extensive than percutaneous joint aspiration were performed for 12% of patients, with no preponderance to hip or shoulder arthritis. Two late-onset infections occurred in 1 child in the long-term treatment group; however, all patients recovered without sequelae.

Conclusions

Large doses of well-absorbed antimicrobials for < 2 weeks (initially administered intravenously) and only 1 joint aspiration are sufficient for treatment of most cases of childhood septic arthritis, regardless of the infecting pathogen or anatomical site, if the clinical response is good and the C-reactive protein level normalizes shortly after initiation of treatment.

PIDS/IDSA pediatric acute bacterial arthritis — Staphylococcus aureus antimicrobial selection: When S. aureus is suspected to be susceptible to both clindamycin and vancomycin, empiric use of clindamycin is preferred over vancomycin. For methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), alternatives to vancomycin should be considered for vancomycin non-susceptible strains (MIC ≥ 2 μg/mL). Parenteral daptomycin and parenteral/oral linezolid have been studied in prospective pediatric trials for complicated staphylococcal skin infections, including MRSA, and provide options based on in vitro susceptibility testing. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) shows in vitro activity against most S. aureus strains including CA-MRSA, but no controlled, comparative data exist for TMP/SMX in ABA caused by CA-MRSA. No controlled, comparative data support the choice of one of these agents over another for invasive MRSA infections in children, and no controlled data exist to base recommendations for synergistic combination therapy; however, combining agents to broaden empiric antibacterial spectrum is appropriate for severe infections, particularly when Gram-negative coverage in addition to S. aureus is needed.

Acute bacterial arthritis (pediatric) — management when therapy fails or infection recurs: For children with presumed or confirmed acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) experiencing primary treatment failure or recurrence, clinicians should assess adequacy of the antimicrobial regimen and adequacy of joint debridement and irrigation before deciding on the need to broaden the spectrum or to restart antimicrobials, and clinicians should assess the need for additional diagnostic evaluation for possible adjacent osteomyelitis and for surgical intervention; the initial diagnosis of primary ABA may need to be reconsidered.

Staphylococcus aureusis the most common cause in children. When septic arthritis is suspected an orthopedic surgeon should be consulted urgently; tapping the joint is useful for diagnosis as well as for therapy. Initial therapy should include antistaphylococcal antibiotics, which can be changed subsequently depending on culture and sensitivity results.

### Clinical features and outcomes of children with culture-negative septic arthritis [^111jH2gg]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Septic arthritis is a serious infection, but the results of blood and joint fluid cultures are often negative in children. We describe here the clinical features and management of culture-negative septic arthritis in children at our hospital and their outcomes.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of a cohort of children with septic arthritis who were hospitalized at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between January 2002 and December 2014. Culture-negative septic arthritis was defined as a joint white blood cell count of > 50000/μL with associated symptoms, a clinical diagnosis of septic arthritis, and a negative culture result. Children with pretreatment, an intensive case unit admission, Lyme arthritis, immunodeficiency, or surgical hardware were excluded. Treatment failure included a change in antibiotics, surgery, and/or reevaluation because of a lack of improvement/worsening.

Results

We identified 157 children with septic arthritis. The patients with concurrent osteomyelitis (n = 28) had higher inflammatory marker levels at presentation, had a longer duration of symptoms (median, 4.5 vs 3 days, respectively; P < .001), and more often had bacteremia (46.4% vs 6.2%, respectively; P < .001). Among children with septic arthritis without associated osteomyelitis, 69% (89 of 129) had negative culture results. These children had lower C-reactive protein levels (median, 4.0 vs 7.3 mg/dL, respectively; p = 0.001) and erythrocyte sedimentation rates (median, 39 vs 51 mm/hour, respectively; p = 0.01) at admission and less often had foot/ankle involvement (P = .02). Among the children with culture-negative septic arthritis, the inpatient treatment failure rate was 9.1%, and treatment failure was more common in boys than in girls (17.1% vs 3.8%, respectively; p = 0.03). We found no association between treatment failure and empiric antibiotics or patient age. No outpatient treatment failures occurred during the 6-month follow-up period, although 17% of the children discharged with a peripherally inserted central catheter line experienced complications, including 3 with bacteremia.

Conclusions

The majority of septic arthritis infections at our institution were culture negative. Among patients with culture-negative infection, empiric antibiotics failed for 9% and necessitated a change in therapy. More sensitive diagnostic testing should be implemented to elucidate the causes of culture-negative septic arthritis in children.

### Treatment of acute septic arthritis [^112XunEM]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Acute septic arthritis is a rare, but potentially devastating disease. The treatment is initiated intravenously, but can be safely switched to oral after 2–4 days providing large doses of a well-absorbing antibiotic and, for time-dependent antibiotics, 4 times-a-day administration are used. Empiric treatment should always cover Staphylococcus aureus and common respiratory pathogens, whereas Kingella kingae and Salmonella are important only regionally. Studies conducted by our group have shown that a total course of 10 days may suffice for previously healthy children in a Western setting. Treatment of neonates, patients with immunodeficiency or cases caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus, may deserve a different approach.

PIDS/IDSA 2023 pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) without adjacent osteomyelitis — duration of therapy recommendations: In children with presumed primary ABA without adjacent osteomyelitis with rapid clinical improvement and consistent, progressive decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) by the end of the first week of treatment, we suggest treating for a total duration of antimicrobial therapy (parenteral plus oral) as short as 10 to 14 days rather than for longer courses (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). For children with slower clinical response, inadequate source control, or persistently elevated CRP, courses of therapy of 21 to 28 days may be preferred. These treatment recommendations apply to children with ABA who do not have adjacent osteomyelitis; when osteomyelitis is present, treatment recommendations for it, which frequently include longer treatment duration, supersede these recommendations.

Rationale for recommendation — agent selection during response to empiric therapy in pediatric ABA: Treatment of children with presumed or documented ABA that is responding to empiric antibiotic therapy is best managed by selecting a definitive antimicrobial regimen with either parenteral or oral agents based on principles of selecting an effective agent with the narrowest spectrum agent with the lowest adverse event profile and the best host tolerance, and the benefits of selecting an agent based on these principles are expected to be large and unequivocal.

### Primary septic arthritis among children 6 to 48 months of age: implications for PCR acquisition and empiric antimicrobial selection [^111yTBfU]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary septic arthritis requires unique evaluation and treatment considerations for children in the 6- to 48-month age range because of the spectrum of identified pathogens and high rate of negative cultures. The purpose of this study is to evaluate primary septic arthritis in this age group in order to differentiate children with infection caused by Kingella kingae from those with other confirmed pathogens and those with no identified pathogen.

Methods

Preschool children who underwent multidisciplinary evaluation and treatment for septic arthritis between 2009 and 2019 were retrospectively studied. Three cohorts were established for comparison of clinical and laboratory features of primary septic arthritis: (1) confirmed K. kingae, (2) confirmed other pathogen, and (3) presumed (without identified pathogen).

Results

Among 139 children with septic arthritis, 40 (29%) were confirmed K. kingae, 29 (21%) other pathogen, and 70 (50%) presumed. Children with Kingella and those with presumed septic arthritis had significantly lower initial C-reactive protein (4.8 and 4.5 vs. 9.3mg/dL) and fewer febrile hospital days (0.2 and 0.4 vs. 1.3d) than children with other confirmed pathogens. Children with other pathogens had higher rates of bacteremia (38% vs. 0%) and positive joint fluid cultures (86% vs. 15%) than that of children with Kingella. The rate of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) acquisition was 38 of 40 (95.0%) Kingella cases, 18 of 29 (62.1%) other pathogen cases, and 33 of 70 (47.1%) presumed cases.

Conclusions

K. kingae was the most commonly identified pathogen among 6-month to 4-year-old children. The Kingella and other identified pathogens in this study serve to guide empiric antimicrobial recommendations for this age range. Because of similarities between children with septic arthritis because of K. kingae and those with no identified pathogen, it is likely that an unrecognized burden of Kingella resides in culture negative cases, particularly if no PCR is sent. Systematic evaluation, including PCR acquisition, and a high index of suspicion for K. kingae are recommended to thoroughly evaluate septic arthritis in preschool children.

Level Of Evidence

Decide on oral antibiotics based on the in vitro activity, oral bioavailability, and diffusion to the synovial fluid.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

PIDS/IDSA pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) empiric therapy decisions are best informed by review of the most recent data on ABA pathogens identified in a clinician's region, particularly with respect to susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) isolates. Across reports, bacterial pathogens other than S. aureus accounted for from 15.4% to 92.1%, with Group A Streptococcus representing up to 14% in some studies; outside S. aureus, Kingella kingae, and group A Streptococcus, no other pathogen occurred in greater than 5% of cases in any study. For S. aureus coverage, many isolates remain susceptible to anti-staphylococcal penicillins (ASP) such as oxacillin and nafcillin and to first-generation cephalosporins such as cefazolin and cephalexin; cefazolin and nafcillin/oxacillin are considered therapeutically equivalent in pediatric ABA, although no comparative data are available for an ASP and cefazolin. In regions with low rates of CA-MRSA arthritis (less than ~10%), some experts begin therapy with oxacillin/nafcillin or cefazolin for children with mild to moderate illness, watching closely for a response to treatment. Where resistance to methicillin is estimated to be 10–20% or greater, consideration should be given for empiric therapy to include agents active against invasive CA-MRSA, and effective empiric therapy for CA-MRSA ABA is expected with clindamycin (unless local clindamycin resistance rates are high), vancomycin, daptomycin, ceftaroline, and linezolid. Clindamycin resistance occurs in both MRSA and MSSA and should be a factor in selecting empiric therapy, with documented rates of 5% to 40% of all S. aureus isolates.

### Septic arthritis: current diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm [^116kYzWB]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To propose and discuss an evidence-based algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of bacterial septic arthritis. Also, to review the recent literature on emerging management strategies and discuss the potential impact of these developments on clinical practice.

Recent Findings

Evidence-based guidelines have recently been published to assist in the diagnosis and management of suspected and confirmed septic arthritis. All suspected septic joints should be aspirated and the synovial fluid examined by microscopy for the presence of crystals and microorganisms. There is controversy surrounding the diagnostic utility of quantifying the synovial fluid white cell count, with two recent systematic reviews reaching opposite conclusions. The emergence of multidrug resistant pathogens has led to a search for alternative antimicrobial agents such as linezolid. Studies in animals and children have suggested that corticosteroid therapy may be a useful adjunct to conventional antibiotic therapy. Research using experimental murine models of septic arthritis is also generating novel immunotherapeutic targets as potential adjuncts to antibiotic regimens.

Summary

There is a striking paucity of high-quality evidence upon which to base guidelines on the management of the hot-swollen joint. Ultimately, the diagnosis of septic arthritis rests on the opinion of a clinician experienced in the assessment of musculoskeletal disease. Future research may provide alternative investigative and treatment strategies to improve the accuracy of diagnosis as well as the outcome in this group of patients.

Scope and population — overlap with osteomyelitis and neonatal exclusions are specified: The clinical presentations of osteomyelitis and acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) can overlap substantially in children and these entities may occur concurrently. Neonates are excluded due to important differences in bacterial pathogens, complications of infection, immunologic immaturity, as well as lack of adequate antimicrobial pharmacokinetic data for neonates of various gestational and postnatal ages. For uncommon pathogens, adequate, controlled data are not available to support recommendations, and treatment recommendations for these uncommon pathogens may be found in other organism-specific or disease-specific texts and publications.

### Oral antibiotic therapy for septic arthritis in children… [^116RG4Bv]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

High-dose oral antibiotic therapy has demonstrated adequate bactericidal activity in bone and joint tissue in children, allowing the option of oral antibiotic therapy in the convalescent phase of treatment for bacterial arthritis. Newton and associates compared the effectiveness of convalescent high-dose oral antibiotic therapy with intravenous therapy for septic arthritis in patients 16 years of age or younger. The 83 children at one hospital were given high-dose oral antibiotic therapy after approximately one week of intravenous therapy. The 103 children at the other hospital were switched to high-dose oral antibiotic therapy after two weeks of parenteral antibiotic therapy. Cefazolin was the most commonly used intravenous antibiotic. Oral therapy for staphylococcal infection consisted of cephalexin or cloxacillin, in a dosage of 100 to 150 mg per kg per day, or dicloxacillin, in a dosage of 75 to 100 mg per kg per day, divided into four daily doses.

For streptococcal or pneumococcal infections, oral penicillin V or amoxicillin, in a dosage of 75 to 100 mg per kg per day, was used. Serum bactericidal levels were determined in children with staphylococcal infection after the second or third oral dose. If the titer was less than 1: 8, the oral dosage was increased to a maximum of 150 mg per kg per day, and testing was repeated to ensure that the titer was 1: 4 to 1:

8. No patient required reinstitution of intravenous therapy. Total duration of therapy was 30. 1 days at one site and 28 days at the other. The complication rate was minimal. The authors conclude that oral high-dose antibiotic therapy is effective in children with septic arthritis who have responded well to an initial course of intravenous antibiotic therapy. Compliance with the administration of oral medication must be certain.

In addition, an adequate serum bactericidal titer must be confirmed shortly after initiation of oral therapy for staphylococcal infection because of varying sensitivities of this organism.

PIDS and IDSA pediatric acute bacterial arthritis — empiric antimicrobial therapy recommendations emphasize Staphylococcus aureus coverage, stating that in children with suspected acute bacterial arthritis (ABA), we recommend using empiric antimicrobial therapy active against S. aureus and that antimicrobials with activity against community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) should be considered based on local susceptibility data and severity of disease; adding empiric antimicrobial coverage for pathogens in addition to coverage for S. aureus may be warranted when other pathogens are suspected based on relevant aspects of immunization, exposure history, clinical presentation, or physical examination. In infants and preschool aged children (6 to 48 months of age) with suspected ABA, we suggest selecting empiric therapy to include activity against K. kingae rather than only targeting S. aureus, and with K. kingae reported as the most frequent pathogen in this age group in recent studies, additional therapy is suggested if empiric therapy used for S. aureus is not active against K. kingae.

Pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) with clinical sepsis — timing of antimicrobials and outcomes: For the ill-appearing child with clinical sepsis and rapidly progressive disease, early antibiotic therapy is associated with improved outcomes. In pediatric sepsis cohorts, antimicrobials given > 3 hours after presentation were associated with a 4.92-fold increased risk of mortality (95% CI: 1.30 to 18.6) in a retrospective, multicenter study of 130 children with sepsis (21%) or septic shock (79%), and completion of a sepsis bundle including empiric antimicrobials within 1 hour was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (Odds ratio [OR]: 0.59, 95% CI: .38 to .93, p-value = 0.02) among 1,179 children at 54 hospitals. Adult data align, as appropriate therapy within one hour from documentation of hypotension yielded a survival rate of 80%, with each hour of delay during the first 6 hours associated with a 7.6% decrease in survival, and a large retrospective review of 18 000 adults from 165 ICUs found increased mortality with each additional hour to first antimicrobials during the first 6 hours. These data indirectly support the recommendation for early administration of antimicrobials to children with sepsis and suspected ABA when invasive joint sampling is not immediately available at presentation.

Children with uncomplicated osteomyelitis and/or septic arthritis were more likely (P < .01) to have positive focus than blood cultures. Those who grew a pathogen and/or started on a single antibiotic were more likely to be discharged on a single antibiotic, and those sent home on oral therapy had fewer adverse events.

### Primary septic arthritis in children demonstrates presumed and confirmed varieties which require age-specific evaluation and treatment strategies [^1139j63i]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There is uncertainty involved in the evaluation and treatment of children suspected to have septic arthritis particularly when no causative pathogen is confirmed. This study evaluates children with primary septic arthritis to refine the processes of evaluation and treatment and improve the rate of pathogen confirmation.

Methods

Children suspected to have septic arthritis from 2009 to 2019 were retrospectively studied. Diagnosis of primary septic arthritis, defined as hematogenous joint infection without associated osteomyelitis, was established by clinical evaluation, radiology and laboratory results, including joint fluid analysis. Excluded cases were categorized by etiology. Children with primary septic arthritis were divided into confirmed and presumed cohorts for statistical comparison.

Results

A total of 355 children (average age 4.4y, range 0.05 to 18y) were initially treated as septic arthritis. Eighty-seven (24.5%) were excluded due to other conditions, including 34 (9.6%) with noninfectious conditions. Among 268 children with primary septic arthritis, 134 were confirmed and 134 were presumed. A higher rate of 16S polymerase chain reaction (PCR) acquisition (71.6% vs. 45.5%) occurred in the confirmed cohort. Overall yield for various methods of pathogen identification were 27 of 239 (11.3%) by blood culture, 83 of 268 (31.0%) by joint fluid culture and 85 of 157 (54.1%) by PCR. PCR identified a pathogen in 87.5% of children with confirmed septic arthritis. Antibiotic pretreatment was associated with a lower rate of joint fluid culture positivity. Pathogens aggregated within specific age groups. The 4 to 9-year-old age group displayed the widest spectrum of pathogens with limited predictability.

Conclusions

This study emphasizes the need for systematic processes of evaluation and treatment for children suspected to have primary septic arthritis, including minimization of antibiotic pretreatment, age-based empiric antibiotic selection, and sufficient follow-up to ensure noninfectious conditions are distinguished in culture-negative cases. Extended observation, before intervention, may be appropriate for some children.

Level Of Evidence

Level III-retrospective control study.

Antibiotic duration for culture-proven acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) — the available data indicate that the outcome of previously healthy children older than 3 months of age with culture proven ABA due to common pathogens treated for a total duration of 10 days is not different to those treated for 30 days, if clinical and C-reactive protein (CRP) improvement is documented, and this is typically accomplished by 2 to 4 days of initial parenteral antibiotic therapy followed by transition to oral therapy; the Guideline Panel consensus is that total duration of therapy may be based on the observed response from clinical and laboratory data, with treatment durations as short as 10 days.
