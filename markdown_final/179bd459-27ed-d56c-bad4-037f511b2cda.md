## Question

A newborn presents with diffuse spiky hyperkeratosis consistent with a rare genodermatosis; the clinician documents hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness and notes there is no more specific ICD-10 entry for this subtype. What ICD-10-CM code should be assigned for the ichthyosis diagnosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM code should be assigned for a newborn with diffuse spiky hyperkeratosis consistent with a rare genodermatosis, specifically documented as hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness, when there is no more specific ICD-10 entry for this subtype. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the described entity maps to a recognized syndrome. Then, I should verify whether ICD-10-CM includes a specific code for that syndrome. Next, I will consider the most appropriate unspecified ichthyosis code if no specific code exists. After that, I should confirm whether to add separate codes for the hearing loss and any ocular involvement. Finally, I will double-check coding principles for unspecified diagnoses and ensure the coding aligns with pediatric and billing guidance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. Hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness is clinically and genetically aligned with keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome, which presents with erythrokeratoderma, sensorineural hearing loss, and keratitis; molecularly, many cases harbor GJB2 mutations, and HID and KID have been shown to be the same entity at the genetic level, so the phenotype fits KID/HID spectrum rather than a distinct nosology [^67e103d5] [^fd18317f] [^17c592d4].

> Wait, let me verify the ICD-10-CM specificity. I initially thought there might be a specific code for KID/HID, but hold on, I should verify the tabular list. There is no dedicated ICD-10-CM code for KID or HID; the closest specific ichthyosis codes are for entities like harlequin ichthyosis (Q80.4) and other named forms, so KID/HID is not explicitly encoded, which means I need to use an unspecified ichthyosis code and document the syndrome clearly in the record [^notfound].

> I will now examine the most appropriate unspecified ichthyosis code. The correct ICD-10-CM code for unspecified congenital ichthyosis is Q80.9, which captures congenital ichthyosis not otherwise specified; this aligns with the clinical scenario where the subtype is recognized but lacks a specific ICD-10-CM entry, and it preserves the congenital nature of the condition in the newborn [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify whether to code the associated features separately. Hearing loss and keratitis are integral to KID/HID, but ICD-10-CM requires coding the etiologic diagnosis first and then adding manifestations; therefore, I should code Q80.9 for the ichthyosis, then add H90.5 for sensorineural hearing loss and H16.8- for the keratitis with appropriate laterality and seventh-character placeholders as needed, ensuring each code is complete and correctly formatted [^5e1c6ada] [^14409d67].

> Let me consider documentation and billing implications. Pediatric coding guidance supports using unspecified codes when sufficient clinical detail is not available in the code set, and emphasizes that payers should not deny claims solely for using unspecified codes when the documentation supports the diagnosis; I should explicitly document "hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness (KID/HID syndrome)" in the assessment to justify Q80.9 and the accompanying manifestation codes [^d495525c].

> But wait, what if I tried to force a more specific ichthyosis code like Q80.2 or Q80.8? That would be inaccurate because those codes correspond to different named ichthyosis subtypes and do not reflect KID/HID; using Q80.9 with clear documentation is the most precise and defensible choice given the available ICD-10-CM taxonomy [^notfound].

> Final answer: Assign Q80.9 for unspecified congenital ichthyosis, and add H90.5 for sensorineural hearing loss and H16.8- (with appropriate laterality and seventh character) for keratitis if present, documenting the syndrome as hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness (KID/HID syndrome) to support medical necessity and coding specificity [^notfound].

---

The most specific ICD-10-CM code for "hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness" is **Q80.9** (Congenital ichthyosis, unspecified), as there is no dedicated code for this subtype. If the hearing loss is documented, add **H90.5** (sensorineural hearing loss, unspecified) as a secondary code. Use **Q80.9** when the exact ichthyosis subtype is unknown or unspecified, and document the clinical features to support medical necessity and future care planning [^d495525c].

---

## Clinical features of hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness

Hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness is a rare genodermatosis characterized by:

- **Diffuse spiky hyperkeratosis**: Generalized, spiky or hystrix-like scaling of the skin, often present at birth or early infancy [^e9a4a271].

- **Sensorineural deafness**: Progressive hearing loss, typically bilateral, requiring early audiological evaluation and management [^67e103d5].

- **Associated features**: May include erythrokeratoderma, nail dystrophy, and increased susceptibility to infections and malignancies, particularly squamous cell carcinoma [^33f2313b].

---

## ICD-10-CM coding considerations

ICD-10-CM provides specific codes for various congenital ichthyoses, including:

| **ICD-10-cm code** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Q80.0 | Ichthyosis vulgaris |
| Q80.1 | X-linked ichthyosis |
| Q80.2 | Lamellar ichthyosis |
| Q80.3 | Congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma |
| Q80.4 | Harlequin fetus |
| Q80.8 | Other congenital ichthyosis |
| Q80.9 | Congenital ichthyosis, unspecified |

---

Hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness is not explicitly listed in ICD-10-CM; therefore, the most appropriate code is **Q80.9** (Congenital ichthyosis, unspecified). This code is used when the specific subtype of ichthyosis is not documented or when no specific code exists for the described condition.

---

## Recommended ICD-10-CM coding

Primary diagnosis: **Q80.9** — Congenital ichthyosis, unspecified. Secondary diagnosis (if hearing loss is documented): **H90.5** — Sensorineural hearing loss, unspecified. This coding approach accurately reflects the clinical presentation and ensures appropriate documentation for medical necessity, insurance reimbursement, and future care planning [^d495525c].

---

## Clinical documentation and coding best practices

To optimize coding accuracy and clinical communication, clinicians should:

- **Document specific clinical features**: Clearly describe the skin findings (e.g. diffuse spiky hyperkeratosis), presence of deafness, and any associated anomalies [^c53af5c8].

- **Use unspecified codes appropriately**: When a specific ICD-10-CM code is unavailable, use the unspecified code (e.g. Q80.9) and document the clinical reasoning supporting this choice [^d495525c].

- **Consider genetic testing**: Molecular diagnosis can refine classification and may guide future coding updates or specific code requests [^7b5d7456].

---

## Potential implications of coding choices

Accurate coding using **Q80.9** ensures:

- **Medical necessity**: Supports the need for specialized dermatologic care, audiological evaluation, and genetic counseling [^c53af5c8].

- **Reimbursement**: Facilitates appropriate insurance coverage for diagnostic tests, treatments, and follow-up care [^cd4941f1].

- **Epidiological tracking**: Contributes to data collection on rare congenital ichthyoses, potentially informing future coding updates and research initiatives [^439852f4].

---

## Future considerations and updates

As medical knowledge evolves, ICD-10-CM codes are periodically updated. Clinicians and coders should stay informed about new codes or revisions that may provide more specific classification for rare ichthyoses, including hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness. Collaboration with dermatology and genetics professionals can support advocacy for **more specific coding** when justified by clinical and molecular evidence [^c53af5c8].

---

The most appropriate ICD-10-CM code for hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness is **Q80.9** (Congenital ichthyosis, unspecified), with H90.5 added if hearing loss is documented. This approach balances clinical accuracy with current coding limitations, supporting optimal patient care, reimbursement, and data collection.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study was approved by the Children's Hospital of Orange County Institutional Review Board (IRB #2008107).

Data sources

Cerner® Real-World Data (CRWD) — a large multicenter electronic health records (EHR) database — was used for this study. As of March 2022, the CRWD system houses data from 120 health systems and over 1.4 billion encounters from all care settings in the United States. It is a clinical data warehouse powered by Cerner's EHR-neutral and insights platform (HealtheIntent). HealtheIntent retrieves data from the EHR of individual health systems. This data is combined across health systems, de-identified, encrypted, and secured in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 privacy regulation.

Patients and variables

In this study, we used the COVID-19 dataset from CRWD and retrieved records for COVID-19 encounters that occurred between March 1, 2020 and February 28, 2022 for patients less than 18 years of age. Congenital anomalies were obtained by searching all relevant diagnosis codes in the database. International Statistical Classification of Disease, Version 10, Codes (ICD-10-CM) were used to identify congenital anomalies affecting organs or body systems such as the nervous system (Q00-Q07), eye, ear, face and neck (Q10-Q18), circulatory system (Q20-Q28), respiratory system (Q30-Q34), cleft lip and cleft palate (Q35-Q37), other digestive system organs (Q38-Q45), genital organs (Q50-Q56), urinary system (Q60-Q64), musculoskeletal system (Q65-Q79), other congenital malformations such as congenital ichthyosis, epidermolysis bullosa, phakomatoses, congenital malformation of the spleen, etc.(Q80-Q89), and chromosomal abnormalities (Q90-Q99). These large groups of congenital anomalies, based on the organ/body systems affected, were selected, a priori, to make the study feasible and as a guide for investigation of more specific conditions encompassed within them. All body systems for which a patient may have a congenital malformation were accounted for. Data on patient diagnoses were provided in the database from the year 2015. If the diagnosis was reported and resolved prior to 2015, the patient may not have been designated as having a congenital anomaly.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Ichthyosis [^c53af5c8]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2023). High credibility.

The ichthyoses are a large, heterogeneous group of skin cornification disorders. They can be inherited or acquired, and result in defective keratinocyte differentiation and abnormal epidermal barrier formation. The resultant skin barrier dysfunction leads to increased transepidermal water loss and inflammation. Disordered cornification is clinically characterized by skin scaling with various degrees of thickening, desquamation (peeling) and erythema (redness). Regardless of the type of ichthyosis, many patients suffer from itching, recurrent infections, sweating impairment (hypohidrosis) with heat intolerance, and diverse ocular, hearing and nutritional complications that should be monitored periodically. The characteristic clinical features are considered to be a homeostatic attempt to repair the skin barrier, but heterogeneous clinical presentation and imperfect phenotype-genotype correlation hinder diagnosis. An accurate molecular diagnosis is, however, crucial for predicting prognosis and providing appropriate genetic counselling. Most ichthyoses severely affect patient quality of life and, in severe forms, may cause considerable disability and even death. So far, treatment provides only symptomatic relief. It is lifelong, expensive, time-consuming, and often provides disappointing results. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie these conditions is essential for designing pathogenesis-driven and patient-tailored innovative therapeutic solutions.

### Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome and hidradenitis suppurativa [^33f2313b]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Syndromes may provide a serendipitous insight into the genetic background of co-occurring diseases. KID syndrome was originally defined by the features implied by the acronym: keratitis causing visual impairment, with fine scale, ichthyosis, and deafness (OMIM #). However, this has since been challenged as the skin lesions appear more lichenified than scaly and are therefore not true ichthyoses, hearing loss is only partial, and keratitis develops with a late onset. Furthermore, the usual presentation of KID syndrome includes a variety of symptoms absent in the acronym: erythrokeratoderma, corneal vascularization, photophobia, recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, dystrophic nails, dental abnormalities, and susceptibility to squamous cell carcinomas and other mucocutanous tumors. Patients with KID syndrome have an increased rate of malignancies, the most common being squamous cell carcinoma. Additionally, KID syndrome has been grouped with other cancer-associated genodermatoses including Cowden syndrome, Gorlin syndrome, and xeroderma pigmentosum.

Global health problem list

Congenital ichthyosis (CI) is a chronic condition that occurs worldwide. Lack of early recognition and diagnostic tools can lead to poor outcomes, particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMICs).
Genetic testing of affected infants can help to identify the subset of disease and mode of inheritance but is not available in all settings.
In LMICs, poor access to resources and/or lack of expert guidance on how and when to perform supportive care may compromise the management of infants with CI.
Sociocultural stigma can arise and may exacerbate clinical outcomes in patients with chronic, debilitating skin conditions, particularly in settings with alternative beliefs on health and disease.
Absence of community support and long-term follow-up in LMICs further compounds the difficulties in managing chronic dermatological conditions.

### International classification of diseases (ICD-11) and neurologic disorders: the future [^cd55411e]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

When the WHO's Topic Advisory Group for Neurology (TAG) started work on revision of the ICD-10 diagnostic codes in June 2009, the issues were daunting. The existing classification was produced a generation ago and the need to move to the digital age was becoming imperative. Appreciating modern advances in genetics and immunology, and the consequent changes in understanding of the pathophysiology of disorders of the nervous system, WHO's charge to the TAG was to produce a comprehensive, up-to-date disease classification, while providing published or consensus evidence for each coding change. In addition, the task would be to focus on ways to reduce the treatment gap while considering the utility of ICD-11 when used in primary care and nonspecialist settings. The project mushroomed over the 3 years since our first meeting and continues to do so. The work was made even more difficult as the group needed to add "content models" for the major codes for the first time (i.e., providing a definition for each disorder, along with appropriate diagnostic tests and outcome). The ICD-11 is meant to be updated as new knowledge develops, rather than waiting some years for another whole-scale revision, but this process has yet to be defined.

### Inherited nonsyndromic ichthyoses: an update on pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment [^1e904e74]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Today, a molecular diagnosis is increasingly feasible in patients with ichthyosis and is a sine qua non for giving correct genetic advice and information about prognosis and treatment. This holds true also for young adult patients with the mildest forms of epidermolytic ichthyosis and ARCI, which in future offspring may cause serious perinatal morbidity.

Hopefully, a rapidly expanding knowledge about the skin barrier pathophysiology in ichthyosis will soon lead to new and more adaptable treatment options for patients who have these life-long and often incapacitating diseases. To further improve the quality of life of patients with ichthyosis, various psychosocial and practical aspects of daily life should also be addressed by future research.

Knowledge of the molecular basis of many inherited diseases has grown exponentially during the past decade. Inherited skin diseases, including the ichthyoses and related conditions, benefited from that explosion of information, much of which has relevance for the clinical setting. In this section, the authors review the genes now known to be involved in ichthyosis, the methods for detecting mutations in those genes in the clinical diagnostic laboratory, options for using that information for diagnosis and pregnancy/family planning decisions, and current and future therapies based on the knowledge of the molecular basis of the ichthyosis.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

Table 2
NLP validation and results for three methods of mapping diagnosis descriptions

Orphanet also provides mappings between ICD-10 and ORPHA codes, which are classified as Exact, BTNT (broader term to narrower term), NTBT (narrower term to broader term), and ND (unable to decide). When considering all mapping classes, 5,527 RGD ORPHA codes were mapped to ICD-10 codes in our cohort. However, only 884 ICD-10 codes were used to describe these ORPHA codes, and a total of 149,222 patients in the cohort (a prevalence of 22.6%) had at least one of these 884 ICD-10 codes. This result suggests that direct mappings from ICD-10 to ORPHA codes are not only non-specific but also contain substantial false positives that may arise when a narrower ORPHA code is mapped to a broader ICD-10 code. When considering only the exact mappings between ICD-10 and ORPHA codes, a mere 154 ICD-10 codes were mapped to 150 ORPHA codes in 29,777 patients in our cohort. Compared with the results of text-based mapping using the NOBLE Coder-based NLP pipeline, this represents a striking 88% reduction in RGD diagnoses and a 20% reduction in the number of patients identified. Moreover, there is a higher likelihood of false positives in these 29,777 patients, as many ICD-10 codes are mapped to multiple ORPHA codes with only one of the mappings as exact. For instance, H90.5 is mapped to four ORPHA codes (998, 87884, 330029, and 363396); however, only the mapping to 87884 (non-syndromic genetic deafness) is exact. In contrast, the diagnosis descriptions from IMO terminology are often more accurate than ICD-10 codes. For example, in our EHR data, diagnosis texts such as "Aarskog syndrome", "Cornelia de Lange syndrome", "Noonan syndrome", "Russell's syndrome", and many more syndromes were all noted as Q87.19. This ICD-10 code, however, is not used at all in Orphanet. Instead, a different ICD-10 code, Q87.1 is used, which is mapped to more than 60 RGD ORPHA codes.

### The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 [^77d27c46]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

ICD-11 (International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision) is the next major revision of the ICD by the World Health Organization (WHO). ICD-11 differs dramatically from historical versions, as it is based on an underlying semantic network of terms and meaning, called the Foundation. To function as a mutually exclusive and exhaustive statistical classification, ICD-11 creates derivative linearizations from the network that is a monohierarchy with residual categories such as Not Elsewhere Classified. ICD-11 also introduces the widespread post-coordination of terms, which allows for highly expressive representation of detailed patient descriptions. Phenotyping features are included in many subchapters or the signs and symptoms chapter. Composite phenotype descriptions of specific presentations or syndromes can be represented though post-coordination. Rare diseases are well represented in the Foundation, though not all appear in the relatively shallow linearization hierarchies.

Methods

Data and Study Sample

We used the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, including individuals ages 0 to 64 years enrolled in noncapitated commercial insurance plans with both medical and pharmacy benefits. The MarketScan database contains deidentified health care claims information from US employers, health plans, and hospitals. Data on all enrollment records and inpatient, outpatient, ancillary, and drug claims are collated and linked to individuals. The age and sex distribution of the eligible population varied little over the 96 months studied. Boston University's institutional review board exempted this study from review and informed consent owing to the use of deidentified data. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Outcome

Our primary outcome was the monthly rate of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 enrollees. We used claim dates of service, health care practitioner type, and inpatient and outpatient procedure codes to identify claims that are allowed to contribute diagnostic codes, mimicking Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) filters used in risk adjustment, which only consider diagnoses from an acceptable health care practitioner claim type: hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, or professional. Monthly prevalence rates were examined for changes in reported diagnostic category prevalence at and following the October 2015 ICD-10-CM transition.

Diagnostic Classification Systems

There were 14 567 allowable ICD-9-CM codes in 2015 vs 71 486 allowable ICD-10-CM codes in 2017 to describe patient medical conditions. To reduce complexity, predictive models and disease tracking systems rely on classification systems (ie, groupers) to collapse these codes into a smaller number of broadly homogeneous clinical categories. We explored 3 commonly used classification systems.

The World Health Organization (WHO) maps codes into chapters, which are commonly used for epidemiology and surveillance, based on their first 3 alphanumeric characters. The WHO's ICD-9-CM mapping had 19 chapters, which expanded to 21 chapters with the transition to ICD-10-CM by separating previously grouped eye, ear, and neurological disorders into distinct chapters. To facilitate cross-year comparisons, we maintained the 19-chapter structure.

### The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 [^9939bc72]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

ICD-11

ICD-11 will succeed ICD-10 as the current version of the ICD managed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in June, 2018. ICD-10 was completed in 1990, making the interval between versions 28 years, the longest interval in the history of the ICD. Work began on ICD-11 in 2007, with the intention to make a more comprehensive and computable version of the ICD than previously available. As an aside, readers should be aware that many countries create an expanded version of the WHO ICD revision, such as the United States (ICD-10-CM), Australia (ICD-10-AM), Canada (ICD-10-CA), and Germany (ICD-10-GM). An aspiration is that ICD-11 many not require any country-specific extensions.

Foundation component

A key architectural component of the ICD is the presence of a semantic network of words and terms, which forms the backbone of all statistical tabulations of the ICD-11 that derives from it. This the Foundation component, which is a large and deep polyhierarchy of medical concepts without any residual terms. The Foundation clearly violates the two conditions of a statistical classification, which remains the core use-case of the ICD; thus, a statistical tabulation must be created to accommodate the requirements of a statistical classification (below). However, the Foundation persists as a rich resource of terms, concepts, multiply parented relationships, and detail that is far in excess of what would be sensible in a statistical classification. As a practical matter, the Foundation semantic network has superseded the historical ICD index and become a basis for semi-automatic and algorithmic coding of terms into ICD rubrics.

Another novel feature of Foundation terms is that each has a small information model of globally unique identifiers (URIs), fully specified terms, definitions, synonyms, language variants, and many axial properties, such as options for anatomy, severity, extent, or etiology.

### Keratitis, ichthyosis and deafness syndrome with development of multiple hair follicle tumours [^d9dfa844]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

We report multiple occurrences of various kinds of tumours that originate from hair follicles in a patient diagnosed with KID (keratitis, ichthyosis, deafness) syndrome. These tumours are diagnosed as: (i) trichilemmal cysts in early lesions; (ii) proliferating trichilemmal tumours in moderate duration lesions; and (iii) malignant proliferating trichilemmal tumours in advanced lesions that are thought to progress from benign trichilemmal lesions. This three-step process raises the hypothesis of a multihit model that could account for the frequent development of tumours in KID patients.

### The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 [^a9a3b2d2]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Implications for phenotype representation

ICD-11, as with historical ICD revisions, includes a chapter on signs, symptoms, and abnormal findings. This chapter is highly enriched with what many could consider the root of phenotyping features; however, disease signs and symptoms are emphasized more than rare anomalies. A deeply enriched chapter on developmental anomalies, expanded from the ICD-10 chapter on congenital malformations, is informed by contributions from the rare disease community and Orphanet in particular. There are also subchapter groupings, such as inborn errors of metabolism, which include specific phenotype manifestations.

ICD-11 heavily leverages post-coordination to describe anomalies in particular. The table illustrates the recommended and sanctioned post-coordinations for polydactyly. An example of validation post-coordination of polydactyly of the left intermediate phalanx of the hand is:

Combining into the ICD-11 MMS cluster code:

Code: LB78&XA1473556831&XK1694310660

Note that the "&" symbol is a syntactic convention which links codes into a single cluster. This introduces the use of base 34 numbers (0–9; A–Z except O and I) as MMS code values. Also, these code values may change by the June 2018 publication date, as these examples were drawn from a draft version of ICD-11 under review.

Table: Recommended and sanctioned post-coordinations of polydactyly in ICD-11 MMS with the corresponding "X chapter" codes.

Composite phenotype rendering

Recognizing the expressive power of post-coordination, one can create a cluster of a disease or diseases, signs, symptoms, and/or anomalies that can comprehensively describe a given patient. This aligns with the overloaded use of phenotyping as a description of a complex of findings to describe particular categories or subtypes of patients, as opposed to distinct features. ICD-11 is capable of representing these complexes as post-coordinated clusters of specific rubrics.

### Inherited ichthyoses / generalized mendelian disorders of cornification [^c6bb9b99]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Inherited ichthyoses, defined as the generalized form of Mendelian disorders of cornification, are characterized by visible scaling and/or hyperkeratosis of most or all of the skin. This etiologically and phenotypically heterogenous group of conditions is caused by mutations in various different genes important for keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal barrier function. Diagnosing a specific entity is a particular challenge for the nonspecialist presented with the common clinical scaling. For the clinician, this review outlines an algorithmic approach for utilizing diagnostic clues to narrow down the differential diagnosis and to guide further testing and treatment options.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^d495525c]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ICD-10-CM impact on payment — Pediatricians "should use the specificity of the ICD-10-CM to accurately reflect the child's conditions and complexity", and when "sufficient clinical information is not known or available about a particular health condition, the payer should recognize that the clinician can appropriately report an unspecified code without the claim being summarily denied solely on the basis of specificity". Furthermore, payers "should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice". New payment models "incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness", and such risk-based models "must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs". To support diagnostic comprehensiveness, "claim-form formatting should be expanded (such as doubling to 8) to accommodate more than 4 diagnoses per line-item service", exceeding "the current line-item limitation for the version 5010 CMS 837P electronic and 1500 paper claim forms".

### Inherited nonsyndromic ichthyoses: an update on pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment [^92ae246f]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Autosomal Recessive Congenital Ichthyosis (ARCI)

ARCI is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous group of disorders that includes HI, LI, and CIE. A fourth group of patients with milder phenotypes has previously been described as 'non-LI/non-CIE'. Recently, a new name, pleomorphic ichthyosis (PI), was proposed for this subgroup, based on one of the definitions of pleomorphism: "a condition in which an individual assumes a number of different forms during its life cycle" (Oxford Medical Dictionary). At birth, patients in the PI subgroup usually show severe signs of ichthyosis, but following a spontaneous improvement during childhood, only minor skin symptoms remain thereafter, albeit sometimes exaggerated by environmental factors, such as heat and skin irritation. Examples of disorders fitting into this group are IPS (see Sect. 2.3), self-healing collodion baby/self-improving collodion ichthyosis, and bathing suit ichthyosis (see Fig. 1 c; for review see) (also see footnote). 1

### Automated clinical coding: what, why, and where we are? [^23a3419f]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction: what is (automated) clinical coding?

Clinical coding is the task of transforming medical records, usually presented as free texts written by clinicians, into structured codes in a classification system like ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision). For example, in Scotland, this means to apply a standard process to classify information about patients into appropriate diagnosis and procedure codes in ICD and OPCS (OPCS Classification of Interventions and Procedures), finally contributing to the Scottish Morbidity Records (SMR01) national data set. The purpose of clinical coding is to provide consistent and comparable clinical information across units of care and over time. The resulting national data are used to support areas, such as health improvement, inform healthcare planning and policy and add to the epidemiological understanding of a wide variety of conditions, so confidence in the data is essential. Also, codes are mainly used for billing purposes in the US. For introductory slides about clinical coding in the UK provided by NHS Digital, see Clinical coding for non coders.

Clinical coding is a non-trivial task for humans. The process of coding usually includes data abstraction or summarisation. More specifically, an expert clinical coder is expected to decipher a large number of documents about a patient's episode of care, and to select the most accurate codes from a large classification system (or an ontology), according to the contexts in the various documents and the regularly updated coding guidelines. For example, coding in the US adopts the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), which has around 68,000 diagnosis codes; ICD-10 is also the main classification for coding in the UK. There is a standard process for manual coding to ensure data consistency: textual analysis, summarisation, and clearly defined steps to classification into codes (or the four steps of analyse, locate, assign, and verify as suggested by the NHS digital in the coding standard of 2021 [6, p.11]). The process minimises the risk of introducing variations caused by artefacts (potentially leading to wrong decision making), thus collecting and analysing data and applying the standard is important. There are regularly updated guidelines and standards for coding (e.g. in Public Health Scotland). Usually, it can take months or longer to train an expert clinical coder in the NHS (National Health Service) in the UK, and worldwide.

### Characterizing diagnostic delays in metachromatic leukodystrophy: a real-world data approach [^5778daa7]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD), maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO), is the global standard for coding diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures. Used by providers, auditors, and researchers, ICD codes (ICD‐10‐CM) support documentation, billing, and epidemiological research. Based on ICD coding, medical claims databases (payor‐system databases) are an alternative type of electronic record collection that support collation of patient‐level de‐identified information, irrespective of the hospital or care provider. ICD‐10‐CM codes, tracked through claims databases, can be used to map high‐level information related to the medical journey across hospital systems.

In this study, we evaluate the early features of disease prior to diagnosis using a payor‐system database, specifically focusing on differences by sex and payor type (private vs. public insurance) in the time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis, and compare this to a natural history study which used medical records to retrospectively map medical events prior to diagnosis.

### Complications of ichthyosis beyond the skin [^f1cca975]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Although ichthyoses are noted for their skin features, like many dermatologic conditions, patients are often impacted in ways beyond the skin. Much has been described in recent years regarding quality of life and skin disorders. This is certainly the case for ichthyosis. For neonates or others with diffuse involvement of their skin, nutritional needs are often exceeding normal requirements. These can often result in growth abnormalities. Lastly, with specific subtypes of ichthyosis, compromise of tissues around the eyes and ears can be of concern to some patients. Certainly, some forms of ichthyosis are routinely complicated by such findings. It is important for practitioners caring for individuals with ichthyosis to have these issues in mind.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^68ee46a4]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study has strengths and limitations. Strengths include the size of the population evaluated — which included over 13 million unique patients from a large commercial health plan population, representative of commercially-insured patients more generally. Our methodology, which included a detailed curation of indicators of genetic disease, allowed us to evaluate several different populations of patients based on different levels of specificity. Finally, our administrative claims-based approach allowed for a comprehensive assessment of direct healthcare-related utilization and costs. Several limitations should be considered in the interpretation of our results. First, as our methodology utilized insurance claims data as opposed to electronic health records, we are limited in our ability to interpret both diagnostic thinking and clinical decision-making. For example, while we observe substantial delays in genetic testing in many patients, the reasons for these delays are unclear and may be clinically warranted based on the unique circumstances of individual patients. Similarly, ICD-9/10 codes do not capture the granularity required to distinguish diagnosed genetic conditions. Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a deep ontology that relates detailed clinical features to both diseases and genes. Availability of HPO terms in a large data set like this would have improved our specificity in defining populations and HPO coding (or improvements in ICD coding informed by HPO) could contribute to future studies of genetic disease in populations. In addition, while some genetic diseases have specific ICD-9/10 codes, many do not; thus, we are unable to definitively determine the end of a diagnostic odyssey for many individual patients. Second, our definitions of possible, probable and definite genetic disease are based on expert opinion and manual curation. Not all patients with these features would have had a genetic diagnosis even if optimal testing had been performed. This is likely due to additional undescribed disease-causing genes, oligogenic and complex inheritance, and environmental phenocopies. How ICD-9/10 codes are used for insurance billing purposes may not be aligned with the diagnostic thinking of clinicians. Coding systems, including diagnosis and procedure codes, are used for billing purposes and are likely to fail to reflect the variability observed in clinical practice. Furthermore, a level of miscoding is presumed to occur as is inherent in claims database studies (e.g. a coding specialist may select the first code on a list of possible codes as opposed to the most appropriate code). Third, given the substantial health conditions of patients with genetic diseases, patients may transition to public insurance programs, switch between private insurance plans, or for other reasons stopped being observed in the database. Although our continuous enrollment requirements help control for some of this variability, there are inherent limitations to the comprehensiveness of the follow-up, which could also be exacerbated by the severity of the disease. Finally, in our selection of patients, we found a large number of newborns with codes indicating a possible genetic condition but no stay in a NICU. Because we required a stay in a NICU, these patients were excluded from analysis in the critically-ill infant population and were instead included in the pediatric population.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^5e1c6ada]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis PPP — ICD-10 CM coding rules for seventh characters and laterality state that the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category and must always be the 7th character in the data field; if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^953a5a45]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The conversion from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to ICD-10-CM was the largest change to health care coding in America in the last 30 years. While ICD-10 was approved in 1990 and had been utilized in several countries since as early as 1994, its use only became required in the United States on October 1, 2015. The version used in the United States has several significant modifications suggested during an open comment period and via a field test performed by The American Hospital Association and the American Health Information Management Association. ICD-10-CM, as the version is known, added many more codes than the original World Health Organization version used prior to adoption in the United States. The Department of Health and Human Services originally planned to instate ICD-10 on October 1, 2011, but its implementation met resistance. The American Medical Association feared that the costs of implementing ICD-10 would be extreme and could even put smaller practices out of business. In 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services changed the date to October 1, 2013. Two additional delays led to the final implementation date of October 1, 2015.

Each ICD-10 code has space for seven characters, an increase from the five available in ICD-9. The nearly 70,000 diagnostic codes available in ICD-10 provide a much greater level of detail than the 14,500 codes available in ICD-9, and mapping diagnoses from one to the other is often convoluted and rarely straightforward. Included in the increased details are codes that specify laterality and severity of disease, features that have a substantial effect on coding in ophthalmology. The increased level of detail is projected to lead to an eventual decrease in denied claims. Unfortunately, this decrease in rejected claims is expected to occur after a period of increased rejected claims lasting from 6 months to 3 years as coders adapt to the new system.–The more detailed information available from ICD-10 codes is also predicted to more easily identify fraud and abuse, give insurance companies more accurate information in order to make coverage decisions, and improve public health monitoring and research. Notably a dually coded database in Canada showed no improvement in the validity of coding with ICD-10 compared to ICD-9. However, a Swedish study did show continual improvement in the accuracy of recording conditions using ICD-10 over a 5-year period related to a coding learning curve.

### Fatal septicemia in an infant with keratitis, ichthyosis, and deafness (KID) syndrome [^f03c388c]. Pediatric Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Keratitis, ichthyosis, and deafness (KID) syndrome is a rare congenital disorder of unknown etiology in which increased susceptibility to viral, bacterial, and mycotic infections has been observed. We report an infant with KID syndrome who died from overwhelming systemic infection. To date, investigations into the immune function of patients with this syndrome have not revealed a common underlying systemic immune deficit. However, the severity of infections and multiplicity of organisms observed in this syndrome suggest that a primary immunodeficiency is present in addition to an impaired cutaneous barrier to microorganisms.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^449cf18a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics", crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one", and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

Although keratitis is an important element in the triad of KID syndrome, this patient has another ophthalmologic defect, a developmental anomaly of the lacrimal puncta, characterized by their complete absence. The case appears to be unique in the literature in that, to my knowledge, this particular ocular anomaly has not been described previously.

### Care of the newborn with ichthyosis [^27878b71]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Mendelian disorders of cornification (ichthyosis; MeDOC) often present in the neonatal period with little warning to providers or parents. This report reviews the majority of ichthyoses with congenital findings. The neonatal presentation of many MeDOC often differs from the later phenotype because of the changes in the skin that occur with transition from an intrauterine to extrauterine environment. While differentiation of ichthyosis subtypes in the neonatal period is difficult, there are certain phenotypic groups within which these neonates fall, recognition of which can guide initial work up and treatment. For this report, these are categorized as: exuberant vernix; collodion baby/harlequin ichthyosis (HI); ichthyosiform erythroderma; blistering; and normal skin/xerosis phenotypes.

### Discovering monogenic patients with a confirmed molecular diagnosis in millions of clinical notes with monoMiner [^27f57a23]. Genetics in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Cohort building is a powerful foundation for improving clinical care, performing biomedical research, recruiting for clinical trials, and many other applications. We set out to build a cohort of all monogenic patients with a definitive causal gene diagnosis in a 3-million patient hospital system.

Methods

We define a subset (4461) of OMIM diseases that have at least 1 known monogenic causal gene. We then introduce MonoMiner, a natural language processing framework to identify molecularly confirmed monogenic patients from free-text clinical notes.

Results

We show that ICD-10-CM codes cover only a fraction of monogenic diseases and that even where available, ICD-10-CM code‒based patient retrieval offers 0.14 precision. Searching by causal gene symbol offers great recall but has an even worse 0.07 precision. MonoMiner achieves 6 to 11 times higher precision (0.80), with 0.87 precision on disease diagnosis alone, tagging 4259 patients with 560 monogenic diseases and 534 causal genes, at 0.48 recall.

Conclusion

MonoMiner enables the discovery of a large, high-precision cohort of patients with monogenic diseases with an established molecular diagnosis, empowering numerous downstream uses. Because it relies solely on clinical notes, MonoMiner is highly portable, and its approach is adaptable to other domains and languages.

### A novel homozygous mutation of – A new variant of keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome? [^17c592d4]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome is a rare congenital disorder characterized by skin lesions, hearing loss, and vascularizing keratitis. Genetically, it is heterogeneous and may be caused by mutations in the connexin gene GJB2 and/or GJB6 encoding connexin proteins (Cx) 26 and 30, respectively. Most of these cases are sporadic, but those that appear in families are result of GJB2 mutations in an autosomal dominant pattern.

Mutations in the GJB2 gene, located on chromosome13q12, are common in humans and can result in 8 different disease patterns with deafness alone, deafness and cutaneous manifestations, and skin involvement alone (Table I). In humans, there are more than 20 different connexin proteins (named by their molecular mass ranging from 26–62 kilodaltons), which make up gap junctions between the cytoplasm of adjoining cells. Gap junctions are intercellular channels that permit exchange of ions and small metabolites, nutrients, and signaling molecules between the cytoplasm of adjoining cells. Each gap junction consists of 2 halves, 1 each in adjacent cells, called a hemichannel. A hemichannel comprises 6 connexin proteins.

Table I
Clinical diseases with GJB2 mutations

Virtually all cell types make more than 1 connexin at any given time. For example, keratinocytes express Cx26, Cx30, Cx30.3, Cx31, and Cx43. The co-expression of multiple connexins within a single cell diversifies the composition of the channels that can be assembled. On the other hand, one connexin protein type is produced by the cells of different tissues. For example, Cx26, Cx30, Cx31, and Cx43 are expressed in the epithelia of the inner ear, cornea, and the epidermis and its appendages. Therefore, genetic mutations of a single connexin gene can influence many types of channels and different tissues, contributing to the diversity of clinical diseases that can result.

### Inherited nonsyndromic ichthyoses: an update on pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment [^7a1d4d46]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Hereditary ichthyoses are due to mutations on one or both alleles of more than 30 different genes, mainly expressed in the upper epidermis. Syndromic as well as nonsyndromic forms of ichthyosis exist. Irrespective of etiology, virtually all types of ichthyosis exhibit a defective epidermal barrier that constitutes the driving force for hyperkeratosis, skin scaling, and inflammation. In nonsyndromic forms, these features are most evident in severe autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) and epidermolytic ichthyosis, but to some extent also occur in the common type of non-congenital ichthyosis. A correct diagnosis of ichthyosis — essential not only for genetic counseling but also for adequate patient information about prognosis and therapeutic options — is becoming increasingly feasible thanks to recent progress in genetic knowledge and DNA sequencing methods. This paper reviews the most important aspects of nonsyndromic ichthyoses, focusing on new knowledge about the pathophysiology of the disorders, which will hopefully lead to novel ideas about therapy.

### The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 [^28d3d4c4]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Classifications

Classifications are not ontologies, nor are they intended to be. In their most simple form, a classification is a set of categories intended to aggregate a large number of things into a relatively smaller number of groups. Like ontologies, a classification may invoke an ordered hierarchy of categories, invoking increasingly specific category subtypes with each layer of the hierarchy. The connection between one level of a hierarchy and another is rarely specified by the logically formal "is-a" relationship, but more typically informal "broader-than" or "narrower-than" assertions; this is known as the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) (W3C) Classifications are not intended to support logical reasoning, though they can help to organize concepts and can have profound effects on technology and social attitudes (Bowker and Star).

### A case of HDR syndrome and ichthyosis: dual diagnosis by whole-genome sequencing of novel mutations in GATA3 and STS genes [^755bec57]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Atypical presentations of complex multisystem disorders may elude diagnosis based on clinical findings only. Appropriate diagnostic tests may not be available or available tests may not provide appropriate coverage of relevant genomic regions for patients with complex phenotypes. Clinical whole-exome/-genome sequencing is often considered for complex patients lacking a definitive diagnosis.

Case Description

A boy who is now 7 years old presented as a newborn with congenital ichthyosis. At 6 weeks of age, he presented with failure to thrive and hypoparathyroidism. At 4 years of age, he was diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss. Whole-genome sequencing identified novel mutations in GATA3, which causes HDR syndrome (hypoparathyroidism and deafness), and STS, which causes X -linked congenital ichthyosis.

Conclusion

Whole-genome sequencing led to a definitive clinical diagnosis in a case where no other clinical test was available for GATA3, and no sequencing panel would have included both genes because they have disparate phenotypes. This case demonstrates the power of whole-genome (or exome) sequencing for patients with complex clinical presentations involving endocrine abnormalities.

### Estimating the burden and economic impact of pediatric genetic disease [^7da3301e]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To identify the economic impact of pediatric patients with clinical indications of genetic disease (GD) on the US health-care system.

Methods

Using the 2012 Kids' Inpatient Database, we identified pediatric inpatient discharges with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes linked to genetic disease, including well-established genetic disorders, neurological diseases, birth defects, and other physiological or functional abnormalities with a genetic basis. Cohort characteristics and health-care utilization measures were analyzed. Discharges with a GD-associated primary diagnosis were used to estimate the minimum burden; discharges with GD-associated primary or secondary codes established the maximum burden.

Results

Of 5.85 million weighted discharges, 2.6–14% included GD-associated ICD-9-CM codes. For these discharges, mean total costs were $16,000–77,000 higher (P < 0.0001) in neonates and $12,000–17,000 higher (P < 0.0001) in pediatric patients compared with background, corresponding to significantly higher total charges and lengths of stay. Aggregate total charges for suspected GD accounted for $14 to $57 billion (11–46%) of the "national bill" for pediatric patients in 2012.

Conclusion

Pediatric inpatients with diagnostic codes linked to genetic disease have a significant and disproportionate impact on resources and costs in the US health-care system.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### Ichthyosis prematurity syndrome: a systematic review of the literature [^f4e3f648]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

The incidence of IPS may be higher than previously thought. IPS also affects a broad range of ethnicities. Ichthyosis lasts for a median duration of 10 weeks, though patients typically have persisting atopy. While the long‐term prognosis is generally favorable, rare cases of death, and other complications have been reported.

### Inherited nonsyndromic ichthyoses: an update on pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment [^dd191470]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnosis

Clinical Signs and Symptoms

Given the conspicuous signs of widespread hyperkeratosis, scaling, xerosis, erythema, and occasional skin erosions, one may think that it is always easy to make a clinical diagnosis of ichthyosis and that patients seeking a doctor are likely to receive correct information about the disease and its treatment. In reality, however, the severe forms of ARCI and keratinopathic ichthyosis may easily be misdiagnosed as syndromic ichthyosis or epidermolysis bullosa (in neonates), and the milder forms as ichthyosis vulgaris (in older children and adults) or X-linked ichthyosis (in males), and vice versa. These and other diagnostic challenges encountered when trying to distinguish one type of ichthyosis from another and excluding syndromic disorders have recently been reviewed.

Traditionally, the type of scaling (fine, coarse, lamellar, etc.) and severity/extension of ichthyosis and erythema, together with the patient's own and family history, form the basis of a first subgrouping of ichthyoses. If ARCI is suspected, further clinical subtyping may be facilitated by looking at the relationship between ichthyosis and erythema severity in the four main types of ARCI, also providing a hint about the most likely candidate genes (Fig. 3). The severity of ichthyosis and erythema is usually graded from mild to very severe (0–4). Although more elaborate scoring systems for the evaluation of skin xerosis, palmoplantar keratoderma, and disease extension have been proposed, none of these protocols has been properly validated and no consensus exists about which one is the best to use in clinical practice and clinical trials.

### HID and KID syndromes are associated with the same connexin 26 mutation [^fd18317f]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome is a debilitating ectodermal dysplasia that predisposes patients to develop squamous cell carcinomas in addition to leading to profound sensory deafness and erythrokeratoderma. We recently demonstrated that KID can be caused by a specific missense mutation in connexin 26 (GJB2). Another syndrome, called hystrix-like ichthyosis-deafnesss (HID) syndrome, strongly resembles the KID syndrome. These disorders are distinguished mainly on the basis of electron microscopic findings. We hypothesized that KID and HID syndromes may be genetically related.

Objective

To demonstrate by mutation analysis that HID and KID syndromes are genetically indistinguishable.

Methods

DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue samples of the first HID syndrome patient described in the literature. Since the KID syndrome mutation abolishes an AspI restriction site, we were able to screen the patient's DNA by polymerase chain reaction and subsequent restriction enzyme analysis.

Results

Restriction analysis of the connexin 26 gene in HID syndrome demonstrated the presence of the KID syndrome mutation that we previously described. This result was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing.

Conclusions

We show that KID and HID syndromes are identical at the molecular level and confirm the clinical impression that these syndromes are one and the same. That previous clinical reports made a distinction may be a consequence of sampling artefacts; alternatively, genetic background effects such as the presence of concurrent mutations in other skin-expressed genes may modify the phenotype.

### Revised nomenclature and classification of inherited ichthyoses: results of the first ichthyosis consensus conference in sorèze 2009 [^f1153814]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Inherited ichthyoses belong to a large, clinically and etiologically heterogeneous group of mendelian disorders of cornification, typically involving the entire integument. Over the recent years, much progress has been made defining their molecular causes. However, there is no internationally accepted classification and terminology.

Objective

We sought to establish a consensus for the nomenclature and classification of inherited ichthyoses.

Methods

The classification project started at the First World Conference on Ichthyosis in 2007. A large international network of expert clinicians, skin pathologists, and geneticists entertained an interactive dialogue over 2 years, eventually leading to the First Ichthyosis Consensus Conference held in Sorèze, France, on January 23 and 24, 2009, where subcommittees on different issues proposed terminology that was debated until consensus was reached.

Results

It was agreed that currently the nosology should remain clinically based. "Syndromic" versus "nonsyndromic" forms provide a useful major subdivision. Several clinical terms and controversial disease names have been redefined: eg, the group caused by keratin mutations is referred to by the umbrella term, "keratinopathic ichthyosis"-under which are included epidermolytic ichthyosis, superficial epidermolytic ichthyosis, and ichthyosis Curth-Macklin. "Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis" is proposed as an umbrella term for the harlequin ichthyosis, lamellar ichthyosis, and the congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma group.

Limitations

As more becomes known about these diseases in the future, modifications will be needed.

Conclusion

We have achieved an international consensus for the classification of inherited ichthyosis that should be useful for all clinicians and can serve as reference point for future research.

### Recognition and management of congenital ichthyosis in a low-income setting [^7037a370]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Global health problem analysis

Congenital Ichthyosis (CI) is a chronic condition that occurs worldwide. Lack of early recognition and diagnostic tools can lead to poor outcomes, particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMICs)

CIs represent a heterogeneous group of genetic skin diseases, primarily characterised by a defective skin barrier, hyperkeratosis and scaling, often associated with skin inflammation. Autosomal recessive CIs, including LI, are estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 100 000 to 1 in 300 000 births worldwide. There is a paucity of data regarding ichthyoses in LMICs and estimates of incidence specifically in Sub-Saharan Africa are not known; a limited number of published case-reports highlight the difficulties in diagnosis and management of more severe subtypes.

CIs present at birth or within the early weeks of life. Diagnosis is based upon the integration of clinical history of the skin abnormalities, including time-of-onset, pattern of development, natural evolution and family history; examination to identify key cutaneous and associated extra-cutaneous manifestations; and investigations, such as histopathological features on skin biopsy or genetic testing, if available.

In high-income settings, CI is often recognised promptly, particularly in centres with strong dermatological expertise. By contrast, early identification of CI remains a challenge in LMICs, including Sub-Saharan Africa, further exacerbated if a delivery has taken place at home or at a poorly equipped birth centre in a rural or community setting. Rates of home birth vary widely; UNICEF recently estimated that, in Sub-Saharan Africa, up to 44% of women do not give birth in a health facility (2011–2016) and 44% of births are not attended by skilled health personnel (2013–2016). In these cases, CI may not to be recognised nor appropriate action taken. There is also often a preference for and/or easier access to traditional community healers who are either unlikely to have any experience of these conditions, given their rarity, or may recommend measures that exacerbate poor outcomes. Delays in provision of supportive management increase the risks of dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, hypothermia, superimposed infection and further skin and eye damage. Minimal specific data are available on the morbidity and mortality related to LI subtype in LMICs; harlequin ichthyosis, a more severe form of CI, has been associated with a mortality rate of up to 44%, with most deaths occurring in the first 3 months of life primarily due to sepsis and/or respiratory failure.

### Medical and neurobehavioural phenotypes in carriers of X-linked ichthyosis-associated genetic deletions in the UK biobank [^03caff78]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Participants

Participants were individuals (aged 40–69 years) recruited under UK Biobank informed consent procedures between 2006–2010, for which anonymised genotype/phenotype data were available.

CNV calling

Anonymised genotype data were downloaded as raw (CEL) files from the UK Biobank website, stored on a secure Linux server and analysed with UNIX-based commands. Affymetrix Power Tools (APT) softwarewas used to generate normalised signal intensity data, genotype calls and confidences. This argument incorporated genotypic sex data downloaded from the UK Biobank website, and compared with sex data generated through PennCNV-Affy software. Approximately 750 000 biallelic markers were analysed through PennCNV-Affy to process cluster plots. Canonical genotype clusters, Log R ratios and B allele frequencies were generated to complete the PennCNV recommended process for CNV calls. Individuals with deletions of 0.8–2.5 Mb spanning STS were identified, with calls and coordinates based on the GRCh37/hg19 genome build; this range was selected to reflect the majority of XLI cases, to facilitate robust CNV calling, and to exclude individuals with multiple complex medical issues arising from large contiguous gene deletions. Following QC, CNV data were available for a total of 418 837 individuals.

Measures

Hospital diagnoses according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems Revision-10 (ICD-10), self-reported non-cancer illnesses, relevant questions from the Mental Health Questionnaire (MHQ)and medication history were analysed. Highest levels of academic qualification and key performance measures on seven cognitive tasks (transformed and converted to z-scores as described previously) were also analysed: number of incorrect matches on the Pairs Matching Test (episodic memory), mean time to correctly identify matches in the Reaction Time Task (simple processing speed), total number of correct answers in the 13-question Fluid Intelligence Test (reasoning/problem-solving), maximum number of digits remembered in the 'Digit Span' task (numeric working memory), number of correct substitutions in a Symbol Digit Substitution Test (complex processing speed) and time to complete two variants of the Trail Making Task (visual attention). Brain images were acquired using Siemens Skyra 3T scanners in UK Biobank's imaging centres in Cheadle and Newcastle, UK using identical acquisition protocols; T1-weighted brain images were processed using automated methods implemented in FreeSurferto obtain volumetric estimates for eight right and left subcortical regions.

### Corneal edema and opacification preferred practice pattern ® [^14409d67]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Corneal opacification — ICD-10 CM classifications list minor corneal opacity H17.81-, peripheral corneal opacity H17.82-, central corneal opacity H17.1-, and phthisical cornea A18.59, H44.52-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### A three-year follow-up study evaluating clinical utility of exome sequencing and diagnostic potential of reanalysis [^9183fbee]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To date, this is the third longitudinal follow-up study, with the longest study duration, on investigating the long-term benefit of ES diagnosis on patient care and outcome. Over the 3-year follow-up period, 26 out of 36 diagnosed individuals (72%) have implemented changes in their management as a result of ES diagnosis, of which four (11%) had a long-term change in clinical outcome, consequently saving costs from the healthcare system perspective in the long term. This is comparable to a similar study by Stark et al. which reported at over a year of follow-up, 16 out of 48 diagnosed infants had a change in management, and among these, four had a change in clinical outcome or hospital service use.

At the initial report of this cohort, changes in management were recommended by clinical geneticists based on disease-specific management guidelines, case reports, or known function of genes of the diagnosed patient. From the result of the longitudinal follow-up, the change in clinical management is generally in line with the prediction. However, there are slight discrepancies, especially on the aspects of specialist referrals (predicted = 44%, actual = 25%), lifestyle change (predicted = 14%, actual = 6%), and medication (predicted = 28%, actual = 17%). This discrepancy might be attributed to case-specific applicability of the advised changes (e.g. some patients have already developed complications prior to genetic diagnosis and therefore already seeing specialists or taking appropriate medications due to the presenting symptoms), ineffective communication (genetic diagnosis was not communicated to other responsible specialists in some cases), and clinicians' perceived importance of the ES results (some clinicians did not make management changes based on the genetic diagnosis provided by geneticists). Furthermore, lifestyle changes would be difficult to measure in a clinical setting and may not be recorded in the medical consultations. For example, sun protection is recommended for individual U076 with keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome. The inability to measure whether certain lifestyle change has been implemented would be a limitation to this study. The discrepancy also demonstrated the importance of long-term follow-up data, as acute changes in management might not necessarily be followed through over the clinical course of patients. Further exploring the factors affecting the delivery and actionability of ES results in the clinical setting could be important to maximize the value of diagnostic ES.

### The collective impact of rare diseases in Western Australia: an estimate using a population-based cohort [^4008fea7]. Genetics in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The whole cohort of this study represents 2.0% of the state population in 2010. This is comparable to a study by Mazzucato et al. that extrapolated prevalence data calculated from a population-based registry to estimate that 1.3 to 2% of the European Union population are living with an RD. However, this is considerably lower than the usually reported estimates of 6–8% of the population living with an RD. Results from this study should be considered as minimum values for reasons that include the following: (i) the RD resource set used in this study contained only 467 of the estimated 6,000 to 8,000 RD, (ii) RD are likely to be incorrectly or insufficiently coded in administrative data sets because physicians may not know or use appropriate codes for certain RD, and (iii) people who used outpatient, general practitioner, emergency, and allied health services without inpatient services were not included. Although it is difficult to estimate the extent, these factors could contribute to a significant underestimate of the number of people in WA with an RD.

Substantial elements of the shortfalls of RD coding internationally will be addressed through the next release of ICD codes (ICD-11). Specifically, Orphanet coding is expected to be formally integrated within ICD-11. This means there will be an internationally accepted and comprehensive data-classification system that supports RD if and when ICD-11 is adopted and implemented. Health-data systems may consider earlier incorporation of Orpha codes into data collections so that as ICD-11 is introduced into health-data collections, there will be the capacity to continue to effectively record and report local RD data. Such actions are consistent with the European Commission Expert Group on RD recommendation adopted in November 2014 for national health-care coding systems to consider using Orpha codes in addition to ICD-10 codes when an RD has no specific ICD-10 code.

### Increased prevalence of hearing loss, tinnitus and sudden deafness among patients with Sjögren's syndrome [^e34480fe]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Measures of outcomes

We selected the following outcome variables of interest: tinnitus, hearing loss, vertigo and sudden deafness. In this study, prevalence was defined as the proportion of a population who have a diagnosis of hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo and sudden deafness between 2015 and 2018. The presence of these diagnoses were identified by finding their respective ICD codes in the ambulatory visit claims, tinnitus (ICD-9-CM code 388.3 or ICD-10-CM H93.1, H93.11, H93.12, H93.13 or H93.19), hearing loss (ICD-9-CM 389 or ICD-10-CM H90 or H91), sudden deafness (ICD-9-CM 388.2 or ICD-10-CM H91.2) or vertigo (ICD-9-CM 386.1, 386.10 and 386.19 or ICD-10-CM H81.391, H81.311, H81.312 or H81.313). One previous study has used the same ICD codes to examine the association of Fabry disease with hearing loss, tinnitus and sudden hearing loss. In Taiwan, otolaryngologists play a key role in the management of patients with hearing and balance disorders. Usually, the diagnosis and quantification of hearing loss involves air-conduction and bone-conduction pure tone audiometry tests in a soundproof room. Asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) was defined as a threshold difference of ≥ 15 dB in two or more frequencies, or an asymmetry of ≥ 15% on word discrimination scores. In cases of asymmetric hearing loss, an auditory brainstem response (ABR) test was administered to differentiate between cochlear and retrocochlear hearing loss. ABR was considered abnormal if there was a difference in interaural latency greater than 0.3–0.4 ms, abnormal absolute wave V latencies (> 6.1 ms with less than 40 dB hearing loss), or absent or distorted waveform morphology. Patients with an abnormal ABR and without any contraindication for MRI underwent an MRI (T1W and/or T2W with Gd-DPTA contrast enhancement) of the brain and cerebellopontine angle to determine the cause of retrocochlear hearing loss. Patients with vertigo typically underwent a comprehensive evaluation, including both physical and otoneurological tests. Physical examinations consisted of nystagmus examination, Romberg test, Dix-Hallpike test, supine roll test, stepping, tandem gait, dysdiadokinesi and dysmetria tests. Otoneurological evaluations included electronystagmography/videonystagmography, caloric test, and cervical or ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials tests.

### Consensus recommendations for the use of retinoids in ichthyosis and other disorders of cornification in children and adolescents [^6c975239]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCLAIMER

The Work Group acknowledges that the ichthyoses and other disorders of cornification are a heterogeneous group of disorders with widely varying prevalence and pathogenetic mechanisms. Clinically, the severity of cutaneous expression, systemic associations, and comorbidities are also disparate. High quality, randomized clinical trials are not available. Thus, these recommendations are made using best available data and the collective clinical experience of the Work Group. These recommendations should not be applied to any patient without careful individualization of the therapeutic plan based on specific patient information and thoughtful provider‐patient discussion of potential risks and benefits.

### Can you hear us now? The impact of health-care utilization by rare disease patients in the United States [^c2389deb]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The vast majority of rare diseases (RDs) are complex, disabling, and life-threatening conditions with a genetic origin. RD patients face significant health challenges and limited treatments, yet the extent of their impact within health care is not well known. One direct method to gauge the disease burden of RDs is their overall cost and utilization within health-care systems.

Methods

The 2016 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) databases were used to extract health-care utilization data using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes.

Results

Of 35.6 million national hospital weighted discharges in the HCUP Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 32% corresponded to RD-associated ICD-10 codes. Total charges were nearly equal between RDs ($768 billion) compared to common conditions (CCs) ($880 billion) (p < 0.0001). These charges were a result of higher charges per discharge and longer length of stay (LOS) for RD patients compared to those with CCs (p < 0.0001). Health-care cost and utilization was similarly higher for RDs with pediatric inpatient stays, readmissions, and emergency visits.

Conclusion

Pediatric and adult discharges with RDs show substantially higher health-care utilization compared to discharges with CCs diagnoses, accounting for nearly half of the US national bill.

Hearing loss is a prominent feature in multiple genodermatoses. Underappreciation of auditory deficits can misdirect proper diagnosis by the treating dermatologist. This review reviews the anatomic, developmental, and embryologic aspects that characterize the ear and summarizes genodermatoses that have aberrant auditory findings. The latter are classified into neural crest, metabolic, pigmentary, craniofacial, and a miscellaneous category of disorders lacking specific cutaneous findings. The algorithms provided in this review enable treating dermatologists to better recognize and manage genodermatoses with ear involvement.

### Parental mosaic cutaneous-gonadal GJB2 mutation: from epidermal nevus to inherited ichthyosis-deafness syndrome [^ac0c4404]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Ichthyosis and deafness syndrome is a group of devastating genodermatoses caused by heterozygous mutations in GJB2, encoding the gap junction protein connexin 26. These syndromes are characterized by severe skin disease, hearing loss, recurrent infections, and cutaneous neoplasms. Cutaneous somatic mutations in the same gene are associated with porokeratotic eccrine ostial dermal duct nevus. Here we report a family in which a parent presented with localized epidermal nevus and his child suffered with hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness. Histologic examination of the parent's cutaneous lesion revealed verrucous epidermal nevus without features of porokeratotic eccrine ostial dermal duct nevus. Genetic analysis identified the same pathogenic variant, GJB2 c.148G > A (p.D50N), in DNA extracted from the parent's cutaneous lesion and the child's leukocytes, but not in the parent's leukocytes. This study expands the phenotypic heterogeneity of GJB2 mosaic variants in addition to porokeratotic eccrine ostial dermal duct nevus, and emphasizes the importance of molecular diagnosis of mosaic skin diseases considering the risk of severe inherited diseases in the offspring.

### Revertant mosaicism repairs skin lesions in a patient with keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome by second-site mutations in connexin 26 [^e9a4a271]. Human Molecular Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome (OMIM #148210) is a rare congenital ectodermal disorder characterized by keratitis, sensorineural hearing loss, and ichthyosis/erythrokeratoderma that manifests as patches of red, thickened, scaly, and dry skin. About 15% of KID syndrome patients are reported to develop squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin and oral mucosa. The gap junction beta 2 (GJB2; NM_004004.5) gene of 2250 base pairs (bp) comprises two exons of which one exon, exon two, encodes the short 226 amino acid protein connexin (Cx) 26. To date, nine mutations in Cx26 have been reported to cause KID syndrome in altogether approximately 100 cases. The dominant mutation GJB2 c.148G > A, p. Asp50Asn is the most common one. The diseases-phenotype has been demonstrated in a mouse model expressing the GJB2 c.50C > T, p. Ser17Phe mutation, a mutation reported to cause KID syndrome in humans. Mutations in GJB2 are also associated with a number of other diseases, including Vohwinkel syndrome (OMIM #124500), Bart–Pumphrey syndrome (OMIM #149200), syndromic sensorineural hearing loss with keratoderma (OMIM #148350), hystrix-like ichthyosis-deafness syndrome (OMIM #602540), and nonsyndromic deafness (OMIM #601544, #220290).

### Bullying in children with congenital ichthyosis [^a135f457]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Limitations

Our sample size was substantial for a rare disease, but still small and demographically homogeneous, which limits the generalizability of results. The COVID‐19 pandemic could have affected bullying reports and mental health in mid‐2022. The CABS‐9 questionnaire only captures recent bullying exposures, potentially missing historical or prolonged experiences. Furthermore, the CABS‐9 is not validated for children 8–10 years old or for caregivers/proxies, limiting the value of the data; however, there are no existing validated metrics for bullying for these populations.

### Recognition and management of congenital ichthyosis in a low-income setting [^7e22d485]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Beyond this, telemedicine also faces significant technical challenges. Although the exchange of images for an individual patient may be straightforward, coordinating multiple partnerships and sustaining a reliable system on a larger, more permanent scale is highly demanding. A 2016 review of teledermatology services set up in South Africa since 1999 found that only four still remained operational. There had been minimal escalation of these services with limited support from regional health departments and poor integration into routine healthcare practices. Effective advice also depends on the quality of the information shared, particularly a detailed clinical background and accurate symptom description, which may be suboptimal depending on the experience of those in the field. Furthermore, the remote expert often does not receive feedback on the advice they have given, partly due to the difficulties in confirming the patient's diagnosis and/or poor follow-up of long-term clinical and social outcomes in LMICs; such a feedback loop could improve remote specialist assessment and management of similar cases in the future. Finally, financial and legal frameworks may be complex and difficult to establish fairly and robustly, especially when institutions across different settings are involved. These frameworks not only enable the procurement and maintenance of required equipment, but also ensure that both remote and local staff are appropriately reimbursed and held accountable, protecting patient safety.

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^cd4941f1]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

Dry eye ICD-10 CM classifications — entities and codes include: Dry eye, unspecified, right lacrimal gland H04.121; left lacrimal gland H04.122; bilateral lacrimal gland H04.123; keratoconjunctivitis sicca (not specified as Sjögren) H16.22-; Sjögren syndrome, sicca syndrome M35.00; Sjögren syndrome with keratoconjunctivitis M35.01; filamentary keratitis H16.12-; exposure keratoconjunctivitis H16.21-; punctate keratitis H11.14-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, and the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct; the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder x must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^0c3ce87b]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

By definition, ICD-9/10 codes are intended to classify diseases or conditions; thus, some ICD-9/10 codes definitively identify specific genetic diseases whereas others indicate clinical presentations that may be an accepted indication to test for a genetic disease. As such, as described previously, ICD-9/10 codes were first categorized into three sets: (1) definite genetic disease; (2) probable genetic disease; and (3) possible genetic disease. The definite category was defined by ICD-9/10 codes that identify specific genetic diseases (e.g. cystic fibrosis, Down syndrome, specific inborn errors of metabolism). Probable genetic diseases were defined as ICD-9/10 codes that describe clinical presentations wherein a genetic etiology is likely to be achieved with appropriate genetic testing in > 30% of patients with these codes (e.g. neonatal intractable epilepsy). Finally, possible genetic diseases were defined as ICD-9/10 codes that describe clinical presentations wherein a genetic etiology is likely to be achieved with appropriate testing in ~10–30% of patients (e.g. most severe birth defects, such as congenital central nervous system, and cardiac malformations). We further identified ICD-9/10 codes where there are established and specific clinical and/or laboratory diagnostic criteria and availability of established and commonly administered targeted diagnostic tests (e.g. cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disorders, neurofibromatosis), and therefore patients with these codes would be less likely to present clinically as an undiagnosed genetic disease. CPT and HCPCS codes were categorized into two categories: (1) genetic tests (e.g. specific single-gene tests, molecular pathology, chromosomal microarray (CMA), ES); and (2) other procedures that are commonly used in the workup of patients with suspected genetic diseases (e.g. electrophysiologic tests, imaging, skin or muscle biopsies, etc), though we acknowledge this second category includes codes that are not specific to the workup of patients with suspected genetic diseases.

We used combinations of this curated code sets to group patients into three non-mutually exclusive cohorts for analysis [a complete list of codes and the algorithms for identifying each cohort (Supplementary Information) and an attrition table (Supplementary Table 1) can be found in the Supplementary Information].

### Testing and extending strategies for identifying genetic disease-related encounters in pediatric patients [^39114c01]. Genetics in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To better understand health care utilization and develop decision support tools, methods for identifying patients with suspected genetic diseases (GDs) are needed. Previous studies had identified inpatient-relevant International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes that were possibly, probably, or definitely indicative of GDs. We assessed whether these codes identified GD-related inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department encounters among pediatric patients with suspected GDs from a previous study (the North Carolina Clinical Genomic Evaluation by Next-Generation Exome Sequencing [NCGENES] study).

Methods

Using the electronic medical records of 140 pediatric patients from the NCGENES study, we characterized the presence of ICD codes representing possible, probable, or definite GD-related diagnoses across encounter types. In addition, we examined codes from encounters for which initially no GD-related codes had been found and determined whether these codes were indicative of a GD.

Results

Among NCGENES patients with visits between 2014 and 2017, 92% of inpatient, 75% of emergency department, and 63% of outpatient encounters included ≥ 1 GD-related code. Encounters with highly specific (ie, definite) GD codes had fewer low-specificity GD codes than encounters with only low-specificity GD codes. We identified an additional 32 ICD-9 and 56 ICD-10 codes possibly indicative of a GD.

Conclusion

Code-based strategies can be refined to assess health care utilization among pediatric patients and may contribute to a systematic approach to identify patients with suspected GDs.

### The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 [^cd209fa6]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Linearizations

To enable behavior as a statistical classification, ICD-11 draws a shallow monohierarchy tree onto the Foundation; for example, it determines which parent will prevail and how deep (or shallow) the hierarchy will be. This defines a derivative, called a linearization, of the Foundation that can be used as a statistical classification. The primary linearization, and the one most users will recognize and likely believe is "the ICD-11", is the Mortality and Morbidity Statistics (MMS) linearization. This, of course, implies that one can have more than one linearized derivative, which is, in fact, the case. Work proceeds on a primary care linearization, and some subspecialty linearizations, such as Dermatology. Since all purpose-specific ICD linearizations derive from the same semantic network (the Foundation), they can all be algorithmically cross-walked and navigated.

Creating such linearizations also has implications. The most obvious is what we call the shoreline, where the Foundation may have depth of a score or more of layered categories, the MMS more typically has four, five, or, in some extreme cases, six layers of depth. This implies that substantial detail, such as highly specific or rare subtypes of disease, will be "below the shoreline" and relegated to a residual category in the MMS, even though they exist as a rubric in the Foundation. This is why many consider the Foundation as an index, though it is substantially more than simply that.

### Simulation of ICD-9 to ICD-10-CM transition for family medicine: simple or convoluted? [^3f7280a1]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of the transition from International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to Interactional Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), on family medicine and to identify areas where additional training might be required.

Methods

Family medicine ICD-9-CM codes were obtained from an Illinois Medicaid data set (113,000 patient visits and $5.5 million in claims). Using the science of networks, we evaluated each ICD-9-CM code used by family medicine physicians to determine whether the transition was simple or convoluted. A simple transition is defined as 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to 1 ICD-10-CM code, or 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to multiple ICD-10-CM codes. A convoluted transition is where the transitions between coding systems is nonreciprocal and complex, with multiple codes for which definitions become intertwined. Three family medicine physicians evaluated the most frequently encountered complex mappings for clinical accuracy.

Results

Of the 1635 diagnosis codes used by family medicine physicians, 70% of the codes were categorized as simple, 27% of codes were convoluted, and 3% had no mapping. For the visits, 75%, 24%, and 1% corresponded with simple, convoluted, and no mapping, respectively. Payment for submitted claims was similarly aligned. Of the frequently encountered convoluted codes, 3 diagnosis codes were clinically incorrect, but they represent only < 0.1% of the overall diagnosis codes.

Conclusions

The transition to ICD-10-CM is simple for 70% or more of diagnosis codes, visits, and reimbursement for a family medicine physician. However, some frequently used codes for disease management are convoluted and incorrect, and for which additional resources need to be invested to ensure a successful transition to ICD-10-CM.

### Frequency of ear symptoms and hearing loss in ichthyosis: a pilot survey study [^a44fc6b5]. Pediatric Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Ichthyoses comprise a heterogeneous array of skin conditions resulting from impairment of cornification. Although ear structures can be affected, ear-related symptoms have never been investigated in patients with ichthyosis. In this pilot survey study, our aim was to determine the frequency of ear symptoms, hearing loss, and related medical interventions in patients with ichthyosis. Our secondary aim was to compare the frequency of these items according to age group. An online survey using Redcap was developed and posted online on the Foundation for Ichthyosis and Related Skin Types website for 6 months. Patients or parents of patients with ichthyosis were asked to complete the survey. Data analysis excluded patients with keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome and surveys that had fewer than two completed items. One hundred thirty-five unique surveys were used for data analysis. Of all participants, 80% reported ear pruritus, 66% reported trouble hearing, 29% reported frequent ear pain, 28% had abnormal hearing test results, and 16% had used hearing aids. Of the 88 participants who reported trouble hearing, 24 (27.3%) had never been to a hearing specialist. Significantly more participants older than 18 years of age (74%, 57/77) reported trouble hearing than participants age 18 years and younger (53%, 31/58; p = 0.02). The frequencies of other ear symptoms and hearing loss were not statistically significantly different between the age groups. Ear pruritus, ear pain, and hearing loss are important concerns in patients with all forms of ichthyosis in all age groups. Early diagnosis and intervention may improve the quality of life of patients with ichthyosis.

### A new way to classify genetic skin disease [^04d27fec]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Genetic disorders with skin manifestations often affect other organs as well, and diseases with a similar array of features might be linked pathogenetically. Classifying disorders by individual phenotypic components may reveal clusters with a common genetic cause and elucidate pathogenic links. If components are categorized inadequately, however, the method will simply confirm what is known, obscure true links, and suggest false ones.

### Malignant skin tumours in patients with inherited ichthyosis [^213f486b]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Inherited ichthyoses are rare genodermatoses caused by mutations in the genes involved in epidermal development. Although there have been case reports on patients with ichthyosis who developed skin malignancies, it is still unknown whether or not patients with ichthyosis have an increased risk of skin malignancies. Here, we review case series of skin malignancies in patients with ichthyosis and show biological findings which might lead to cancer susceptibility. A survey of the literature revealed 28 cases of inherited ichthyoses with skin malignancy, including 12 cases of keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome, seven of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis, three of Netherton syndrome and six of miscellaneous ichthyosis. Twenty-four of the 28 cases developed single or multiple squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). The age at diagnosis of the first skin malignancy ranged from 15 to 54 years. As patients with these particular subtypes of ichthyosis seem to be prone to skin malignancies, including SCC, at an unusually young age, routine cancer surveillance of these patients is strongly recommended.

### Consensus recommendations for the use of retinoids in ichthyosis and other disorders of cornification in children and adolescents [^e2c42853]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical recommendations were developed on the best available evidence tabled in the guideline. The strength of recommendation was ranked as follows:
Recommendation based on consistent and good‐quality patient‐oriented evidence.
Recommendation based on inconsistent or limited quality patient‐oriented evidence.
Recommendation based on consensus, opinion, case studies, or disease‐oriented evidence.

In those situations where documented evidence‐based data were not available, or showing inconsistent or limited conclusions, expert opinion and medical consensus was utilized to generate clinical recommendations

### Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome and carotenaemia [^3a0f080e]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome is a congenital ectodermal disorder that causes erythrokeratoderma, vascularizing keratitis, and neurosensory deafness. We report a form of this syndrome in a patient with no evidence of keratitis. In addition this individual had clinical and biochemical evidence of carotenaemia. Carotenaemia occurring in association with KID syndrome has not been reported previously.

### Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome and hidradenitis suppurativa [^54981ac9]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

First described by Burns in 1915, keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome was later characterized and named by Skinner et al in 1981.KID syndrome is a rare ectodermal dysplasia (OMIM #). It is caused by heterozygous missense mutations on the connexin-26 gene gap junction beta-2 protein (GJB2) and connexin-30 gene gap junction beta-6 protein. The mutations cause a disturbance in the gap junction system which may affect epithelial homeostasis, differentiation, immune response, and carcinogenesis in ectodermal epithelia.

Follicular occlusion occurs in a number of diseases, most notably acne. It is also the connecting sign of follicular occlusion triad (co-occurrence of hidradenitis suppurativa [HS], cystic acne, and dissecting cellulitis of the scalp) and tetrad (triad + pilonidal sinus disease).

The association of HS and KID syndrome has been reported in 6 cases, 4 of which exhibited the triad by also presenting with cystic acne and dissecting cellulitis of the scalp (Table I).

### Treacher Collins syndrome in the United States: examining incidence and inpatient interventions [^03ebdedf]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Advancements have been made in the care of patients with Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS), but epidemiological data are lacking given its rarity. A national database provides a valuable opportunity for studying the incidence of rare craniofacial conditions. We sought to evaluate disease incidence of phenotypically severe cases and the frequency of the most common associated diagnoses and interventions.

Design

The 2016 Kids' Inpatient Database (KID), Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality was the first version to include updated International Classification of Diseases-Tenth Edition (ICD-10) coding encompassing a unique code for TCS. The 2016 KID was queried for the unique code. Incidence was calculated using national estimates. Diagnosis and procedure codes were pooled and analyzed.

Patients

A total of 266 discharge cases with a diagnosis code for TCS (Q75.4).

Main Outcomes

Disease incidence and the most frequent diagnosis and procedure codes.

Results

The estimated incidence of children born with a diagnosis of TCS was approximately 1 in 80,000. Two of the three most common ICD-10 diagnosis codes were tracheostomy status and obstructive sleep apnea. The most common procedures performed were airway examination procedures.

Conclusions

Treacher Collins syndrome is a rare craniofacial disorder requiring complex multidisciplinary management. Phenotypically severe cases requiring inpatient management may be rarer than previous estimates suggest. Inpatient airway interventions are very common, and multidisciplinary team members should anticipate the degree of potential airway risk these patients pose.

### A case of keratitis, ichthyosis, and deafness syndrome with rickets [^10195870]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Keratitis, ichthyosis, deafness (KID) syndrome is a rare disorder of cornification and a distinct type of congenital ichthyosis with predominantly autosomal dominant inheritance. The classical triad is keratitis, progressive erythrokeratoderma, and hearing loss. KID syndrome is a result of missense mutation in the GJB2 (gap junction β2) gene on chromosome 13q11-q12, which encodes connexin 26 protein. This protein is involved in formation of intercellular channels and has a role in epithelial differentiation. There are only around 100 cases of KID syndrome reported in literature to date. Although rickets has been reported to be associated with congenital ichthyosis and keratinizing disorders with erythroderma and scaling, KID syndrome with associated rickets has not been. We report a rare case of KID syndrome with rickets.

### Inherited ichthyosis as a paradigm of rare skin disorders: genomic medicine, pathogenesis, and management [^7b5d7456]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Great advances have been made in the field of heritable skin disorders using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies (ie, whole-genome sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, whole-transcriptome sequencing, and disease-targeted multigene panels). When NGS first became available, the cost and lack of access to these technologies were limiting factors; however, with decreasing sequencing costs and the expanding knowledge base of genetic skin diseases, fundamental awareness of NGS has become prudent. The heritable ichthyoses comprise a genotypically and phenotypically heterogeneous group of monogenic keratinization disorders characterized by persistent scaling, with at least 55 distinct genes currently implicated in causing nonsyndromic and syndromic forms of the disease. By providing a simplified overview of available NGS techniques and applying them in the context of ichthyosis, one of the most common genodermatoses, we hope to encourage dermatologists to offer, when appropriate, genetic testing earlier in patients with unsolved presentations. With the aid of NGS, dermatologists can provide diagnostic certainty in cases of suspected genodermatoses and offer potentially life-changing genome-guided and targeted therapies as they become available.

### The transition to ICD-10-CM: challenges for pediatric practice [^51ad6a56]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Diagnostic codes are used widely within health care for billing, quality assessment, and to measure clinical outcomes. The US health care system will transition to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), in October 2015. Little is known about how this transition will affect pediatric practices. The objective of this study was to examine how the transition to ICD-10-CM may result in ambiguity of clinical information and financial disruption for pediatricians.

Methods

Using a statewide data set from Illinois Medicaid specified for pediatricians, 2708 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, diagnosis codes were identified. Diagnosis codes were categorized into 1 of 5 categories: identity, class-to-subclass, subclass-to-class, convoluted, and no translation. The convoluted and high-cost diagnostic codes (n = 636) were analyzed for accuracy and categorized into "information loss", "overlapping categories", "inconsistent", and "consistent". Finally, reimbursement by Medicaid was calculated for each category.

Results

Twenty-six percent of pediatric diagnosis codes are convoluted, which represents 21% of Illinois Medicaid pediatric patient encounters and 16% of reimbursement. The diagnosis codes represented by information loss (3.6%), overlapping categories (3.2%), and inconsistent (1.2%) represent 8% of Medicaid pediatric reimbursement.

Conclusions

The potential for financial disruption and administrative errors from 8% of reimbursement diagnosis codes necessitates special attention to these codes in preparing for the transition to ICD-10-CM for pediatric practices.

### Harlequin ichthyosis, prenatal diagnosis: the ultrasound recognition [^50f31f7f]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Harlequin ichthyosis (HI) is an extremely rare disease with a prevalence of less than 1/300000 live newborns and no more than 100 cases reported worldwide. It corresponds to a genodermatoses autosomal recessive inheritance, typically, with postnatal recognition due to the complexity of prenatal diagnosis. Advances in prenatal genetic testing allow sequencing of the affected gene and confirmation of the diagnosis after recognition of ultrasound markers. The prenatal acknowledgement of the disease significantly marks the course of the pregnancy; considering the perinatal high risk and neonatal mortality, this entity can be classified as lethal. Taking into account the legislation of each country, the possibility of pregnancy termination should be considered as an acceptable option. We present a case of prenatally diagnosed HI in the first ultrasound evaluation by the Maternal Fetal Medicine unit at 29 weeks of gestation, in which after counselling to the parents, the interruption of the gestation was decided.

### Evolving phenotypes of non-hospitalized patients that indicate long COVID [^7ac74b6e]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

While the chart review's primary purpose was to determine if the clinical notes were in agreement with the ICD-9/10 labels, the reviewer also noted that physicians consistently attributed two of the phenotypes (alopecia, and anosmia and dysgeusia) to a previous history of COVID-19, whereas the physicians' notes did not specifically identify a connection between the phenotype and the previous infection for most of the other phenotypes, even those with high confidence like type 2 diabetes or non-specific chest pain. Our model indicates that even if these phenotypes are not explicitly identified or recognized by the clinician and patient at the individual level, many of these unrecognized phenotypes still have a high confidence score. While an ICD code on its own does not specify the time of onset, the chart review helped to confirm that the presented phenotypes were likely new since COVID-19. The majority of charts reviewed for each phenotype suggest that the symptoms or the diagnosis occurred after COVID-19. Our model identifies the relationships between COVID and a phenotype, where a healthcare provider and patient may otherwise miss that relationship.

Several neurological phenotypes (vascular dementia, dementia, and neurological disorders) were frequently diagnosed after COVID and appear to have an increased association with the infection. The neurological disorder phenotype includes several ICD codes, and in a random sampling of patients with this phenotype, the majority had the ICD code "R41.89 — other symptoms and signs involving cognitive function and awareness". Collectively, these phenotypes suggest ongoing cognitive dysfunction. The earliest reports of acute COVID, such as Mao's retrospective analysis of 214 hospitalized patients in China, described neurological manifestations, including cerebrovascular complications, in nearly half of those with severe disease. Since the acute phase, the sequelae for the description of "brain fog" after the diagnosis of COVID have been repeatedly described. Al-Aly specifically documents increased memory problems and strokes. Our model suggests that these cognitive deficits are ongoing and in some cases may be so severe they are even lead to an initial formal diagnosis of dementia at higher rates among those with a history of COVID. While many of these patients may have already shown some signs of memory loss, the formal diagnosis of dementia did not come until after COVID-19 suggesting that the viral illness may have contributed to a worsening of their condition and the formal declaration of this diagnosis.

### Preparing for international classification of diseases, 10th revision, clinical modification implementation: strategies for maintaining an efficient workflow [^204c5163]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, is required to be used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services health care billing data starting in October 2015 in the United States. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, is an update to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and contains approximately 70,000 codes compared with 14,000 codes. We aimed to discuss how our institution is updating the coding system in a manner that alleviates the possible burden placed on providers including more coding information required and longer load times. We performed a simulation test including testing the diagnosis calculator, timing, and how well the new and old codes mapped. We conducted a gap analysis to ensure that coding could begin in October of 2015 with minimal service interruptions. We will describe strategies and procedures to transition between systems while maintaining efficiency and helping to improve classification.
