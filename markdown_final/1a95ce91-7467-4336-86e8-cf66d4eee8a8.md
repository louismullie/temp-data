## Question

Range of blood sugar levels and classifications

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the range of blood sugar levels and their classifications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic framework and which tests are acceptable. Then, I should verify the exact thresholds for normal, prediabetes, and diabetes using ADA 2025. Next, I will examine hypoglycemia classifications and special populations, including pregnancy and pediatrics. After that, I need to check for discordance between A1C and glucose and how to confirm diagnoses. Finally, I will consider the continuum of risk, screening intervals, and practical clinical implications, making sure I double-check any points that seem uncertain before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework so I don't jump to conclusions: diabetes can be diagnosed by A1C or plasma glucose using fasting plasma glucose, a 2-hour OGTT, or a random plasma glucose in the presence of classic symptoms, and in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, confirmation with two abnormal results is required, which I should explicitly state to avoid misclassification [^113ijYvh] [^113RPQFH].

> I will now examine the ADA 2025 thresholds for diabetes; hold on, I should verify the exact cut points: A1C ≥ 6.5% using an NGSP-certified, DCCT-aligned method, fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL after at least 8 hours of fasting, 2-hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL during a 75-g OGTT, or random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL with classic symptoms or hyperglycemic crisis, and I need to ensure I note that confirmation is needed unless the presentation is unequivocal [^113RPQFH] [^113ijYvh].

> Next, I should review prediabetes; wait, let me verify the ranges: A1C 5.7–6.4%, impaired fasting glucose 100–125 mg/dL, and impaired glucose tolerance 140–199 mg/dL on the 2-hour OGTT, and I should emphasize that risk is continuous and rises disproportionately toward the upper ends of these ranges, which is why counseling and risk reduction are recommended even at the lower bound of prediabetes [^111hm5Gx] [^117MLamS].

> For normal glycemia, I initially thought to cite a normal fasting range of 70–99 mg/dL, but wait, I should double-check the source; the first aid reference defines a normal blood glucose range of 70–120 mg/dL, which is a physiologic framing rather than a diagnostic cut point, so I should clarify that ADA diagnostic "normal" for fasting is < 100 mg/dL while acknowledging that population normals can extend up to about 120 mg/dL in some contexts, and I should also anchor hypoglycemia at < 70 mg/dL as the clinical threshold for action [^114fHtiz] [^1145SjR5].

> Now, I need to check hypoglycemia classifications; Level 1 is glucose < 70 mg/dL and ≥ 54 mg/dL, Level 2 is glucose < 54 mg/dL, and Level 3 is a severe event requiring assistance, irrespective of the measured glucose, and I should confirm that these ADA categories are the standard for clinical decision-making and documentation [^115K5Xyq].

> Let me consider pregnancy-specific thresholds; I should confirm early pregnancy screening for abnormal glucose metabolism using FPG 110–125 mg/dL or A1C 5.9–6.4%, and at 24–28 weeks universal screening for GDM using the 75-g OGTT with thresholds of FPG ≥ 92 mg/dL, 1-hour ≥ 180 mg/dL, and 2-hour ≥ 153 mg/dL, noting that these are IADPSG-derived and adopted by ADA, and I should also remember postpartum testing at 4–12 weeks with a 75-g OGTT and lifelong screening every 1–3 years thereafter [^11485EeF] [^113k8xAV] [^115H1w1A].

> For pediatrics, I should confirm that adult diagnostic criteria are applied to children and adolescents for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, with screening beginning in youth with overweight/obesity and risk factors, and I need to ensure I note that while A1C is acceptable, OGTT may detect more cases in some high-risk pediatric populations [^116tUVAX].

> Hold on, I should verify how to handle discordance between A1C and glucose; if two different tests are both above diagnostic thresholds, diabetes is confirmed, but if results are discordant, repeat the abnormal test and consider alternative markers such as fructosamine or glycated albumin, and I should also remember that A1C can be misleading in conditions altering erythrocyte turnover or with certain hemoglobinopathies, prompting reliance on glucose criteria in those settings [^114NY2Ex] [^115kb4S7].

> I need to ensure I capture the continuum of risk; risk for future diabetes and cardiovascular disease rises even below conventional cut points, with higher risk as A1C approaches 6.0% and with combined IFG/IGT conferring the greatest progression risk, which supports aggressive lifestyle intervention and, in selected very-high-risk individuals, pharmacotherapy for diabetes prevention [^115PDvtC] [^111hm5Gx].

> Next, I should review screening intervals and confirmatory practices; routine screening should begin at age 35 in average-risk adults, with a 3-year interval if normal, shorter intervals for those near diagnostic thresholds, and annual testing for those with prediabetes or prior GDM, and I should confirm that screening is ideally conducted in healthcare settings with established referral pathways [^112KhzHP] [^116eZDAu] [^116ZPMJZ].

> But wait, what about inpatient and ICU contexts; I should double-check that hyperglycemia in the hospital is often defined as > 140 mg/dL and that hypoglycemia is < 70 mg/dL, with severe hypoglycemia variably defined around < 40–50 mg/dL, and I need to caution that tight glycemic targets in ICU settings carry hypoglycemia risk and require validated measurement and insulin protocols, so many programs target intermediate ranges rather than age-normal levels [^114qe4sd] [^113CVhTf] [^1178Zae3].

> Finally, I should synthesize the clinical implications: accurate classification guides prevention, surveillance, and treatment intensity, and I need to ensure I emphasize that A1C offers convenience and reflects chronic glycemia but has lower sensitivity than glucose-based tests, OGTT detects more diabetes but is less practical, and discordant results warrant repeat testing and consideration of assay limitations before labeling a patient, which helps avoid both under- and over-diagnosis [^11683ts9] [^113yiD4Q] [^114NY2Ex].

Blood sugar levels are classified into **normal, prediabetes, and diabetes** based on fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and A1C [^1144zuoF]. Normal fasting glucose is **< 100 mg/dL**; prediabetes is 100–125 mg/dL (impaired fasting glucose) or 140–199 mg/dL at 2 hours on OGTT (impaired glucose tolerance) [^111hm5Gx]; diabetes is **≥ 126 mg/dL** fasting, **≥ 200 mg/dL** at 2 hours on OGTT, or **≥ 6.5% **A1C [^113RPQFH]. Hypoglycemia is **< 70 mg/dL** and severe hypoglycemia is **< 54 mg/dL** [^1145SjR5]. These thresholds guide diagnosis and management [^113ijYvh].

| **Category** | **Fasting plasma glucose (FPG)** | **2-hour OGTT** | **A1C** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Normal | < 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) | < 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) | < 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) |
| Prediabetes | 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L) | 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L) | 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) |
| Diabetes | ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) | ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) | ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) |

---

Hypoglycemia is defined as **< 70 mg/dL** (3.9 mmol/L), with severe hypoglycemia at **< 54 mg/dL** (3.0 mmol/L) [^1145SjR5]. These classifications are used to guide diagnosis, screening, and management of dysglycemia [^notfound].

Standards of Care in Diabetes — 2025: A1C-based identification of high-risk states — An A1C range of 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) identifies a group of individuals at high risk for diabetes and cardiovascular complications; these individuals should be informed of their increased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease and counseled about effective strategies to lower their risk, and aggressive intervention and vigilant follow-up should be pursued for those considered at very high risk, such as those with A1C ≥ 6.0% [≥ 42 mmol/mol] and individuals with both impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Analyses also note that A1C of 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) or higher is associated with a diabetes risk similar to that of high-risk Diabetes Prevention Program participants.

### Which patients should be evaluated for blood glucose variability? [^113qLrqk]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetes is characterized by glycaemic disorders that include both sustained chronic hyperglycaemia and acute fluctuations (i.e.g.lycaemic variability). Increasing attention is being paid to the role of glycaemic variability as a relevant determinant for diabetes control and prevention of its vascular complications. As a consequence, it is strongly suggested that a global antidiabetic strategy should be aimed at reducing to a minimum the different components of glycaemic control (i.e. HbA1c, fasting and postprandial glucose, as well as glycaemic variability). Subjects at risk of hypoglycaemia, subjects with postprandial hyperglycaemia and patients who need to adjust or start insulin seem to be the categories that require glycaemic variability monitoring. The analysis of blood glucose variability represents an additional tool in the global assessment of glycaemic control and can serve as a guide to the clinician in the management of therapy and for the patients both in the prevention of acute complications, in particular hypoglycaemia, and chronic disease, in particular macrovascular complications.

Normal blood glucose range is 70 to 120 mg/dL (3.9–6.6 mmol/L). Hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 70 or < 2.8 mmol/L) can result from starvation, underlying metabolic disorders, deficiencies of hormones, and medications.

Prediabetes — definition and glycemic thresholds: People with prediabetes are defined by the presence of IFG and/or IGT and/or A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol). IFG is defined as FPG levels from 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) and 2-h PG levels during 75-g OGTT from 140 to 199 mg/dL (from 7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L). The World Health Organization and a number of diabetes organizations define the IFG lower limit at 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L), whereas in 2003 the ADA adopted the range of 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L). Prediabetes is associated with obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension; the presence of prediabetes should prompt comprehensive screening for cardiovascular risk factors and risk management.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus [^114ycGUw]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Further research is needed to better characterize those patients whose glycemic status might be categorized differently by two different tests (e.g. FPG and A1C), obtained in close temporal approximation. Such discordance may arise from measurement variability, change over time, or because A1C, FPG, and postchallenge glucose each measure different physiological processes. In the setting of an elevated A1C but "nondiabetic" FPG, the likelihood of greater postprandial glucose levels or increased glycation rates for a given degree of hyperglycemia may be present. In the opposite scenario (high FPG yet A1C below the diabetes cut point), augmented hepatic glucose production or reduced glycation rates may be present.

As with most diagnostic tests, a test result diagnostic of diabetes should be repeated to rule out laboratory error, unless the diagnosis is clear on clinical grounds, such as a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis. It is preferable that the same test be repeated for confirmation, since there will be a greater likelihood of concurrence in this case. For example, if the A1C is 7.0% and a repeat result is 6.8%, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed. However, there are scenarios in which results of two different tests (e.g. FPG and A1C) are available for the same patient. In this situation, if the two different tests are both above the diagnostic thresholds, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus [^116K7P11]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Individuals with an A1C of 5.7–6.4% should be informed of their increased risk for diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease and counseled about effective strategies, such as weight loss and physical activity, to lower their risks. As with glucose measurements, the continuum of risk is curvilinear, so that as A1C rises, the risk of diabetes rises disproportionately. Accordingly, interventions should be most intensive and follow-up should be particularly vigilant for those with A1C levels above 6.0%, who should be considered to be at very high risk. However, just as an individual with a fasting glucose of 98 mg/dl (5.4 mmol/l) may not be at negligible risk for diabetes, individuals with A1C levels below 5.7% may still be at risk, depending on level of A1C and presence of other risk factors, such as obesity and family history.

Table 2 summarizes the categories of increased risk for diabetes. Evaluation of patients at risk should incorporate a global risk factor assessment for both diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Screening for and counseling about risk of diabetes should always be in the pragmatic context of the patient's comorbidities, life expectancy, personal capacity to engage in lifestyle change, and overall health goals.

Diabetes diagnosis has important implications for individuals. Diagnostic criteria for fasting and 2-hour plasma glucose and HbA1c are universally agreed. Intermediate hyperglycemia/prediabetes is a risk factor for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Because risk is a continuum, determining cut-point is problematic and reflected in significant differences in recommended fasting glucose and HbA1c criteria. Many types of diabetes are recognized. Diabetes classification systems are limited by a lack of understanding of etiopathogenetic pathways leading to diminished β-cell function. The World Health Organization classification system is designed to assist clinical care decisions. Newly recognized phenotypic clusters of diabetes might inform future classification systems.

As A1C is used more commonly to diagnose diabetes in individuals with risk factors, it will also identify those at higher risk for developing diabetes in the future. When recommending the use of the A1C to diagnose diabetes in its 2009 report, the International Expert Committee stressed the continuum of risk for diabetes with all glycemic measures and did not formally identify an equivalent intermediate category for A1C. The group did note that those with A1C levels above the laboratory "normal" range but below the diagnostic cut point for diabetes (6.0 to < 6.5%) are at very high risk of developing diabetes. Indeed, incidence of diabetes in people with A1C levels in this range is more than 10 times that of people with lower levels. However, the 6.0 to < 6.5% range fails to identify a substantial number of patients who have IFG and/or IGT. Prospective studies indicate that people within the A1C range of 5.5–6.0% have a 5-year cumulative incidence of diabetes that ranges from 12 to 25%, which is appreciably (three- to eightfold) higher than incidence in the U.S. population as a whole. Analyses of nationally representative data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicate that the A1C value that most accurately identifies people with IFG or IGT falls between 5.5 and 6.0%. In addition, linear regression analyses of these data indicate that among the nondiabetic adult population, an FPG of 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) corresponds to an A1C of 5.6%, while an FPG of 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) corresponds to an A1C of 5.4% (R.T. Ackerman, personal communication). Finally, evidence from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), wherein the mean A1C was 5.9% (SD 0.5%), indicates that preventive interventions are effective in groups of people with A1C levels both below and above 5.9%. For these reasons, the most appropriate A1C level above which to initiate preventive interventions is likely to be somewhere in the range of 5.5–6%.

Testing interval — general guidance states that the appropriate interval between screenings is not known, that the rationale for the 3-year interval is to reduce false positives requiring confirmatory testing and to allow retesting of false negatives before complications develop, and that in especially high-risk individuals with previous values near the diabetes diagnostic cut point, shorter intervals between screenings may be useful.

Table 2.2 — Criteria defining prediabetes in nonpregnant individuals — Prediabetes is defined by any of the following: A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol); fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) to 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L) (impaired fasting glucose [IFG]); or 2-hour plasma glucose (2-h PG) during 75-g OGTT 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) to 199 mg/dL (11.0 mmol/L) (impaired glucose tolerance [IGT]). For all three tests, risk is continuous, extending below the lower limit of the range and becoming disproportionately greater at the higher end of the range.

### Consensus report: definition and interpretation of remission in type 2 diabetes [^116sv6Cr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Improvement of glucose levels into the normal range can occur in some people living with diabetes, either spontaneously or after medical interventions, and in some cases can persist after withdrawal of glucose-lowering pharmacotherapy. Such sustained improvement may now be occurring more often due to newer forms of treatment. However, terminology for describing this process and objective measures for defining it are not well established, and the long-term risks versus benefits of its attainment are not well understood. To update prior discussions of this issue, an international expert group was convened by the American Diabetes Association to propose nomenclature and principles for data collection and analysis, with the goal of establishing a base of information to support future clinical guidance. This group proposed "remission" as the most appropriate descriptive term, and HbA1c < 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) measured at least 3 months after cessation of glucose-lowering pharmacotherapy as the usual diagnostic criterion. The group also made suggestions for active observation of individuals experiencing a remission and discussed further questions and unmet needs regarding predictors and outcomes of remission.

### International expert committee report on the role of the A1c assay in the diagnosis of diabetes [^112mzBVY]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Can A1C measurements define a specific subdiabetic "high-risk" state?

The 2003 International Expert Committee report reduced the lower bound of IFG from 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) to 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) on the grounds that the lower level optimized the sensitivity and specificity for predicting future diabetes and also increased the proportion of those with IGT who could be identified with an FPG test. While previous studies have shown a powerful effect of IFG and/or IGT on the subsequent development of diabetes diagnosed with glucose values, recent reports have demonstrated a graded risk of diabetes development at glycemic levels well within what was previously considered "normal", i.e. FPG < 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) and A1C < 6.0%. In addition, metabolic derangements related to diabetes have been documented at similarly low glycemic levels, increasing in severity with higher glucose values within the nondiabetic range.

As with measures of glucose, a continuum of risk for the development of diabetes based on A1C levels has been demonstrated. Thus, while there appears to be an approximate glycemic threshold above which the risk for retinopathy escalates, there does not appear to be a specific level at which risk for diabetes clearly begins. A continuum of risk for the development of diabetes across a wide range of subdiabetic A1C levels may make the classification of individuals into categories similar to IFG and IGT equally problematic for A1C, as it implies that we actually know where risk begins or becomes clinically important. The continuum of risk in the subdiabetic glycemic range argues for the elimination of dichotomous subdiabetic classifications, such as "pre-diabetes", IFG, and IGT. However, as A1C levels approach the diagnostic level for diabetes, the risk of developing diabetes becomes greatest.

### Clinical review: intensive insulin therapy in critically ill patients: NICE-SUGAR or leuven blood glucose target? [^113CVhTf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Context

Hyper- and hypoglycemia are associated with increased mortality of critically ill patients, but whether this association is causal remains unclear. Early randomized-controlled studies compared insulin infusion targeting "age-normal" blood glucose levels, labeled intensive insulin therapy, with an approach that considered hyperglycemia as a beneficial adaptation. These studies found benefits with maintaining normoglycemia. A recent large multicenter study, NICE-SUGAR, compared a similar age-normal with an intermediate glucose target and found the intermediate target superior. These results require explanation.

Evidence Acquisition

All published randomized controlled studies on glucose control in ICU were reviewed. The methodological differences between the repeat studies, most specifically NICE-SUGAR, and the original proof-of-concept studies, were systematically analyzed.

Evidence Synthesis

There were important methodological differences, possibly explaining different outcomes. These comprised different target ranges for blood glucose in control and intervention groups, different routes for insulin administration and types of infusion-pumps, different sampling sites, and different accuracies of glucometers, as well as different nutritional strategies and varying levels of expertise.

Conclusions

These differences do not permit confident recommendations for a single optimal glucose target in variable ICU settings. Respecting the "primum non nocere" principle, it appears safe not to embark on targeting age-normal levels in ICUs that are not equipped to accurately and frequently measure blood glucose and have not acquired extensive experience with iv insulin administration using a customized guideline. A simple overall fall-back position could be to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible without evoking unacceptable fluctuations, hypoglycemia, and hypokalemia.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus [^114LCLN7]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

As was the case with FPG and 2-h PG, defining a lower limit of an intermediate category of A1C is somewhat arbitrary, as the risk of diabetes with any measure or surrogate of glycemia is a continuum, extending well into the normal ranges. To maximize equity and efficiency of preventive interventions, such an A1C cut point should balance the costs of "false negatives" (failing to identify those who are going to develop diabetes) against the costs of "false positives" (falsely identifying and then spending intervention resources on those who were not going to develop diabetes anyway).

As is the case with the glucose measures, several prospective studies that used A1C to predict the progression to diabetes demonstrated a strong, continuous association between A1C and subsequent diabetes. In a systematic review of 44,203 individuals from 16 cohort studies with a follow-up interval averaging 5.6 years (range 2.8–12 years), those with an A1C between 5.5 and 6.0% had a substantially increased risk of diabetes with 5-year incidences ranging from 9 to 25%. An A1C range of 6.0–6.5% had a 5-year risk of developing diabetes between 25 and 50% and relative risk 20 times higher compared with an A1C of 5.0%. In a community-based study of black and white adults without diabetes, baseline A1C was a stronger predictor of subsequent diabetes and cardiovascular events than was fasting glucose. Other analyses suggest that an A1C of 5.7% is associated with similar diabetes risk to the high-risk participants in the DPP. Hence, it is reasonable to consider an A1C range of 5.7–6.4% as identifying individuals with high risk for future diabetes, to whom the term prediabetes may be applied.

Standards of Care in Diabetes-2025 — A1C clinical characteristics note that "A1C has several advantages compared with FPG and OGTT, including greater convenience (fasting is not required), greater preanalytical stability, and fewer day-to-day perturbations during stress, changes in nutrition, or illness", yet there is "lower sensitivity of A1C at the designated cut point compared with an FPG of 126 mg/dL". A1C reflects erythrocyte life span "(~120 days)" yielding a weighted average, and "clinically meaningful changes in A1C can be seen in < 120 days".

Asymptomatic adults — screening approach — Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes risk through a targeted assessment of risk factors or with an assessment tool, such as the ADA risk test, is recommended to guide whether performing a diagnostic test is appropriate. Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes meet criteria for conditions in which early detection via screening is appropriate, simple tests to detect preclinical disease are readily available, and the duration of glycemic burden is a strong predictor of adverse outcomes.

CATEGORIES OF INCREASED RISK FOR DIABETES

In 1997 and 2003, the Expert Committee on Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus recognized an intermediate group of individuals whose glucose levels do not meet criteria for diabetes, yet are higher than those considered normal. These people were defined as having impaired fasting glucose (IFG) [fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) to 125 mg/dl (6.9 mmol/l)], or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) [2-h values in the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) of 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) to 199 mg/dl (11.0 mmol/l)].

Individuals with IFG and/or IGT have been referred to as having prediabetes, indicating the relatively high risk for the future development of diabetes. IFG and IGT should not be viewed as clinical entities in their own right but rather risk factors for diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease. They can be observed as intermediate stages in any of the disease processes listed in Table 1. IFG and IGT are associated with obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension. Structured lifestyle intervention, aimed at increasing physical activity and producing 5–10% loss of body weight, and certain pharmacological agents have been demonstrated to prevent or delay the development of diabetes in people with IGT; the potential impact of such interventions to reduce mortality or the incidence of cardiovascular disease has not been demonstrated to date. It should be noted that the 2003 ADA Expert Committee report reduced the lower FPG cut point to define IFG from 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) to 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l), in part to ensure that prevalence of IFG was similar to that of IGT. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) and many other diabetes organizations did not adopt this change in the definition of IFG.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113ijYvh]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

American Diabetes Association Standards of Care in Diabetes — diagnostic tests and recommendations state that "Diabetes may be diagnosed based on A1C or plasma glucose criteria", with plasma glucose criteria including the fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h plasma glucose (2-h PG) during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or random glucose accompanied by classic hyperglycemic symptoms or hyperglycemic crises (diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA] and/or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state [HHS]). Recommendation 2.1a (B) directs to "Diagnose diabetes based on A1C or plasma glucose criteria" with these plasma glucose options, and recommendation 2.1b (B) states that "In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia (e.g., hyperglycemic crises), diagnosis requires confirmatory testing"; additionally, "FPG, 2-h PG during 75-g OGTT, and A1C are appropriate for screening and diagnosis".

### A systematic review on quality indicators for tight glycaemic control in critically ill patients: need for an unambiguous indicator reference subset [^113G72bQ]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

The objectives of this study were to systematically identify and summarize quality indicators of tight glycaemic control in critically ill patients, and to inspect the applicability of their definitions.

Methods

We searched in MEDLINE for all studies evaluating a tight glycaemic control protocol and/or quality of glucose control that reported original data from a clinical trial or observational study on critically ill adult patients.

Results

Forty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria; 30 different indicators were extracted and categorized into four nonorthogonal categories: blood glucose zones (for example, 'hypoglycaemia'); blood glucose levels (for example, 'mean blood glucose level'); time intervals (for example, 'time to occurrence of an event'); and protocol characteristics (for example, 'blood glucose sampling frequency'). Hypoglycaemia-related indicators were used in 43 out of 49 studies, acting as a proxy for safety, but they employed many different definitions. Blood glucose level summaries were used in 41 out of 49 studies, reported as means and/or medians during the study period or at a certain time point (for example, the morning blood glucose level or blood glucose level upon starting insulin therapy). Time spent in the predefined blood glucose level range, time needed to reach the defined blood glucose level target, hyperglycaemia-related indicators and protocol-related indicators were other frequently used indicators. Most indicators differ in their definitions even when they are meant to measure the same underlying concept. More importantly, many definitions are not precise, prohibiting their applicability and hence the reproducibility and comparability of research results.

Conclusions

An unambiguous indicator reference subset is necessary. The result of this systematic review can be used as a starting point from which to develop a standard list of well defined indicators that are associated with clinical outcomes or that concur with clinicians' subjective views on the quality of the regulatory process.

Early abnormal glucose metabolism — risk-identifying thresholds are defined as fasting glucose 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L) or A1C 5.9% (41 mmol/mol), which may identify individuals at higher risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes and of later GDM or insulin need, whereas an A1C threshold of 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) has not been shown to be associated with adverse perinatal outcomes.

Table 2.1 — Criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant individuals — Diagnosis can be established by any of the following: A1C ≥ 6.5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol). The test should be performed in a laboratory using a method that is NGSP certified and standardized to the DCCT assay; fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 126 mg/dL (≥ 7.0 mmol/L). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 h; 2-hour plasma glucose (2-h PG) ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The test should be performed as described by the WHO, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water; or, in an individual with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L). Random is any time of the day without regard to time since previous meal. In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, diagnoses require two abnormal results from different tests which may be obtained at the same time (e.g. A1C and FPG), or the same test at two different time points.

Standards of Care in Diabetes-2025 — Table 2.3 contrasts practical attributes of glucose and A1C tests relevant to selection and interpretation. For A1C, the test is "More expensive than glucose and not as widely available globally", is a "Nonfasting test; no participant preparation is needed", and results are "Unaffected by recent food intake, stress, illness, activity". Factors affecting A1C include "Altered erythrocyte turnover (e.g., anemia, iron status, splenectomy, blood loss, transfusion, hemolysis, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, erythropoietin), HIV, cirrhosis, renal failure, dialysis, pregnancy", and interferences "Depends on specific assay: hemoglobin variants, severe hypertriglyceridemia, severe hyperbilirubinemia". For glucose testing, preanalytic stability is "Poor; plasma must be separated immediately or samples must be kept on ice to prevent glycolysis", and A1C "Requires whole-blood sample".

Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes — adult screening and testing recommendations state that testing for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic people should be considered in adults of any age with overweight or obesity who have one or more risk factors; for all people, screening should begin at age 35 years. In people without prediabetes or diabetes after screening, repeat screening recommended at a minimum of 3-year intervals is reasonable, sooner with symptoms or change in risk. To screen for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, PG, 2-h PG during 75-g OGTT, and A1C are appropriate, and when using OGTT as a screening tool, adequate carbohydrate intake (at least 150 g/day) should be assured for 3 days prior to testing.

Developing personalized definitions of interstitial glucose excursions for detecting intraindividual excursions

Study participants were 35–65 years of age with elevated blood glucose in the normal range (HbA1c 5.2–5.6) or prediabetes (HbA1c 5.7–6.4) (Supplementary Table 2). Existing clinical definitions of blood glucose excursions, including 'hyperglycemia' (glucose that is too high) and 'hypoglycemia' (glucose that is too low), are defined at the population level and are largely used to describe glucose excursions in T1D and T2D patients,–; however, these classifications were established for diabetes managementand may not be suitable to explain significant glucose excursions in normoglycemic or prediabetic individuals due to their lower overall fasting glucose levels and lower glucose variability as compared with diabetic individuals. Examples demonstrating this scenario are shown in Fig. 2, where three separate participants had clear glycemic responses to specific behaviors, including sugary food or drink intake (spike in blood sugar) or not eating (drop in blood sugar). These excursions were not sufficiently high or low as to be clinically categorized as hyper- or hypoglycemia and would therefore be considered normal as per the traditional definitions, even though they are high or low compared to the individual's own baseline. Personalized glucose excursion classes (Fig. 2 circles) provide more tailored information about glucose fluctuations and enable self-management and tracking of diet, exercise, and stress-related behaviors that affect blood glucose. Furthermore, the glycemic baseline is also dynamic over time –, so single-valued population-level thresholds to define glucose excursions are inadequate for understanding an individual's deviations over time from their typical state. Thus, we developed three personalized and dynamic designations to categorize each interstitial glucose measurement to indicate the presence and absence of personalized glucose excursions. We denote these categories as PersHigh, PersLow, and PersNorm, which correspond to an interstitial glucose measurement that is greater than, less than, or within one standard deviation of the 24-h personalized mean, respectively (Fig. 3a). These personalized and time-varying calculations account for circadian, intra-, and inter-day variability. Each of the three categories are approximately normally distributed (PersNorm Kolmogorov–Smirnov Normality Test (KS) Statistic = 0.03 (Fig. 3c); PersHigh KS Statistic = 0.05; PersLow KS Statistic = 0.04) (Table 1). The PersHigh distribution is skewed moderately right and is leptokurtic, with more data located at the tails of the distribution rather than around the mean (Fig. 3d, Table 1). PersLow is skewed slightly left and is mesokurtic, with a distribution moderate in breadth and approximately normally distributed (Fig. 3e, Table 1). The wider distribution for PersHigh compared to PersLow likely reflects the fact that there is a wider range of possible hyperglycemic values than hypoglycemic values in our population. Interestingly, there is an overlap in all three distributions between interstitial glucose values of 66–164 mg/dL (Fig. 2b), supporting the idea that what may be considered a normal measurement for one person may actually be a low or high measurement for another person, which also points to the inadequacy of population-level thresholds.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus [^1116JNiy]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

A1C is a widely used marker of chronic glycemia, reflecting average blood glucose levels over a 2- to 3-month period of time. The test plays a critical role in the management of the patient with diabetes, since it correlates well with both microvascular and, to a lesser extent, macrovascular complications and is widely used as the standard biomarker for the adequacy of glycemic management. Prior Expert Committees have not recommended use of the A1C for diagnosis of diabetes, in part due to lack of standardization of the assay. However, A1C assays are now highly standardized so that their results can be uniformly applied both temporally and across populations. In their recent report, an International Expert Committee, after an extensive review of both established and emerging epidemiological evidence, recommended the use of the A1C test to diagnose diabetes, with a threshold of ≥ 6.5%, and ADA affirms this decision. The diagnostic A1C cut point of 6.5% is associated with an inflection point for retinopathy prevalence, as are the diagnostic thresholds for FPG and 2-h PG. The diagnostic test should be performed using a method that is certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) and standardized or traceable to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial reference assay. Point-of-care A1C assays are not sufficiently accurate at this time to use for diagnostic purposes.

There is an inherent logic to using a more chronic versus an acute marker of dysglycemia, particularly since the A1C is already widely familiar to clinicians as a marker of glycemic control. Moreover, the A1C has several advantages to the FPG, including greater convenience, since fasting is not required, evidence to suggest greater preanalytical stability, and less day-to-day perturbations during periods of stress and illness. These advantages, however, must be balanced by greater cost, the limited availability of A1C testing in certain regions of the developing world, and the incomplete correlation between A1C and average glucose in certain individuals. In addition, the A1C can be misleading in patients with certain forms of anemia and hemoglobinopathies, which may also have unique ethnic or geographic distributions. For patients with a hemoglobinopathy but normal red cell turnover, such as sickle cell trait, an A1C assay without interference from abnormal hemoglobins should be used (an updated list is available at). For conditions with abnormal red cell turnover, such as anemias from hemolysis and iron deficiency, the diagnosis of diabetes must employ glucose criteria exclusively.

C. Categories of increased risk for diabetes

In 1997 and 2003, The Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus recognized an intermediate group of individuals whose glucose levels, although not meeting criteria for diabetes, are nevertheless too high to be considered normal. This group was defined as having impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG levels of 100 mg/dl [5.6 mmol/l] to 125 mg/dl [6.9 mmol/l]) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (2-h OGTT values of 140 mg/dl [7.8 mmol/l] to 199 mg/dl [11.0 mmol/l]).

Individuals with IFG and/or IGT have been referred to as having pre-diabetes, indicating the relatively high risk for the future development of diabetes. IFG and IGT should not be viewed as clinical entities in their own right but rather risk factors for diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD). IFG and IGT are associated with obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension. Structured lifestyle intervention, aimed at increasing physical activity and producing 5–10% loss of body weight, and certain pharmacological agents have been demonstrated to prevent or delay the development of diabetes in people with IGT (see Table 7). It should be noted that the 2003 ADA Expert Committee report reduced the lower FPG cut point to define IFG from 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) to 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l), in part to make the prevalence of IFG more similar to that of IGT. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) and many other diabetes organizations did not adopt this change.

Diabetes diagnosis — confirmatory testing and discordance management: Unless there is a clear clinical diagnosis with random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL [≥ 11.1 mmol/L], diagnosis requires confirmation by two abnormal screening test results obtained at the same time or at two different time points. If using samples at two different time points, it is recommended that the second test, which may be either a repeat of the initial test or a different test, be performed in a timely manner; for example, if the A1C is 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and a repeat result is 6.8% (51 mmol/mol), diabetes is confirmed. Two different tests (such as A1C and fasting plasma glucose [FPG]) both above the diagnostic threshold when collected at the same time or at two different time points also confirm the diagnosis. If results from two different tests are discordant, the test result that is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated, and the diagnosis is made based on the confirmatory screening test; for instance, if A1C shows two results ≥ 6.5% [= 48 mmol/mol] but FPG is < 126 mg/dL [< 7.0 mmol/L], the person should nevertheless be considered to have diabetes. If abnormal A1C and FPG results are near diagnostic margins, repeat the test in 3–6 months, and substantial discordance between glucose values and A1C should prompt additional follow-up and consideration of other biomarkers such as fructosamine and glycated albumin for monitoring glycemic management.

C-peptide testing — indications, sampling, and interpretation in insulin-treated individuals: A C-peptide test is only indicated in people receiving insulin treatment, and a random sample with concurrent glucose within 5 h of eating can replace a formal stimulation test for classification; if the result is ≥ 600 pmol/L (≥ 1.8 ng/mL) the circumstances of testing do not matter, whereas if the result is < 600 pmol/L (< 1.8 ng/mL) with concurrent glucose < 4 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL) or possible fasting, consider repeating the test, noting that very low levels (e.g., < 80 pmol/L [< 0.24 ng/mL]) do not need to be repeated; C-peptide values 200–600 pmol/L (0.6–1.8 ng/mL) are indeterminate, C-peptide must be measured prior to insulin discontinuation, and C-peptide should not be tested within 2 weeks of a hyperglycemic emergency.

Diabetes is the extreme manifestation of a spectrum conditions in which the balance of insulin secretion and insulin action (or insulin resistance) has been altered. Loss of euglycemia is caused by relative insulin deficiency in the presence of insulin resistance, or by absolute insulin deficiency. There are related conditions in which an alteration of insulin resistance or beta-cell dysfunction exists, but because of compensation glucose homeostasis has not been lost. The elucidation of the causes of insulin resistance and -cell failure and the attention to the different degrees of insulin deficiency and insulin resistance allow for better diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diabetes and its related conditions.

CONCLUSIONS

Immediate implications

These recommendations have widespread implications. The strategy outlined in Table 2 will finally lead to using a 75-g glucose dose for an OGTT in all clinical settings in or outside of pregnancy. In some regions and/or countries, this represents a substantial change in long-established practices. Glucose testing early in pregnancy to detect overt diabetes and again with a 75-g OGTT at 24–28 weeks' of gestation in all pregnancies not already diagnosed with overt diabetes or GDM by early testing represents fundamental changes in strategies for detection and diagnosis of hyperglycemia in pregnancy. In most areas, using the outcome-linked diagnostic criteria in Table 1 and the detection strategy in Table 2 will substantially increase the frequency of hyperglycemic disorders in pregnancy. However, this is consistent with the high prevalence of obesity and disorders of glucose metabolism in the general population of young adults and with recent reports of a rising prevalence of GDM and preexisting overt diabetes in pregnant women.

Future considerations

In future clinical practice, simpler and more cost-effective strategies that do not require performing an OGTT on most pregnant women may be developed. In the HAPO study, risks of some adverse outcomes were low when FPG was ≤ 4.4 mmol/l (80 mg/dl). However, it was thought that using FPG to potentially identify pregnancies at very low risk for GDM and for adverse outcomes requires further evaluation. Similarly, further evaluation of A1C results from the HAPO study, results from other populations, or new integrated tests of glycemia with a shorter timeframe than A1C might serve this purpose.

The HAPO study was a basic epidemiological investigation that for the first time conclusively identified strong continuous associations of maternal glucose levels below those diagnostic of diabetes with several perinatal outcomes. It was not a clinical trial, but two randomized controlled trials of treatment of mild GDM have been carried out successfully in participants with glucose values that overlap with the thresholds recommended in this report. However, it is likely that additional well-designed randomized controlled trials and other clinical studies will be needed to determine 1) cost-effective therapeutic strategies for treatment of GDM diagnosed by the IADPSG Consensus Panel–recommended criteria; 2) optimal glycemic treatment targets; 3) appropriate follow-up of mothers to determine risks for later development of diabetes, other metabolic disorders, or CVD risk factors; and 4) follow-up of children to assess potential associations of maternal glycemia with long-term risks of obesity, altered glucose metabolism, and CVD risk factors.

### Blood glucose control in the intensive care unit: benefits and risks [^1178Zae3]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Abnormal blood glucose levels are common during critical illness and are associated with outcomes that correspond to a J-shaped curve, the lowest risk associated with normoglycemia. Three proof-of-concept randomized-controlled-trials performed in the surgical, medical, and pediatric intensive care units of the Leuven University Hospital in Belgium demonstrated that maintaining strict age-adjusted normal fasting levels of glycemia (80–110 mg/dl in adults, 70–100 mg/dl in children, 50–80 mg/dl in infants) with intensive insulin therapy reduced morbidity and mortality as compared with tolerating stress hyperglycemia as a potentially beneficial response. Recently, concern has risen about the safety of this intervention, as a multicenter adult study reported an, as yet unexplained, increased mortality with targeting normoglycemia as compared with an intermediate blood glucose level of around 140 mg/dl. This apparent contradiction may be explained by several methodological differences among studies, comprising, among others, different glucose target ranges in the control groups, different feeding policies, and variable accuracy of tools used for glucose measurement and insulin infusion. Hence, efficacy and safety of intensive insulin therapy may be affected by patient-related and ICU setting-related variables. Therefore, no single optimal blood glucose target range for ICU patients can be advocated. It appears safe not to embark on targeting "age-normal" levels in intensive care units (ICUs) that are not equipped to accurately and frequently measure blood glucose, and have not acquired extensive experience with intravenous insulin administration using a customized guideline. A simple fallback position could be to control blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible without evoking unacceptable blood glucose fluctuations, hypoglycemia, and hypokalemia.

Background

Diagnosing diabetes based on the distribution of glucose levels

Historically, the measurement of glucose has been the means of diagnosing diabetes. Type 1 diabetes has a sufficiently characteristic clinical onset, with relatively acute, extreme elevations in glucose concentrations accompanied by symptoms, such that specific blood glucose cut points are not required for diagnosis in most clinical settings. On the other hand, type 2 diabetes has a more gradual onset, with slowly rising glucose levels over time, and its diagnosis has required specified glucose values to distinguish pathologic glucose concentrations from the distribution of glucose concentrations in the nondiabetic population. Virtually every scheme for the classification and diagnosis of diabetes in modern times has relied on the measurement of plasma (or blood or serum) glucose concentrations in timed samples, such as fasting glucose; in casual samples independent of prandial status; or after a standardized metabolic stress test, such as the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).

Early attempts to standardize the definition of diabetes relied on the OGTT, but the performance and interpretation of the test were inconsistent and the number of subjects studied to define abnormal values was very small. Studies in the high-risk Pima Indian population that demonstrated a bimodal distribution of glucose levels following the OGTT helped establish the 2-h value as the diagnostic value of choice, even though most populations had a unimodal distribution of glucose levels. Of note, a bimodal distribution was also seen in the fasting glucose samples in the Pimas and other high-risk populations. However, a discrete fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or 2-h plasma glucose (2HPG) level that separated the bimodal distributions in the Pimas was difficult to identify, with potential FPG and 2HPG cut points ranging from 120 to 160 mg/dl (6.7–8.9 mmol/l) and from 200 to 250 mg/dl (11.1–13.9 mmol/l), respectively.

Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus

Diagnosis of diabetes

This guideline recommends the World Health Organization's (WHO) (1999) the criteria for diagnosis and classification of diabetes, and classification of metabolic status (Table 2): either the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or the 2‐h plasma glucose (2‐h PG) value after a 75‐g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) can be used alone for epidemiological investigations or mass screenings 7. However, the data in China include only the FPG levels, resulting in a larger proportion of diabetes being missed. The ideal investigation should simultaneously check FPG and 2‐h PG after the glucose load; blood glucose levels at other time points after the OGTT are not used as diagnostic criteria.

Table 2
Diagnostic criteria for diabetes and prediabetes

Individuals with impaired fasting glucose should undergo the OGTT to reduce the number of missed diabetes diagnoses.

The issue of using HbA 1c for diabetes diagnosis

The 2010 American Diabetes Association guidelines added glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) ≥ 6.5% as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes 8. In 2011, the WHO also recommended that wherever conditions permit, countries and regions may consider adopting this cut‐off point for diabetes diagnosis 9. However, given that the HbA 1c test is not yet commonly applied in China, the insufficient degree of standardization, and the fact that the instruments and quality control for measuring HbA 1c are currently unable to meet the current diagnostic standard for diabetes, this guideline does not recommend the use of HbA 1c for diagnosis of diabetes in China. Nevertheless, for hospitals that use a standardized HbA 1c assay with a normal reference value of 4.0–6.0% and strict quality control, HbA 1c ≥ 6.5% can be used as a reference when diagnosing diabetes.

Classification of diabetes mellitus

This guideline adopts the diabetes aetiology classification system proposed by the WHO (1999), which divides diabetes into four major categories based on aetiological evidence, that is, T1DM, T2DM, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and special types of diabetes.

Table 2.5 — Criteria for screening for diabetes or prediabetes in asymptomatic adults — testing should be considered in adults with overweight or obesity (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 or ≥ 23 kg/m2 in individuals of Asian ancestry) who have one or more risk factors such as hypertension (≥ 130/80 mmHg or on therapy for hypertension) and dyslipidemia with HDL cholesterol level < 35 mg/dL and/or triglyceride level > 250 mg/dL. People with prediabetes (A1C ≥ 5.7% [≥ 39 mmol/mol], IGT, or IFG) should be tested yearly; people who were diagnosed with GDM should have testing at least every 1–3 years. For all other people, testing should begin at age 35 years, and if results are normal, testing should be repeated at a minimum of 3-year intervals with consideration of more frequent testing depending on initial results and risk status. Individuals in other high-risk groups (e.g., people with HIV, exposure to high-risk medications, evidence of periodontal disease, history of pancreatitis) should also be closely monitored.

Early screening follow-up and diagnostic scope — if early screenings for undiagnosed diabetes or early abnormal glucose metabolism are negative, individuals should be rescreened for GDM between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation, and those not previously screened should be screened at the same time point; diagnostic thresholds developed for the 75-g OGTT and the two-step approach were not derived from the first half of pregnancy and should not be used for early screening.

### Impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glycaemia: the current status on definition and intervention [^114dkxDC]. Diabetic Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

A workshop was convened by the International Diabetes Federation to review the latest information relating to the risks associated with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) for future diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The workshop sought to address three questions: (i) are the current definitions of IGT and IFG appropriate; (ii) are IFG and IGT risk factors, risk markers or diseases; (iii) what interventions (if any) should be recommended for people with IFG and IGT? The determinants of elevated fasting glucose and 2-h plasma glucose in an oral glucose tolerance test (2-HPG) levels differ. Raised hepatic glucose output and a defect in early insulin secretion are characteristic of the former, and peripheral insulin resistance is most characteristic of the latter. Therefore, it is not surprising that the concordance between the categories of IFG and IGT is limited. In all prevalence studies to date only half or less of people with IFG have IGT, and even a lower proportion (20–30%) with IGT also have IFG. In the majority of populations studied, IGT is more prevalent than IFG, and there is a difference in phenotype and gender distribution between the two categories. IFG is substantially more common amongst men and IGT slightly more common amongst women. The prevalence of IFG tends to plateau in middle age whereas the prevalence of IGT rises into old age. Both IFG and IGT are associated with a substantially increased risk of developing diabetes, with the highest risk in people with combined IFG and IGT. Because IGT is commoner than IFG in most populations it is more sensitive (but slightly less specific) for identifying people who will develop diabetes. In most populations studied, 60% of people who develop diabetes have either IGT or IFG 5 years or so before, with the other 40% having normal glucose tolerance at that time. The limited published data suggest that both isolated IFG (I-IFG) and isolated IGT (I-IGT) are similarly associated with cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidaemia, with the highest risk in those with combined IFG and IGT. However, some data have suggested that I-IGT is more strongly associated with hypertension and dyslipidaemia (features of the metabolic syndrome) than I-IFG. In unadjusted analyses both IFG and IGT are associated with CVD and total mortality. In separate analyses for fasting and 2-HPG adjusted for other cardiovascular risk factors (from the DECODE study) there remains a continuous relationship between 2-HPG and mortality, but an independent relationship with fasting glucose is only found above 7.0 mmol/l. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels are continuously and positively associated with CVD and total mortality independent of other CVD risk factors. Life style interventions, including weight loss and increased physical activity, are highly effective in preventing or delaying the onset of diabetes in people with IGT. Two randomized controlled trials of individuals with IGT found that life style intervention studies reduce the risk of progressing to diabetes by 58%. The oral hypoglycaemic drugs metformin and acarbose have also been shown to be effective, but less so than the life style measures. Similar data do not yet exist for the effectiveness of such interventions in people with I-IFG. Larger studies are required to evaluate the effects of interventions on cardiovascular outcomes in people with IGT. Cost effective strategies to identify people with IGT for intervention should be developed and evaluated. The use of simple risk scores to assess who should undergo an oral glucose tolerance test is one promising approach, although these will need to be population-specific. In conclusion, IGT and IFG differ in their prevalence, population distribution, phenotype, and risk of total mortality and CVD. The consensus of the workshop was: 1. The diagnostic thresholds for all categories of glucose intolerance should be revisited in the light of the latest evidence. There was no clear consensus (with current evidence) on whether IFG and IGT should be classified as diseases, but they clearly represent risk factors and risk markers for diabetes and CVD, respectively. 2. Both IGT and IFG are similarly associated with an increased risk of diabetes, but IGT is more strongly associated with CVD outcomes. 3. Risks are higher when IGT and IFG coexist. 4. Life style interventions are highly effective in delaying or preventing the onset of diabetes in people with IGT and may reduce CVD and total mortality, but the latter requires formal testing.

### Individualized glycemic goals and an expanded classification of severe hypoglycemia in diabetes [^1165kU15]. Diabetes Care (2017). Low credibility.

The view that a hemoglobin A 1c (A1C) level < 7% (55 mmol/mol) is the accepted glycemic goal for most people with diabetes sometimes conflicts with the view that glycemic goals should be individualized and, thus, that somewhat higher A1C levels are appropriate for some, particularly many at risk for iatrogenic hypoglycemia because of treatment with insulin, a sulfonylurea, or a glinide. The relationship between A1C and chronic complications of diabetes is curvilinear, A1C is a relatively weak predictor of cardiovascular disease, and minor elevations of A1C above 7% have not been found to be associated with increased mortality. Iatrogenic hypoglycemia causes recurrent morbidity in diabetes and is sometimes fatal. In those at risk for hypoglycemia, a reasonable individualized glycemic goal is the lowest A1C that does not cause severe hypoglycemia and preserves awareness of hypoglycemia, preferably with little or no symptomatic or even asymptomatic hypoglycemia, at a given stage in the evolution of the individual's diabetes. A somewhat higher A1C level is appropriate in those who have previously experienced hypoglycemia or have potential high risk for hypoglycemia, have a long duration of diabetes, and have a short life expectancy, among other traits. Given the importance of severe hypoglycemia in selecting glycemic goals, it is proposed to expand the classification of severe hypoglycemia beyond a hypoglycemic event requiring assistance from another person to include a measured glucose concentration < 50 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L), a level associated with sudden death.

### Reframing prediabetes: a call for better risk stratification and intervention [^111VxgLJ]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Prediabetes is an intermediate state of glucose homeostasis whereby plasma glucose concentrations are above normal but below the threshold of diagnosis for diabetes. Over the last several decades, criteria for prediabetes have changed as the cut points for normal glucose concentration and diagnosis of diabetes have shifted. Global consensus does not exist for prediabetes criteria; as a result, the clinical course and risk for type 2 diabetes vary. At present, we can identify individuals with prediabetes based on three glycemic tests (hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose, and 2-h plasma glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test). The majority of individuals diagnosed with prediabetes meet only one of these criteria. Meeting one, two, or all glycemic criteria changes risk for type 2 diabetes, but this information is not widely known and does not currently guide intervention strategies for individuals with prediabetes. This review summarizes current epidemiology, prognosis, and intervention strategies for individuals diagnosed with prediabetes and suggests a call for more precise risk stratification of individuals with prediabetes as elevated (one prediabetes criterion), high risk (two prediabetes criteria), and very high risk (three prediabetes criteria). In addition, the roles of oral glucose tolerance testing and continuous glucose monitoring in the diagnostic criteria for prediabetes need reassessment. Finally, we must reframe our goals for prediabetes and prioritize intensive interventions for those at high and very high risk for type 2 diabetes.

Table 2.4 — Staging of type 1 diabetes defines three stages by autoimmunity and glycemia. Stage 1 includes autoimmunity with normoglycemia and is presymptomatic, with multiple islet autoantibodies and no impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG), normal A1C. Stage 2 includes autoimmunity with dysglycemia and is presymptomatic; diagnostic criteria include islet autoantibodies (usually multiple) plus dysglycemia defined by IFG: FPG 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L), or IGT: 2-h PG 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L), or A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) or ≥ 10% increase in A1C. Stage 3 includes autoimmunity with overt hyperglycemia and symptomatic disease; diagnostic criteria are diabetes by standard criteria, and autoantibodies may become absent. Alternate additional stage 2 criteria used in trials are 30-, 60-, or 90-min plasma glucose on oral glucose tolerance test ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L) with confirmatory testing in those aged ≥ 18 years; dysglycemia can be defined by one or more criteria.

Fasting or 2-hour plasma glucose testing — In individuals without symptoms, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or 2-hour plasma glucose (2-h PG) can be used for screening and diagnosis of diabetes, while measurement of random plasma glucose is sufficient to diagnose diabetes when symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis are present plus random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL [≥ 11.1 mmol/L]. In nonpregnant individuals, FPG (or A1C) is typically preferred for routine screening due to the ease of administration; however, the 2-h PG (OGTT) testing protocol diagnoses more diabetes than the other two tests and is preferentially recommended for screening for some conditions (e.g., cystic fibrosis-related diabetes or posttransplantation diabetes mellitus). Individuals may have difficulty fasting for the full 8-h period or may misreport their fasting status, and glycolysis and sample handling can affect results; people should follow a mixed eating pattern with at least 150 g of carbohydrates on the 3 days prior to OGTT, and antecedent carbohydrate restriction in the days prior to OGTT can falsely elevate postchallenge glucose levels, potentially resulting in a false-positive OGTT.

Alternative OR/threshold combinations.

Consideration was given to glucose values and outcome frequencies for adjusted ORs of 1.5 and 2.0. The threshold OR of 1.5 identified 25% of the cohort with one or more glucose values that met or exceeded the threshold. The proportion of the cohort with FPG equal to or greater than threshold at ORs of 1.5, 1.75, or 2.0 (5.0, 5.1, and 5.3 mmol/l or 90, 92, or 95 mg/dl, respectively) differed substantially, representing ∼12, 8, and 4%, respectively. At ORs of 2.0, frequencies of birth weight, cord serum C-peptide, or percent infant body fat > 90th percentile in those meeting threshold were modestly higher than those for OR 1.75 (supplemental Table B), but the number of participants meeting threshold decreased from 16.1 to 8.8%, meaning that the higher thresholds would fail to identify many cases with nearly comparable risk of adverse outcomes.

Rounding threshold values to easy-to-remember numbers.

Values such as 5.0 and 9.0 mmol/l (90 and 155 mg/dl, respectively) for FPG and 2-h plasma glucose would be somewhat easier to remember than those indicated in Table 1. However, this strategy is not feasible. First, as indicated above, arbitrarily choosing an FPG threshold of 5.0 mmol/l (90 mg/dl) would substantially affect the proportion of women meeting a diagnostic threshold. Second, both S i and standard units are widely used, and the numbers are not equally easy or difficult to remember for both units of measure. The values in Table 1 represent the best choice from a clinical perspective, and they meet the predefined strength of association from an epidemiological perspective.

### Diagnosis, classification, and pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus [^111SNLff]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that is characterized by inappropriate hyperglycemia and is associated with both acute and chronic complications. Currently, diabetes mellitus is diagnosed by blood or plasma glucose levels. A random plasma glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL in an individual with classic symptoms is sufficient to make the diagnosis. Otherwise, a fasting plasma glucose level ≥ 126 mg/dL or a 2-hour plasma glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL after an oral glucose challenge of 75 g on 2 occasions is sufficient evidence upon which to diagnose diabetes mellitus. The major types of diabetes mellitus are type 1 diabetes (insulin deficient) and type 2 diabetes (combination of insulin resistance and insulin deficiency). In both types, there is a genetic predisposition as well as environmental factors that contribute to the expression of the genetic predisposition. In type 1 diabetes, the primary abnormality is extensive deficiency of beta cell function. In type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance occurs, and the marked compensatory increases in insulin secretion necessary to maintain normal glucose tolerance cannot be achieved or maintained. As beta cell function continues to decrease, the individual progresses from normal glucose tolerance to impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes with primarily postprandial hyperglycemia to diabetes with fasting hyperglycemia. Drugs can cause diabetes by interfering with beta cell insulin secretion, by increasing insulin resistance, or by a combination of both. Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been reported to cause diabetic ketoacidosis, obesity and insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia. A monitoring system should be in place in patients started on treatment with these agents to detect metabolic abnormalities as they are evolving so that adequate and timely treatment can be initiated.

Type 1 diabetes — autoantibody natural history and early detection highlight that the persistent presence of two or more islet autoantibodies is a near-certain predictor of clinical diabetes; in at-risk cohorts followed from birth or a very young age, seroconversion rarely occurs before 6 months of age with a peak between 9 and 24 months of age; and glucose and A1C changes (e.g., changes in fasting plasma glucose [FPG] or 2-h plasma glucose [2-h PG]) can occur about 6 months before diagnosis, enabling diagnosis before clinical onset.

4. Interpretation

Despite the low analytical imprecision at the diagnostic decision limits of 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) and 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), classification errors may occur. Knowledge of intraindividual (within-person) variation in FPG concentrations is essential for meaningful interpretation of patient values (although total biological variation includes within-person and between-person variation, most discussions focus on the within-person variation). An early study, which repeated the OGTT in 31 nondiabetic adults at a 48-h interval, revealed that the FPG concentration varied between the 2 values by < 10% in 22 participants (77%) and by < 20% in 30 participants (97%). A careful evaluation of healthy individuals over several consecutive days revealed that the biological variation in FPG [mean glucose, 4.9 mmol/L (88 mg/dL)] exhibited within- and between-individual CVs of 4.8%–6.1% and 7.5%–7.8%, respectively. Larger studies have revealed intraindividual CVs of 4.8% and 7.1% for FPG in 246 healthy individuals and 80 previously undiagnosed individuals with diabetes, respectively. Similar findings were obtained from an analysis of 685 adults from NHANES III, in which the mean within-person variation in FPG measured 2–4 weeks apart was 5.7% (95% CI, 5.3%–6.1%). An analysis of larger numbers of individuals from the same NHANES III database yielded within- and between-person CVs of 8.3% and 12.5%, respectively, at a glucose concentration of approximately 5.1 mmol/L (92 mg/dL). If a within-person biological CV of 5.7% is applied to a true glucose concentration of 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL), the 95% CI would encompass glucose concentrations of 6.2–7.8 mmol/L (112–140 mg/dL). If the analytical CV of the glucose assay (approximately 3%) is included, the 95% CI is approximately ± 12.88%. Thus, the 95% CI for a fasting glucose concentration of 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) would be 7.0 mmol/L ± 6.4% (126 mg/dL ± 6.4%), i.e. 6.1–7.9 mmol/L (110–142 mg/dL). Use of an assay CV of 3% only (excluding biological variation) would yield a 95% CI of 6.6–7.4 mmol/L (118–134 mg/dL) among laboratories, for a true glucose concentration of 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL). Performing the same calculations at the cutoff for impaired fasting glucose yields a 95% CI of 5.6 mmol/L ± 6.4% (100 mg/dL ± 6.4%), i.e. 4.9–6.3 mmol/L (87–113 mg/dL). One should bear in mind that these intervals include 95% of the results and that the remaining 5% will be outside this interval. Thus, the biological variation is substantially greater than the analytical variation. Using biological variation as the basis for deriving analytical performance characteristics, Westgard proposed the following desirable specifications for glucose: analytical imprecision, ≤ 2.9%; bias, ≤ 2.2%; and total error, ≤ 6.9%.

### Brazilian guideline for screening and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes: a position statement from the Brazilian diabetes society [^112QexWM]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

How to screen for type 2 diabetes and prediabetes:

R3: For the diagnosis of T2D, it is RECOMMENDED to use Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG), HbA1c, 1-h OGTT or 2 h-OGTT. The diagnostic criteria are FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL, HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, 1-h OGTT glucose ≥ 209 mg/dL, or 2-h OGTT glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (Table 4).

Table 4
Criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes:

Summary of evidence:
In 1997, The Report of the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes defined the FPG and 2-h OGTT (2 h-OGTT) cutoffs for diagnosing diabetes and prediabetes based on three population cohorts that assessed the association between glycemic levels and the development of diabetic retinopathy.
A cohort study demonstrated a continuous relationship between glycemic levels and the development of diabetic retinopathy. However, a threshold differentiates individuals at higher risk for diabetes-related complications from those at lower risk, which establishes the diagnostic cutoff for diabetes. Notably, this threshold is inconsistent across studies, and variations in retinopathy prevalence between populations may partly account for the differing thresholds. These variations highlight the need for population-specific research to understand better the optimal thresholds for diagnosing and managing diabetes-related complications like retinopathy.
The Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration study, which evaluated 121 prospective studies involving 1.27 million adults with individual records of cardiovascular complications, showed that in individuals without a history of diabetes, the risk of coronary heart disease was significantly higher in those with FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL compared to those with FPG ≤ 100 mg/dL. Known diabetes diagnosis or FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL, regardless of other factors, doubled the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and vascular-related deaths.
FPG and HbA1c are complementary measures, as subjects may have elevated levels of one or both biomarkers. FPG reflects glucose homeostasis in the post-absorptive state, and HbA1c reflects average glycemia over 2–3 months. The FPG value is strongly correlated with the HbA1c value.
The use of HbA1c ≥ 6.5% as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes was suggested in 2009 by the International Expert Committee based on population studies that evaluated fasting glucose and 2 h-OGTT. An analysis of data from nine studies across five countries, with 44,623 participants aged 20 to 79 years, showed an increased odds ratio (OR) between HbA1c levels and the presence of diabetic retinopathy (OR for HbA1c 6.5–6.9% vs HbA1c 4–4.4% = 16.8 [95% CI: 2.3–123.7]; p = 0.01).
The HbA1c cutoff of 6.5% has a sensitivity (Se) of 47–67% and a specificity (Sp) of 98–99% for diagnosing diabetes, compared to the 2 h-OGTT. Brazilian data also corroborate the low Se and high Sp of HbA1c for diagnosing diabetes relative to the 2 h-OGTT.
A meta-analysis of 17 studies evaluating the accuracy of HbA1c and FPG for diabetes diagnosis, using the 2 h-OGTT as the gold standard, showed that the Se, Sp, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of HbA1c ≥ 6.5% were 50% (95% CI 42–59%), 97.3% (95% CI 95.3–98.4), 18.3% (95% CI 11.1–30.5), and 51% (95% CI 43–60%), respectively. For FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL, the respective values were 59.4% (95% CI 46.6–71%), 98.8% (95% CI 96.5–99.6%), 47.82% (95% CI 19.1–119.7%), and 41.1% (95% CI 30.5–55.5%).
HbA1c levels may also vary according to ethnicity and the studied population due to factors independent of medication adherence and access to healthcare, like differences in red cell survival, intra and extracellular glucose balance, and genetic determinants of hemoglobin glycation. African-descendant individuals may have higher HbA1c levels than expected for their glycemic profile, resulting in false-positive diabetes diagnoses.
The HbA1c measurement can avoid the risk of intra-individual variability observed in plasma glucose (PG) measurements and the need to fast. The values of HbA1c, regardless of the methodology used, may not be reliable in the presence of some conditions that alter the life expectancy of erythrocytes (for example, the use of erythropoietin, hemolytic anemia), severe iron deficiency anemia, and recent blood transfusions. Sickle cell anemia or other hemoglobin variants, such as fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and hemoglobins S, C, D, and E, can also interfere with HbA1c results. The factors that may interfere in the glycation of hemoglobin and, therefore, may limit the use of HbA1c for the diagnosis of diabetes are summarized in Table 5. To use HbA1c values as a diagnostic tool for diabetes, it is necessary to employ the global standardization method proposed by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP).
Recently, an IDF expert committee re-evaluated the accuracy and applicability of the 1 h-OGTT for diagnosing prediabetes and diabetes. 1 h-OGTT is more practical than 2 h-OGTT. A meta-analysis of 15 studies, with 35,551 individuals of Caucasian, Native American, Asian, and Mexican American descent, identified that the 1 h-OGTT cutoff of 209 mg/dl is equivalent to the 2 h-OGTT cutoff of 200 mg/dl for diagnosing diabetes. The IDF recommends that 1 h-OGTT glucose ≥ 209 mg/dl should be a criterion for diagnosing diabetes.
All diagnostic methods have methodological limitations. FPG requires fasting, can be affected by acute conditions, and has lower reproducibility than HbA1c. The OGTT is more costly, uncomfortable, and time-consuming, but has higher Se. For its use, a diet including at least 150 g of carbohydrates per day is required for three days before the test. HbA1c is more expensive, does not account for individual variability in the protein glycation process, and has lower diagnostic Se than other methods.
Diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes have not been investigated specifically in children and adolescents and are based on adult definitions. However, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is recognized by the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) as a valid diagnostic tool. Kim et al. evaluated 190 children and adolescents with obesity or asymptomatic glucosuria who underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to assess the accuracy of HbA1c as a diagnostic tool for diabetes. The study concluded that an HbA1c threshold of ≥ 6.5% was appropriate for diagnosing type 2 diabetes in this population, although the ideal cutoff was identified as 6.15%. A study involving a multiethnic cohort of 1,156 children and adolescents with obesity assessed the utility of HbA1c for diagnosing diabetes and associated risks. Participants underwent HbA1c measurement and a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (2 h-OGTT), with 218 followed up for approximately two years. Results showed that 47% of those with HbA1c levels in the "at risk" range (5.7–6.4%) and 62% with HbA1c ≥ 6.5% were classified as having prediabetes or diabetes by 2 h-OGTT. The optimal HbA1c threshold for detecting diabetes was 5.8% (78% specificity, 68% sensitivity), while a 1% increase in baseline HbA1c was associated with a 13-fold higher risk of prediabetes or diabetes. This study indicates that HbA1c can be a useful clinical tool for identifying T2D when combined with FPG and 2 h-PG. However, relying solely on HbA1c for diagnosing prediabetes and T2D may be insufficient, to avoid missed or delayed identification. Although a lower cutoff might be more appropriate for this age group, setting the HbA1c threshold at 6.5% for diagnosing diabetes, in conjunction with other criteria, is unlikely to result in an excessive number of inappropriate diabetes diagnoses.
A longitudinal study (1965–2007) of a high-risk Indigenous American cohort examined the relationship between childhood HbA1c, 2 h-PG levels, and diabetes-related complications. Children with overweight and obesity that had HbA1c compatible with pre-diabetes levels had a higher incidence of retinopathy than those with normal HbA1c (7.9 vs. 2.5 cases per 1,000 person-years; risk difference 5.4; P = 0.002). Elevated HbA1c levels, analyzed as a continuous variable, were also significantly linked to increased retinopathy risk (HR 1.53 per %). While A1c, 2 h-PG, and FPG were similarly effective in predicting albuminuria, 2 h-PG slightly outperformed HbA1c in predicting retinopathy (AUC 0.73 vs. 0.69; P = 0.046). Overall, higher childhood glycemia was associated with an increased risk of albuminuria and retinopathy.

### Inadequacies of absolute threshold levels for diagnosing prediabetes [^112Zcqz7]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Prediabetes comprising Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) and Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) represents an intermediate stage of altered glucose metabolism between normal glucose levels and type 2 diabetes mellitus and is associated with an increased risk for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. There is considerable evidence that glucose levels lower than those meeting the current definition of prediabetes may also be associated with similar risks particularly in high-risk individuals. Prediabetes is often unrecognized and therefore constitutes a major public health concern suggesting the need for earlier intervention than is currently recommended.

QUESTION 2: WHAT GLYCEMIC TARGETS CAN BE RECOMMENDED IN DIFFERENT PATIENT POPULATIONS?

The management of hyperglycemia in the hospital presents unique challenges that stem from variations in a patient's nutritional status and level of consciousness, the practical limitations of intermittent glycemic monitoring, and the ultimate importance of patient safety. Accordingly, reasonable glucose targets in the hospital setting are modestly higher than may be routinely advised for patients with diabetes in the outpatient setting.

Definition of glucose abnormalities

In this report, hyperglycemia is defined as any BG value > 140 mg/dl (> 7.8 mmol/l). Levels that are significantly and persistently above this level may necessitate treatment in hospitalized patients. In patients without a previous diagnosis of diabetes, elevated BG concentrations may be due to stress hyperglycemia, a condition that can be established by a review of prior medical records or measurement of A1C. A1C values of > 6.5–7.0% suggest that diabetes preceded hospitalization.

Hypoglycemia is defined as any BG level < 70 mg/dl (< 3.9 mmol/l). This is the standard definition in outpatients and correlates with the initial threshold for the release of counterregulatory hormones. Severe hypoglycemia in hospitalized patients has been defined by many clinicians as < 40 mg/dl (< 2.2 mmol/l), although this value is lower than the approximate 50 mg/dl (2.8 mmol/l) level at which cognitive impairment begins in normal individuals. As with hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia among inpatients is also associated with adverse short-term and long-term outcomes. Early recognition and treatment of mild to moderate hypoglycemia (40 and 69 mg/dl [2.2 and 3.8 mmol/l], respectively) can prevent deterioration to a more severe episode with potential adverse sequelae.

Table 1
Threshold values for diagnosis of GDM or overt diabetes in pregnancy

Adjusted ORs and 95% CIs for associations between maternal glucose and HAPO study outcomes are in supplemental Table A. ORs are for the difference in glucose between the mean glucose value and the recommended threshold. In addition to the outcomes used to determine the thresholds, there were strong associations between maternal glucose and preeclampsia (ORs 1.40–1.57) and shoulder dystocia and/or birth injury (1.30–1.43).

The frequencies of HAPO study outcomes when all three glucose measures were below threshold values and when any one or more values were greater than or equal to threshold concentration were compared (supplemental Table B). The frequency of birth weight, C-peptide, or percent infant body fat > 90th percentile was approximately twofold greater when any of the glucose values were greater than or equal to the threshold. The frequency of preeclampsia was twofold higher when one or more glucose values met or exceeded threshold, and frequencies of preterm delivery and primary cesarean section were > 45% higher.

Other considerations

Measurement of glucose.

The frequencies and ORs for outcomes on which the recommended diagnostic thresholds are based increase substantially over relatively small changes in glucose concentration (supplemental Fig. 1 and Table A). Therefore, to achieve reliable diagnosis and classification of hyperglycemia in pregnancy, clinical laboratories must measure venous plasma or serum glucose using an enzymatic method with high accuracy and precision. This includes proper sample collection and processing to minimize pre-analytic glycolysis and proper laboratory analysis. Capillary and venous plasma glucose concentrations differ and are not interchangeable, and conversion factors do not accurately estimate equivalent values.

Testing high-risk adults for prediabetes is warranted because the laboratory assessment is safe and reasonable in cost.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes is a growing global public health concern, affecting over 537 million individuals worldwide — over 90% of whom have type 2 diabetes. Even more people are affected by pre‐diabetes, an intermediate stage between normoglycaemia and diabetes, although the introduction of this term has caused some concerns about over‐diagnosis and over‐treatment. Detection of diabetes and pre‐diabetes aims to identify individuals at increased risk of macrovascular (e.g. cardiovascular disease) and microvascular complications (e.g. retinopathy) and inform subsequent interventions, including pharmacological treatment. The diagnostic criteria for diabetes have been revised several times over the past few decades. Two‐hour post‐load glucose (2hPG) was first used to diagnose diabetes, and then fasting blood glucose (FPG) and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) were added to the diagnostic criteria. Likewise, the criteria for diagnosing pre‐diabetes include impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and elevated HbA1c. According to the latest guidelines of the American Diabetes Association (ADA), a diagnosis of diabetes or pre‐diabetes can be made when any of these glycaemic indicators exceed their respective thresholds. Although diagnostic practice in other countries or populations may vary in terms of the more commonly used diagnostic measures (e.g. whether HbA1c testing is preferred), the cutoffs adopted (e.g. the lower thresholds of FPG and HbA1c for diagnosing pre‐diabetes) and diagnostic rigour (e.g. whether repeat testing is required if the first testing is positive), most countries' guidelines recommend that 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c can all be used for the diagnosis of diabetes and pre‐diabetes. The increase in the number of diagnostic measures would inevitably increase the number of new cases and prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes, because the test results of different diagnostic measures do not align with each other perfectly. For example, in the case of isolated FPG elevation, the FPG level exceeds the diagnostic threshold for diabetes, while 2hPG and HbA1c are 'normal'

### Clinical review: consensus recommendations on measurement of blood glucose and reporting glycemic control in critically ill adults [^115S7sM1]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

The management reporting and assessment of glycemic control lacks standardization. The use of different methods to measure the blood glucose concentration and to report the performance of insulin treatment yields major disparities and complicates the interpretation and comparison of clinical trials. We convened a meeting of 16 experts plus invited observers from industry to discuss and where possible reach consensus on the most appropriate methods to measure and monitor blood glucose in critically ill patients and on how glycemic control should be assessed and reported. Where consensus could not be reached, recommendations on further research and data needed to reach consensus in the future were suggested. Recognizing their clear conflict of interest, industry observers played no role in developing the consensus or recommendations from the meeting. Consensus recommendations were agreed for the measurement and reporting of glycemic control in clinical trials and for the measurement of blood glucose in clinical practice. Recommendations covered the following areas: How should we measure and report glucose control when intermittent blood glucose measurements are used? What are the appropriate performance standards for intermittent blood glucose monitors in the ICU? Continuous or automated intermittent glucose monitoring - methods and technology: can we use the same measures for assessment of glucose control with continuous and intermittent monitoring? What is acceptable performance for continuous glucose monitoring systems? If implemented, these recommendations have the potential to minimize the discrepancies in the conduct and reporting of clinical trials and to improve glucose control in clinical practice. Furthermore, to be fit for use, glucose meters and continuous monitoring systems must match their performance to fit the needs of patients and clinicians in the intensive care setting.

### Effects of diabetes definition on global surveillance of diabetes prevalence and diagnosis: a pooled analysis of 96 population-based studies with 331, 288 participants [^113kerW5]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Diabetes has been defined on the basis of different biomarkers, including fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h plasma glucose in an oral glucose tolerance test (2hOGTT), and HbA 1c. We assessed the effect of different diagnostic definitions on both the population prevalence of diabetes and the classification of previously undiagnosed individuals as having diabetes versus not having diabetes in a pooled analysis of data from population-based health examination surveys in different regions.

Methods

We used data from 96 population-based health examination surveys that had measured at least two of the biomarkers used for defining diabetes. Diabetes was defined using HbA 1c (HbA 1c ≥ 6·5% or history of diabetes diagnosis or using insulin or oral hypoglycaemic drugs) compared with either FPG only or FPG-or-2hOGTT definitions (FPG ≥ 7·0 mmol/L or 2hOGTT ≥ 11·1 mmol/L or history of diabetes or using insulin or oral hypoglycaemic drugs). We calculated diabetes prevalence, taking into account complex survey design and survey sample weights. We compared the prevalences of diabetes using different definitions graphically and by regression analyses. We calculated sensitivity and specificity of diabetes diagnosis based on HbA 1c compared with diagnosis based on glucose among previously undiagnosed individuals (ie, excluding those with history of diabetes or using insulin or oral hypoglycaemic drugs). We calculated sensitivity and specificity in each survey, and then pooled results using a random-effects model. We assessed the sources of heterogeneity of sensitivity by meta-regressions for study characteristics selected a priori.

Findings

Population prevalence of diabetes based on FPG-or-2hOGTT was correlated with prevalence based on FPG alone (r = 0·98), but was higher by 2–6 percentage points at different prevalence levels. Prevalence based on HbA 1c was lower than prevalence based on FPG in 42·8% of age–sex–survey groups and higher in another 41·6%; in the other 15·6%, the two definitions provided similar prevalence estimates. The variation across studies in the relation between glucose-based and HbA 1c -based prevalences was partly related to participants' age, followed by natural logarithm of per person gross domestic product, the year of survey, mean BMI, and whether the survey population was national, subnational, or from specific communities. Diabetes defined as HbA 1c 6·5% or more had a pooled sensitivity of 52·8% (95% CI 51·3–54·3%) and a pooled specificity of 99·74% (99·71–99·78%) compared with FPG 7·0 mmol/L or more for diagnosing previously undiagnosed participants; sensitivity compared with diabetes defined based on FPG-or-2hOGTT was 30·5% (28·7–32·3%). None of the preselected study-level characteristics explained the heterogeneity in the sensitivity of HbA 1c versus FPG.

Interpretation

Different biomarkers and definitions for diabetes can provide different estimates of population prevalence of diabetes, and differentially identify people without previous diagnosis as having diabetes. Using an HbA 1c -based definition alone in health surveys will not identify a substantial proportion of previously undiagnosed people who would be considered as having diabetes using a glucose-based test.

### Should prediabetes be treated pharmacologically? [^114s1n2M]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Summary Points

Prediabetes is a dysglycemia with glycemic values between normal and those that define diabetes. People with prediabetes are characterized by decreased insulin sensitivity (insulin resistance) and impaired insulin secretion that cannot meet the extra demands on the pancreatic beta cells imposed by the insulin resistance. Prediabetes increases the risk for the subsequent development of diabetes. This risk begins with a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration of 4.6–4.8 mmol/L and increases in a curvilinear manner, with the chances of developing diabetes progressively rising the closer the dysglycemia is to the diagnostic criteria for diabetes.

The criteria for the diagnosis of prediabetes differs between the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the international community (Table 1). Moreover, in contrast to the recommendation that the diagnosis of diabetes be confirmed, there is no such recommendation for the diagnosis of prediabetes. This is unfortunate because on a repeat oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) within 2–6 weeks, approximately half of individuals with Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) have a normal result. If the international Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) criterion were used to diagnose prediabetes, 32% were normal on repeat testing. OGTTs are rarely used in clinical practice (except in pregnancy) so the diagnosis of prediabetes rests on FPG and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) testing. Depending on where one lives and the test used for the diagnosis, there is a marked difference in whether an individual will be diagnosed with prediabetes or not. To illustrate using the largest possible difference, the prevalence of prediabetes in the United States diagnosed by a FPG concentration of 5.6–6.9 mmol/L is 37.5% compared with the international prevalence diagnosed by an HbA1c level of 42–46 mmol/mol of 5.8%.

### Changing the definition of impaired fasting glucose: impact on the classification of individuals and risk definition [^113NtDte]. Diabetes Care (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

This study evaluates the impact of lowering the diagnostic threshold for impaired fasting glucose (IFG) from 6.1 to 5.6 mmol/l as proposed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) on the prevalence of the condition, classification of individuals, and risk definition.

Research Design and Methods

A total of 1,285 employees of the Italian Telephone Company aged 35–59 years without known diabetes underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). BMI, serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure were measured. Medication use was recorded.

Results

With the new ADA criterion, the proportion of people diagnosed with IFG increased from 3.2 to 9.7%. The newly proposed IFG category identified 41% of all subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) compared with 16.2% identified with the use of the World Health Organization criterion for IFG; the improvement in accuracy has been achieved at the cost of classifying more previously "normal" subjects as having IFG (from 2.3 to 7.3%). Both IFG and IGT were associated with an unfavorable risk profile for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, with a higher estimated risk for IGT than IFG.

Conclusions

Even with the revised diagnostic criterion, IFG and IGT identify distinct groups that have a different background risk. The cost/benefit of preventive measures tested in people with IGT may not apply to the new IFG category.

Finally, the natural history of prediabetes is somewhat reassuring. Approximately two-thirds of people with prediabetes do not develop diabetes. In the placebo arm of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcome Study (DPPOS), 65% of participants had not developed diabetes 5.7 years after the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) had ended. Similarly, 69% of people with prediabetes in the Framingham Offspring Study had not developed diabetes 27 to 30 years later. In people with prediabetes who were older than 60 years enrolled in the Swedish National Study on Aging who were followed for 12 years, 23% died and 13% developed diabetes. Even assuming that all the individuals who died had developed diabetes before doing so (highly unlikely), 64% of those still living would not have developed diabetes. Furthermore, a mean of one-third, with a wide range of 13–69% depending on the diagnostic criteria used to diagnose prediabetes and euglycemia, returned to normal glucose regulation over time.

### Pre-impaired fasting glucose state is a risk factor for endothelial dysfunction: flow-mediated dilation Japan (FMD-J) study [^112vqfKZ]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular events. It is well known that cardiovascular risk is increased before the onset of DM as a state of pre-diabetes. In the American Diabetes Association (ADA) classification, a fasting blood glucose (FBG) range of 100–125 mg/dL is categorized as impaired fasting glucose (IFG). However, before 2003, an FBG range of 110–125 mg/dL was categorized as IFG in the ADA classification. In WHO criteria, an FBG range of 110–125 mg/dL is categorized as IFG. In the Japan Diabetes Society criteria, an FBG range of 110–125 mg/dL is categorized as pre-diabetes, and a range of 100–109 mg/dL is categorized as high normal blood glucose. The definition of IFG differs between countries and eras.

Endothelial dysfunction is known as the first step in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and is also known as a marker of cardiovascular events. Measurement of flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) in the brachial artery is widely used for assessment of endothelial function. FMD is also well known as an independent predictor of cardiovascular events. In addition, measurement of FMD is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in the general population, including individuals with DM. It has been established that DM is associated with endothelial dysfunction. However, the relationship between IFG and endothelial function is still controversial. Some investigators have shown that IFG is associated with endothelial dysfunction. On the other hand, Henry et al reported that IFG was not associated with endothelial dysfunction.

There has been no study on the detailed relationships of FBG, including a normal range of glucose, pre-IFG range, and IFG range with endothelial function. First, we divided subjects into four groups according to the ADA classification, the WHO criteria and the Japan Diabetes Society criteria, FBG of < 100, 100–109, 110–125, and ≥ 126 mg/dL or known DM, and assessed the FMD values. Furthermore, there is no information on from what level of FBG adversely affects endothelial function. Therefore, we divided FBG of < 100 mg/dL, which was previously classified as normal blood glucose, into three groups, FBG of < 90 md/dL, FBG of 90–94 mg/dL and FBG of 95–99 mg/dL, and evaluated the relationships of FBG levels of < 90, 90–94, 95–99, 100–109, 110–125 and ≥ 126 mg/dL or known DM with FMD in multiple centers using a large sample size.

### Impact of mismatches in hbAvs glucose values on the diagnostic classification of diabetes and prediabetes [^1155coUx]. Diabetic Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

To determine whether HbA 1c mismatches (HbA 1c levels that are higher or lower than expected for the average glucose levels in different individuals) could lead to errors if diagnostic classification is based only on HbA 1c levels.

Methods

In a cross-sectional study, 3106 participants without known diabetes underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (fasting glucose and 2-h glucose) and a 50-g glucose challenge test (1-h glucose) on separate days. They were classified by oral glucose tolerance test results as having: normal glucose metabolism; prediabetes; or diabetes. Predicted HbA 1c was determined from the linear regression modelling the relationship between observed HbA 1c and average glucose (mean of fasting glucose and 2-h glucose from the oral glucose tolerance test, and 1-h glucose from the glucose challenge test) within oral glucose tolerance test groups. The haemoglobin glycation index was calculated as [observed - predicted HbA 1c], and divided into low, intermediate and high haemoglobin glycation index mismatch tertiles.

Results

Those participants with higher mismatches were more likely to be black, to be men, to be older, and to have higher BMI (all P < 0.001). Using oral glucose tolerance test criteria, the distribution of normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes and diabetes was similar across mismatch tertiles; however, using HbA 1c criteria, the participants with low mismatches were classified as 97% normal glucose metabolism, 3% prediabetes and 0% diabetes, i.e. mostly normal, while those with high mismatches were classified as 13% normal glucose metabolism, 77% prediabetes and 10% diabetes, i.e. mostly abnormal (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Measuring only HbA 1c could lead to under-diagnosis in people with low mismatches and over-diagnosis in those with high mismatches. Additional oral glucose tolerance tests and/or fasting glucose testing to complement HbA 1c in diagnostic classification should be performed in most individuals.

### Liraglutide and glycaemic outcomes in the LEADER trial [^114nFs7d]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Plain Language Summary

In patients with type 2 diabetes, blood sugar levels are higher and vary more than in healthy people. In the past, some drugs that were used to treat diabetes by controlling blood sugar levels increased the risk of certain complications. LEADER was a clinical trial investigating the impact of a drug called liraglutide on stroke, heart attack and death in patients with type 2 diabetes. Liraglutide was compared with a placebo control drug, but all patients were also allowed to use a range of other diabetes drugs during the trial if needed to achieve good blood sugar control. LEADER showed that liraglutide reduced the risk of the key complications compared with placebo. While LEADER was a safety study, other variables were also measured. We examined both the haemoglobin A1C (a measure of average blood sugar levels) and the need for additional diabetes drugs as measures of how well liraglutide controlled blood sugar levels. We showed that fewer patients treated with liraglutide experienced a worsening of blood sugar control or needed additional diabetes drugs to control blood sugar. This means that patients treated with liraglutide had better blood sugar control over time than those who received the placebo. While blood sugar control worsened with both placebo and liraglutide over the 5 years of the study, this worsening was faster with the placebo.

### Contributions of 2-h post-load glucose, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults: a systematic analysis of global data [^113nCeoA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Some studies found that the association of fasting blood glucose (FPG) or glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) elevation with diabetic complications was not statistically significant after controlling for the confounding caused by 2-h post-load glucose (2hPG) elevation. Furthermore, inclusion of HbA1c as a diagnostic measure for diabetes has raised some concerns about over-diagnosis and over-treatment. This study aimed to quantify the contributions of 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes respectively, by synthesising global data, which can serve as essential parameters in cost-effectiveness analysis and inform updates of practice guidelines about prevention and control of diabetes.

Materials and Methods

The levels of 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c were classified as either 'elevated' or 'normal' Each distinct combination of these markers (e.g., 'elevated 2hPG, normal FPG and normal HbA1c') defined a unique subgroup, resulting in a total of seven subgroups for both diabetes and pre-diabetes. The contribution of 2hPG elevation to diabetes prevalence was calculated as its proportion among all diabetes cases; the same approach was applied to FPG and HbA1c elevations, as well as to pre-diabetes prevalence. To retrieve global data, five electronic databases (i.e. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wan Fang) were searched from their inception to February 2024. Studies that fulfilled the following criteria were considered eligible: (1) were conducted in adults without previously diagnosed diabetes; (2) were cross-sectional studies or baseline surveys of cohort studies (which can be regarded as a special type of cross-sectional studies); and (3) reported directly or allowed for calculation of the proportion of each subgroup out of all diabetes and/or the proportion of each subgroup out of all pre-diabetes. A 10-item tool selected from literature was used to appraise the quality of included data. The proportions of each subgroup among all diabetes cases were meta-analysed across eligible studies with the random-effects model using the MetaXL software. Similar meta-analyses were conducted for pre-diabetes.

Results

Thirty-two eligible studies were identified, with 25 reporting on newly detected diabetes (n = 289094) and 15 on pre-diabetes (n = 221988) and the majority of them using identical diagnostic cutoffs proposed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). The mean age of participants ranged from 24 to 68years (median of mean ages: 51). Twenty-four studies (75%) were assessed as at low risk for ≥ 7 out of the 10 quality items. In the general population, based on the ADA criteria, the weighted prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes was 15% and 69%, respectively. Among those with newly detected diabetes (n = 24214), 69% had elevated 2hPG, 44% elevated FPG and 61% elevated HbA1c; 7% had isolated FPG elevation; 20% had isolated HbA1c elevation. Among those with newly detected pre-diabetes (n = 133621), 33% had elevated 2hPG, 51% elevated FPG and 68% elevated HbA1c; 17% had isolated FPG elevation; 34% had isolated HbA1c elevation. Sensitivity analyses stratified by participant comorbidities and study quality produced results consistent with the main findings.

Conclusions

The largest contributors to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes are 2hPG and HbA1c, respectively. Isolated FPG and HbA1c elevations account for over a quarter of all diabetes and more than half of all pre-diabetes.

### Effects of diabetes definition on global surveillance of diabetes prevalence and diagnosis: a pooled analysis of 96 population-based studies with 331, 288 participants [^1149ZdUa]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes has been defined on the basis of different biomarkers, including fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h plasma glucose in an oral glucose tolerance test (2hOGTT), and HbA1c. We assessed the effect of different diagnostic definitions on both the population prevalence of diabetes and the classification of previously undiagnosed individuals as having diabetes versus not having diabetes in a pooled analysis of data from population-based health examination surveys in different regions.

Methods

We used data from 96 population-based health examination surveys that had measured at least two of the biomarkers used for defining diabetes. Diabetes was defined using HbA1c (HbA1c ≥ 6·5% or history of diabetes diagnosis or using insulin or oral hypoglycaemic drugs) compared with either FPG only or FPG-or-2hOGTT definitions (FPG ≥ 7·0 mmol/L or 2hOGTT ≥ 11·1 mmol/L or history of diabetes or using insulin or oral hypoglycaemic drugs). We calculated diabetes prevalence, taking into account complex survey design and survey sample weights. We compared the prevalences of diabetes using different definitions graphically and by regression analyses. We calculated sensitivity and specificity of diabetes diagnosis based on HbA1c compared with diagnosis based on glucose among previously undiagnosed individuals (ie, excluding those with history of diabetes or using insulin or oral hypoglycaemic drugs). We calculated sensitivity and specificity in each survey, and then pooled results using a random-effects model. We assessed the sources of heterogeneity of sensitivity by meta-regressions for study characteristics selected a priori.

Findings

Population prevalence of diabetes based on FPG-or-2hOGTT was correlated with prevalence based on FPG alone (r = 0·98), but was higher by 2–6 percentage points at different prevalence levels. Prevalence based on HbA1c was lower than prevalence based on FPG in 42·8% of age-sex-survey groups and higher in another 41·6%; in the other 15·6%, the two definitions provided similar prevalence estimates. The variation across studies in the relation between glucose-based and HbA1c-based prevalences was partly related to participants' age, followed by natural logarithm of per person gross domestic product, the year of survey, mean BMI, and whether the survey population was national, subnational, or from specific communities. Diabetes defined as HbA1c 6·5% or more had a pooled sensitivity of 52·8% (95% CI 51·3–54·3%) and a pooled specificity of 99·74% (99·71–99·78%) compared with FPG 7·0 mmol/L or more for diagnosing previously undiagnosed participants; sensitivity compared with diabetes defined based on FPG-or-2hOGTT was 30·5% (28·7–32·3%). None of the preselected study-level characteristics explained the heterogeneity in the sensitivity of HbA1c versus FPG.

Interpretation

Different biomarkers and definitions for diabetes can provide different estimates of population prevalence of diabetes, and differentially identify people without previous diagnosis as having diabetes. Using an HbA1c-based definition alone in health surveys will not identify a substantial proportion of previously undiagnosed people who would be considered as having diabetes using a glucose-based test.

### A method for assessing quality of control from glucose profiles [^111TysVd]. Diabetic Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Aim

As the practice of multiple assessments of glucose concentration throughout the day increases for people with diabetes, there is a need for an assessment of glycaemic control weighted for the clinical risks of both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia.

Methods

We have developed a methodology to report the degree of risk which a glycaemic profile represents. Fifty diabetes professionals assigned risk values to a range of 40 blood glucose concentrations. Their responses were summarised and a generic function of glycaemic risk was derived. This function was applied to patient glucose profiles to generate an integrated risk score termed the Glycaemic Risk Assessment Diabetes Equation (GRADE). The GRADE score was then reported by use of the mean value and the relative percent contribution to the weighted risk score from the hypoglycaemic, euglycaemic, hyperglycaemic range, respectively, e.g. GRADE (hypoglycaemia%, euglycaemia%, hyperglycaemia%).

Results

The GRADE scores of indicative glucose profiles were as follows: continuous glucose monitoring profile non-diabetic subjects GRADE = 1.1, Type 1 diabetes continuous glucose monitoring GRADE = 8.09 (20%, 8%, 72%), Type 2 diabetes home blood glucose monitoring GRADE = 9.97 (2%, 7%, 91%).

Conclusions

The GRADE score of a glucose profile summarises the degree of risk associated with a glucose profile. Values < 5 correspond to euglycaemia. The GRADE score is simple to generate from any blood glucose profile and can be used as an adjunct to HbA1c to report the degree of risk associated with glycaemic variability.

Fasting blood glucose in pediatric cardiovascular health — thresholds and applicability: A fasting blood glucose level of < 100 mg/dL was set as the ideal for pediatric patients, but measurement of fasting blood glucose is not a current or proposed recommendation for routine pediatric care. The American Diabetes Association defines impaired glucose tolerance as a fasting blood glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dL and diabetes mellitus as a fasting blood glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL. Puberty-related changes in glucose have not been documented, suggesting that the use of a single cut point for glucose may be reasonable.

### Recent applications of machine learning and deep learning models in the prediction, diagnosis, and management of diabetes: a comprehensive review [^111uPwRB]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

The control of T1DM relies on the suitable assessment of the insulin units to maintain the BG levels in the desired range. This value is disparate for the patients depending on the calories they consumed and the degree of physical exercise they performed. The kinetics of body glucose is complex and different for each user. An RNN model based on LSTM cells could be employed to elevate the precision of blood glucose predictions according to the insulin absorption curves and the approximation of carbohydrate digestion for specified patients. The outcomes disclosed the capability of the suggested model to assess the absorption curves of insulin for normalized fast insulin curves that could have an uppermost amount of 1 unit. Moreover, the algorithm was capable of learning the complicated dependencies between the levels of blood sugar and estimated quantities for carbohydrate and blood insulin concentrations.

A predictive warning for the forthcoming hypoglycemic occurrence could help patients with T1DM to make a preventive decision to limit further consequences. To construct such a prediction model with a low False Alert Rate (FAR) and proper generalizability to new individuals and time periods, RF and quantile regression forest were employed. Two diverse modeling methods were examined including classification-based and regression-based approaches. The classification-based method could straightly predict the occurrence of sustained hypoglycemia. However, the regression-based technique could forecast the glucose at several time points and also could provide a further deduction for sustained hypoglycemia. The sustained hypoglycemic occurrence was specified glucose amounts less than 70 mg/dL for at least 15 min. The model predicted sustained events with more than 97% specificity and sensitivity for both 30- and 60-minute prediction horizons. The FAR remained at less than 25%. The results confirmed that making alerts based on sustained events instead of all hypoglycemic occurrences could decrease the FAR and also could lead to the models with superior generalizability with the new individuals and period times.

### Screening and diagnosis of prediabetes: where are we headed? [^1136UrjM]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

It is currently estimated that more than 300 million people have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), putting them at increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its adverse consequences. In addition, many others are at risk on the basis of a family history of T2DM, obesity, dyslipidaemia and hypertension. Screening for risk should include both blood glucose testing in high-risk populations and prescreening (e.g. by questionnaire, waist circumference measurement) to identify high-risk individuals in overall low-risk populations; these individuals should then undergo glucose testing. Fasting plasma glucose measurement cannot diagnose IGT; the preferred definite test for diagnosis is oral glucose tolerance testing.

Serum glucose level before FDG administration — fasting and glucose thresholds are specified to ensure appropriate imaging conditions: the main objectives of patient preparation with at least 4 h of fasting are to ensure low blood glucose and low insulinaemia, and efforts should be made to decrease blood glucose to normal levels (typically 4–7 mmol/L), though hyperglycaemia should not represent an absolute contraindication; blood glucose level must be measured prior to administering FDG, and a calibrated and validated method must be used if plasma glucose is used to correct standardized uptake values (SUVs); on arrival, glucose should not be below 4 mmol/L (about 70 mg/dL); for clinical studies, if plasma glucose is lower than 11 mmol/L (about 200 mg/dL) the FDG PET/CT study can be performed; for research studies, the recommended upper plasma glucose levels may range between 7 and 8.3 mmol/L (126 mg/dL and 150 mg/dL), with the upper threshold specified in the protocol and patients outside the specified range often excluded.

### Screening for diabetes and pre-diabetes with proposed A1c-based diagnostic criteria [^1144zuoF]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Classification of glucose tolerance

Glucose tolerance was classified by ADA criteria on the basis of glucose levels in a single 75-g OGTT. Subjects were grouped as normal glucose tolerance (fasting plasma glucose [FPG] < 100 mg/dl, with 2-h plasma glucose < 140 mg/dl), pre-diabetes (impaired fasting glucose with FPG 100–125 mg/dl and 2-h plasma glucose < 200 mg/dl and/or impaired glucose tolerance with FPG < 126 mg/dl and 2-h plasma glucose 140–199 mg/dl), and diabetes (FPG ≥ 126 mg/dl or 2-h plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl). The additional IEC criteria identified subjects as normal (A1C < 6%), high risk for diabetes (A1C 6.0–6.4%), and diabetes (A1C ≥ 6.5%), whereas new ADA criteria identified subjects as normal (A1C < 5.7%), high risk (A1C 5.7–6.4%), and diabetes (A1C ≥ 6.5%). Additional evaluations used FPG ≤ 110 mg/dl for normal glucose tolerance. "Dysglycemia" includes pre-diabetes or diabetes (OGTT) or high risk or diabetes (A1C).

Statistical analysis

Means and frequencies were determined in aggregate and by subgroup analysis of the different glucose tolerance categories. The discriminative effectiveness of screening was evaluated by the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) for the NHANES data and SPSS 15.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) for SIGT study data. All NHANES analyses were conducted using SAS 9.2 and SUDAAN version 10 (RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC) to account for the complex survey design. Prevalence estimates from NHANES studies were weighted, except where noted or when small sample sizes made weighting estimates unstable; 95% CIs were calculated using the Wilson score method. Paired t tests compared rates of apparent false-positive and false-negative identification of diabetes or high risk in black and white subjects. Population estimates were derived from the results of the weighted NHANES 2005–2006 dataset and applied to non-Hispanic black or white adults for whom data were available (∼156 million individuals). No additional extrapolations were made.

Definitions of prediabetes (intermediate glycemia) — Table 3 specifies organizational thresholds. For ADA, impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; 2-h OGTT) is 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L), and high risk by A1c is 5.7%–6.4% (39–46 mmol/mol), with the comment that "Any one of the three is sufficient". For WHO 2011, IFG is 110–125 mg/dL (6.1–6.9 mmol/L) and "A1c is not recommended for diagnosis of intermediate glycemia". For IEC 2009, high risk by A1c is 6.0%–6.4% (42–46 mmol/mol) and the comment states "Restricted to higher risk group than ADA definition for T2DM prevention".

### Performance of A1c for the classification and prediction of diabetes [^1151UDpc]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

An A1C cut point of 6.5% is highly specific but has low sensitivity for the identification of prevalent undiagnosed diabetes by these definitions. The low sensitivity of A1C does not necessarily mean that A1C has poor test performance; it may be that A1C is more appropriately distinguishing those individuals at risk for subsequent complications. Recommendations for use of A1C for diagnosis, monitoring glycemic control, and guiding therapy in diabetes are largely based on the association of A1C with long-term microvascular outcomes. Epidemiological studies have also demonstrated associations among A1C and risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality in nondiabetic individuals, with substantial increases in risk observed at A1C values ≥ 6.0%. Prospective epidemiological data demonstrate that A1C is a stronger predictor of vascular complications than fasting glucose.

As has been shown in previous studies, blacks were substantially more likely to have elevated A1C values than whites. Nonetheless, we did not observe substantial racial differences in the overall performance of A1C for the identification or prediction of diabetes.

This study highlights a weakness in the literature related to diabetes diagnosis: the lack of confirmatory glucose testing to replicate the typical clinical scenario in which multiple tests are conducted before a diagnosis is made. In studies with no confirmatory testing, A1C will seem to miss a proportion of fasting glucose-defined cases of diabetes. This is partly a function of the short-term variability in fasting glucose. When repeat testing is used, this discordance is reduced. We have shown previously that A1C has substantially lower within-person variability compared with fasting and 2-h glucose. Whereas repeating fasting glucose tests can substantially reduce misclassification, the high reliability of A1C suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for diagnostic classification unless laboratory error or interference is suspected.

For diabetes and other asymptomatic conditions that are clinically defined, diagnostic testing studies should use multiple reference standards, ideally emphasizing those that most closely replicate the clinical setting. Previous studies have highlighted the low sensitivity of A1C for detecting diabetes defined by a single fasting or 2-h glucose measurement. Our data demonstrated improved performance of A1C compared with stronger gold standards that relied on repeated glucose determinations on different days.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114V3E6i]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to diagnose prediabetes in nonpregnant individuals based on HbA1c, FBG criteria, or OGTT:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|HbA1c|- 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol)|
|Fasting plasma glucose|- 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L)|
|2-hour plasma glucose during 75-g OGTT|- 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L).|

### Home blood pressure compared with office blood pressure in relation to dysglycemia [^1179BoyG]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous group of metabolic diseases diagnosed by elevated fasting plasma glucose, elevated plasma glucose after oral glucose tolerance testing, and/or elevated glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). HbA1c is an indirect marker of prolonged elevation of plasma glucose levels, and a diagnostic threshold of 48 mmol/mol or higher is advised by most guidelines. Prediabetes is defined as supernormal glucose levels that do not meet the criteria of diabetes mellitus, but the diagnostic criteria are not universally agreed upon. Furthermore, prediabetes is classified as impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance and this categorization is lacking consensus as well. Prediabetes increases the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the risk of CVD, although the predictive significance of the various definitions of prediabetes differ.

The 2019 ESC Guidelines on Diabetes, Pre-Diabetes and Cardiovascular Diseases suggest that HBPM should be considered to evaluate antihypertensive treatment in patients with diabetes. However, there is no evidence of greater benefits of HBPM for patients with diabetes compared with hypertensive patients without diabetes.

To our knowledge, the relationship between HbA1c, office BP, and HBPM is not known. Thus, the aim of our study was to explore if there is a discrepancy between office BP and HBPM in relation to HbA1c as well as glycemic status.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^116iG6eb]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Prediabetes — individuals whose blood glucose levels do not meet the criteria for diabetes but are higher than normal are classified as having prediabetes, and they have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke; age, race, and co-morbid hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia are significant risk factors associated with progression. Persons with prediabetes have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), or abnormal glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) levels, with IGT diagnosed only by the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and defined by a 2-hour plasma glucose in the 75-g OGTT of 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) to 199 mg/dL (11.0 mmol/L), IFG defined as fasting glucose 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) to 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L), and an A1C test level between 5.7 percent and 6.4 percent considered prediabetes.

4 STAGING AND PROGRESSION TO CLINICAL DISEASE

The diagnosis of early‐stage type 1 diabetes is a step that identifies individuals who are likely to develop clinical type 1 diabetes later in life. Diagnosis activates and requires proper clinical care. A key aspect of this care, particularly in the context of potential therapies to delay progression, is the accurate diagnosis of Stage 1, which is associated with less than 20% 2‐year progression to clinical diabetes or Stage 2, which is associated with a 50% 2‐year progression rate. The defining distinction between these stages is glycaemic status: normoglycaemia in Stage 1 and dysglycaemia in Stage 2.

Over the past decade, the definition of dysglycaemia in early‐stage type 1 diabetes has evolved. Initially, it relied solely on impaired oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) values and subsequent confirmation. Later, it incorporated impaired HbA1c values and aligned the definition of impaired fasting glucose with those used in pre‐type 2 diabetes. A comparison of diagnostic criteria has revealed significant differences in the rates of progression to Stage 3 type 1 diabetes depending on the number and type of impaired values. While this variability could raise concerns, it also presents an opportunity to improve risk stratification (Table 2). Indeed, risk within Stage 2 type 1 diabetes can be stratified on the basis of the number and persistence of glycaemia abnormalities as well as the combination of abnormalities by blood glucose and HbA1c. Nevertheless, the OGTT is influenced by several factors — some controllable and others not — and there is sub‐optimal compliance in some studies. Alternative markers such as c‐peptide values during an OGTT, proinsulin‐c‐peptide ratios and values derived from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices have been investigated. Although thresholds for dysglycaemia from these measurements have been proposed, this is still in its infancy, with substantial variability within and between studies, particularly for CGM. Nevertheless, we expect that once standardized, CGM will become a useful component for staging and stratification of risk in early‐stage type 1 diabetes.

### Intensive glucose control versus conventional glucose control for type 1 diabetes mellitus [^1153wzZL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical guidelines differ regarding their recommended blood glucose targets for patients with type 1 diabetes and recent studies on patients with type 2 diabetes suggest that aiming at very low targets can increase the risk of mortality.

Objectives

To assess the effects of intensive versus conventional glycaemic targets in patients with type 1 diabetes in terms of long-term complications and determine whether very low, near normoglycaemic values are of additional benefit.

Search Methods

A systematic literature search was performed in the databases The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and EMBASE. The date of the last search was December 2012 for all databases.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that had defined different glycaemic targets in the treatment arms, studied patients with type 1 diabetes, and had a follow-up duration of at least one year.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed studies for risk of bias, with differences resolved by consensus. Overall study quality was evaluated by the 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation' (GRADE) system. Random-effects models were used for the main analyses and the results are presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes.

Main Results

We identified 12 trials that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, including a total of 2230 patients. The patient populations varied widely across studies with one study only including children, one study only including patients after a kidney transplant, one study with newly diagnosed adult patients, and several studies where patients had retinopathy or microalbuminuria at baseline. The mean follow-up duration across studies varied between one and 6.5 years. The majority of the studies were carried out in the 1980s and all trials took place in Europe or North America. Due to the nature of the intervention, none of the studies could be carried out in a blinded fashion so that the risk of performance bias, especially for subjective outcomes such as hypoglycaemia, was present in all of the studies. Fifty per cent of the studies were judged to have a high risk of bias in at least one other category. Under intensive glucose control, the risk of developing microvascular complications was reduced compared to conventional treatment for a) retinopathy: 23/371 (6.2%) versus 92/397 (23.2%); RR 0.27 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.42); P < 0.00001; 768 participants; 2 trials; high quality evidence; b) nephropathy: 119/732 (16.3%) versus 211/743 (28.4%); RR 0.56 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.68); P < 0.00001; 1475 participants; 3 trials; moderate quality evidence; c) neuropathy: 29/586 (4.9%) versus 86/617 (13.9%); RR 0.35 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.53); P < 0.00001; 1203 participants; 3 trials; high quality evidence. Regarding the progression of these complications after manifestation, the effect was weaker (retinopathy) or possibly not existent (nephropathy: RR 0.79 (95% CI 0.37 to 1.70); P = 0.55; 179 participants with microalbuminuria; 3 trials; very low quality evidence); no adequate data were available regarding the progression of neuropathy. For retinopathy, intensive glucose control reduced the risk of progression in studies with a follow-up duration of at least two years (85/366 (23.2%) versus 154/398 (38.7%); RR 0.61 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.76); P < 0.0001; 764 participants; 2 trials; moderate quality evidence), while we found evidence for an initial worsening of retinopathy after only one year of intensive glucose control (17/49 (34.7%) versus 7/47 (14.9%); RR 2.32 (95% CI 1.16 to 4.63); P = 0.02; 96 participants; 2 trials; low quality evidence). Major macrovascular outcomes (stroke and myocardial infarction) occurred very rarely, and no firm evidence could be established regarding these outcome measures (low quality evidence). We found that intensive glucose control increased the risk for severe hypoglycaemia, however the results were heterogeneous and only the 'Diabetes Complications Clinical Trial' (DCCT) showed a clear increase in severe hypoglycaemic episodes under intensive treatment. A subgroup analysis according to the baseline haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of participants in the trials (low quality evidence) suggests that the risk of hypoglycaemia is possibly only increased for patients who started with relatively low HbA1c values (< 9.0%). Several of the included studies also showed a greater weight gain under intensive glucose control, and the risk of ketoacidosis was only increased in studies using insulin pumps in the intensive treatment group (very low quality evidence). Overall, all-cause mortality was very low in all studies (moderate quality evidence) except in one study investigating renal allograft as treatment for end-stage diabetic nephropathy. Health-related quality of life was only reported in the DCCT trial, showing no statistically significant differences between the intervention and comparator groups (moderate quality evidence). In addition, only the DCCT published data on costs, indicating that intensive glucose therapy control was highly cost-effective considering the reduction of potential diabetes complications (moderate quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Tight blood sugar control reduces the risk of developing microvascular diabetes complications. The evidence of benefit is mainly from studies in younger patients at early stages of the disease. Benefits need to be weighed against risks including severe hypoglycaemia, and patient training is an important aspect in practice. The effects of tight blood sugar control seem to become weaker once complications have been manifested. However, further research is needed on this issue. Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence from RCTs on the effects of tight blood sugar control in older patient populations or patients with macrovascular disease. There is no firm evidence for specific blood glucose targets and treatment goals need to be individualised taking into account age, disease progression, macrovascular risk, as well as the patient's lifestyle and disease management capabilities.

### Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) | Diabetes… [^1145SjR5]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Low blood sugar can be dangerous if left untreated.
- Blood sugar below 70 mg/dL is considered low.
- Low blood sugar is especially common in people with type 1 diabetes. Overview Blood sugar levels change often during the day. When they drop below 70 mg/dL, this is called having low blood sugar. At this level, you need to take action to bring it back up. Low blood sugar is especially common in people with type 1 diabetes. Knowing how to spot low blood sugar is important because it can be dangerous if left untreated. Read more about what causes low blood sugar and common symptoms. Types Nighttime low blood sugar Low blood sugar can happen at any time during the day. Some people may experience low blood sugar while they sleep. Reasons this may happen include:

- Having an active day.
- Being physically active close to bedtime.
- Taking too much insulin.
- Drinking alcohol at night.

Eating regular meals and not skipping them can help you avoid nighttime low blood sugar. Eating when you drink alcohol can also help. If you think you're at risk for low blood sugar overnight, have a snack before bed. You may wake up when you have low blood sugar, but you shouldn't rely on that. A continuous glucose monitor can alert you if your blood sugar gets low while you're sleeping. Severe low blood sugar As your low blood sugar gets worse, you may have more serious symptoms, including:

- Feeling weak.
- Having trouble walking or seeing clearly.
- Acting strange or feeling confused.
- Having seizures. Severe low blood sugar is below 54 mg/dL. Blood sugar this low may make you faint. Often, you'll need someone to help you treat severe low blood sugar. Hypoglycemia unawareness You may not have any symptoms when your blood sugar is low. If you don't have symptoms, it will be harder to treat your low blood sugar early.

This increases your risk of having severe lows and can be dangerous. This is more likely to happen if you:

- Have had diabetes for more than 5–10 years.
- Often have low blood sugar.
- Take certain medicines, such as beta blockers for high blood pressure. If you meet one or more of the above and you have hypoglycemia unawareness, check your blood sugar more often. Checking is especially important to do before driving or being physically active.

### Diabetes basics… [^116E63Y2]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy.
- **There are three main types of diabetes**: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes. Overview Your body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body's cells for use as energy. With diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or can't use it as well as it should. When there isn't enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease. Types Type 1 diabetes Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction.

This reaction stops your body from making insulin. If you have type 1 diabetes, you'll need to take insulin every day to survive. Currently, no one knows how to prevent type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults but can be diagnosed at any age, and symptoms often develop quickly. Keep Reading: About Type 1 Diabetes. Type 2 diabetes With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't use insulin well and can't keep blood sugar at normal levels. It develops over many years and is usually diagnosed in adults. You may not notice any symptoms, so it's important to get your blood sugar tested if you're at risk. Keep Reading: About Type 2 Diabetes. Prevention Prediabetes In the United States, about 1 in 3 adults has prediabetes. More than 8 in 10 people with prediabetes don't know they have it.

With prediabetes, blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough for a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Prediabetes raises your risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes can be prevented with lifestyle changes. Currently, no one knows how to prevent type 1 diabetes. How you can prevent type 2 diabetes.
