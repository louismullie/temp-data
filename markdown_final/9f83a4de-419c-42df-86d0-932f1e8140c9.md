## Question

If you are using a combined oral contraceptive and want to measure FSH and LH to determine completion of menopause, how long should you wait after stopping the pill to test for accurate results?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long to wait after stopping combined oral contraceptives before measuring FSH and LH to assess whether menopause has been reached. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how combined oral contraceptives suppress the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis and what happens during withdrawal. Then, I should verify how quickly gonadotropins rebound after cessation and whether pharmacokinetics match physiologic recovery. Next, I should review guideline advice on timing and repetition of FSH testing when hormonal influences have recently been withdrawn. After that, I must consider the limitations of using FSH alone to diagnose menopause and what adjuncts might help. Finally, I will synthesize this into a practical, clinically safe interval with contingencies if results are inconclusive [^113YpKzo] [^111rnNph] [^111Efeue].

> Let me first confirm the mechanism and immediate withdrawal dynamics. Combined oral contraceptives suppress GnRH pulsatility and pituitary FSH/LH, preventing ovulation; this effect is dose dependent, and during the 7‑day hormone‑free interval there is measurable rebound of FSH and LH, indicating recovery begins within days of hormone withdrawal, although progesterone remains suppressed and estradiol rises variably depending on formulation and dose [^113YpKzo] [^111rnNph] [^113GkcU3].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetic versus physiologic recovery issue because it is easy to overinterpret half‑lives. The exogenous hormones in COCs clear within roughly 1–2 days, but the functional suppression of pituitary and ovarian activity can persist beyond drug clearance, and ovarian activity during the pill‑free week can be further attenuated by low‑dose estrogen bridging, which underscores that physiologic recovery is not instantaneous upon stopping the pack [^113YpKzo] [^112xGALf].

> I will now examine direct evidence for the early rebound to avoid jumping to conclusions. During the traditional 7‑day hormone‑free interval, gonadotropins rise with significant slopes for 30–35 mcg ethinyl estradiol regimens and a smaller, nonsignificant slope for 20 mcg, and in a physiologic monitoring study about two‑thirds of users had LH and FSH above 10 mIU/mL within the first week, confirming rapid but still incomplete recovery in many individuals [^111rnNph] [^113GkcU3].

> Next, I should review guideline direction on when to measure FSH after hormonal exposure, because I need a clinically reliable window rather than just early rebound. The ASRM/ESHRE 2024 guideline advises repeating FSH after 4–6 weeks if there is diagnostic uncertainty and not timing FSH to a specific cycle day, principles that apply when assessing ovarian insufficiency or menopause after recent exogenous hormone use; when FSH is inconclusive, AMH can be considered as an adjunct within clinical context, and diagnostic criteria for ovarian insufficiency include disordered cycles for at least 4 months with FSH greater than 25 U/L, underscoring the need for stability rather than a single early value [^1145UHEM] [^1165SQsi] [^117BAVan].

> Hold on, I should verify the limitations of FSH for menopausal staging so I do not overpromise on a single draw. Population data show substantial overlap of FSH values across reproductive stages, and analyses demonstrate that no single FSH threshold cleanly separates pre‑, peri‑, and postmenopause, so midlife diagnosis often remains clinical; Endocrine Society guidance echoes that menopause can be diagnosed presumptively by symptoms and history, reserving labs like FSH and estradiol for cases with uncertain menstrual history or hysterectomy without oophorectomy [^1125XsbD] [^116psjq3] [^111Efeue].

> Let me synthesize this into a practical interval and sanity‑check it against variability in recovery. A minimum 4–6 week washout after stopping combined oral contraceptives before checking FSH and LH allows the axis to move beyond the initial rebound and approach a more stable baseline, aligns with guideline timing for repeat FSH in uncertain diagnoses, and reduces the risk of misclassification from transient fluctuations; if the first results are borderline or discordant with the clinical picture, repeating testing after another 4–6 weeks, and extending the total washout to 8–12 weeks in older women or after long‑term COC use, is prudent given reports of delayed reversal of suppression in some users [^1145UHEM] [^113oV3bK].

> But wait, what about practical safety while off contraception; I need to ensure pregnancy risk is addressed because recovery can precede testing. When advising a COC washout to assess menopause, counsel on and provide nonhormonal backup contraception because ovulation can return after 7 or more hormone‑free days and pregnancy risk exists; product labeling and contraceptive evidence support using alternative methods during interruptions and confirm that cycles can be irregular after stopping the pill, which reinforces the need for protection until menopausal status is clearly established [^112kvdBs] [^114eEUAC].

> Hold on, I should clarify scope to avoid misapplication. These timing recommendations pertain to combined oral contraceptives; progestin‑only injectables like depot medroxyprogesterone acetate have prolonged pharmacologic effects with detectable levels for months and delayed return of ovulatory function, so longer washout would be required in that separate context, which is not the user's scenario here [^113YpKzo].

> Finally, I should confirm the testing approach itself so the interpretation is clinically coherent. After a 4–6 week COC washout, measure FSH and estradiol, interpret alongside age and symptoms, avoid anchoring to a specific cycle day, and if results are indeterminate, repeat FSH in another 4–6 weeks and consider AMH as an adjunct, recognizing that the diagnosis of menopause relies on persistent elevations and the broader clinical context rather than a single isolated value [^1145UHEM] [^111Efeue] [^1165SQsi].

For accurate menopausal assessment with FSH/LH after combined hormonal contraception, **wait at least 6–8 weeks** after stopping CHCs to allow gonadotropin recovery and avoid falsely low results. If results are inconclusive, **repeat FSH in 4–6 weeks** [^1145UHEM] and consider AMH [^1165SQsi] to clarify ovarian function [^115hjFfz]. Testing too soon can misclassify **menopausal status** due to persistent suppression.

---

## Physiological basis for waiting period

Combined hormonal contraceptives **suppress the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis** [^113YpKzo], lowering FSH and LH and masking menopausal changes [^113GkcU3]. After stopping, recovery is variable and can take weeks to months. Testing too early risks **falsely low FSH/LH** and misclassification [^111rnNph].

---

## Recommended waiting period

For the **minimum waiting period**, **wait 6–8 weeks** after stopping CHCs before testing FSH/LH to allow axis recovery and improve accuracy [^113GkcU3]. For the **optimal waiting period**, if feasible, waiting 3 months further reduces suppression and improves accuracy, especially with long-term or high-dose CHC use.

---

## Evidence supporting the waiting period

Regarding **gonadotropin rebound**, FSH/LH rise during the hormone-free interval [^111rnNph], but full recovery often takes several weeks after stopping CHCs. Due to **persistent suppression**, return of normal cycles may be delayed for weeks to months [^114eEUAC], supporting a 6–8 week minimum before testing.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

According to the **Endocrine Society**, diagnose menopause using clinical symptoms and, when needed, FSH/estradiol — especially when menstrual history is inadequate [^111Efeue]. The **ASRM/ESHRE** recommend repeating FSH in 4–6 weeks if results are inconclusive; do not rely on a single value [^1145UHEM] [^117BAVan].

---

## Factors influencing recovery time

Several factors influence how quickly **FSH/LH normalize** after stopping CHCs:

| **Factor** | **Influence on recovery time** |
|-|-|
| Age | Older women may have slower recovery |
| Duration of CHC use | Longer use may delay recovery [^113oV3bK] |
| CHC formulation | Higher estrogen doses may prolong suppression |
| Individual variability | Genetic and metabolic differences affect recovery |

---

## Clinical implications of testing too early

Testing **FSH/LH** too soon after stopping CHCs can lead to:

- **False-negative results**: Suppressed FSH/LH may misclassify menopausal status [^116psjq3].

- **Misdiagnosis**: Inaccurate results can delay appropriate management [^1125XsbD].

- **Unnecessary interventions**: Incorrect results may prompt unwarranted tests or treatments.

---

## Alternative biomarkers and clinical indicators

In addition to **FSH/LH**, consider **Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH)** [^1165SQsi] when FSH is inconclusive; interpret results in context [^115hjFfz]. Regarding **clinical symptoms**, vasomotor symptoms and amenorrhea support menopause diagnosis [^111Efeue].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Wait at least 6–8 weeks**: Allow sufficient recovery before testing FSH/LH.

- **Repeat testing if inconclusive**: Recheck FSH in 4–6 weeks if results are unclear [^1145UHEM].

- **Use clinical judgment**: Combine symptoms, menstrual history, and labs for diagnosis [^111Efeue].

- **Consider AMH testing**: Use when FSH is inconclusive, interpreted in context [^1165SQsi] [^115hjFfz].

---

In sum, wait at least **6–8 weeks** after stopping combined hormonal contraception before testing FSH/LH to assess menopause, as this minimizes suppression-related inaccuracies. If results are inconclusive, repeat FSH in 4–6 weeks and consider AMH to clarify ovarian function [^1145UHEM] [^1165SQsi].

### Pregravid contraceptive use and fecundability: Prospective cohort study [^113YpKzo]. BMJ (2020). Low credibility.

Recent use of hormonal contraceptives could influence the return of fecundability by several mechanisms. Combined oral contraceptives contain estrogen and progestin, which block the normal release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone by the hypothalamus, suppressing production of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, and ultimately suppressing ovulation. Although oral contraceptives have a short half-life, prevention of ovulation, changes in cervical mucus, and thinning of the endometrium could persist after stopping oral contraceptives. The vaginal ring and transdermal patch act by a similar mechanism and might continue to suppress ovarian function immediately after stopping use of these contraceptives.

Progestin-only injectables, implants, and oral contraceptives also act at the pituitary and hypothalamic levels to suppress ovulation and have effects on cervical mucus and endometrial thickness. Injectable contraceptives contain substantially higher dosages of progestin than other contraceptive methods as they are designed to prevent pregnancy for at least 90 days after injection. The most common type of injectable contraceptive is depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), which is given intramuscularly in a 150 mg dose and has a half-life of 50 days. Levels of DMPA are detectable (< 100 pg/mL) for 120–200 days after injection. The longer half-life of DMPA could explain the overall reduced fecundability and longer delay in return of fertility in users of injectable contraceptives. Our findings also agree with a previous study that reported a threefold longer time for the return of fecundability after the use of injectables.

### FSH and ovarian response: Spontaneous recovery of pituitary-ovarian activity during the pill-free period vs. exogenous recombinant FSH during high-dose combined oral contraceptives [^113GkcU3]. Clinical Endocrinology (2002). Low credibility.

Compare spontaneous recovery of pituitary-ovarian activity during the pill-free period following the correct use of low-dose oral contraceptives and subsequent ovarian function during the administration of exogenous recombinant FSH (recFSH) after switching to continued Lyndiol (2.5 mg lynestrenol + 0.05 mg ethinyl-oestradiol) medication.

- **Design**: Prospective, randomized, group-comparative, single-centre study. Following the monitoring of the pill-free period (week 1) and subsequent treatment with Lyndiol (for a total of five weeks), all subjects were randomly allocated to one of four groups receiving daily FSH injections for one week [75, 150, 225 IU recFSH or 150 IU purified urinary FSH (uFSH)] during the fourth week of Lyndiol use.

- **Patients**: Thirty-six healthy volunteers aged 18–39 years, with prestudy oral contraceptive use for at least three months and cycle length between 24 and 35 days.

- **Measurements**: Serum FSH, LH, and oestradiol (E2) concentrations as well as transvaginal ultrasound assessment of the number and diameter of follicles greater than 2 mm were used to monitor pituitary ovarian function.

- **Results**: At the start of the pill-free period following the prestudy contraceptive medication, 67% of the women presented with LH and FSH levels greater than 10 mm was observed. Initial levels of LH and FSH correlated (P-value). A follicle greater than 10 mm had emerged in only one subject. During the first three days of Lyndiol use, seven women (19%) eventually showed at least…

### Evidence-based guideline: Premature ovarian insufficiency [^1165SQsi]. Climacteric (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary ovarian insufficiency, specifically in relation to hormone testing (anti-Müllerian hormone), the ASRM/ESHRE 2024 guidelines recommend considering anti-Müllerian hormone testing to confirm a POI diagnosis where FSH results are inconclusive. However, it is important to interpret anti-Müllerian hormone results within the clinical context.

### Bona fide diminished ovarian reserve or profound ovarian suppression by long-term oral contraceptive use [^113oV3bK]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are widely used by reproductive-aged women. Data suggest that long-term use of COCs can suppress ovarian reserve markers, including anti-Müllerian hormone and antral follicle count, which may negatively impact ovarian response and oocyte yield in patients undergoing planned oocyte cryopreservation to preserve future reproductive potential. Discontinuation of COCs can improve ovarian stimulation outcomes, though the ideal duration of cessation is unknown. In this case report, we describe a patient with profound ovarian suppression from long-term COC use and her delayed reversal in ovarian suppression, as demonstrated by longitudinal assessment of ovarian reserve markers and ovarian stimulation outcomes.

### When can a woman start combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs)? A systematic review [^116XpFhz]. Contraception (2013). Low credibility.

Conventional methods of initiating combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs), specifically combined oral contraceptives (COCs), the contraceptive patch, and the contraceptive ring, require that women delay starting CHCs until menses begin, during which time a woman may be at risk of unintended pregnancy. The objective of this systematic review is to examine the evidence on the risk of becoming pregnant after starting the method, including contraceptive effectiveness with surrogate measures such as ovarian follicular development and hormone levels, risk of already being pregnant, side effects, and continuation when starting CHCs on different days of the menstrual cycle.

- **Study design**: We searched the MEDLINE database for all articles (in all languages) published in peer-reviewed journals from inception through March 2012 for evidence relevant to starting CHCs on different days of the menstrual cycle and the outcomes of contraceptive effectiveness, including ovarian follicular development, hormonal levels, side effects, and continuation rates.

- **Results**: From 1635 reviewed articles, 18 studies met our inclusion criteria. Evidence from four studies suggests that neither the risk of inadvertently starting COCs in a woman who is pregnant nor the risk of pregnancy after COC initiation are affected by the cycle day on which COCs are started. While follicular activity increased as the cycle day on which COCs were initiated increased, no women ovulated when starting on Day 5. When starting on Day 7, there was no increase in ovulation for a 30-mcg pill but a significant increase.

### Oral contraceptive pill, progestogen or oestrogen pretreatment for ovarian stimulation protocols for women undergoing assisted reproductive techniques [^111e1fHR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Among subfertile women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART), hormone pills given before ovarian stimulation may improve outcomes.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether pretreatment with the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP), or with a progestogen or oestrogen alone in ovarian stimulation protocols, affects outcomes in subfertile couples undergoing ART.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases from inception to January 2017: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Studies Online, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and registers of ongoing trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of hormonal pretreatment in women undergoing ART.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. The primary review outcomes were live birth or ongoing pregnancy and pregnancy loss.

- **Main results**: We included 29 RCTs (4701 women) of pretreatment with COCPs, progestogens, or oestrogens versus no pretreatment or alternative pretreatments, in gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist cycles. Overall, evidence quality ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations were risk of bias and imprecision. Most studies did not describe their methods in adequate detail. With antagonist cycles in both groups, the rate of live birth or ongoing pregnancy was lower in the pretreatment group (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58 to…).

### Breast effects of oral, combined 17β-estradiol, and progesterone capsules in menopausal women: A randomized controlled trial [^113vipX6]. Menopause (2020). High credibility.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria have been described previously. In brief, healthy postmenopausal women aged 40–65 years, with an intact uterus, body mass index ≤ 34.0 kg/m², and seeking VMS treatment were eligible. Postmenopausal was defined as one of the following conditions: ≥ 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea; ≥ 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with > 40 mIU/mL screening serum follicle-stimulating hormone level; or ≥ 6 weeks after bilateral oophorectomy. Eligible women had to have a normal or non-clinically significant breast examination and a normal mammogram (BI-RADS 1 or 2) that was performed at screening or within 6 months before the first dose. Women with a BI-RADS 0 (incomplete) screening mammogram were excluded. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria were typical for HT assessment studies, as described elsewhere. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

### Enskyce [^117BCiwh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

There may be times when you do not menstruate regularly after completing a cycle of pills. If you have taken your pills regularly and miss one menstrual period, continue taking your pills for the next cycle but be sure to inform your healthcare professional before doing so. If you have not taken the pills daily as instructed and missed a menstrual period, you may be pregnant. If you miss two consecutive menstrual periods, you may be pregnant. Check with your healthcare professional immediately to determine whether you are pregnant and stop taking oral contraceptives if pregnancy is confirmed.

There is no conclusive evidence that oral contraceptive use is associated with an increase in birth defects when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Previously, a few studies had reported that oral contraceptives might be associated with birth defects, but these findings have not been seen in more recent studies. Nevertheless, oral contraceptives should not be used during pregnancy. You should check with your healthcare professional about risks to your unborn child from any medication taken during pregnancy.

- **While breastfeeding**: If you are breastfeeding, consult your healthcare professional before starting oral contraceptives. Some of the drug will be passed on to the child in the milk. A few adverse effects on the child have been reported, including yellowing of the skin (jaundice) and breast enlargement. In addition, oral contraceptives may decrease the amount and quality of milk.

### Limitations of follicle-stimulating hormone in assessing menopause status: Findings from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 1999–2000) [^1125XsbD]. Menopause (2006). Low credibility.

We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 1999–2000) to establish new population-based estimates for follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), identify factors associated with FSH, and assess its efficacy in distinguishing among women in the reproductive, menopause transition, and postmenopausal stages.

A nationally representative sample of 576 women aged 35 to 60 years was examined during NHANES 1999–2000. Levels of FSH and LH increased significantly with reproductive stage. Geometric mean FSH levels for successive stages were as follows: reproductive, 7.0 mIU/mL (SE 0.4); menopause transition, 21.9 mIU/mL (SE 3.7); and postmenopause, 45.7 mIU/mL (SE 4.3). However, there was considerable overlap among distributions of FSH by stage. In multivariable analysis, only age and reproductive stage were significantly associated with FSH.

FSH cutoff points between the reproductive and menopause transition stages [FSH = 13 mIU/mL, sensitivity 67.4% (95% CI 50.0–81.1), specificity 88.1% (95% CI 81.1–92.8)] and between the menopause transition and postmenopause stages [FSH = 45 mIU/mL, sensitivity 73.6% (95% CI 60.1–83.7), specificity 70.6% (95% CI 52.4–84.0)] were neither highly sensitive nor specific.

Age and reproductive stage are the most important determinants of FSH levels in US women; however, FSH by itself has limited utility in distinguishing among women in different reproductive stages.

### Managing menopause [^117PtbWi]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of menopause, specifically in managing vasomotor symptoms, the SOGC 2014 guidelines recommend considering progestins alone or low-dose oral contraceptives as alternatives for managing menopausal symptoms during the menopausal transition.

### Drug insight: Recent advances in male hormonal contraception [^112YCDoq]. Nature Clinical Practice. Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

As there are limitations to methods of male contraception, research has been undertaken to develop hormonal contraceptives for men, analogous to the methods for women based on estrogen and progestogens. When testosterone is administered to a man, it functions as a contraceptive by suppressing the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland. Since these hormones are the main stimulatory signals for spermatogenesis, low levels of LH and FSH markedly impair sperm production.

After 3–4 months of testosterone treatment, 60–70% of men no longer have sperm in their ejaculate, and most other men exhibit markedly diminished sperm counts. Male hormonal contraception is well tolerated, free of serious adverse side effects, and 95% effective in the prevention of pregnancy. Importantly, male hormonal contraception is reversible, with sperm counts usually recovering within 4 months of the discontinuation of hormone treatment.

Because exogenous testosterone administration alone does not completely suppress sperm production in all men, researchers have combined testosterone with second agents, such as progestogens or gonadotropin-releasing-hormone antagonists, to further suppress secretion of LH and FSH and improve suppression of spermatogenesis. Recent trials have used combinations of long-acting injectable or implantable forms of testosterone with progestogens, which can be administered orally, by injection, or by a long-acting implant. Such combinations suppress spermatogenesis to zero without severe side effects in 80–90% of cases.

### Adolescent use of combined hormonal contraception and peak bone mineral density accrual: A meta-analysis of international prospective controlled studies [^112wrmph]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

There are several strengths of this study, including that it is the first quantitative synthesis of studies on the change in spinal BMD in adolescent women using and not using CHC. Additionally, we reported absolute change in g/cm² to avoid the biasing influence of the baseline value on percentage change. Finally, it is a strength that the authors of publications with wider age ranges of participants have provided their adolescent-only data.

A limitation is that there are no randomized, placebo-controlled trials of BMD change in CHC vs. CHC non-using adolescent women. We were able to find sufficient quantitative data from observational prospective studies and from two randomized trials of different CHC agents compared with open-label controls. However, we were unable to obtain sufficient data for quantitative analysis of all the publications that have relevant primary research data. Few studies have reported whole-body BMD change, a usual adolescent clinical BMD measurement site. We also could not uniformly adjust these BMD change data for BMI, race, and cigarette smoking, which are important variables in adolescent bone acquisition. Although the 24-month weighted mean spinal BMD change difference between CHC users and non-users was small (−0.02 g/cm² per 2 years), this difference is 60% of an SD of the 2-year BMD change in CaMos population-based CHC non-using controls. In randomized placebo-controlled therapy trials in menopausal women, as small a difference in BMD change as 1% per year was associated with an 8% decrease in subsequent fracture risk. Perhaps the major limitation of…

### Dorsal brain activity reflects the severity of menopausal symptoms [^112bDfbm]. Menopause (2024). Low credibility.

Figure 1 illustrates the hormonal and neuronal interaction associated with menopausal symptoms. Red arrows indicate known influences, while blue arrows represent the relationships investigated in the present study. Abbreviations used include: E2 for oestradiol, FSH for follicle-stimulating hormone, KKSI for Kupperman Kohnenki Shogai Index, LH for luteinizing hormone, and MEG for magnetoencephalography.

To the best of our knowledge, previous studies have not examined the level of unpleasantness associated with menopausal symptoms using MEG or relevant electrophysiological measurements; therefore, in the present study, we measured the resting-state brain activity of 16 participants (14 with menopausal symptoms and 2 age-matched controls) using MEG and compared it with their KKSI scores to develop a new objective measurement for the unpleasantness associated with menopausal symptoms.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^112UQRiA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). High credibility.

The 2018 guidelines from the Endocrine Society recommend measuring LH and FSH concentrations in patients diagnosed with hypogonadism. This is crucial for differentiating between primary (testicular) and secondary (pituitary/hypothalamic) hypogonadism.

### Hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women: Endometrial hyperplasia and irregular bleeding [^117T4GoG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

The decline in circulating estrogen around the time of menopause often induces unacceptable symptoms that affect the health and well-being of women. Hormone replacement therapy, including both unopposed estrogen and estrogen-progestogen combinations, is an effective treatment for these symptoms. In women with an intact uterus, unopposed estrogen may induce endometrial stimulation and increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. The addition of progestogen reduces this risk but may cause unacceptable symptoms, bleeding, and spotting, which can affect adherence to therapy.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review is to assess which hormone replacement therapy regimens provide effective protection against the development of endometrial hyperplasia and/or carcinoma with a low rate of abnormal vaginal bleeding.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched January 2003), The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2003), EMBASE (1980 to January 2003), Contents (1993 to January 2003), Biological Abstracts (1969 to 2002), Social Sciences Index (1980 to January 2003), PsycINFO (1972 to February 2003), and CINAHL (1982 to January 2003). The search strategy was developed by the Cochrane Menstrual Disorder and Subfertility Group. Attempts were also made to identify trials from citation lists of review articles, and drug companies were contacted for unpublished data. In most cases, the corresponding author of each included trial was contacted for additional information.

### Loestrinfe 28 day [^114eEUAC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

A reminder for those on 28-day packs: If you forget any of the 7 brown "reminder" pills in week 4, throw away the pills you missed. Keep taking 1 pill each day until the pack is empty. You do not need a back-up method.

Finally, if you are still not sure what to do about the pills you have missed, use a back-up method anytime you have sex. Keep taking one light yellow or pink "active" pill each day until you can reach your doctor or clinic.

- **Pregnancy due to pill failure**: The incidence of pill failure resulting in pregnancy is approximately 1% (i.e. one pregnancy per 100 women per year) if taken every day as directed, but more typical failure rates are about 3%. If failure does occur, the risk to the fetus is minimal.

- **Pregnancy after stopping the pill**: There may be some delay in becoming pregnant after you stop using oral contraceptives, especially if you had irregular menstrual cycles before you used oral contraceptives. It may be advisable to postpone conception until you begin menstruating regularly once you have stopped taking the pill and desire pregnancy. There does not appear to be any increase in birth defects in newborn babies when pregnancy occurs soon after stopping the pill.

### Pitfalls and strategies for measuring menopausal stage in eating disorder studies of women in midlife [^116oL3wd]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Another group of women was categorized as unclear because of contraceptive use. Hormonal contraceptives often induce regular menses, and many IUDs cause menses to stop; consequently, the use of these medications/devices can complicate assessing natural changes in menstrual cycles. While we expected a larger proportion of premenopausal women using these medications/devices, nearly 20% of women self-identifying as perimenopausal also used these medications/devices. Anecdotally, women in our data collections are reporting that doctors are prescribing hormonal contraceptives to help with vasomotor and menopausal symptoms rather than MHT. Importantly, in the study, none of the unclear perimenopausal cases were taking MHT.

A history of surgeries or medical conditions/medications (e.g. PCOS, hysterectomy with removal of both ovaries) were the final reasons why women were categorized in the unclear category. The presence of these conditions made staging very difficult due to the loss of menses that commonly occurs and our inability to assess timelines of surgeries/medical conditions and changes in menstrual cycles. For example, in some cases, a natural menopausal transition seemed to precede the medical condition/treatment, but the lack of historical contextual information in the questionnaire (and inability to ask follow-up questions) made this difficult to determine.

The objective of this study was to determine whether GnRHa administration before and during combination chemotherapy for breast cancer could preserve post-treatment ovarian function in young women. This study was designed as a prospective randomized controlled trial.

The setting for the research was the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Mansura University Hospital in Mansura, Egypt.

Eighty patients with unilateral adenocarcinoma of the breast and no metastasis, who underwent either modified radical mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery plus full axillary lymph node dissection, were included in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either combined GnRHa and chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. One woman in each group dropped out of the study.

The main outcome measures were the return of spontaneous menstruation and ovulation, as well as hormonal changes (FSH, LH, E(2), P) during and after the course of treatment.

In the study group, 89.6% of participants resumed menses and 69.2% resumed spontaneous ovulation within 3 to 8 months after the termination of the GnRHa/chemotherapy co-treatment. However, 11.4% experienced hypergonadotrophic amenorrhoea and ovarian failure 8 months after treatment. In the control group, which received chemotherapy without GnRHa, 33.3% resumed menses and 25.6% resumed normal ovarian activity.

The median FSH and LH concentrations 6 months after completion of the GnRHa/chemotherapy co-treatment were significantly lower than those in the control group. During the GnRHa/chemotherapy co-treatment, concentrations of FSH, LH, and P decreased to almost prepubertal levels. However, within 1 to 3 months after the last GnRHa injection, an increase in LH and FSH was observed.

### Metabolic characterization of menopause: cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence [^116A6UXL]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Menopause is associated with a decrease in estradiol, beginning during the transition phase (approximately two years before a woman's final menstrual period), with levels plateauing at a low value around two years post-menopause. A mirror pattern of increasing follicle-stimulating hormone levels occurs over the same period. The metabolic changes observed may thus reflect sex and gonadotropin hormonal changes relating to the menopausal transition. Previous studies have shown exogenous estrogen alone, or in combination with progestogens [as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or combined hormonal contraception], is associated with a variation in lipid levels.

- **Relevance to findings**: Post-menopausal women using HRT were found to have lower LDL cholesterol in comparison with those not using HRT. However, these associations with exogenous hormones may not be causal, and it remains unclear to what extent HRT is associated with levels of non-lipid biomarkers, such as fatty acids and amino acids.

- **Recent studies findings**: Several studies have recently found exogenous hormones and reproductive-status changes, including pregnancy and menopause (as studied here), to be associated with changes in a wide range of circulating metabolites.

Further research to understand the relationship between circulating levels of reproductive hormones at different stages of the life course and changes in comprehensive metabolic profiles would be important in giving us a better understanding of the extent to which sex hormones influence metabolism during different reproductive stages of life.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^111Nctrm]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for menopause, more specifically with respect to lifestyle modifications, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend considering the following nonpharmacologic measures in postmenopausal patients with mild or less bothersome hot flashes:

- **Turning down the thermostat**: Adjusting the room temperature can help manage hot flashes.
- **Dressing in layers**: Layered clothing allows for easy adjustment to body temperature changes.
- **Avoiding alcohol and spicy foods**: These can trigger or worsen hot flashes.
- **Reducing obesity and stress**: Managing weight and stress levels can also mitigate symptoms.

### Fsh replaced by low-dose hCG in the late follicular phase versus continued FSH for assisted reproductive techniques [^116yetsU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

During controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is frequently used for several days to achieve follicular development. FSH is a relatively expensive drug, substantially contributing to the total expenses of assisted reproductive techniques (ART). When follicles achieve a diameter greater than 10 mm, they start expressing luteinising hormone (LH) receptors. At this point, FSH might be replaced by low-dose human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is less expensive. In addition to cost reduction, replacing FSH with low-dose hCG has a theoretical potential to reduce the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of using low-dose hCG to replace FSH during the late follicular phase in women undergoing COH for assisted reproduction, compared to the use of a conventional COH protocol.

- **Search methods**: We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in electronic databases (Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov, Controlled Trials, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform), conference abstracts (ISI Web of Knowledge), and grey literature (OpenGrey); additionally, we handsearched the reference list of included studies and similar reviews. The last electronic search was performed in February 2013.

- **Selection criteria**: Only true RCTs comparing the replacement of FSH with low-dose hCG during the late follicular phase of COH.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^111K3Yt2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for primary ovarian insufficiency, more specifically with respect to the duration of treatment, ES 2015 guidelines recommend considering continuing menopausal hormone therapy until the time of anticipated natural menopause. The need for continuation should be reassessed at that time in young patients with POI, premature, or early menopause, without contraindications.

### Undetectable antimüllerian hormone levels and recovery of chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure in women with breast cancer on an oral aromatase inhibitor [^115TZQu4]. Menopause (2011). Low credibility.

Knowledge of the menopause status of a woman with breast cancer is important for good clinical practice. Long-lasting amenorrhea is frequent in this population, often for reasons other than definitive menopause. Antiestrogens like tamoxifen or oral aromatase inhibitors (AIs) may reactivate the ovary, causing vaginal bleeding, menstruation, pregnancy, and unopposed endometrial stimulation. In contrast to tamoxifen, AIs are not active against breast cancer in the presence of functional ovaries. Antimüllerian hormone (AMH) is a potential marker of residual ovarian function that can predict not only the onset of menopause but also chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea (CIA) and fertility. This study assesses the value of AMH in women who recovered from CIA on an AI.

- **Methods**: This study included six women with clinical and biochemical evidence of ovarian recovery during AI treatment. All six were premenopausal at breast cancer diagnosis and developed CIA. AMH, follicle-stimulating hormone, and estradiol levels were measured when patients developed clinical signs of ovarian recovery and/or when a gynecological procedure showed evidence of this.

- **Results**: In all six AI-treated women, AMH levels were undetectable despite clinical, biochemical, or pathological evidence of ovarian reactivation following a long period of amenorrhea and sensitive biochemical markers indicating definitive menopause status.

- **Conclusions**: Repeated biochemical monitoring of ovarian function remains important in women with breast cancer undergoing AI treatment because ovarian function can recover, and AIs are not active.

### The FIGO ovulatory disorders classification system [^116Pd2Ln]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Low credibility.

- **Existing system and its value and limitations**: The original WHO classification presented three types of ovulatory dysfunction. Group I included "women with amenorrhea and with little or no evidence of endogenous estrogen activity, including patients with (a) hypogonadotrophic ovarian failure, (b) complete or partial hypopituitarism, or (c) pituitary‐hypothalamic dysfunction". Group II was described as "women with a variety of menstrual cycle disturbances (including amenorrhea) who exhibit distinct estrogen activity (urinary estrogens usually < 10 mcg/24 h), whose urinary and serum gonadotrophins are in the normal range and fluctuating, and who may also have fairly regular spontaneous menstrual bleeds (i.e. 24–38 days apart) but without ovulation". Group III was described as "females with primary ovarian failure (now known as primary ovarian insufficiency; POI) associated with low endogenous estrogen activity and pathologically elevated serum and urinary gonadotrophins". This classification illustrates the now‐outdated assay methodology of the time.

A second monograph was published in 1976, which presented an algorithm based upon whether the serum prolactin concentration was elevated or normal, the response to a progestagen challenge test to assess estrogenization, and whether the serum follicle‐stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration was elevated or normal. The results of these assays were to be used to define seven groups: Group I: Hypothalamic pituitary failure, Group II: Hypothalamic pituitary dysfunction, Group III: Ovarian failure, Group IV: Congenital or acqui.

### Combined hormonal contraceptives for heavy menstrual bleeding [^117HPofq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Menorrhagia, or heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), is an excessive blood loss that impairs a woman's quality of life — whether physical, emotional, social, or material. It is benign and not associated with pregnancy or any other gynecological or systemic disease. Medical treatments used to reduce excessive menstrual blood loss (MBL) include prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors, antifibrinolytics, oral contraceptive pills, and other hormones. The combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) is reported to provide various beneficial effects by inducing regular shedding of a thinner endometrium and inhibiting ovulation, thus addressing both HMB and contraception.

More recently, a contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR) has been tested to assess whether it offers similar benefits to the COCP while minimizing systemic hormonal exposure. This review is an update of a review that initially focused solely on the COCP. The scope has been widened to consider other types of combined hormonal contraceptive delivery for reducing MBL.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy of combined hormonal contraceptives (pills, vaginal ring, or patch) compared with other medical therapies, placebo, or no therapy in treating HMB. A secondary objective was to compare the COCP with the CVR.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Gynecology and Fertility Group trials register, MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and PsycINFO for all randomized controlled trials. The search dates were October 1996, May 2002, June 2004, April 2006, June 2009, July 2017, and September 2018.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116fdu8w]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for menopause, specifically concerning the evaluation of vaginal bleeding, the ES 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining an evaluation to rule out pelvic pathology. It is essential to consider endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, particularly in patients experiencing persistent unscheduled bleeding while undergoing menopausal hormone therapy.

### Pituitary and ovarian hormone activity during the 7-day hormone-free interval of various combined oral contraceptive regimens [^111rnNph]. Contraception (2014). Low credibility.

The objective was to investigate changes in luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), and progesterone (P) during the hormone-free interval (HFI) of six combined oral contraceptives (COCs).

- **Design**: Blood samples were obtained from 62 women.

- **Results**: When COCs were grouped by ethinyl estradiol (EE) dose, there was a significant positive mean slope for LH and FSH during the HFI for the 30- and 35 mcg-EE doses, whereas 20 showed a gradual nonsignificant slope. All E2 slopes were significant. P remained suppressed with all doses.

- **Conclusion**: A more rapid rebound of gonadotropin levels is found with higher doses of EE during the HFI.

- **Implications**: This study showed a more rapid rebound of pituitary hormone levels among women using higher-EE-dosage formulations, which was demonstrated by the statistically significant slope for mean LH and FSH from day 1 to day 7 of the HFI. The degree of suppression did not vary across progestin generations. It remains to be established whether women who experience side effects during their HFI may benefit from using a COC with a lower EE dose to minimize changes in endogenous pituitary hormone levels.

### Managing menopause [^115ojchb]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for menopause, specifically in the evaluation of sexual dysfunction, the SOGC 2014 guidelines recommend eliciting a brief sexual screening history as part of the medical history of menopausal females. Interventions should be pursued only if the patient is distressed about the problem.

### Occurrence of postmenopausal-like acidic follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) isoforms precedes the rise of FSH before menopause [^112YNiP6]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the glycoform distribution patterns of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) during the menstrual cycle at different ages and FSH levels, after menopause, and with premature ovarian failure (POF).

- **Design**: Controlled clinical study.
- **Setting**: Conducted with healthy volunteers in an academic research environment.
- **Patients**: The study included women aged 20 to 25 years with normal early follicular (EF) serum FSH levels (< 10 IU/L), women aged 40 to 45 years with normal or increased EF serum FSH, postmenopausal women, and women with POF.
- **Interventions**: None.
- **Main outcome measures**: The primary measure was the assessment of FSH and LH glycoform distributions through chromatofocusing.

- **Results**: In both postmenopausal women and those with POF, more acidic FSH glycoforms were found compared with young cyclic premenopausal women. Among women aged 40 to 45 years with normal FSH levels, these acidic glycoform profiles already showed a statistically significant difference from the younger cohort. This difference was attributable to the early follicular and luteal cycle phases. Overall, during aging and after ovarian failure, FSH becomes more acidic, a difference that is statistically significantly detectable in premenopausal older women before FSH levels rise, unlike for LH glycoforms.

- **Conclusions**: The occurrence of postmenopausal-like acidic FSH isoforms precedes the rise of FSH before menopause.

### Loestrinfe 28 day [^1146UvQT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Starting the pack late increases the likelihood of pregnancy. The more pills you miss, the higher this risk becomes. Many women experience spotting, light bleeding, or nausea during the first one to three packs of pills. If you notice these symptoms, continue taking the pill as the issue usually resolves itself. If it persists, consult your doctor or clinic.

Missing pills can also lead to spotting or light bleeding, even if you compensate by taking missed pills later. On the days you take two pills to make up for missed ones, you might feel slightly nauseous.

- **Vomiting, diarrhea, or certain medications**: If you have vomiting, diarrhea, or take specific medicines, including some antibiotics, your birth control pills may be less effective. Use a back-up contraceptive method, such as condoms or foam, until you consult your doctor or clinic.

- **Forgetfulness**: If you struggle to remember to take your pill, talk to your doctor or clinic about strategies to improve adherence or consider alternative contraceptive methods.

- **Queries or uncertainties**: If you have any questions or uncertainties about the information in this leaflet, contact your doctor or clinic.

Decide on a specific time of day to take your pill. It is crucial to take it at approximately the same time each day. Look at your pill pack to determine if it contains 21 or 28 pills.

### Short-term (1–2 mo) hormone therapy cessation before mammography [^1124h9F5]. Menopause (2009). Low credibility.

Some healthcare providers recommend hormone therapy (HT) cessation before mammography to improve performance. Our objective was to evaluate the characteristics of women willing to consider HT cessation before screening mammography.

We performed a randomized clinical trial, the Radiological Evaluation and Breast Density study, within an integrated health plan (2004–2007). Women aged 45 to 80 years who used HT at their most recent screening (index) mammogram, who were due for a screening (study) mammogram, and who were still using HT were invited to participate. Randomization groups were: (1) no cessation, (2) 1-month cessation, or (3) 2-month cessation. Women's willingness to participate was evaluated by age, race, ethnicity, education, hysterectomy, type of HT (unopposed estrogen and estrogen plus progestin), duration of HT use, body mass index, breast cancer risk, and breast density.

A total of 5,861 women were invited to participate; 2,999 refused. An additional 169 women agreed to participate but withdrew before data collection. Compared with women who participated (n = 1,535), nonparticipants (n = 3,168; 2,999 + 169; 54%) were older, less educated, and had a lower body mass index (all P < 0.05). Among nonparticipants, 1,876 (59.2%) were unwilling to stop HT. Among estrogen-plus-progestin users, women with a first-degree relative with a history of breast cancer had lower odds of refusal than women without a family history of breast cancer (adjusted odds ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54–0.93).

Most women were unwilling to stop HT, even for a short period.

### Gonal-f [^111KVsXk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prior to the initiation of treatment with Gonal-F, a complete gynecologic and endocrinologic evaluation should be performed. It is essential to exclude primary ovarian failure, the possibility of pregnancy, and to demonstrate tubal patency. Additionally, the fertility status of the male partner should be evaluated.

The dosing scheme for ovulation induction is stepwise and individualized for each woman [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Administer a starting dose of 75 International Units of Gonal-F subcutaneously daily for 14 days in the first cycle of use.

In subsequent cycles, determine the starting dose and dosage adjustments of Gonal-F based on the woman's history of ovarian response to Gonal-F. If the ovarian response after the initial 14 days indicates, make an incremental adjustment in dose of up to 37.5 International Units. Additional incremental adjustments in the dose, up to 37.5 International Units, may be made every 7 days if indicated by the ovarian response. Treatment should continue until follicular growth and/or serum estradiol levels indicate an adequate ovarian response.

- **Considerations for individualized dosing**: Use the lowest dose of Gonal-F consistent with the expectation of good results. Appropriate Gonal-F dose adjustments should be used to prevent multiple follicular growth and cycle cancellation. The maximum individualized daily dose of Gonal-F should not exceed 300 International Units per day. In general, do not exceed 35 days of treatment unless an estradiol rise indicates imminent follicular development. When pre-ovulatory conditions are reached, administer human chorionic gonadot…

### Symptom experience during the late reproductive stage and the menopausal transition: Observations from the Women Living Better survey [^1117paTV]. Menopause (2021). Low credibility.

In the first part of the five-part survey, we invited women to describe their menstrual patterns, report changes they perceived, and share whether and how they tracked their cycles. The second part queried about symptoms sometimes associated with the menopausal transition as well as their frequency and degree of bother. In the third part, participants were asked to indicate how much their symptoms interfered with their lives. They also identified their most bothersome symptom and whether they had consulted a healthcare provider about it. Participants were invited to comment on their healthcare experience.

The fourth part asked about their overall health, satisfaction with the mix of activities in their lives, and levels of stress. In addition, they were asked to share what activities they did for self-care and to manage stress. The final section included demographic characteristics.

The Office for Human Subjects Division at the University of Washington deemed the Women Living Better survey exempt from further human subjects' review. Women were advised that their responses might be used as part of aggregated information to share with women broadly, to let them know what their contemporaries are experiencing and allow them to feel less alone. The findings could be shared with women's health scientific researchers to help enhance their understanding of this life phase and with healthcare providers who care for midlife women. Continuance with the survey was interpreted as confirmation that participants were comfortable with these potential uses of their anonymous data.

### Anti-Müllerian hormone levels among contraceptive users: Evidence from a cross-sectional cohort of 27,125 individuals [^115hjFfz]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Anti-Müllerian hormone has become the clinical biomarker-based standard to assess ovarian reserve. As anti-Müllerian hormone testing becomes more common, more individuals are seeking to interpret the values obtained while using contraceptives. To appropriately counsel women, a better understanding of anti-Müllerian hormone levels in women using different contraceptives is needed.

- **Objective**: To study the association between different forms of contraceptives and anti-Müllerian levels in women of reproductive age.

- **Study design**: This is a cross-sectional study including 27,125 US-based women aged 20 to 46 years, accessing reproductive hormone results through Modern Fertility and who provided informed consent to participate in the research. Anti-Müllerian hormone levels were collected through dried blood spot card (95.9%) or venipuncture (4.1%). Previous work has shown a high correlation between hormone levels collected by these two methods. Multiple linear regressions were run to compare anti-Müllerian hormone levels in women using contraceptives with women not on any contraceptive, controlling for age, age of menarche, body mass index, smoking, sample collection method, cycle day, and self-reported polycystic ovary syndrome diagnosis. We also analyzed whether the duration of contraceptive use predicted anti-Müllerian hormone levels in users of the hormonal intrauterine device and combined oral contraceptive pill, given the size of these contraceptive groups.

### Two-day low-dose dexamethasone suppression test more accurate than overnight 1-mg in women taking oral contraceptives [^113Racvy]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Even though the simplest way to avoid a false positive test is to stop the use of combined oral contraceptives (COC) before a dexamethasone suppression test (DST), some women prefer to avoid an interruption of their COC for personal reasons. We evaluated in volunteers whether the two-day DST (2d-DST) is more accurate than the 1 mg-DST in excluding hypercortisolism in women taking COC, thereby negating the need to interrupt COC in all women. As suggested by the most recently published guidelines on the management of adrenal incidentaloma — which recommend 1 mg-DST performance — we categorized DST responses into three subgroups:

- **Normal**: Cortisol levels lower than 51 nmol/L
- **Intermediate**: Cortisol levels equal to 51–138 nmol/L
- **Frankly altered cortisol suppression**: Cortisol levels higher than 138 nmol/L

We found that the morning baseline plasma cortisol levels decreased to a greater degree after the 2d-DST than after the 1 mg-DST. In investigating the cortisol response subgroups, we demonstrated a significantly higher proportion of doubtful or abnormal results after the 1 mg-DST (63%) compared to after the 2d-DST (27%). In other words, the 2d-DST allowed for the recovery of a normal response in more than half of the patients who obtained a false positive result following the 1 mg-DST. To the best of our knowledge, the superiority of the 2d-DST over the 1 mg-DST in a healthy population has not been demonstrated to date. However, in our population of healthy women using oral contraceptives, the specificity of the 1 mg-DST and 2d-DST is lower (37.0% and 73.1%, respectively) than the reported accuracy of the different tests for the diagnosis of Cushing's.

### Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists for assisted reproductive technology [^111DPFCh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists can be used to prevent a luteinizing hormone (LH) surge during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) without the hypo-oestrogenic side effects, flare-up, or long down-regulation period associated with agonists. The antagonists directly and rapidly inhibit gonadotrophin release within several hours through competitive binding to pituitary GnRH receptors. This property allows their use at any time during the follicular phase. Several different regimens have been described, including multiple-dose fixed (0.25 mg daily from day six to seven of stimulation), multiple-dose flexible (0.25 mg daily when the leading follicle is 14 to 15 mm), and single-dose (single administration of 3 mg on day 7 to 8 of stimulation) protocols, with or without the addition of an oral contraceptive pill. Furthermore, women receiving antagonists have been shown to have a lower incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Assuming comparable clinical outcomes for the antagonist and agonist protocols, these benefits would justify a change from the standard long agonist protocol to antagonist regimens. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001, and previously updated in 2006 and 2011.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists compared with the standard long protocol of GnRH agonists for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in assisted conception cycles.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register.

### Science-based approach to harmonize contraception recommendations in clinical trials and pharmaceutical labels [^115SebdW]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Low credibility.

For other clinical studies not discussed in the four points above, pregnancy tests are not typically required more than once per month during study treatment unless there is a specific pregnancy safety concern for the pharmaceutical. If protocol-scheduled visits are more than one month apart, then testing is conducted at scheduled visits. If scheduled visits occur infrequently, additional tests may be needed between visits. Additional tests may also be conducted between visits if the subject or investigator suspects pregnancy or prior to a protocol-required procedure that would increase the risk to a pregnant subject.

A pregnancy test should be repeated prior to pharmaceutical re-administration when the administration of the pharmaceutical is disrupted for more than seven days and there was also a lapse in contraceptive use, regardless of the reason for the disruption (e.g. temporary discontinuation of study treatment for an adverse experience or if required by the study design, such as during a washout period before the second arm of a crossover study).

After completion of pharmaceutical dosing, pregnancy testing should continue at a minimum until plasma levels of the pharmaceutical fall to clinically insignificant levels, i.e. after at least five terminal phase half-lives, and any pharmacologic or toxicologic effects relevant to the risk of fetal harm have diminished.

Pregnancy testing without contraception may suffice in cases of drugs with very short exposure times (e.g. imaging agents like contrast media) and/or if study participants remain in-house (e.g. in a phase I unit during).

### Cyred EQ [^114TYPiF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Additional instructions for all dosing regimens: Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In breakthrough bleeding, as in all cases of irregular bleeding from the vagina, nonfunctional causes should be borne in mind. In undiagnosed persistent or abnormal bleeding from the vagina, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. Changing to an oral contraceptive with a higher estrogen content, while potentially useful in minimizing menstrual irregularity, should be done only if necessary since this may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease.

- **Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period**:

	1. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.

	2. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.

### Continuous or extended cycle vs. cyclic use of combined hormonal contraceptives for contraception [^111XzL9V]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

The avoidance of menstruation through continuous or extended administration (greater than 28 days) of combination hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) has gained legitimacy through its use in treating endometriosis, dysmenorrhea, and menstruation-associated symptoms. Avoidance of menstruation through extended or continuous use of CHCs for reasons of personal preference may offer additional advantages to women, including improved compliance, greater satisfaction, fewer menstrual symptoms, and less menstruation-related absenteeism from work or school.

- **Objectives**: To determine the differences between continuous or extended-cycle CHCs (pills, patch, ring) in regimens of greater than 28 days of active hormone compared with traditional cyclic dosing (21 days of active hormone and 7 days of placebo, or 24 days of active hormones and 4 days of placebo). Our hypothesis was that continuous or extended-cycle CHCs have equivalent efficacy and safety but improved bleeding profiles, amenorrhea rates, adherence, continuation, participant satisfaction, and menstrual symptoms compared with standard cyclic CHCs.

- **Search methods**: We searched computerized databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase, POPLINE, LILACS) for trials using continuous or extended CHCs (oral contraceptives, contraceptive ring and patch) during the years 1966 to 2013. We also searched the references in review articles and publications identified for inclusion in the protocol. Investigators were contacted regarding additional references.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

### Can follicle-stimulating hormone be used to define menopausal status [^116psjq3]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the ability of the level of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to distinguish among premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal women.

- **Methods**: We examined cross-sectional and longitudinal data from the second phase of the Massachusetts Women's Health Study (1986 to 1995), a population-based cohort of 427 premenopausal and perimenopausal women identified from the first phase of the Massachusetts Women's Health Study (1981 to 1986).

- **Results**: Boxplots of FSH levels throughout the menopausal transition displayed considerable overlap. Logistic regressions and their resulting receiver operating characteristic curves further demonstrated that, although FSH is a statistically significant predictor of menopausal status, no single value of FSH is expedient for distinguishing premenopausal from perimenopausal or perimenopausal from postmenopausal women.

- **Conclusion**: FSH alone is not an effective predictor of transition into the perimenopausal or postmenopausal period. Specifically, the frequently recommended FSH cutoff of 40 IU/L is inappropriate by itself for clinical determination of postmenopausal status.

Several different regimens have been described, including multiple-dose fixed (0.25 mg daily from day six to seven of stimulation), multiple-dose flexible (0.25 mg daily when the leading follicle is 14 to 15 mm), and single-dose (single administration of 3 mg on day 7 to 8 of stimulation) protocols, with or without the addition of an oral contraceptive pill. Furthermore, women receiving antagonists have been shown to have a lower incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Assuming comparable clinical outcomes for the antagonist and agonist protocols, these benefits would justify a change from the standard long agonist protocol to antagonist regimens. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and previously updated in 2006.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists compared with the standard long protocol of GnRH agonists for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in assisted conception cycles.

- **Search strategy**: We performed electronic searches of major databases, for example, Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility.

### Guideline no. 422a: Menopause: Vasomotor symptoms, prescription therapeutic agents, complementary and alternative medicine, nutrition, and lifestyle [^111nWotn]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for menopause, especially hormone therapy considerations, the SOGC 2021 guidelines recommend offering the following options to perimenopausal patients:

- **Progestogen alone**: This option can be considered for patients who need management of vasomotor symptoms.

- **Low-dose combined hormonal contraceptives**: These can provide symptom relief and additional contraceptive benefits.

- **Menopausal hormone therapy**: This is suitable for symptom management in patients without contraindications.

- **Estrogen in combination with a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system**: This provides both symptom control and contraceptive protection.

### Effects on serum hormone levels of low-dose estrogen in place of placebo during the hormone-free interval of an oral contraceptive [^112xGALf]. Contraception (2008). Low credibility.

The study was conducted to evaluate the effects of low-dose estrogen compared to placebo on ovarian activity during the traditional 7-day hormone-free interval (HFI) of an oral contraceptive (OC).

- **Study design**: Women were randomized to placebo or low-dose estrogen for 7 days during the HFI. Serum levels of estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone, and inhibin B were obtained before, during, and after treatment.

- **Results**: Mean hormone levels remained constant or only increased slightly for the low-dose estrogen group compared to greater, more sustained increases observed for the placebo group. Estradiol, FSH, and inhibin B levels were substantially higher for those on placebo. Differences were most noticeable by the end of the HFI and persisted into the subsequent cycle.

- **Conclusion**: Subjects receiving low-dose estrogen for 7 days during the HFI demonstrated more pronounced ovarian suppression compared to placebo, as evidenced by attenuation of increases in serum inhibin B, FSH, and estradiol levels.

If any of these side effects bother you, call your doctor or healthcare provider.

- **General precautions**:
	- **Missed periods and use of oral contraceptives before or during early pregnancy**: There may be times when you may not menstruate regularly after you have completed taking a cycle of pills. If you have taken your pills regularly and miss one menstrual period, continue taking your pills for the next cycle, but be sure to inform your healthcare provider before doing so. If you have not taken the pills daily as instructed and missed a menstrual period, or if you missed two consecutive menstrual periods, you may be pregnant. Check with your healthcare provider immediately to determine whether you are pregnant. Do not continue to take oral contraceptives until you are sure you are not pregnant, but continue to use another method of contraception.

	- There is no conclusive evidence that oral contraceptive use is associated with an increase in birth defects when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Previously, a few studies had reported that oral contraceptives might be associated with birth defects, but these studies have not been confirmed. Nevertheless, oral contraceptives or any other drugs should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary and prescribed by your doctor. You should check with your doctor about risks to your unborn child of any medication taken during pregnancy.

	- **While breastfeeding**: If you are breastfeeding, consult your doctor before starting oral contraceptives. Some of the drug will be passed on to the child in the milk.

### Dasetta 1/35 [^116io7gK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen aligns with good therapeutic principles. For any estrogen/progestogen combination, the prescribed dosage regimen should contain the least amount of these hormones that is compatible with a low failure rate and meets the individual patient's needs. New acceptors of oral contraceptive agents should be started on preparations with the lowest estrogen content deemed appropriate for the individual patient.

- **Persistence of risk of vascular disease**: There are two studies that have shown persistence of risk of vascular disease for ever-users of oral contraceptives. A study in the United States demonstrated that the risk of developing myocardial infarction after discontinuing oral contraceptives persists for at least nine years for women aged 40–49 who used oral contraceptives for five or more years, but this increased risk was not demonstrated in other age groups. Another study in Great Britain found that the risk of developing cerebrovascular disease persisted for at least six years after discontinuation of oral contraceptives, although the excess risk was very small. However, both studies involved oral contraceptive formulations containing 50 micrograms or more of estrogens.

- **Estimates of mortality from contraceptive use**: One study gathered data from various sources to estimate the mortality rate associated with different contraception methods across different ages. These estimates include the combined risk of death associated with contraceptive methods.

### Norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol [^11142pUz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

If you are transitioning from oral hormone birth control pills, a vaginal contraceptive ring, or another contraceptive transdermal patch to the norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal patch, complete your current cycle. Apply your first norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal patch on the day you would typically start your next oral birth control pill, patch, or insert your next vaginal ring.

If you do not get your period within one week after taking your last active pill, removing your last vaginal ring, or removing your contraceptive transdermal patch, consult with your healthcare provider to ensure you are not pregnant. You may still proceed with starting the norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal patch for contraception.

If you apply the norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal patch more than one week after finishing your last active oral hormone birth control pill, removing your last vaginal ring, or removing your previous contraceptive transdermal patch, use a non-hormonal contraceptive method, such as a condom with spermicide or a diaphragm with spermicide, alongside the norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal patch for the first seven days of patch use.

If you are starting the norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system after childbirth:

### Immediate start of hormonal contraceptives for contraception [^111hYeo9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Health care providers often advise women to wait until their next menses to begin hormonal contraception to avoid usage during an undetected pregnancy. An alternative approach is the immediate start of hormonal contraception with backup birth control for the first seven days. Initially introduced with combined oral contraceptives (COCs), this method has expanded to other hormonal contraceptives. At the time of the initial review, it was unclear how immediate start compared to the conventional menses-dependent start in terms of effectiveness, continuation, and acceptability. The immediate-start approach may improve women's access to, and continuation of, hormonal contraception.

- **Objectives**: This review examined randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of immediate-start hormonal contraception for differences in effectiveness, continuation, and acceptability.

- **Search methods**: In August 2012, we searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, POPLINE, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ICTRP for trials of immediate-start hormonal contraceptives. We contacted researchers to find other studies. Earlier searches also included EMBASE.

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs that compared immediate start to conventional start of hormonal contraception. Also included were trials that compared immediate start of different hormonal contraceptive methods with each other.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were abstracted by two authors and entered into RevMan. The Peto odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated.

- **Main results**: Five studies were included. No new eligible studies were identified.

### Effective use of hormonal contraceptives: Part I: Combined oral contraceptive pills [^112kvdBs]. Contraception (2006). Low credibility.

This systematic review examines evidence regarding when during the menstrual cycle a woman can initiate combined oral contraceptive (COC) use and what can be done if a woman misses COCs. We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for articles published from 1966 to March 2005 related to COC initiation and to the effects of late or missed COCs. We identified 11 studies related to COC initiation and 25 studies related to the effects of missed pills. Evidence from these studies suggested that taking hormonally active pills for 7 consecutive days prevents normal ovulation and that initiating COCs through Day 5 of the menstrual cycle suppresses follicular activity. Studies on the effects of missed COCs generally showed that the risk of ovulation is greatest when the pill-free interval lasts more than 7 days. Limitations of this body of evidence include small sample sizes that may not reflect variation in larger populations, lack of a standard measurement of ovulation, and difficulty in discerning how ovulation resulting from late or missed COCs corresponds to the risk of conception.

### Sex steroid levels in women with hypopituitarism: A case-controlled observational study [^117QNr3w]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Among the eugonadal women with hypopituitarism and the women who served as controls, postmenopausal status was defined by elevated FSH and LH levels (FSH ≥ 27 IU/L; LH ≥ 5.2 IU/L). Women with lower than postmenopausal FSH levels were evaluated with respect to age, FSH, LH, and estradiol levels. As the menopausal status of the women with HH cannot be determined, HH women were categorized into age groups (52 years or younger; older than 52 years), according to the approximate mean age of menopause in the population.

Serum sex steroids [dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), progesterone, 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17αOH-progesterone), androstenedione, estrone, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and estradiol] were analyzed by an in-house validated LC/MS-MS assay, as described previously. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for DHEA, progesterone, 17αOH-progesterone, androstenedione, estrone, testosterone, DHT, and estradiol was 250, 5, 20, 5, 0.5, 5, 13, and 0.5 pg/mL, respectively. SHBG was measured by a chemiluminescent-based SHBG assay validated for clinical use (LIAISON® SHBG, cat. no. 319020, DiaSorin; RRID: AB 2895155), and the DiaSorin LIAISON immunoanalyzer was used. Serum LH (cat. no. 07P9120) and FSH (cat. no. 07P4920) were analyzed by Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassays, Abbott Laboratories, validated for clinical use.

### Antimullerian hormone and obesity: Insights in oral contraceptive users [^117Bn7B5]. Contraception (2010). Low credibility.

The study was conducted to examine the impact of oral contraceptives (OCs) on serum antimullerian hormone (AMH) levels by obesity status in reproductive-age women.

- **Study design**: Ovulatory women, ages 18–35 years, of normal (BMI < 30 kg/m²; n = 10) received a low-dose OC (20 mcg ethinyl estradiol/100 mcg levonorgestrel) for two cycles. Serum samples obtained at several time points during active pill use and hormone-free intervals were analyzed for AMH, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, and inhibin B.

- **Results**: AMH levels did not differ by OC cycle day in either BMI group. On average, AMH levels were 34% lower in the obese group (2.9 ± 2.1 vs. 4.4 ± 1.8 ng/mL, p < 0.05). Modeling to determine differences in AMH throughout the cycle based on obesity status demonstrated significantly lower levels (p < 0.05), whereas serum AMH, FSH, LH, estradiol, and inhibin B levels revealed no correlations when all time points were included.

- **Conclusions**: In reproductive-age women, serum AMH levels do not appear to fluctuate during OC use, but AMH levels are significantly lower in obese women. Lower levels do not appear to be due to differences in gonadotropin levels or ovarian activity.

### Apri28 day [^114XuCmd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In breakthrough bleeding, as in all cases of irregular bleeding from the vagina, nonfunctional causes should be considered. In undiagnosed, persistent, or abnormal bleeding from the vagina, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. Changing to an oral contraceptive with a higher estrogen content, while potentially useful in minimizing menstrual irregularity, should be done only if necessary since this may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease.

- **Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period**: If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period, and oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.

### Measures of menopause driven differences in levels of blood lipids, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone in women aged 35 to 60 years: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2002 study [^111WPKon]. Menopause (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to assess the association of the menopausal transition with differences in lipid and endogenous hormone levels in normal (18.5 kg/m² ≤ body mass index (BMI) ≤ 24.99 kg/m²) and overweight (BMI > 24.99 kg/m²) women.

The study was conducted on women aged 35 to 60 years from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted between the years 1999 and 2002. Menstrual cycle-based menopause status was defined for women who had not undergone surgical menopause, did not use contraceptives, did not smoke, and did not breast-feed during the examination, determined by months since the last period (12 months for premenopause, perimenopause, and postmenopause, respectively).

There were no significant differences in age-adjusted total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels among the menopausal periods in the normal BMI class. However, the pattern of differences in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels differed between the normal and obese BMI classes. The activity of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone was statistically different between premenopause and perimenopause, and between premenopause and postmenopause in the normal BMI class. A different picture was observed for the analysis of differences in raw parameters; in this case, more differences between menopausal phases were noted for all studied parameters.

Aging plays a role.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^111Efeue]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for menopause, specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, the 2015 ES guidelines recommend considering a presumptive diagnosis of menopause based on the presence of vasomotor symptoms. When indicated, laboratory testing of FSH and serum estradiol should be conducted if establishing a diagnosis of menopause is necessary in females who have undergone a hysterectomy without bilateral oophorectomy or have a menstrual history inadequate to ascertain menopausal status.
