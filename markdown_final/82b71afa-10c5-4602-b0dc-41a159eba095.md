## Question

If Xifaxan isn't covered, what is an alternative?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what alternatives to Xifaxan (rifaximin) are available if it isn't covered, organized by indication, with practical notes for coverage issues. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the primary indication driving the rifaximin prescription, because alternatives differ by condition. Then, I should verify the comparative efficacy and guideline hierarchy for each condition. Next, I will review dosing context and key trial data that inform equivalence or adjunctive roles. After that, I need to ensure safety considerations and antimicrobial resistance risks are incorporated. Finally, I will consider cost/coverage pragmatics and summarize indication-specific alternatives clearly.

> Let me first confirm the labeled and guideline-backed use-cases for rifaximin so I do not mix indications; rifaximin is indicated for traveler's diarrhea, hepatic encephalopathy (HE), and IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), which means any "alternative" must be matched to the condition being treated to remain evidence-based and payer-aligned, and for traveler's diarrhea specifically, the labeled adult dosing is 200 mg TID for 3 days, which also frames how head-to-head trials compared antibiotics and symptomatic agents in that setting [^112TykzU] [^113zANwk].

> For traveler's diarrhea, I will now examine antibiotic and symptomatic alternatives: ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID performed comparably to rifaximin 200 mg TID across sites in a randomized double-blind trial with similar median time to last unformed stool, though rifaximin was less effective against invasive pathogens, so I should be cautious to consider fever/dysentery or local resistance patterns before substituting blindly; loperamide alone provides symptomatic relief more slowly, but when combined with rifaximin it accelerated symptom resolution versus monotherapy, which suggests that if an antibiotic is not covered, loperamide remains a low-cost, OTC symptomatic option albeit with slower recovery than antibiotics in the trial data, and I should double-check for red flags (fever, blood) where antimotility agents are generally avoided pending evaluation [^115cishQ] [^1112EXvo] [^111qMpim].

> For hepatic encephalopathy, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about replacing rifaximin; I need to check the guideline sequence: lactulose is the first-line standard both for acute management and for secondary prevention, while rifaximin is typically added to lactulose in patients with recurrent OHE to reduce recurrences and hospitalizations, supported by randomized data demonstrating improved reversal rates and mortality when rifaximin is added to lactulose compared with lactulose alone, and high-quality evidence synthesis and society guidance consistently place lactulose ahead of rifaximin as monotherapy, which makes lactulose the primary alternative if rifaximin is not covered; I should also confirm hepatic dosing cautions with rifaximin in advanced Child-Pugh C for safety completeness even though the alternative here is lactulose [^115HfJEU] [^114qs6Kt] [^116xuBtE] [^111CCTPK].

> For IBS-D, let me reconsider the substitution logic because I almost said "use another antibiotic", but wait, I should verify guideline positions; both the BSG 2021 and AGA 2022 guidelines recommend rifaximin for IBS-D, and the AGA further supports repeat courses in prior responders with recurrence, whereas other antibiotics occasionally used for suspected SIBO (for example ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, metronidazole, neomycin) appear in narrative reviews but are not guideline-endorsed first-line alternatives for IBS-D, so I should be explicit that these agents are not a like-for-like, evidence-based replacement for rifaximin in IBS-D; supportive trial work shows rifaximin improves IBS-D symptoms and quality of life and can be retreated upon relapse, further underscoring that true "alternatives" should be drawn from comprehensive IBS-D guidelines rather than SIBO narratives, though those broader IBS-D options were not detailed in the rifaximin-focused documents here [^116qeS12] [^111eo9ny] [^1113DiZv] [^113s3uac].

> Next, I should review practical coverage considerations that are likely to sway real-world substitution; lactulose is inexpensive, generic, and guideline-recommended first-line for HE, making it the logical coverage-friendly alternative if rifaximin is denied; ciprofloxacin is a low-cost generic with randomized evidence for traveler's diarrhea and loperamide is OTC for symptomatic control, so for travel-related illness these choices typically align with affordability and access if rifaximin is not covered, whereas for IBS-D, if rifaximin is not covered, I need to ensure the care plan follows IBS-D guideline pathways rather than ad hoc antibiotic substitution that lacks endorsement in this context [^115HfJEU] [^115cishQ] [^1112EXvo].

> I should confirm safety and stewardship guardrails before finalizing any switch; rifaximin is generally well tolerated but can be associated with adverse effects including gastrointestinal upset and rare C. difficile colitis, and labels flag pseudomembranous colitis precautions; additionally, repeated or widespread rifamycin use can select for rpoB-mediated resistance with cross-resistance concerns, with reports noting increases in rifaximin resistance where use is extensive, so I need to avoid indiscriminate antibiotic substitution and prioritize guideline-concordant therapy, especially in recurrent CDI where rifaximin "chasers" have been explored but resistance remains a caution; for those with advanced liver disease, I should verify labeling cautions for Child-Pugh C if rifaximin is being considered or continued, even as lactulose takes precedence as the alternative [^113grfvX] [^116ZSms5] [^1174FUtS] [^111yWZ2a] [^111CCTPK].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the alternative clearly matches the indication: for traveler's diarrhea, ciprofloxacin is an evidence-based antibiotic alternative and loperamide provides a lower-cost symptomatic option, recognizing invasive pathogen scenarios and local resistance may influence choice; for hepatic encephalopathy, lactulose is the standard first-line alternative and rifaximin is typically an add-on to lactulose, not a replacement; for IBS-D, there is no direct antibiotic "equivalent" to rifaximin endorsed as first-line in these documents, so management should defer to IBS-D guidelines with rifaximin as the recommended option and retreatment in responders, rather than substituting systemic antibiotics used for SIBO in narrative reviews, and all changes should be made under clinician supervision to balance efficacy, safety, and stewardship [^115cishQ] [^1112EXvo] [^115HfJEU] [^114qs6Kt] [^116qeS12] [^111eo9ny] [^1113DiZv].

---

If Xifaxan (rifaximin) is not covered, **preferred alternatives** are **lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy** [^115HfJEU] and **loperamide or eluxadoline for IBS-D**. For travelers' diarrhea, use **ciprofloxacin or azithromycin** [^115cishQ] if invasive pathogens are suspected; use loperamide for symptom control [^1112EXvo]. Lactulose is **first-line for HE** [^113wkRFv] and can be combined with neomycin or metronidazole if needed; **loperamide is first-line for IBS-D**, with eluxadoline or bile acid sequestrants if symptoms persist. These recommendations are supported by guidelines and clinical evidence.

---

## Hepatic encephalopathy (HE)

### First-line alternative: lactulose

- **Mechanism of action**: Non-absorbable disaccharide that reduces ammonia absorption by acidifying colonic contents and promoting ammonia excretion.

- **Clinical evidence**: Lactulose is recommended as first-line therapy for acute treatment and prevention of HE recurrence [^113wkRFv] [^115HfJEU].

- **Efficacy**: Lactulose significantly reduces HE recurrence and improves quality of life [^115L9Xru] [^114Y5NkF].

- **Safety**: Common adverse effects include diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal discomfort; dose adjustments can mitigate these effects [^111jwtPz].

---

### Second-line alternatives

Second-line options include **Neomycin**, an oral aminoglycoside that reduces intestinal ammonia-producing bacteria and is used when lactulose is insufficient or not tolerated, and **Metronidazole**, an alternative antibiotic, though long-term use is limited by potential neurotoxicity.

---

## Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D)

### First-line alternative: loperamide

- **Mechanism of action**: Peripheral μ-opioid receptor agonist that slows intestinal transit, reducing diarrhea frequency.

- **Clinical evidence**: Loperamide is recommended as first-line therapy for IBS-D symptom control.

- **Efficacy**: Effective in reducing stool frequency and improving consistency, though less effective for abdominal pain and bloating.

- **Safety**: Generally well-tolerated; constipation is the most common adverse effect.

---

### Second-line alternatives

Second-line options include **Eluxadoline**, a mixed μ-opioid receptor agonist and δ-opioid receptor antagonist effective for reducing diarrhea and abdominal pain, and **Bile acid sequestrants (e.g. cholestyramine)**, which are useful when bile acid malabsorption contributes to IBS-D symptoms.

---

## Travelers' diarrhea

### First-line alternatives

- **Ciprofloxacin**: A fluoroquinolone antibiotic effective against invasive bacterial pathogens [^115cishQ].

- **Azithromycin**: A macrolide antibiotic effective against Campylobacter and other invasive pathogens.

- **Loperamide**: Effective for symptomatic relief in non-invasive travelers' diarrhea [^1112EXvo].

---

## Clinical considerations

Clinical considerations should include **patient-specific factors** such as comorbidities, medication tolerability, and potential drug interactions. Cost-effectiveness favors **lactulose and loperamide** compared with rifaximin, and treatment selection should align with current guideline recommendations.

---

If Xifaxan is not covered, **lactulose is the primary alternative for hepatic encephalopathy** [^115HfJEU], and loperamide or eluxadoline are suitable for IBS-D. For travelers' diarrhea, ciprofloxacin or azithromycin are effective alternatives [^115cishQ].

### Treatment of travelers' diarrhea: randomized trial comparing rifaximin, rifaximin plus loperamide, and loperamide alone [^1112EXvo]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Antimotility agents provide rapid temporary relief of acute diarrhea, whereas antibiotics slowly cure the illness. Thus, the combination of an antimotility agent and an antibiotic may provide greater therapeutic benefit than either drug alone. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of rifaximin-loperamide in the treatment of travelers' diarrhea.

- **Methods**: Consenting adults with acute diarrhea (≥ 3 unformed stools in 24 hours with ≥ 1 symptom of enteric infection) were randomized to receive rifaximin 200 mg three times daily for three days; loperamide 4 mg initially followed by 2 mg after each unformed stool; or a combination of both drugs using the same dosing regimen. The primary endpoint was the median time from beginning therapy until passing the last unformed stool.

- **Results**: A total of 310 patients completed treatment with rifaximin (n = 102), loperamide (n = 104), or rifaximin-loperamide combination therapy (n = 104). The groups showed demographic similarity. Rifaximin and rifaximin-loperamide significantly reduced the median time until passage of the last unformed stool (32.5 ± 4.14 h and 27.3 ± 4.13 h, respectively) compared to loperamide (69 ± 4.11 h; p = 0.0019). The mean number of unformed stools passed during illness was lower with rifaximin-loperamide (3.99 ± 4.28) compared with rifaximin (6.23 ± 6.90; p = 0.004) or loperamide alone (6.72 ± 6.93; p = 0.002). All treatments were well tolerated with a low incidence of adverse events.

- **Conclusions**: Rifaximin-loperamide therapy provided rapid symptomatic improvement and greater overall well-being.

### A randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of rifaximin compared with placebo and with ciprofloxacin in the treatment of travelers' diarrhea [^115cishQ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2006). High credibility.

This study evaluated the efficacy of rifaximin compared to placebo and ciprofloxacin in the treatment of travelers' diarrhea through a randomized, double-blind clinical trial. Adult travelers (N = 399) visiting travel clinics in Mexico, Guatemala, and India were randomized to receive rifaximin (200 mg three times a day), ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice a day and placebo once a day), or placebo three times a day for three days. Participants documented stool time and consistency along with symptoms for five days post-treatment in daily diaries.

Stool samples were collected for microbiologic assessments before and after treatment. The median time to last unformed stool (TLUS) in the rifaximin group was 32.0 hours, which was significantly shorter than the placebo group at 65.5 hours (P = 0.001; risk ratio 1.6; 95% confidence interval 1.2, 2.2), demonstrating the primary efficacy endpoint. The median TLUS for the ciprofloxacin group was 28.8 hours (P = 0.0003 versus placebo; P = 0.35 versus rifaximin). Rifaximin was found to be less effective than ciprofloxacin against invasive intestinal bacterial pathogens, yet it remains a safe and effective option for treating travelers' diarrhea caused by non-invasive pathogens.

### Quality of life as a therapeutic objective in the management of hepatic encephalopathy and the potential role of rifaximin-α [^113wkRFv]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy is a brain dysfunction caused by either liver insufficiency, portosystemic shunting, or both, manifesting as a wide spectrum of neurologic or psychiatric abnormalities, ranging from subclinical alterations to coma. Although the etiology of hepatic encephalopathy has not been conclusively established, its pathophysiology is thought to involve elevated blood levels of gut-derived neurotoxins (particularly ammonia) entering the brain, due to the inability of the damaged liver to remove them from the blood circulation. Systemic inflammation, neuroinflammation, and endotoxemia are also thought to be implicated. Hepatic encephalopathy is one of the most debilitating complications of liver disease and is associated with increased mortality. It negatively affects patients' quality of life (QoL), both physically and mentally, resulting in a substantial burden on the lives of both patients and caregivers. The economic burden of hepatic encephalopathy is also profound.

Hepatic encephalopathy guidelines recommend both the active treatment of overt hepatic encephalopathy and secondary prophylaxis to prevent hepatic encephalopathy recurrence. Lactulose is recommended as the first choice for acute treatment and for the prevention of recurrence. Rifaximin is recommended as adjunctive therapy to lactulose for the prevention of overt hepatic encephalopathy recurrence after the second episode. The guidelines also recommend that prophylactic therapy be continued, unless precipitating factors (e.g. variceal bleeding, infections) have been addressed.

### Mechanism of action and therapeutic benefit of rifaximin in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: a narrative review [^116Nt5sG]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder of gut-brain interactions characterized by recurrent bouts of abdominal pain and altered bowel habits; patients also often experience bloating. IBS is further characterized by the predominant stool form observed: IBS with constipation (IBS-C), IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), and IBS with a mixture of constipation and diarrhea (IBS-M). IBS is one of the most common gastrointestinal (GI) conditions, with a pooled worldwide prevalence ranging from 8.8% to 11.2%. A three-country survey using ROME IV IBS diagnostic criteria reported estimated prevalence rates of 5.5% and 7.5% (overall and specifically for females, respectively) in the United Kingdom, 5.7% and 7.8% in Canada, and 6.1% and 7.1% in the United States.

The pathophysiology of IBS is multifactorial in nature, and it is thought to include contributions from factors such as gut microbiota dysbiosis, altered intestinal and colonic permeability, GI immune cell activation, visceral hypersensitivity, and abnormal gut-brain interactions. The goal of this narrative review is to provide an overview of the factors proposed to be involved in IBS pathophysiology and to discuss the role rifaximin may play in modulating these pathophysiologic factors and improving symptoms in patients with IBS.

### Repeat treatment with rifaximin improves irritable bowel syndrome-related quality of life: A secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113s3uac]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

This study is a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase III trial [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01543178]. The patient population and study design have been previously described. Briefly, individuals aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of IBS, based on Rome III criteria, were included. Eligible participants had average symptom severity scores of 3 or higher for IBS-related abdominal pain (on a scale from 0, no pain, to 10, worst possible pain) and bloating (on a scale from 0, not at all, to 6, a very great deal) during the screening phase. Additionally, they needed to have stools for 2 or more days per week meeting Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) criteria for type 6 or type 7 consistency.

During the screening phase, which lasted 10 ± 3 days, all patients received a single-blind placebo three times a day and reported daily IBS-related symptoms. In the open-label treatment phase, patients were given rifaximin 550 mg three times a day for 2 weeks, followed by a 4-week treatment-free follow-up period during which response was evaluated. A response was defined as meeting weekly response criteria for both abdominal pain (an improvement of 30% or more from baseline in mean weekly pain score) and stool consistency (a decrease of 50% or more from baseline in the number of days per week with BSS type 6 or 7 stools) during at least 2 of the 4 weeks. Nonresponders to the open-label rifaximin were withdrawn from the study. Responders were subsequently observed without treatment for up to 18 additional weeks or until relapse.

### Repeat treatment with rifaximin improves irritable bowel syndrome-related quality of life: a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115Cy74N]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain related to defecation, along with altered bowel function such as changes in the form or frequency of stool. These symptoms affect health-related quality of life (QOL). IBS can be further subdivided by stool consistency: constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C), diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), or a combination of both (IBS-M). Patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms of IBS often require more intensive management with prescription therapies.

IBS negatively impacts aspects of patients' daily activity and social well-being, including work productivity, social activities, and travel. Patients with IBS participating in a web-based survey reported a restriction of daily activities on approximately 73 days per year, constituting 20% annually. Moreover, 13% of respondents indicated not working due to health-related reasons. Patients with IBS cited several factors they believed to be associated with the severity of IBS symptoms, such as pain (80%), bowel difficulties (74%), bloating (69%), and dietary limitations (69%). The number of factors cited was directly correlated with an increase in IBS symptom severity.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^115L9Xru]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

This systematic review shows an increasing body of evidence for the use of rifaximin in addition to lactulose, and for lactulose therapy alone, in the long-term management of patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE). In line with the guidelines, this evidence supports the use of lactulose therapy as secondary prophylaxis for the prevention of recurrence of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) events over the long term. In addition, one study has shown the effectiveness of lactulose as primary prophylaxis in the prevention of long-term OHE occurrence. Although there is very little direct head-to-head evidence of rifaximin versus lactulose over the long term, there is considerable evidence to support recommendations for the use of rifaximin as an add-on treatment to standard lactulose therapy in the secondary prophylaxis setting.

In terms of effectiveness, several long-term, open-label clinical trials and clinical practice studies have shown that, when added to lactulose therapy, rifaximin significantly reduces the recurrence of OHE events and the rate of HE-related hospitalization compared to lactulose therapy alone. An exception to this was a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial carried out by Ali et al, in which rifaximin was found to be no better than a placebo when combined with lactulose therapy as secondary prophylaxis against OHE recurrence. In discussing the potential reasons for the discrepancy in the findings of this trial compared with those of the phase III trial by Bass et al, the authors point out that the study populations differed in terms of the primary etiology of cirrhosis.

### Mechanism of action and therapeutic benefit of rifaximin in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: a narrative review [^113b4myo]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Antibiotic use and its paradoxical association with IBS**: Antibiotic use within the previous year has been associated with an increased risk of development of IBS (RR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1–3.1). For the development of PI-IBS, the odds increased if there was antibiotic use at the time of gastroenteritis, based on a meta-analysis of seven studies (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2–2.4). In addition, findings of a population-based study reported that treatment of nonenteric infections with antibiotics was significantly associated with the development of IBS at a later date (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2–4.3; p = 0.01).

Paradoxically, treatment of IBS may include antibiotic therapy. Indeed, eradication of SIBO by antibiotics (e.g. ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, metronidazole, neomycin, rifaximin) has been shown to improve IBS symptoms in a subset of patients. In one study, eradication of SIBO (i.e. based on lactulose hydrogen breath test results no longer showing two peaks, no hydrogen production < 90 min after lactulose consumption, and an absolute change in hydrogen concentration ≤ 20 ppm) in patients with IBS was associated with a significant decrease from baseline in abdominal pain (p < 0.001) and diarrhea (p < 0.05). Moreover, almost half of the patients who achieved eradication of SIBO in that study no longer met Rome criteria for IBS. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, a greater percentage of patients with IBS and comorbid SIBO (duodenal aspirate of ≥ 10⁵ cfu/ml; n = 8) receiving norfloxacin 400 mg twice daily for 10 days achieved global symptom relief compared with patients with IBS.

### Repeat treatment with rifaximin improves irritable bowel syndrome-related quality of life: a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113G5rSZ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

A limitation of the study is that patients who responded to open-label rifaximin but did not relapse during the 18-week treatment-free observation phase discontinued from the study per protocol. Therefore, further assessment of this non-relapsing patient population was not conducted to evaluate the duration of improvement in IBS-QOL scores beyond a total of 18 weeks after response was assessed.

Another limitation of the study is that when data were missing for an item within the subdomains of the IBS-QOL instrument, scores were not calculated at a given time point, limiting the data available for some assessments during the study. Data from some assessments included a small number of patients, such as those who only received one repeat treatment course.

In addition, some components of the IBS-QOL instrument, although a valid instrument for IBS-D, have been reported not to be optimal for patients with IBS-D, and thus using this instrument may not have fully assessed the condition of IBS-D or the potential impact of treatments. This study was not sufficiently powered to examine specific demographic and baseline disease characteristics previously shown to be associated with QOL in patients with IBS-D, such as sex, and these analyses were not conducted. Finally, this study did not compare improvement in QOL with patient daily activities, which are often impaired by IBS.

In conclusion, patients with IBS-D receiving short-term (2-week) repeat treatment with rifaximin experienced clinically meaningful improvements in QOL.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^112bUHhA]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

The review examines the effectiveness of long-term (more than six months) treatment of hepatic encephalopathy using rifaximin and/or lactulose.

Manual assessment of articles containing primary clinical data identified long-term effectiveness outcomes for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. Eight articles reported outcomes for treatment with lactulose alone, while 19 articles reported outcomes for treatment with rifaximin, either alone or in combination with lactulose.

- **NNT analyses**: NNT (number needed to treat) analyses were conducted on studies that reported at least six months of secondary prophylaxis. Comparisons included lactulose versus no lactulose (n = 1), lactulose versus placebo (n = 1), rifaximin combined with lactulose versus placebo combined with lactulose (n = 2), and rifaximin monotherapy versus rifaximin combined with lactulose (n = 1).

Details of studies including more than 100 patients are summarized in greater detail later in the text.

- **Figures and tables**: The tables report effectiveness outcomes over the long term (six or more months) for patients treated with rifaximin and/or lactulose. Articles reporting data for both rifaximin and lactulose are presented within the rifaximin section, while those exclusive to lactulose, without rifaximin data, are presented in the lactulose section. Figures provide NNTs along with 95% confidence intervals for comparisons among the treatment groups.

### The efficacy and safety of rifaximin for the irritable bowel syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115xZPr7]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects 10–15% of the population, and treatment options are limited. Rifaximin is a minimally absorbed antibiotic that has shown efficacy in IBS patients. The objective of this study was to perform a meta-analysis and systematic review of available randomized, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of rifaximin in patients with IBS.

The study performed a systematic literature search of multiple online electronic databases irrespective of language. Inclusion criteria entailed randomized, placebo-controlled trials and IBS defined by accepted symptom-based criteria. Meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of combined studies for the primary and secondary outcomes using a random-effects model based on the DerSimonian and Laird method to reflect both within- and between-study variability. Heterogeneity was assessed using the χ² test and the inconsistency index statistic (I²), with significant heterogeneity defined as I² ≥ 25%. Meta-regression was performed using a generalized linear mixed-effects model and study as random effects to estimate the summary OR adjusting for covariate differences across studies and treatment groups. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plot analysis.

The systematic review identified 13,700 citations. Eighteen were deemed potentially relevant, of which five articles met eligibility. The meta-analysis found rifaximin to be more efficacious than placebo for global IBS symptom improvement (OR = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.22, 2).

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^111W6ngN]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Historically, the NNT measure was designed to quantify treatment benefit directly in terms of the number of patients who would need to be treated before a benefit is observed, thereby providing a means of expressing absolute, as opposed to relative, risk in a clinically meaningful way. Although the number of studies eligible for inclusion in the NNT analyses was limited, the results showed that, in terms of long-term secondary prophylaxis for the prevention of OHE recurrence, approximately four patients would need to be treated with lactulose before clinical benefit is observed, compared with no treatment or placebo. This must be considered within the clinical context showing a very high rate of OHE recurrence with no prophylaxis or with poor adherence to lactulose therapy. Importantly, to show the add-on benefit of rifaximin to lactulose, the NNT is approximately four patients to prevent the recurrence of OHE. The relatively low NNT value for adding rifaximin to lactulose therapy provides further support for the clinical benefit of these treatments for the prevention of OHE recurrence over the long term. Only one study compared rifaximin monotherapy versus rifaximin+lactulose, and NNT analysis showed that approximately seven patients would need to be treated with rifaximin monotherapy before clinical benefit is observed in comparison with rifaximin+lactulose. However, the results of this single study should be viewed with caution, not only because the 95% CI was very wide but also because the study design was such that patients who received rifaximin monotherapy…

### A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial comparing rifaximin plus lactulose with lactulose alone in treatment of overt hepatic encephalopathy [^116xuBtE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is associated with a poor prognosis in cirrhosis. Drugs used in the treatment of HE are primarily directed at the reduction of blood ammonia levels. Rifaximin and lactulose have been shown to be effective in HE. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of rifaximin plus lactulose versus lactulose alone for the treatment of overt HE.

- **Methods**: In this prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial, 120 patients with overt HE were randomized into two groups: group A received lactulose plus rifaximin 1,200 mg/day (n = 63), and group B received lactulose plus placebo (n = 57). The primary endpoint was the complete reversal of HE, while the secondary endpoints included mortality and hospital stay.

- **Results**: A total of 120 patients (mean age 39.4 ± 9.6 years; male/female ratio 89:31) participated in the study. 37 patients (30.8%) were in Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class B, and 83 (69.2%) were in CTP class C. The mean CTP score was 9.7 ± 2.8, and the MELD (model for end-stage liver disease) score was 24.6 ± 4.2. Upon admission, 22 patients (18.3%) had grade 2 HE, 40 (33.3%) had grade 3, and 58 (48.3%) had grade 4. Complete reversal of HE was observed in 48 patients (76%) in group A, compared to 29 (50.8%) in group B (P < 0.004). There was a significant reduction in mortality with treatment using lactulose plus rifaximin versus lactulose and placebo (23.8% vs. 49.1%, P < 0.05). More deaths occurred in group B due to sepsis (group A vs. group B: 7:17, P = 0.01), with no significant differences observed due to gastrointestinal bleeding between groups (group A vs. group B: 4:4, P = nonsignificant).

### The efficacy and safety of rifaximin-α: A 2-year observational study of overt hepatic encephalopathy [^112rpAQ2]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

The median treatment duration of rifaximin-α was 232 days (IQR 65.0–579.0). Figure 3 shows the estimated rifaximin-α users' rate until discontinuation. The rifaximin-α users' rate after initiation was 74% at 3 months, 63% at 6 months, 55% at 1 year, and 44% at 18 months. The reasons for stopping rifaximin-α treatment in the first 6 months were: death in 24 (18.9%) patients, liver transplantation in 16 (12.6%) patients, and temporary or permanent discontinuation in 8 (6.3%) patients for other reasons.

Figure 3: Kaplan–Meier curve showing the proportion (red line) of patients using rifaximin-α after initiation of treatment.

In the long-term follow-up (until the end of study observation, death, liver transplantation, or rifaximin-α discontinuation), rifaximin-α was temporarily discontinued in seven (5.5%) patients due to long-term HE resolution in five patients, adverse events in one patient, and without any documented reason in one patient. However, treatment was reinitiated after recurrence of overt HE. Rifaximin-α treatment was permanently discontinued in eight (6.3%) patients: in three patients, the prescription was discontinued without a documented reason; two patients had adverse events; in two patients, treatment was withdrawn in the terminal phase of the underlying disease; and in one case due to non-adherence. In total, three patients reported an adverse event: nausea assumed to be related to rifaximin-α, rash assumed to be related to rifaximin-α, and polyneuropathy assumed to be non-related to rifaximin-α. Rifaximin-α dosage was raised to

### Repeat treatment with rifaximin improves irritable bowel syndrome-related quality of life: a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114h9jEH]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) impairs patient quality of life (QOL). Rifaximin is an oral, nonsystemic antibiotic indicated for IBS-D. The objective of this secondary analysis was to evaluate rifaximin retreatment on IBS-related QOL in patients with IBS-D.

- **Methods**: Patients received open-label rifaximin 550 mg three times daily for 2 weeks. Clinical responders — simultaneously meeting weekly response criteria for abdominal pain (≥ 30% improvement from baseline in mean weekly pain score) and stool consistency (≥ 50% decrease from baseline in number of days/week with Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) type 6 or 7 stools) during ≥ 2 of the first 4 weeks posttreatment — who relapsed during an up to 18-week treatment-free observation phase were randomly assigned to receive two 2-week courses of double-blind rifaximin or placebo, separated by 10 weeks. A validated 34-item IBS-QOL questionnaire examined patient responses in 8 domains.

- **Results**: The 2579 patients receiving open-label rifaximin experienced a mean improvement from baseline in IBS-QOL overall score of 54.9%. Responders to open-label rifaximin (n = 1074 of 2438 evaluable; 44.1%) had significantly greater improvement from baseline in IBS-QOL overall and all eight subdomain scores, including dysphoria, food avoidance, interference with activity, body image, and sexual function versus nonresponders at 4 weeks posttreatment (n = 1364; p < 0.001 for all comparisons). A significantly greater percentage of responders to open-label rifaximin achieved the minimally clinically important difference (MCID; ≥ 14).

### Rifaximin for the treatment of active pouchitis: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study [^116J6mmZ]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The efficacy of the nonabsorbable antibiotic rifaximin in patients with active acute or chronic pouchitis is unknown.

- **Methods**: We performed a placebo-controlled pilot trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rifaximin in patients with active pouchitis. Eighteen patients with active pouchitis were randomized to receive oral rifaximin 400 mg or placebo three times daily for four weeks. Active pouchitis was defined as a total Pouchitis Disease Activity Index (PDAI) score of 7 points or more. Clinical remission was defined as a PDAI score of less than 7 points and a decrease in the baseline PDAI score of at least 3 points. The primary analysis was clinical remission at week 4.

- **Results**: Eight patients were randomized to rifaximin, and 10 patients were randomized to placebo. One patient in the placebo group did not have a post-baseline efficacy evaluation and was excluded from the efficacy analysis. Two of 8 patients (25%) treated with rifaximin were in clinical remission at week 4 compared to 0 of 9 patients (0%) treated with placebo (P = 0.2059). None of the 8 patients in the rifaximin group withdrew from the trial prior to week 4. Two of the 9 patients in the placebo group withdrew before week 4 due to lack of efficacy and were categorized as treatment failures.

- **Conclusions**: Clinical remission occurred more frequently in patients treated with rifaximin 400 mg three times daily, but the difference was not significant in this pilot study. A larger trial would be required to determine if rifaximin is effective for the treatment of active pouchitis. Rifaximin was well tolerated.

### Repeat treatment with rifaximin improves irritable bowel syndrome-related quality of life: a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115ysSJF]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

Improvements from open-label baseline in IBS-QOL overall and subdomain scores for food avoidance, interference with activity, and body image were significantly greater in patients who responded to open-label rifaximin who did not relapse during the treatment-free observation phase, compared with those who responded and subsequently relapsed during the observation phase. This finding suggests that greater improvement in QOL following treatment with rifaximin is associated with a lower chance of subsequent symptom relapse. Indeed, responders to open-label treatment with rifaximin had significantly greater improvement from baseline in the IBS-QOL overall score based on an MCID ⩾14 points compared with nonresponders at 4 weeks posttreatment.

The subgroup of nonresponders who achieved the MCID in IBS-QOL may not have met the formal prespecified criteria for response, but it is possible that they may have experienced enough improvement in their clinical symptoms with rifaximin treatment that they deemed their QOL improved. While a direct association between MCID and the symptomatic response to rifaximin is not entirely expected, clinically meaningful improvement in IBS-QOL appears to be consistent with improvements in abdominal pain and stool consistency previously reported for these patients. These data demonstrate that a single course of short-term treatment with rifaximin is associated with clinically meaningful improvement in QOL in patients with IBS-D.

### Mechanism of action and therapeutic benefit of rifaximin in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: a narrative review [^115ES5rw]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

In summary, a meta-analysis of five studies demonstrated that rifaximin was significantly associated with improvement of global IBS symptoms compared with placebo [42.2% versus 32.4%, respectively; OR, 1.6 (95% CI, 1.2–2.0); p < 0.001]. Data from four studies showed rifaximin was significantly associated with improvement in bloating versus placebo 10–14 days after treatment [41.6% versus 31.7%; OR, 1.6 (95% CI, 1.2–2.0); p < 0.001]. The number needed to treat for rifaximin has been reported as 8 (based on 7 studies) to 11 (based on 4–6 studies). Overall, the number needed to stop for rifaximin, based on discontinuation due to an adverse event (AE), was 8971. An estimated 846 patients would benefit from rifaximin before an AE resulting in treatment discontinuation would be observed.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of rifaximin-α administration for the reduction of episodes of overt hepatic encephalopathy in recurrence compared with standard treatment in France [^113y4nGy]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome that occurs most often in the context of acute or chronic liver disease. Despite the seriousness of this pathology, only a few treatments have been developed for improving its management. Rifaximin-α is the first treatment that has been clinically developed for overt HE (OHE) episodes. Recent clinical studies demonstrate its significant improvement in health-related quality of life. The objective of the study was to estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of rifaximin-α when used in combination with lactulose, compared with lactulose monotherapy, in cirrhotic patients who have experienced at least two prior OHE events.

- **Methods**: A Markov model was used to estimate rifaximin-α cost-effectiveness, evaluating it from the perspective of all contributors, as recommended by French health technology assessment guidelines. Costs were based on French treatment practices. Transition between health states was derived from the reanalysis of the rifaximin-α pivotal clinical trials RFHE3001 and RFHE3002. The main outcome of the model was cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY).

- **Results**: The results indicate that rifaximin-α is a cost-effective treatment option, with an incremental cost per QALY gained of €19,187 and €18,517 over two different time horizons (2 and 5 years). The robustness of the model was studied using probabilistic sensitivity analysis.

- **Conclusion**: For the societal willingness to pay threshold of €27,000 per QALY gained, rifaximin-α in combination with lactulose is a promising strategy.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^111djYhV]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

**Rifaximin with or without lactulose**: In the phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial carried out by Bass et al, rifaximin-α 550 mg (n = 140) was compared to placebo (n = 159) for the prevention of OHE recurrence over 6 months, with concomitant lactulose use in over 90% of both groups. The overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) was 80.0% with rifaximin versus 79.9% with placebo. The most commonly reported AEs (≥ 10% of patients in either group) included nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, peripheral edema, ascites, dizziness, and headache. There were no significant differences in the rates of these events between the treatment groups. Additionally, there were no significant differences in the incidences of serious AEs and AEs related to infection, including Clostridium difficile infection. Deaths occurred in 6.4% of rifaximin-treated patients and 6.9% of placebo-treated patients.

### Repeat treatment with rifaximin improves irritable bowel syndrome-related quality of life: a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1171NnTS]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

The findings of this study indicate that repeat treatment with rifaximin favorably impacts IBS-QOL overall and all eight subdomain scores in patients with IBS-D. Moreover, IBS-QOL overall and all subdomain scores were improved from baseline for up to 4 weeks post-treatment in patients receiving 2-week open-label rifaximin treatment, with the greatest improvements from baseline observed for the IBS-QOL subdomains of dysphoria and interference with activity.

Interestingly, IBS-QOL subdomain scores for food avoidance, interference with activity, and dysphoria have been shown to be low (i.e. poorer QOL) in patients with IBS-D, and the majority of patients with IBS have self-reported intolerances to a number of foods, which aberrantly affects QOL. Indeed, in the open-label population, baseline IBS-QOL subdomain scores for food avoidance, interference with activity, and dysphoria were among the lowest compared with other IBS-QOL subdomain scores. All of these subdomain scores significantly improved in responders treated with rifaximin compared with nonresponders.

It is valuable to note that the IBS-QOL is a derivative measure that reflects the perceptions of patients with IBS, including the amount of control they have over their symptoms, their ability to socialize, and their sexual relationships, which can have lasting effects even if there is some degree of symptom change. It was not designed as a surrogate measure of symptoms or function.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^11158pzf]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

A consolidated overview of evidence for the effectiveness and safety/tolerability of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) treatment over the long term is currently lacking. We identified and assessed published evidence for the long-term (≥ 6 months) pharmacological management of HE with lactulose and/or rifaximin. A literature search was conducted in PubMed (cutoff date March 5, 2018) using the search terms 'hepatic encephalopathy+rifaximin' and 'hepatic encephalopathy+lactulose'. All articles containing primary clinical data were manually assessed to identify studies in which long-term (≥ 6 months) effectiveness and/or safety/tolerability endpoints were reported for lactulose and/or rifaximin.

Long-term effectiveness outcomes were reported in eight articles for treatment with lactulose alone and 19 articles for treatment with rifaximin, alone or in combination with lactulose. Long-term safety/tolerability outcomes were reported in six articles for treatment with lactulose alone and nine articles for treatment with rifaximin, alone or in combination with lactulose. These studies showed that lactulose is effective for the prevention of overt HE recurrence over the long term and that the addition of rifaximin to lactulose significantly reduces the risk of overt HE recurrence and HE-related hospitalization, compared with lactulose therapy alone, without compromising tolerability.

Evidence therefore supports recommendations for the use of lactulose therapy for the prevention of overt HE recurrence over the long term, and for the additional benefit of adding rifaximin to lactulose.

### Follow-on rifaximin for the prevention of recurrence following standard treatment of infection with (RAPID): a randomized placebo-controlled trial [^114MWEVg]. Gut (2019). High credibility.

Participants were given 126 tablets, containing either rifaximin 200 mg or an identical placebo formulation. Rifaximin and placebo were supplied by Norgine Pharmaceuticals Limited as a gift and manufactured by Alfa Wassermann. The intended treatment regime was two tablets (400 mg rifaximin) taken three times a day for 14 days, reduced to one tablet (200 mg) three times a day for a further 14 days. Participants continued to receive standard care, including antibiotics for indications other than CDI, as determined by their physician. The number of tablets taken was assessed from the difference between the number of tablets supplied (126) and the number returned at the week 4 visit or earlier if CDI recurred. Since recurrences meant that participants took the drug for a variable duration, compliance was assessed against the number of tablets expected to be taken by each participant at the end of their involvement.

Participants with recurrence of CDI within 28 days of recruitment were asked to provide stool samples and were withdrawn from trial treatment prior to commencing standard therapy at the local Principal Investigator's discretion. Additional samples were also collected during any diarrhea episode and for any recurrences occurring later after the start of the treatment intervention, up to 6 months follow-up.

Participants attended study visits at 4 weeks and 12 weeks after the start of intervention, with telephone contact at 2 weeks, 8 weeks, and 6 months to identify CDI recurrence and any serious adverse events (SAEs).

### Repeat treatment with rifaximin improves irritable bowel syndrome-related quality of life: A secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111seTMi]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

The majority of patients included in the double-blind phase received two repeat treatments (rifaximin, 89.9%; placebo, 91.9%). The MCID in the IBS-QOL overall score from double-blind baseline to the end of first retreatment 4-week follow-up was achieved by a significantly greater percentage of patients receiving rifaximin compared with placebo (38.6% versus 29.6%, respectively; p = 0.009).

For patients who received open-label rifaximin and both double-blind treatment courses, the improvement from double-blind baseline to the end of first double-blind treatment follow-up in IBS-QOL overall and most subdomain scores (excepting IBS-QOL health worry and sexual function subdomain scores) was greater compared with patients who received open-label rifaximin and two courses of placebo treatment. However, in patients who received two repeat treatments, differences between treatment groups (i.e. rifaximin versus placebo) were not statistically significant when comparing mean improvement in IBS-QOL overall score from open-label baseline with the 4-week follow-up after open-label rifaximin (treatment #1) or the first double-blind treatment (treatment #2).

A statistical analysis could not be conducted because there was an insufficient number of patients receiving both double-blind treatments who had IBS-QOL data at the end of the study.

### The use of rifaximin in patients with cirrhosis [^113SsPNF]. Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Rifaximin, a non-absorbed oral antibiotic, is frequently used in managing patients with cirrhosis to prevent complications such as hepatic encephalopathy. The medication works by reducing the bacteria in the gut that produce toxins, which can exacerbate liver dysfunction. Its use is particularly prevalent in cases where patients have previously experienced episodes of hepatic encephalopathy.

The administration of rifaximin in cirrhosis is recommended as it has been shown to improve patients' quality of life and lessen hospital admissions related to liver-related complications. Although effective, practitioners must be vigilant in monitoring for potential side effects and interactions with other medications typically used in cirrhotic patients. Furthermore, ongoing research continues to assess the long-term benefits and optimal protocols for rifaximin use in this patient population.

### Mechanism of action and therapeutic benefit of rifaximin in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: A narrative review [^114fJ9AV]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Rifaximin has been shown to improve overall symptoms in a subset of patients with IBS-D, as evidenced by multiple randomized, placebo-controlled trials. On the strength of the available data, rifaximin is currently approved for the treatment of adults with IBS-D in the United States and Canada. Though its efficacy has been clearly demonstrated, the mechanisms responsible for the clinical benefits of rifaximin in patients with IBS-D have not been firmly established. With this in mind, we have reviewed the current knowledge regarding its pharmacology, clinical impact, impact on microbiota, inflammatory activity in the GI tract, and intestinal permeability in patients with IBS-D.

- **Pharmacology**: Rifaximin is a nonsystemic antibiotic with low oral bioavailability, with generally less than 0.01% of a single orally administered 400 mg dose detected in the plasma and urine of healthy volunteers 48 hours after administration. The presence of bile acids increases the solubility of rifaximin 70- to 120-fold, potentially enhancing its availability to exert antimicrobial and other effects in the small intestine. The detection of unchanged drug in stool samples following oral administration indicates that rifaximin has high availability in the GI tract, contributing to the minimum inhibitory concentrations observed against human GI bacteria.

In vitro activity of rifaximin against anaerobic bacteria found in the human GI tract was explored further in Table 1; however, the table is not present in this text.

### Follow-on rifaximin for the prevention of recurrence following standard treatment of infection with (RAPID): a randomised placebo controlled trial [^115DaTEy]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been reported to increase recurrence rates. Therefore, it is important to note that patients on rifaximin, by chance, had a higher rate of PPI use — 32% compared to 20% in those on placebo — which could have reduced the size of the reduction in recurrence rate we observed.

Deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), and adverse events (AEs) were similar to placebo, suggesting that rifaximin is safe in this elderly, frail population. Challenges in recruiting this population have been reported elsewhere and made conducting the trial difficult; we required 23 sites and screened over 2000 patients. The main reason for non-enrolment of those who met entry criteria was participants' choice not to take part. This reluctance reflects the frailty and multiple comorbidities characteristic of patients with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), whose infection is usually induced by antibiotic treatment for another serious illness.

The participants' median (interquartile range, IQR) age of 76 (63, 83), with the oldest being 96, was higher than in other trials cited. The mortality rate was also higher than in many trials of newer agents, which tend to exclude the most frail. This suggests that, as we intended, by minimizing the barriers to patient recruitment, we recruited a sample more typical of the patient group at risk of CDI. Therefore, our results should be generalizable to everyday clinical practice.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^113d6v2E]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Evidence supports recommendations for the use of lactulose therapy for the prevention of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) recurrence over the long term, and for the additional benefit of adding rifaximin to lactulose therapy. The addition of rifaximin to lactulose significantly further reduces the risk of OHE recurrence and hepatic encephalopathy (HE)-related hospitalization compared with lactulose therapy alone, with a demonstrably low number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve these further benefits. There is also emerging evidence to indicate that a switch to rifaximin monotherapy may be appropriate for those for whom lactulose is ineffective, poorly tolerated, or when adherence to lactulose therapy is problematic, although this requires further research.

### Current state of Clostridium difficile treatment options [^111yWZ2a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Rifaximin is a nonabsorbed antibiotic that appears to be somewhat flora sparing. Although highly active against most strains of C. difficile, rifaximin is subject to the problems of other rifamycins. A critical amino acid substitution in the β-subunit of the bacterial RNA polymerase leads to high-level resistance. Rifaximin has been used as a post-vancomycin treatment (i.e. chaser) for the treatment of patients with multiple recurrences where previous treatment strategies failed. Seventy-nine percent of patients from one center with an extended follow-up had no further recurrence after treatment with a rifaximin chaser. In a recent pilot study of the role of rifaximin in patients with disease unresponsive to metronidazole, 64% of the intention-to-treat population had stool cultures negative for C. difficile at the end of the study, and cultures remained negative for all patients at the 56-day follow-up. Data from these uncontrolled and relatively small studies suggest that rifaximin may have a role in treating patients with multiple recurrences or those for whom other treatments have failed. However, the possibility of resistance should warrant caution, particularly in those who previously have been treated with rifampin and rifaximin.

Tigecycline has a broad spectrum of activity, including many gram-positive and -negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Recent evidence suggests that tigecycline does not promote the growth of C. difficile nor its toxin production in either the human gut model or mouse model. There are limited case reports.

### Follow-on rifaximin for the prevention of recurrence following standard treatment of infection with (RAPID): a randomised placebo controlled trial [^115XyQUE]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

- **Assessment of safety**: There were nine deaths reported on placebo and nine deaths on rifaximin. There were 15 (22%) participants with at least one SAE on placebo and 12 (16%) on rifaximin in the 28 days post-randomisation. No SAEs were considered to relate to the trial treatment in the group allocated to rifaximin. Non-SAEs in the 28 days post-randomisation were similar in the two groups, but none were considered definitely related to rifaximin. Full details of types of AEs are provided in online supplementary files 5 and 6.

- **Trial participation survey**: Fifty-six participants completed the patient experience questionnaire at 6 months. Barriers to taking part in the study identified by participants included difficulties completing the diary, collecting stool samples, and taking the medication (size and quantity of tablets). At least one stool diary was completed by 75 participants (50%) during weeks one to four and by 48 participants (32%) in week 12. A summary of stool frequency and consistency during weeks 1 to 4 and weeks 11 to 12 is shown in online supplementary file 7.

### Repeat treatment with rifaximin improves irritable bowel syndrome-related quality of life: A secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112fcfNa]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

The mean change from open-label baseline to the end of the study (i.e. after double-blind rifaximin retreatment) in IBS-QOL overall and subdomain scores for dysphoria, interference with activity, health worry, and sexual function domains was significantly greater for patients receiving repeat treatment with rifaximin versus placebo in the double-blind phase (p ≤ 0.05). Patients receiving double-blind rifaximin had greater mean improvement from open-label baseline to the end of the study (i.e. after double-blind rifaximin retreatment) in IBS-QOL subdomain scores for body image, food avoidance, social reaction, and social relationships domains compared with double-blind placebo, but these differences did not achieve statistical significance.

- **Figure interpretation**: Change from open-label baseline in IBS-QOL overall and subdomain scores at the last visit for patients randomly assigned to receive rifaximin (n = 328) or placebo (n = 308) in the double-blind treatment phases.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^114Y5NkF]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

In a primary prophylaxis study, patients with cirrhosis but no previous history of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) were randomized to receive lactulose therapy (n = 60) or no lactulose therapy (n = 60) for 12 months. Lactulose significantly reduced the rate of OHE occurrence versus no lactulose (11% vs. 28%; P = 0.02) and reduced the median length of stay for HE-related hospitalization, although not significantly.

In a secondary prophylaxis study, patients with cirrhosis who had recovered from OHE were randomized to receive lactulose (n = 68), probiotics (n = 64), or no therapy (n = 65) for up to 12 months. The rate of OHE recurrence was 26.5% with lactulose, 34.4% with probiotics, and 56.9% with no therapy (lactulose vs. probiotics, P = not significant; lactulose vs. no therapy, P = 0.001; and probiotics vs. no therapy, P = 0.02). The mortality rate was 19.1%, 17.2%, and 24.6% for the lactulose, probiotics, and no therapy groups, respectively (P = not significant between groups).

In a similar secondary prophylaxis study, patients were randomized to receive lactulose or placebo over a median follow-up duration of 14 months. Lactulose was significantly superior to placebo in reducing the rate of OHE recurrence (19.6% vs. 46.8%; P = 0.001) but not in reducing the rate of hospitalization for non-HE events or mortality.

### Rifaximin in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: Is there a high risk for development of antimicrobial resistance [^114Br3vS]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a chronic, nonfatal illness, is commonly encountered in clinical practice; however, treatment options are limited and often ineffectual. Despite this, there is increasing evidence that bacterial overgrowth in the bowel (dysbiosis) may be an etiological factor in IBS. This has led to studies in which the antibiotic agent rifaximin has been used to reduce the microbial burden in the bowel, to some extent alleviating the symptoms of IBS.

Rifaximin is a member of the rifamycin class of antibiotics, which, when administered orally, has the distinctions of being gut-specific coupled with poor systemic absorption — characteristics that are suggested to limit the development of bacterial resistance. The rifamycins are currently used to treat serious human diseases including tuberculosis, meningococcal disease, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium difficile infections. The use of rifamycins in the treatment of these diseases is associated with the development of antibiotic resistance over time.

When considering the importance of the rifamycins in the treatment of serious human diseases, the large number of patients affected by IBS, and the lack of scientific evidence available on the development of antibiotic resistance to rifaximin over the long term when used in the gut, it is advisable that the use of rifaximin as a therapy for IBS should be limited to single, acute, short-term treatment.

### Mechanism of action and therapeutic benefit of rifaximin in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: a narrative review [^116keymr]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

In the TARGET 3 study, the gut microbiota of patients with IBS-D who received up to three 2-week courses of rifaximin 550 mg three times daily (n = 103 patients; n = 675 fecal samples) was stable. However, a small, transient decrease in the relative abundance of specific taxa was observed at the end of the first course (2-week open-label rifaximin) compared with baseline (Figure 2).

- **Results**: For 33 patients who received three rifaximin courses, Clostridiaceae.1 was the only taxon that was significantly decreased from baseline following the first and second courses of treatment (p < 0.05 for both courses; Figure 2). One putative mechanism of action for rifaximin may be modulation of the observed taxa that transiently decreased in this study, although additional research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.

Data analyzing the effects of rifaximin on alterations in gut microbiota in patients with IBS and psychological comorbidities are not currently available. Overall, although it is apparent that rifaximin has some modest effect on the gut microbiota in patients with IBS, the efficacy of rifaximin in IBS likely involves several factors.

### Mechanism of action and therapeutic benefit of rifaximin in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: A narrative review [^114rSmUp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder with a multifactorial pathophysiology. The gut microbiota differs between patients with IBS and healthy individuals. After a bout of acute gastroenteritis, postinfection IBS may result in up to approximately 10% of those affected. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is more common in patients with IBS than in healthy individuals, and eradication of SIBO with systemic antibiotics has decreased symptoms of IBS in some patients with IBS and SIBO.

The nonsystemic (i.e. low oral bioavailability) antibiotic rifaximin is indicated in the United States and Canada for the treatment of adults with IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D). The efficacy and safety of 2-week single and repeat courses of rifaximin have been demonstrated in randomized, placebo-controlled studies of adults with IBS. Rifaximin is widely thought to exert its beneficial clinical effects in IBS-D through manipulation of the gut microbiota. However, studies indicate that rifaximin induces only modest effects on the gut microbiota of patients with IBS-D, suggesting that the efficacy of rifaximin may involve other mechanisms. Indeed, preclinical data reveal a potential role for rifaximin in the modulation of inflammatory cytokines and intestinal permeability, but these two findings have not yet been examined in the context of clinical studies. The mechanism of action of rifaximin in IBS is likely multifactorial, and further study is needed.

Evidence of gastrointestinal mucosal inflammation in irritable bowel syndrome:

A meta-analysis of 16 studies reported that low-grade mucosal inflammation may play a role in the pathogenesis of IBS and is associated with IBS symptoms. Gastrointestinal immune activation is one factor that may be involved in the pathophysiology of IBS and may be linked to visceral hypersensitivity since activated immune cells are localized near enteric nerves. Visceral hypersensitivity, which refers to altered pain perception to normal physiological stimulation, is increased in patients with IBS compared to healthy individuals. Approximately half of patients with IBS exhibit hypersensitivity to rectal distension. Further, 18% of patients with IBS (n = 50) included in a prospective study had visceral hypersensitivity. Preclinical data indicated that rats subjected to chronic and repeated stress had increased visceral hypersensitivity compared with control animals. This hypersensitivity was significantly decreased by treatment with the antibiotic rifaximin (p < 0.05); however, clinical studies are warranted to confirm these effects in patients with IBS.

Mast cell counts were significantly increased in mucosal biopsies from the proximal descending colon of patients with IBS (n = 44) compared to healthy individuals (n = 22; p < 0.001). The number of degranulating mast cells, indicative of mast cell activation, was increased by 150% in patients with IBS compared to healthy individuals (p = 0.03). Patients with IBS had 223% more mast cells located < 5 µm from colonic nerves compared to healthy individuals, a finding that correlated positively with…

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^11473nCz]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

A consolidated overview of evidence for the effectiveness and safety/tolerability of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) treatment over the long term is currently lacking. We identified and assessed published evidence for the long-term (≥ 6 months) pharmacological management of HE with lactulose and/or rifaximin. A literature search was conducted in PubMed (cutoff date 05 March 2018) using the search terms 'hepatic encephalopathy+rifaximin' and 'hepatic encephalopathy+lactulose'. All articles containing primary clinical data were manually assessed to identify studies in which long-term (≥ 6 months) effectiveness and/or safety/tolerability endpoints were reported for lactulose and/or rifaximin. Long-term effectiveness outcomes were reported in eight articles for treatment with lactulose alone and 19 articles for treatment with rifaximin, alone or in combination with lactulose. Long-term safety/tolerability outcomes were reported in six articles for treatment with lactulose alone and nine articles for treatment with rifaximin, alone or in combination with lactulose. These studies showed that lactulose is effective for the prevention of overt HE recurrence over the long term and that the addition of rifaximin to lactulose significantly reduces the risk of overt HE recurrence and HE-related hospitalization, compared with lactulose therapy alone, without compromising tolerability. Evidence therefore supports recommendations for the use of lactulose therapy for the prevention of overt HE recurrence over the long term, and for the additional benefit of adding rifaximin to lactulose.

### Repeat treatment with rifaximin improves irritable bowel syndrome-related quality of life: A secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112uXNsu]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) impairs patient quality of life (QOL). Rifaximin is an oral, nonsystemic antibiotic indicated for IBS-D. The objective of this secondary analysis was to evaluate rifaximin retreatment on IBS-related QOL in patients with IBS-D.

- **Methods**: Patients received open-label rifaximin 550 mg three times daily for 2 weeks. Clinical responders, simultaneously meeting weekly response criteria for abdominal pain (≥ 30% improvement from baseline in mean weekly pain score) and stool consistency (≥ 50% decrease from baseline in the number of days per week with Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) type 6 or 7 stools) during at least 2 of the first 4 weeks posttreatment, who relapsed during an up to 18-week treatment-free observation phase, were randomly assigned to receive two 2-week courses of double-blind rifaximin or placebo, separated by 10 weeks. A validated 34-item IBS-QOL questionnaire examined patient responses in 8 domains.

- **Results**: The 2579 patients receiving open-label rifaximin experienced a mean improvement from baseline in IBS-QOL overall score of 54.9%. Responders to open-label rifaximin (n = 1074 of 2438 evaluable; 44.1%) had significantly greater improvement from baseline in IBS-QOL overall and all eight subdomain scores, including dysphoria, food avoidance, interference with activity, body image, and sexual function, versus nonresponders at 4 weeks posttreatment (n = 1364; p < 0.001 for all comparisons). A significantly greater percentage of responders to open-label rifaximin achieved the minimally clinically important difference (MCID; ≥ 1).

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: a review of the evidence [^111jwtPz]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Three large single-center, open-label, randomized controlled studies have assessed the long-term (≥ 6 months) safety and tolerability of lactulose therapy, compared with placebo, probiotics, and/or no therapy.

- **Primary prophylaxis study**: In this study, patients with cirrhosis but no previous history of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) were randomized to receive lactulose therapy (n = 60) or no lactulose therapy (n = 60) for 12 months. All patients treated with lactulose remained adherent to treatment. The most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) with lactulose were diarrhea, distaste for lactulose, and abdominal bloating, which improved following a reduction in lactulose dosing.

- **Secondary prophylaxis study**: In another study, patients with cirrhosis who had recovered from OHE were randomized to receive lactulose (n = 68), probiotics (n = 64), or no therapy (n = 65) for up to 12 months. All lactulose patients remained adherent to treatment. AEs in the lactulose group were similar, including diarrhea, distaste for lactulose, and abdominal bloating. Lactulose dosing was reduced in these patients but not stopped. In the probiotics group, AEs included constipation and abdominal distension, which were managed with dietary advice and intermittent use of proton pump inhibitors. In the no therapy group, only constipation was reported, which was managed with dietary modifications.

Similar results were observed in another secondary prophylaxis study, where patients were randomized to receive lactulose or placebo over a median follow-up duration of 14 months. All patients remained adherent to lactulose therapy, and AEs were consistent with previous observations.

### Follow-on rifaximin for the prevention of recurrence following standard treatment of infection with (RAPID): a randomised placebo controlled trial [^1174FUtS]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

A recent systematic review found that in Europe, the incremental cost of *C. difficile* infection ranged from £4577 to £8843, driven primarily by increased length of hospital stay. The course of rifaximin we used would cost around £200 at UK pricing. Importantly, rifaximin has been widely used for three decades and is known to be safe, possibly related to its unusually low solubility and absorption.

Resistance was initially uncommon but is due to a simple mutation in the *rpoB* gene which codes for rifaximin's molecular target, RNA polymerase β subunit. Of concern is the fact that mutations in this gene also underlie resistance to both rifamycin and rifampicin, an important part of antimycobacterial treatment. It rapidly appears in groups of patients where the drug is widely used, for example, treatment for hepatic encephalopathy. Its widespread use for IBS and hepatic encephalopathy in the United States has coincided with a marked rise of resistance from 8% to 35% in Texas.

Rifaximin's use is more restricted in the UK and resistance is at present low. However, indiscriminate use in a wide range of infections will rapidly increase rates of resistance, so it should be reserved for those at high risk of recurrence. Those who experience multiple recurrences and have repeated courses of treatments often have severely depleted microbiota and are probably best treated by non-antibiotic therapies, particularly fecal transplantation, which has a high success rate in such patients.

The main limitation of the trial is that the planned sample size was not achieved, resulting in reduced precision.

### Rifaximin for the treatment of acute infectious diarrhea [^111qMpim]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Rifaximin is a nonabsorbable rifamycin derivative with an excellent safety profile and a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against a variety of enteropathogens causing acute infectious diarrhea. After oral ingestion, its bioavailability is known to be less than 0.4%, and it has a low potential for significant drug interactions.

In the treatment of travelers' diarrhea caused by noninvasive diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, it has been demonstrated that rifaximin significantly shortens the duration of diarrhea and has an efficacy similar to that of ciprofloxacin. Moreover, according to two randomized placebo-controlled trials, prophylactic treatment with rifaximin reduced the risk of developing travelers' diarrhea by more than 50% compared with the placebo group. For the treatment of acute diarrhea unrelated to travel, a short course of rifaximin significantly reduced the duration of diarrhea, and its overall efficacy was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin.

The discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of rifaximin, however, and the clinical implication of the rapid appearance of bacterial resistance, must be further elucidated. In conclusion, this gut-selective antibiotic seems to be a promising option for the treatment of acute infectious diarrhea secondary to noninvasive E. coli and also appears to be effective in chemoprophylaxis for travelers' diarrhea.

### Rifaximin for prevention and treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in people with cirrhosis [^114qs6Kt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy describes the spectrum of neuropsychiatric changes that may complicate the course of cirrhosis and detrimentally affect outcomes. Ammonia plays a key role in its development. Rifaximin is a non-absorbable antibiotic that inhibits urease-producing bacteria and reduces the absorption of dietary and bacterial ammonia.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of rifaximin versus placebo, no intervention, or non-absorbable disaccharides for:
	- (i) the prevention of hepatic encephalopathy, and
	- (ii) the treatment of minimal and overt hepatic encephalopathy in people with cirrhosis, both when used alone and combined with a non-absorbable disaccharide.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Clinical Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, the reference lists of identified papers, and relevant conference proceedings. We contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies for information on other published, unpublished, or ongoing trials. Searches were performed up to January 2023.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized clinical trials assessing the prevention or treatment of hepatic encephalopathy with rifaximin alone, or with a non-absorbable disaccharide, versus placebo/no intervention, or a non-absorbable disaccharide alone.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Six authors independently searched for studies, extracted data, and validated findings. We assessed the design, bias risk, and participant/intervention characteristics of the included studies. We evaluated mortality and serious adverse events.

### Follow-on rifaximin for the prevention of recurrence following standard treatment of infection (RAPID): A randomised placebo controlled trial [^114D3sya]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

A total of 2,157 patients were screened across 23 hospitals. Of these, 151 were eligible, willing, and randomised (7% of those screened) before funding limits were reached (74 placebo, 77 rifaximin). Approximately one-third of patients approached were not eligible for the trial, and 20% declined to take part. The most common reasons given were competing comorbidities, perceived increase in treatment burden, and personal demands of trial participation. Other reasons for exclusion reported were death or clinical judgment that the patient was too unwell.

The target sample size of 180 was not met before the trial reached its funding limit and ceased recruitment in March 2016. The last follow-up visit occurred in July 2016. The primary outcome was available for 61 of the 74 participants randomised to the placebo group (82%) and 69 of the 77 participants randomised to the rifaximin group (90%). Fifteen participants withdrew consent, and six participants died before primary outcome data could be collected.

- **Baseline characteristics**: The mean age of participants was 71.9 years, and 118 participants (78%) were recruited at their first episode of CDI. The rifaximin group contained a slightly higher proportion of men, participants taking a proton pump inhibitor at randomisation, participants with a previous episode of CDI, and participants recruited outside hospital. Just over a third of participants were inpatients.

### Long-term management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and/or rifaximin: A review of the evidence [^114jM9ML]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

In addition to these prospective data, several large retrospective studies have assessed the effectiveness of rifaximin combined with lactulose in comparison with lactulose alone. The IMPRESS study was a multicenter, retrospective, observational study of 207 patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE), 84% of whom received concomitant lactulose. This study was designed to assess the effect of rifaximin-α 550 mg on hospital resource use. Outcomes were compared for the 6 months before starting rifaximin ('pre-rifaximin') versus the 6 months following rifaximin initiation ('post-rifaximin'), and for 12 months pre-rifaximin versus 12 months post-rifaximin. Overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) episodes were experienced by 57% of patients in the 12 months pre-rifaximin versus 38% in the 12 months post-rifaximin. The mean number of HE episodes per patient decreased significantly from the 12 months pre-rifaximin to the 12 months post-rifaximin (P = 0.047).
