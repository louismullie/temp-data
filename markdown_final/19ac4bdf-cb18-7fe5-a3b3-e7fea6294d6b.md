## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Butrans (buprenorphine transdermal system). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug identity and pharmacologic class. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled indication and limitations of use. Next, I will review pharmacokinetics and formulation details. After that, I need to examine efficacy data from pivotal trials. I will then assess safety, boxed warnings, and special populations. Finally, I should consider practical prescribing, titration, discontinuation, and how Butrans fits within the broader opioid stewardship landscape, before summarizing a balanced clinical take-home message.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity and class. Butrans is a transdermal buprenorphine system delivering 5, 7.5, 10, 15, or 20 mcg/hour over 7 days; buprenorphine is a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist with high receptor affinity and a ceiling effect on respiratory depression, which informs its risk–benefit profile compared with full agonists [^f456b5ce] [^5a00a151].

> I need to verify the labeled indication and limitations. Butrans is indicated for the management of severe and persistent pain that requires daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative options are inadequate; it is not indicated for as-needed (PRN) analgesia, and prescribers should reserve it for patients in whom non-opioid or immediate-release opioids are ineffective, not tolerated, or otherwise inadequate, given addiction, abuse, and overdose risks inherent to extended-release opioids [^f456b5ce] [^5893191f].

> Next, I should review pharmacokinetics and formulation specifics. Steady-state plasma concentrations are typically achieved within about 48–72 hours of the first application, supporting once-weekly dosing; absolute bioavailability is approximately 15% relative to IV administration, and dose-proportional exposure is observed across 5–20 mcg/hour. Application sites include the upper outer arm, upper chest, upper back, or side of chest, with rotation among eight possible sites and a minimum 21-day interval before reusing a site [^094d3ba0] [^73bf5d72].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about efficacy without checking the pivotal trials. In opioid-naïve chronic low back pain, a 12-week randomized, double-blind trial showed Butrans 20 mcg/hour significantly reduced average pain versus placebo, with a higher proportion achieving at least a 30% pain reduction; completion rates were 66% with Butrans vs 70% with placebo, and discontinuations were balanced between lack of efficacy and adverse events, which supports clinically meaningful benefit in selected patients [^4d9268d1]. In opioid-experienced patients with chronic low back pain, a dose-ranging study demonstrated that 20 mcg/hour outperformed 5 mcg/hour on pain endpoints, reinforcing dose–response within the labeled range; however, two other 12-week controlled studies in low back pain and osteoarthritis did not show statistically significant benefit, underscoring heterogeneity of response and the need for careful patient selection and titration [^49d19647] [^3a21986a].

> I should double-check safety and boxed warnings. Like all opioids, Butrans carries risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse; prescribers must assess risk pre-prescription and monitor ongoingly, and consider naloxone for overdose risk mitigation. Respiratory depression can occur, especially at initiation and dose increases, and is more likely in elderly, cachectic, or those with chronic pulmonary disease; there is a ceiling effect on respiratory depression, but it is not absolute, particularly with CNS co-medications. Butrans is contraindicated in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma without resuscitative equipment, and QT prolongation has been observed at 40 mcg/hour (two 20 mcg/hour patches), so the maximum recommended dose is 20 mcg/hour; severe application-site reactions, including vesiculation, have been reported rarely and warrant prompt discontinuation if they occur [^6c259c8e] [^8ea276ff] [^b3982d7b] [^dd39e792] [^651737f0].

> Let me consider special populations and drug–drug interactions. In hepatic impairment, start at 5 mcg/hour and monitor closely; Butrans has not been studied in severe hepatic impairment, so consider alternatives. In renal impairment, dose reduction by 25–50% is advised when eGFR is less than 10 mL/min/1.73 m² or in dialysis, whereas no adjustment is generally needed for eGFR 20–50. In pregnancy, use only if benefits outweigh risks and monitor for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. Concomitant use with full mu-agonists can precipitate withdrawal or blunt analgesia, so avoid overlap when possible; if breakthrough pain occurs, consider non-opioid or carefully selected short-acting opioids with caution, recognizing pharmacologic complexity [^0a52f685] [^72f9cdea] [^f88dadbd] [^a2b990fe] [^1705564e] [^c84e9298].

> I will now examine practical prescribing and titration. For opioid-naïve patients, start at 5 mcg/hour; for opioid-experienced patients, taper existing around-the-clock opioids to 30 mg/day or less of oral morphine equivalents before initiating, then start at 10 mcg/hour if tolerated; titrate every 72 hours to effect, using no more than two patches to a maximum of 20 mcg/hour; rotate application sites and avoid heat exposure that can increase absorption; if the patch falls off, replace at a new site and resume the 7-day schedule [^28e1b8ae] [^b3982d7b] [^73bf5d72] [^dd39e792].

> Wait, let me verify discontinuation guidance. Do not abruptly stop Butrans in physically dependent patients; taper by about 10–25% of the total opioid dose every 2–4 weeks, pausing or slowing if withdrawal or pain flares emerge, and coordinate a multimodal pain plan during the taper to maintain function and safety [^71c3bdc9] [^ceabe6be].

> Next, I should review how Butrans fits within opioid stewardship and access realities. Butrans is Schedule III, which some clinicians view as advantageous for patients at higher risk of misuse or respiratory compromise, yet payer coverage often requires failure of multiple Schedule II opioids first, limiting access despite potential safety benefits; nonetheless, emerging data and expert guidance support considering buprenorphine earlier for chronic pain when opioids are indicated, particularly in patients with elevated overdose risk or comorbidities that amplify opioid-related harms [^eae9d735] [^5a00a151] [^2f480339].

> But wait, what if the patient presents with acute pain or needs surgery? Transdermal buprenorphine has a slow onset and is not ideal for rapid titration or short-duration pain; in perioperative or acute settings, plan ahead for analgesic gaps and consider non-opioid multimodal regimens or carefully selected short-acting agents, recognizing the pharmacologic ceiling and receptor interactions that complicate rescue strategies [^144f7853] [^84553104].

> Let me reconsider the overall clinical take-home. Butrans offers a once-weekly, partial agonist opioid option with predictable PK, a ceiling on respiratory depression, and randomized trial evidence of analgesic benefit in selected chronic low back pain populations; however, response is heterogeneous, adverse effects including nausea and application-site reactions occur, and rigorous risk assessment, dose titration, and monitoring are essential. It is best reserved for patients with severe, persistent pain inadequately managed by non-opioid therapies or immediate-release opioids, and should be integrated with functional goals and a multimodal plan rather than used as monotherapy [^f456b5ce] [^4d9268d1] [^49d19647] [^5a00a151].

---

Butrans (buprenorphine transdermal system) is a **partial opioid agonist patch** for moderate-to-severe chronic pain requiring continuous, around-the-clock opioid therapy when alternatives are inadequate [^f456b5ce]. It provides **7-day analgesia** with a ceiling effect on respiratory depression, lowering overdose risk compared to full agonists [^5a00a151]. Common adverse effects include nausea, constipation, headache, and application-site reactions; serious risks include respiratory depression, QT prolongation, and misuse [^c4f300e0] [^651737f0] [^6c259c8e]. Start at 5 mcg/h (opioid-naive) or 10 mcg/h (opioid-experienced), titrate every 3 days to a max of 20 mcg/h, and rotate sites to avoid skin irritation [^28e1b8ae] [^b3982d7b] [^73bf5d72]. Use caution with hepatic impairment, CNS depressants, and in pregnancy; taper slowly to avoid withdrawal [^0a52f685] [^5a00a151] [^71c3bdc9].

---

## Pharmacological properties

- **Mechanism of action**: Partial agonist at mu-opioid receptors with high affinity and slow dissociation, providing sustained analgesia and a ceiling on respiratory depression [^5a00a151].

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Steady state by day 3; ~15% bioavailability; 7-day duration; dose-proportional exposure [^094d3ba0].

- **Ceiling effect**: Respiratory depression plateaus at higher doses, reducing overdose risk versus full agonists [^5a00a151].

---

## Clinical indications and efficacy

Indicated for **severe, persistent pain requiring daily, long-term opioid therapy** when alternatives are inadequate [^f456b5ce]. Trials show significant pain reduction versus placebo in chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis, with 49% achieving ≥ 30% pain reduction at 20 mcg/h [^4d9268d1] [^49d19647].

---

## Dosage and administration

| **Patient population** | **Initial dose** | **Titration** | **Maximum dose** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Opioid-naive | 5 mcg/h | Increase by 5–10 mcg/h every 3 days | 20 mcg/h |
| Opioid-experienced | 10 mcg/h | Increase by 5–10 mcg/h every 3 days | 20 mcg/h |

---

Apply to a **hairless site** on the upper outer arm, upper chest, upper back, or side of chest; rotate sites and wait ≥ 21 days before reusing a site [^73bf5d72]. Avoid heat, which can increase absorption and cause overdose [^dd39e792].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Common adverse effects include nausea, constipation, headache, dizziness, somnolence, and application-site reactions [^c4f300e0]. Serious adverse effects include **respiratory depression** (especially with CNS depressants or in elderly/debilitated patients), **QT prolongation** at 40 mcg/h, and **misuse/addiction** (monitor at-risk patients) [^8ea276ff] [^651737f0] [^6c259c8e].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **severe respiratory depression**, **acute or severe bronchial asthma**, **paralytic ileus**, or **hypersensitivity to buprenorphine** [^8ea276ff]. Use caution in hepatic impairment (start low, monitor), renal impairment (dose reduce if eGFR < 10), and pregnancy (monitor for neonatal withdrawal) [^0a52f685] [^72f9cdea] [^a2b990fe].

---

## Drug interactions

CNS depressants (benzodiazepines, alcohol, sedatives) increase **respiratory depression risk**; avoid or use the lowest effective doses with close monitoring [^5a00a151]. CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole) can increase buprenorphine levels; CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin) can decrease them.

---

## Clinical considerations and patient counseling

- **Withdrawal**: Taper slowly (≤ 10–25% every 2–4 weeks) to avoid withdrawal and rebound pain [^ceabe6be].

- **Breakthrough pain**: Use short-acting non-opioids or carefully selected opioids if needed [^c84e9298].

- **Storage/disposal**: Keep secure; fold used patches in half and flush or use a take-back program [^notfound].

---

Butrans is a **partial agonist transdermal opioid** for chronic pain with a favorable respiratory safety profile, but requires careful dosing, monitoring, and counseling to balance efficacy with risks.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of BUTRANS has been evaluated in four 12-week double-blind, controlled clinical trials in opioid-naïve and opioid-experienced patients with moderate to severe chronic low back pain or osteoarthritis using pain scores as the primary efficacy variable. Two of these studies, described below, demonstrated efficacy in patients with low back pain. One study in low back pain and one study in osteoarthritis did not show a statistically significant pain reduction for either BUTRANS or the respective active comparators.

12-Week Study in Opioid-Naïve Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain

A total of 1,024 patients with chronic low back pain who were suboptimally responsive to their non-opioid therapy entered an open-label, dose-titration period for up to four weeks. Patients initiated therapy with three days of treatment with BUTRANS 5 mcg/hour. After three days, if adverse events were tolerated, the dose was increased to BUTRANS 10 mcg/hour. If adverse effects were tolerated but adequate analgesia was not reached, the dose was increased to BUTRANS 20 mcg/hour for an additional 10–12 days. Patients who achieved adequate analgesia and tolerable adverse effects on BUTRANS 10 or 20 mcg/hour were then randomized to remain on their titrated dose of BUTRANS or matching placebo. Fifty-three percent of the patients who entered the open-label titration period were able to titrate to a tolerable and effective dose and were randomized into a 12-week, double-blind treatment period. Twenty-three percent of patients discontinued due to an adverse event from the open-label titration period and 14% discontinued due to lack of a therapeutic effect. The remaining 10% of patients were dropped due to various administrative reasons.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

BUTRANS is indicated for the management of severe and persistent pain that requires an extended treatment period with a daily opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.

Limitations of Use

Because of the risks of addiction, abuse and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration, and because of the greater risk of overdose and death with extended-release/long-acting opioid formulations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], reserve BUTRANS for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g., non-opioid analgesics or immediate-release opioids) are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain.
BUTRANS is not indicated as an as-needed (prn) analgesic

2.3 Initial Dosage

Use of BUTRANS as the First Opioid Analgesic (opioid-naive patients)

Initiate treatment with BUTRANS with a 5 mcg/hour patch.

Conversion from Other Opioids to BUTRANS When BUTRANS therapy is initiated, discontinue all other opioid analgesics other than those used on an as needed basis for breakthrough pain when appropriate.

There is a potential for buprenorphine to precipitate withdrawal in patients who are already on opioids.

Prior Total Daily Dose of Opioid Less than 30 mg of Oral Morphine Equivalents per Day: Initiate treatment with BUTRANS 5 mcg/hour at the next dosing interval (see Table 1 below, middle column).

Prior Total Daily Dose of Opioid Between 30 mg to 80 mg of Oral Morphine Equivalents per Day:

Taper the patient's current around-the-clock opioids for up to 7 days to no more than 30 mg of morphine or equivalent per day before beginning treatment with BUTRANS. Then initiate treatment with BUTRANS 10 mcg/hour at the next dosing interval (see Table 1 below, right column). Patients may use short-acting analgesics as needed until analgesic efficacy with BUTRANS is attained.

Prior Total Daily Dose of Opioid Greater than 80 mg of Oral Morphine Equivalents per Day: BUTRANS 20 mcg/hour may not provide adequate analgesia for patients requiring greater than 80 mg/day oral morphine equivalents. Consider the use of an alternate analgesic.

Table 1: Initial BUTRANS Dose

Conversion from Methadone to BUTRANS

Regular evaluation is of particular importance when converting from methadone to other opioid agonists. The ratio between methadone and other opioid agonists may vary widely as a function of previous dose exposure. Methadone has a long half-life and can accumulate in the plasma.

5.1 Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse

BUTRANS contains buprenorphine, a Schedule III controlled substance. As an opioid, BUTRANS exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)]. Because extended-release products such as BUTRANS deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death, due to the larger amount of buprenorphine present [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)].

Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed BUTRANS. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused.

Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing BUTRANS, and reassess all patients receiving BUTRANS for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as BUTRANS but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of BUTRANS, along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, or misuse. Consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Overdosage (10)].

Abuse or misuse of BUTRANS by placing it in the mouth, chewing it, swallowing it, or using it in ways other than indicated may cause choking, overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)].

Opioids are sought for nonmedical use and are subject to diversion from legitimate prescribed use. Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing BUTRANS. Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity and advising the patient on careful storage of the drug during the course of treatment and the proper disposal of unused drug. Contact local state professional licensing board or state-controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Information

BUTRANS should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of extended-release/long-acting opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.
BUTRANS doses of 7.5, 10, 15, and 20 mcg/hour are only for use in patients who are opioid experienced and in whom tolerance to an opioid of comparable potency has been established. Patients who are opioid-experienced are those receiving, for one week or longer, daily opioid doses up to 80 mg/day of oral morphine or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.
Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient's treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of BUTRANS for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.
Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with BUTRANS. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Instruct patients not to use BUTRANS if the pouch seal is broken or the patch is cut, damaged, or changed in any way and not to cut BUTRANS.
Instruct patients to avoid exposing BUTRANS to external heat sources, hot water, or prolonged direct sunlight [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

BUTRANS is for transdermal use (on intact skin) only. Each BUTRANS patch is intended to be worn for 7 days.

2.5 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of BUTRANS

Do not abruptly discontinue BUTRANS in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.

When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient taking BUTRANS, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the total daily dose of opioid (including BUTRANS) the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with comorbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.

### Buprenorphine (Butrans) [^c84e9298]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients who experience breakthrough pain may require dosage adjustment increase of BUTRANS, or may need rescue medication with an appropriate dose of an immediate-release analgesic.

If the level of pain increases after dose stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the BUTRANS dose. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after dosage increase) consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between the management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.

Because steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved within 72 hours, BUTRANS dosage may be adjusted every 3 days. Dose adjustments may be made in 5 mcg/hour, 7.5 mcg/hour, or 10 mcg/hour increments by using no more than two patches of the 5 mcg/hour, or 7.5 mcg/hour, or 10 mcg/hour system(s). The total dose from both patches should not exceed 20 mcg/hour. For the use of two patches, instruct patients to remove their current patch, and apply the two new patches at the same time, adjacent to one another at a different application site [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

2.4 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy

Individually titrate BUTRANS to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving BUTRANS to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and other adverse reactions, as well as reassessing for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.19)]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During use of opioid therapy for an extended period of time, periodically reassess the continued need for opioid analgesics.

The minimum BUTRANS titration interval is 72 hours, based on the pharmacokinetic profile and time to reach steady state levels [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The maximum BUTRANS dose is 20 mcg/hour. Do not exceed a dose of one 20 mcg/hour BUTRANS system due to the risk of QTc interval prolongation. In a clinical trial, BUTRANS 40 mcg/hour (given as two BUTRANS 20 mcg/hour systems) resulted in prolongation of the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

### Buprenorphine (Butrans) [^49d19647]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Of the patients who were able to be randomized in the double-blind period, the mean pain (SE) NRS scores were 6.4 (0.08) and 6.5 (0.08) at screening and were 2.8 (0.08) and 2.9 (0.08) at pre-randomization (beginning of Double-Blind Period) for the BUTRANS 5 mcg/hour and BUTRANS 20 mcg/hour, respectively.

The score for average pain over the last 24 hours at Week 12 was statistically significantly lower for subjects treated with BUTRANS 20 mcg/hour compared to subjects treated with BUTRANS 5 mcg/hour. A higher proportion of BUTRANS 20 mcg/hour patients (49%) had at least a 30% reduction in pain score from screening to study endpoint when compared to BUTRANS 5 mcg/hour patients (33%). The proportion of patients with various degrees of improvement from screening to study endpoint is shown in Figure 4 below.

### Buprenorphine (Butrans) [^4d9268d1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

During the first seven days of double-blind treatment patients were allowed up to two tablets per day of immediate-release oxycodone 5 mg as supplemental analgesia to minimize opioid withdrawal symptoms in patients randomized to placebo. Thereafter, the supplemental analgesia was limited to either acetaminophen 500 mg or ibuprofen 200 mg at a maximum of four tablets per day. Sixty-six percent of the patients treated with BUTRANS completed the 12-week treatment compared to 70% of the patients treated with placebo. Of the 256 patients randomized to BUTRANS, 9% discontinued due to lack of efficacy and 16% due to adverse events. Of the 283 patients randomized to placebo, 13% discontinued due to lack of efficacy and 7% due to adverse events.

Of the patients who were randomized, the mean pain (SE) NRS scores were 7.2 (0.08) and 7.2 (0.07) at screening and 2.6 (0.08) and 2.6 (0.07) at pre-randomization (beginning of double-blind phase) for the BUTRANS and placebo groups, respectively.

The score for average pain over the last 24 hours at the end of the study (Week 12/Early Termination) was statistically significantly lower for patients treated with BUTRANS compared with patients treated with placebo. The proportion of patients with various degrees of improvement, from screening to study endpoint, is shown in Figure 3 below.

There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on BUTRANS who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 10% to 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper.

It may be necessary to provide the patient with lower dosage strengths to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances.

When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period of time, and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see Warnings and Precautions (5.19), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

2.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment

BUTRANS has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. As BUTRANS is only intended for 7-day application, consider use of an alternate analgesic that may permit more flexibility with the dosing in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

Each BUTRANS system provides delivery of buprenorphine for 7 days. Steady state was achieved during the first application by Day 3 (see Figure 2).

Figure 2

 Mean (SD) Buprenorphine Plasma Concentrations Following Three Consecutive Applications of BUTRANS 10 mcg/hour (N = 36 Healthy Subjects)

BUTRANS 5, 10, and 20 mcg/hour provide dose-proportional total buprenorphine exposures (AUC) following 7-day applications. BUTRANS single 7-day application and steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters are summarized in Table 7. Plasma buprenorphine concentrations after titration showed no further change over the 60-day period studied.

Table 7: Pharmacokinetic Parameters of BUTRANS in Healthy Subjects, Mean (%CV)

Transdermal delivery studies showed that intact human skin is permeable to buprenorphine. In clinical pharmacology studies, the median time for BUTRANS 10 mcg/hour to deliver quantifiable buprenorphine concentrations (≥ 25 pg/mL) was approximately 17 hours.

The absolute bioavailability of BUTRANS relative to IV administration, following a 7-day application, is approximately 15% for all doses (BUTRANS 5, 10, and 20 mcg/hour).

Effects of Application Site

A study in healthy subjects demonstrated that the pharmacokinetic profile of buprenorphine delivered by BUTRANS 10 mcg/hour is similar when applied to the upper outer arm, upper chest, upper back, or the side of the chest [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

Figure 3: Percent Reduction in Pain Intensity

12-Week Study in Opioid-Experienced Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain

One thousand one hundred and sixty (1,160) patients on chronic opioid therapy (total daily dose 30–80 mg morphine equivalent) entered an open-label, dose-titration period with BUTRANS for up to 3 weeks, following taper of prior opioids. Patients initiated therapy with BUTRANS 10 mcg/hour for three days. After three days, if the patient tolerated the adverse effects, the dose was increased to BUTRANS 20 mcg/hour for up to 18 days. Patients with adequate analgesia and tolerable adverse effects on BUTRANS 20 mcg/hour were randomized to remain on BUTRANS 20 mcg/hour or were switched to a low-dose control (BUTRANS 5 mcg/hour) or an active control. Fifty-seven percent of the patients who entered the open-label titration period were able to titrate to and tolerate the adverse effects of BUTRANS 20 mcg/hour and were randomized into a 12-week double-blind treatment phase. Twelve percent of patients discontinued due to an adverse event and 21% discontinued due to lack of a therapeutic effect during the open-label titration period.

During the double-blind period, patients were permitted to take ibuprofen (200 mg tablets) or acetaminophen (500 mg tablets) every 4 hours as needed for supplemental analgesia (up to 3200 mg of ibuprofen and 4 grams of acetaminophen daily). Sixty-seven percent of patients treated with BUTRANS 20 mcg/hour and 58% of patients treated with BUTRANS 5 mcg/hour completed the 12-week treatment. Of the 219 patients randomized to BUTRANS 20 mcg/hour, 11% discontinued due to lack of efficacy and 13% due to adverse events. Of the 221 patients randomized to BUTRANS 5 mcg/hour, 24% discontinued due to lack of efficacy and 6% due to adverse events.

### A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy comparison of the efficacy and tolerability of low-dose transdermal buprenorphine (buTrans seven-day patches) with buprenorphine sublingual tablets (temgesic) in patients with osteoarthritis pain [^64413fc1]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common cause of chronic pain, particularly in the older population. Modern approaches to the management of OA pain recommend tailoring treatment to the individual. This study examines treatment options for OA pain in the form of low-dose transdermal and sublingual opioid analgesia.

Objectives

The aims of this trial were to compare the efficacy and tolerability of seven-day, low-dose transdermal buprenorphine patches (BuTrans, Napp Pharmaceuticals Limited UK) with sublingual buprenorphine (Temgesic, Schering-Plough Limited UK) in patients with moderate to severe pain caused by OA of the hip(s) and/or knee(s), and to establish analgesic equivalence of the two products.

Methods

Two hundred forty-six patients with OA pain in the hip(s) and/or knee(s) were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study; 110 completed the study. Patients were randomized to receive transdermal buprenorphine patches (5, 10, and 20 microg/hour) or sublingual buprenorphine (200 and 400 microg tablets). Their medication was titrated to pain control and they were treated for up to seven weeks. The main outcome measures were pain intensity (primary outcome), sleep disturbance, quality of life, and safety assessments.

Results

Patients' Box Scale-11 pain scores decreased between entry and assessment in both treatment groups. During the 28-day assessment period, the estimated mean treatment differences (95% confidence intervals) were 0.00 (-0.68,0.69), -0.11 (-0.85,0.63), and -0.13 (-0.95,0.68), for the morning, midday, and evening scores, respectively. All the confidence intervals were within the prespecified limits for equivalence (-1.5, 1.5). Use of escape medication was low. In both treatment groups, sleep disturbance caused by pain decreased between entry and assessment. Patients' quality of life improved during the study. Significantly fewer patients receiving the transdermal buprenorphine patches reported nausea (P = 0.035), dizziness (P = 0.026), and vomiting (P = 0.039).

Conclusion

In conclusion, seven-day, low-dose transdermal buprenorphine patches are as effective as sublingual buprenorphine, with a better tolerability profile.

### Buprenorphine-an attractive opioid with underutilized potential in treatment of chronic pain [^18d15ee8]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine in pain treatment

Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at μ-receptor. The data in Table 1 suggests that the affinity of buprenorphine for ORL1 receptor is approximately 50 times lower than for μ-receptor and many preclinical reports indicate that ORL1 agonism may contribute to reducing its antinociception effect at high concentration. The significance of ORL1 activation and implication on pronociceptive effect are not validated in clinic. In addition, a number of studies suggest that buprenorphine dose needs for treatment of pain are much lower compared to doses used for the treatment of opioid addiction. The typical analgesic dose of buprenorphine is 0.3–0.6 mg (im or iv), and its analgesic effects last approximately 6 hours. A review of clinical trials showed that buprenorphine was effective in 25/26 trials. Contrary to previous concerns, no analgesic ceiling effect and no antagonism on a combination of buprenorphine with pure μ-OR agonists is seen within the therapeutic dose range in humans. Some authors believe that false myths about buprenorphine based on unconfirmed animal data and early clinical research came into textbooks on pharmacology and pain approximately 30 years ago and have been difficult to eradicate. The fact is that in clinical practice there is no bell-shaped dose–response curve, there is no plateau on the dose–response curve, and there is no antagonist effect from buprenorphine on other μ-opioid agonists. This was also the conclusion by a panel of world experts convened to review pharmacology of buprenorphine and available evidence.

Effective long-term pain relief requires sustenance of opioid plasma levels for extended period to prolong duration of analgesic action and reduce potential adverse effects. The introduction of slow release, transdermal drug delivery systems offered a number of advantages. Depending upon the formulation and the pain model, buprenorphine has been reported to be approximately 25–100 times more potent than morphine.–The conversion calculations for buprenorphine to morphine suggest an equipotency ratio of 1:110–1:115 to accomplish the same degree of analgesia.–

Transdermal buprenorphine product butrans ® (5, 10, and 20 μg/h) is useful in controlling pain. The published observations suggest that 20 μg/h butrans ® may be equivalent to 12–16 μg/day sublingual dose. At the same time 5 μg/h dose of buprenorphine may be a high start dose for frail, elderly patients.

Introduction

Chronic pain affects ∼30% of Americans, and this percentage continues to increase as the population ages. The prevalence of chronic pain has led to an increase in the prescription of opioid pain relievers; this is an attempt to minimize the detrimental impacts of this condition on patients' quality of life, as conservative nonpharmacologic nonopioid therapies are often ineffective. Nevertheless, for many practitioners, opioids continue to be a mainstay of chronic pain management despite governmental and social scrutiny. Unfortunately, the improper use and diversion of prescription opioids have contributed to a national opioid crisis, including addiction and opioid overdose–related deaths.

Opioids vary in both their ability to produce therapeutic effects and their potential for abuse. Differences in abuse potential are recognized by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Scheduling criteria; by DEA definition, "Schedule III drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence. Schedule III drugs' abuse potential is less than Schedule I and Schedule II drugs and more than Schedule IV". Most of the opioids indicated for chronic pain management fall into the Schedule II category. However, the optimal treatment of chronic pain should incorporate an individualized and clinically effective treatment approach on the basis of the patient's risk/benefit profile with the least potential for physical and psychological dependence.

Buprenorphine is a Schedule III opioid analgesic that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1981 as an injectable agent (Buprenex) for the treatment of moderate to severe pain (Figure 1). After the engineering of a sublingual (noninjectable) delivery system, buprenorphine was approved for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD). More recently, novel buprenorphine formulations have been FDA approved for the management of chronic pain. Buprenorphine buccal film (Belbuca, BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc, Raleigh, NC, USA) and the buprenorphine transdermal system (Butrans, Purdue Pharma, LP, Stamford, CT, USA) are the formulations indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.

### Primary care-based buprenorphine taper vs maintenance therapy for prescription opioid dependence: a randomized clinical trial [^8ca59685]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Prescription opioid dependence is increasing and creates a significant public health burden, but primary care physicians lack evidence-based guidelines to decide between tapering doses followed by discontinuation of buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride therapy (hereinafter referred to as buprenorphine therapy) or ongoing maintenance therapy.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of buprenorphine taper vs ongoing maintenance therapy in primary care-based treatment for prescription opioid dependence.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We conducted a 14-week randomized clinical trial that enrolled 113 patients with prescription opioid dependence from February 17, 2009, through February 1, 2013, in a single primary care site.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to buprenorphine taper (taper condition) or ongoing buprenorphine maintenance therapy (maintenance condition). The buprenorphine taper was initiated after 6 weeks of stabilization, lasted for 3 weeks, and included medications for opioid withdrawal, after which patients were offered naltrexone treatment. The maintenance group received ongoing buprenorphine therapy. All patients received physician and nurse support and drug counseling.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Illicit opioid use via results of urinanalysis and patient report, treatment retention, and reinitiation of buprenorphine therapy (taper group only).

Results

During the trial, the mean percentage of urine samples negative for opioids was lower for patients in the taper group (35.2% [95% CI, 26.2%-44.2%]) compared with those in the maintenance group (53.2% [95% CI, 44.3%-62.0%]). Patients in the taper group reported more days per week of illicit opioid use than those in the maintenance group once they were no longer receiving buprenorphine (mean use, 1.27 [95% CI, 0.60–1.94] vs 0.47 [95% CI, 0.19–0.74] days). Patients in the taper group had fewer maximum consecutive weeks of opioid abstinence compared with those in the maintenance group (mean abstinence, 2.70 [95% CI, 1.72–3.75] vs 5.20 [95% CI, 4.16–6.20] weeks). Patients in the taper group were less likely to complete the trial (6 of 57 [11%] vs 37 of 56 [66%]; P < .001). Sixteen patients in the taper group reinitiated buprenorphine treatment after the taper owing to relapse.

Conclusions and Relevance

Tapering is less efficacious than ongoing maintenance treatment in patients with prescription opioid dependence who receive buprenorphine therapy in primary care.

5.18 Anaphylactic/Allergic Reactions

Cases of acute and chronic hypersensitivity to buprenorphine have been reported both in clinical trials and in the post-marketing experience. The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus. Cases of bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported. A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine is a contraindication to the use of BUTRANS.

5.19 Withdrawal

Do not abruptly discontinue buprenorphine in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing BUTRANS in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of buprenorphine in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

Additionally, the use of BUTRANS, a partial agonist opioid analgesic, in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. Avoid concomitant use of BUTRANS with a full opioid agonist analgesic.

5.20 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery

BUTRANS may impair the mental and physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of BUTRANS and know how they will react to the medication.

5.21 Use in Addiction Treatment

BUTRANS has not been studied and is not approved for use in the management of addictive disorders.

2.7 Administration of BUTRANS

Instruct patients to apply immediately after removal from the individually sealed pouch. Instruct patients not to use BUTRANS if the pouch seal is broken or the patch is cut, damaged, or changed in any way. See the Instructions for Use for step-by-step instructions for applying BUTRANS.
Apply BUTRANS to the upper outer arm, upper chest, upper back or the side of the chest. These 4 sites (each present on both sides of the body) provide 8 possible application sites. Rotate BUTRANS among the 8 described skin sites. After BUTRANS removal, wait a minimum of 21 days before reapplying to the same skin site [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Apply BUTRANS to a hairless or nearly hairless skin site. If none are available, the hair at the site should be clipped, not shaven. Do not apply BUTRANS to irritated skin. If the application site must be cleaned, clean the site with water only. Do not use soaps, alcohol, oils, lotions, or abrasive devices. Allow the skin to dry before applying BUTRANS.
Incidental exposure of the BUTRANS patch to water, such as while bathing or showering is acceptable based on experience during clinical studies.
If problems with adhesion of BUTRANS occur, the edges may be taped with first aid tape. If problems with lack of adhesion continue, the patch may be covered with waterproof or semipermeable adhesive dressings suitable for 7 days of wear.
If BUTRANS falls off during the 7-day dosing interval, dispose of the transdermal system properly and place a new BUTRANS patch on at a different skin site.
When changing the system, instruct patients to remove BUTRANS and dispose of it properly [see Dosage and Administration (2.8)].
If the buprenorphine-containing adhesive matrix accidentally contacts the skin, instruct patients or caregivers to wash the area with water and not to use soap, alcohol, or other solvents to remove the adhesive because they may enhance the absorption of the drug.

Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of hyperalgesia, including worsening pain, increased sensitivity to pain, or new pain [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Serotonin Syndrome

Inform patients that opioids could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition called serotonin syndrome resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs. Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop. Instruct patients to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take serotonergic medications [see Drug Interactions (7)].

MAOI Interaction

Inform patients to avoid taking BUTRANS while using any drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase. Patients should not start MAOIs while taking BUTRANS [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Important Administration Instructions

Instruct patients how to properly use BUTRANS, including the following:

To carefully follow instructions for the application, removal, and disposal of BUTRANS. Each week, apply BUTRANS to a different site based on the 8 described skin sites, with a minimum of 3 weeks between applications to a previously used site [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].
To apply BUTRANS to a hairless or nearly hairless skin site. If none are available, instruct patients to clip the hair at the site and not to shave the area. Instruct patients not to apply to irritated skin. If the application site must be cleaned, use clear water only. Soaps, alcohol, oils, lotions, or abrasive devices should not be used. Allow the skin to dry before applying BUTRANS [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].
To avoid exposing the BUTRANS application site to external heat sources, hot water, or prolonged direct sunlight [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

5.9 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia

Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence (9.3)]. Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior.

Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.19)].

5.10 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients

The use of BUTRANS in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.

Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: BUTRANS-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of BUTRANS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Regularly evaluate patients particularly when initiating and titrating BUTRANS and when BUTRANS is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, Drug Interactions (7)]. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.

5.6 Risks of Use with Application of External Heat

Advise patients and their caregivers to avoid exposing the BUTRANS application site and surrounding area to direct external heat sources, such as heating pads or electric blankets, heat or tanning lamps, saunas, hot tubs, and heated water beds while wearing the system because an increase in absorption of buprenorphine may occur [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Advise patients against exposure of the BUTRANS application site and surrounding area to hot water or prolonged exposure to direct sunlight. There is a potential for temperature-dependent increases in buprenorphine released from the system resulting in possible overdose and death.

5.7 Risks of Use in Patients with Fever

Regularly evaluate patients wearing BUTRANS systems who develop fever or increased core body temperature due to strenuous exertion for opioid side effects and adjust the BUTRANS dose if signs of respiratory or central nervous system depression occur.

5.8 Application Site Skin Reactions

In rare cases, severe application site skin reactions with signs of marked inflammation including "burn", "discharge", and "vesicles" have occurred. Time of onset varies, ranging from days to months following the initiation of BUTRANS treatment. Instruct patients to promptly report the development of severe application site reactions and discontinue therapy.

### Use of immediate-release opioids as supplemental analgesia during management of moderate-to-severe chronic pain with buprenorphine transdermal system [^b955ba6c]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pain conditions affect approximately 100 million adults in the US. The US Food and Drug Administration guidance has noted that prescription opioids are an important component of modern pain management. Opioid medications can be classified as immediate-release (IR) or extended-release (ER)/long-acting (LA) opioid formulations on the basis of their duration of action. Usually, IR opioids are short-acting, intended for use every 3–6 hours, and are more appropriate for transient pain types, such as acute, breakthrough, or intermittent pain. Common IR opioids (eg, morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, codeine, fentanyl, tramadol, tapentadol, oxycodone, and hydrocodone) may be available as single entity or in combination with acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Due to associated risks of hepatic and gastrointestinal toxicity with acetaminophen or NSAIDs, the maximum daily amount of these combination therapies may be limited. On the other hand, ER/LA opioids have a prolonged half-life and deliver a dose over a longer period of time (greater than 8 hours), which makes them appropriate for patients with persistent chronic pain that requires stable, around-the-clock dosing. Generally, ER/LA opioids are intended to result in less frequent administration than IR-opioid formulations.

Buprenorphine hydrochloride was introduced in the US for pain management in a parenteral form in 1981. Transdermal formulations for pain management were launched in Europe in 2001, which led to renewed interest in the use of buprenorphine to treat cancer pain and chronic nonmalignant pain. In 2010, the buprenorphine transdermal system (BTDS; Butrans®, Purdue Pharma LP, Stamford, CT, US) was approved in the US for the management of chronic pain.–The BTDS is a transdermal patch that delivers an average of 5, 7.5, 10, 15, or 20 μg/h of buprenorphine over 7 days. It is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. Several studies have demonstrated that the BTDS is effective, safe, and generally well tolerated among adults with moderate–severe chronic pain.–

10 OVERDOSAGE

Clinical Presentation

The manifestations of acute overdose include pinpoint pupils, sedation, hypotension, hypoglycemia, respiratory depression, and death.

Treatment of Overdose

In the event of overdose, the respiratory and cardiac status of the patient should be monitored carefully. When respiratory or cardiac functions are depressed, primary attention should be given to the re-establishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Oxygen, IV fluids, vasopressors, and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated.

In the case of overdose, the primary management should be the re-establishment of adequate ventilation with mechanical assistance of respiration, if required. Naloxone may be of value for the management of buprenorphine overdose. Higher than normal doses and repeated administration may be necessary. The long duration of action of buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablets should be taken into consideration when determining the length of treatment and medical surveillance needed to reverse the effects of an overdose. Insufficient duration of monitoring may put patients at risk.

### Safety and efficacy of the unique opioid buprenorphine for the treatment of chronic pain [^79a52742]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Treatment options for chronic pain, such as buprenorphine, are especially important when the United States is facing increasing opioid misuse and related overdoses. Because buprenorphine has less potential for abuse than drugs or substances in Schedules I and II, it has been classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) as a Schedule III controlled substance. Orally administered buprenorphine has only approximately 10% bioavailability, but recent advances in drug delivery circumvent this issue. The sublingual formulation provides approximately 28–51% bioavailability, the transdermal formulation provides approximately 15%, and the buccal film exhibits 46–65% bioavailability. Each of these formulations bypasses first-pass metabolism.–

Buprenorphine transdermal system (Butrans ®, Purdue Pharma, LP, Stamford, CT) and buprenorphine buccal film (Belbuca ®, BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc, Raleigh, NC) are the two formulations currently indicated for the management of pain that is severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. This standard labeling is required on all extended-release (ER) or long-acting opioids indicated for chronic pain. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the clinical efficacy and safety of these Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved buprenorphine formulations and to elaborate on the current data that support its effective and potentially safer use in chronic pain management compared with ER Schedule II opioids.

Effects on Cardiac Electrophysiology

The effect of BUTRANS 10 mcg/hour and 2 x BUTRANS 20 mcg/hour on QTc interval was evaluated in a double-blind (BUTRANS vs. placebo), randomized, placebo and active-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg, open label), parallel-group, dose-escalating, single-dose study in 132 healthy male and female subjects aged 18 to 55 years. The dose escalation sequence for BUTRANS during the titration period was: BUTRANS 5 mcg/hour for 3 days, then BUTRANS 10 mcg/hour for 3 days, then BUTRANS 20 mcg/hour for 3 days, then 2 x BUTRANS 20 mcg/hour for 4 days. The QTc evaluation was performed during the third day of BUTRANS 10 mcg/hour and the fourth day of 2 x BUTRANS 20 mcg/hour when the plasma levels of buprenorphine were at steady state for the corresponding doses [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17)].

There was no clinically meaningful effect on mean QTc with a BUTRANS dose of 10 mcg/hour. A BUTRANS dose of 40 mcg/hour (given as two 20 mcg/hour BUTRANS Transdermal Systems) prolonged mean QTc by a maximum of 9.2 (90% CI: 5.2–13.3) msec across the 13 assessment time points.

Buprenorphine treatment duration

We identified individuals with at least one prescription of buprenorphine between the years 1997 to 2019 and categorized them into (a) patients with buprenorphine prescription duration of less than 6 months (short-BTD) and (b) patients with buprenorphine prescription duration of equal to or greater than 6 months (long-BTD). This categorization was based on evidence suggesting that patients retained in treatment beyond 6 months show improved outcomes. Because we lacked information regarding the end date of the buprenorphine prescription, we employed a pragmatic approach by considering the standard 30-day duration for pharmacy fills. To classify patients into the long-BTD group, we established a criterion of requiring at least six buprenorphine prescriptions within a 6-month interval that was calculated as the time between consecutive prescriptions. The buprenorphine-related prescriptions are listed in Supplementary Table 1. To enrich the population of patients for whom VUMC was the most likely source of primary care, we used a heuristic 'medical home' definition (i.e. at least five codes on different days over a span of 3 years). We chose this approach to reduce confounding due to systematic missing values in the data. We also removed from the sample all individuals who had at least one cancer-related ICD-code, taking into account that cancer-related pain may be related to long-term analgesic use. Finally, although the vast majority of buprenorphine products used in VUMC are for OUD, there are two buprenorphine products that are used for pain in the outpatient clinics by the pain medicine physicians (i.e. Belbuca and Butrans). Fourteen percent (14%) of the total sample had received this prescription, and we also removed these individuals from our analyses. This resulted in a total of 6686 patients with short-BTD and 1282 patients with long-BTD.

### Trends in out-of-pocket costs for and characteristics of pharmacy-dispensed buprenorphine medications for opioid use disorder treatment by type of payer, 2015 to 2020 [^d3159e93]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Data are from the IQVIA Longitudinal Prescription (LRx) database, capturing 92% of retail pharmacy prescriptions in the US. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline reporting guideline. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined human participant regulations, including informed participant consent, and institutional review board review was not applicable because deidentified secondary data were used in accordance with 45 CFR §46.

Buprenorphine prescriptions dispensed to adults (aged ≥ 18 years) from January 1, 2015, through December 31, 2020, were identified. Buprenorphine formulations primarily used to treat pain (Butrans and Belbuca) were not included in the sample. Prescriptions missing cost (2 917 421 prescriptions) and approximately 0.1% of the sample with negative or exceedingly high cost values (67 631 prescriptions) were excluded. The final sample was 67 592 683 prescriptions from 2015 to 2020.

Prescription payers captured in the LRx data were combined into 6 categories: private and commercial, self-pay, Medicaid, Medicare, assistance, and unknown. Private and commercial included several forms of employer-sponsored health insurance, plans purchased through health insurance exchanges, and those administered by pharmacy benefit managers. Self-pay indicates a prescription was paid for entirely with cash. Medicaid includes Medicaid managed care or fee-for-service Medicaid. Medicare indicates prescriptions paid by Medicare Part D. The assistance category indicates payment using a discount card (including non-Medicare senior discount cards), a coupon, or a voucher. The unknown category was composed of prescriptions that were missing payer type or had "unspecified third party" or "unknown" for payer type (more detail on payer categories is provided in eTable 1 in Supplement 1).

Marketed buprenorphine

Transdermal buprenorphine formulations (butrans ®) have been available in the US since 2011 as 5, 10 and 20 μg/h dose for 7-day delivery patches. Buprenorphine has also been available in most European countries since 2001 as transtec ® in 35, 52.5 and 70 μg/h transdermal patches that deliver dose over 96 hours. Transdermal buprenorphine is approved and indicated for the management of moderate to severe chronic pain in patients requiring a continuous, around-the-clock opioid analgesic for an extended period. Transdermal patches show high variability in PK and take approximately 60 hours to reach steady state. Slow onset with transdermal formulations and inability to adjust initial dose levels may limit the utility in some cases. The supplemental addition of immediate release full μ-agonist is used as a co-therapy in many cases. Transdermal patches may also cause erythema and pruritus.
Sublingual formulations of buprenorphine are available in the US market as monotherapy (generic subutex ®; tablet) and a combination therapy of buprenorphine with naloxone (generic suboxone ®, zubsolv ®, temgesic ®, as a tablet or film) for opioid addiction. Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc. Richmond, VA, USA discontinued distribution of buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablets in March 2013, as a result of concerns over accidental or unsupervised pediatric exposure compared to the film formulation. Subutex ® was discontinued previously in 2011. Sublingual tablets are very common but can take up to 10 minutes to dissolve. Many suffer from after taste, dissolve time, and dispensing restrictions. Branded formulations such as suboxone sublingual film (Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals Inc.), bunavail ® (BioDelivery Sciences, Raleigh, NC, USA) mucoadhesive film and zubsolv ® (Orexo, Uppsala, Sweden) sublingual tablet were launched during 2011–2015. Mucoadhesive film bunavail seems to have much better taste but dissolution time may be higher per individual observations.
Buprenex ® as an injectable (iv or im) approved in US for moderate pain.
No oral buprenorphine product is in the market currently. Low bioavailability (poor absorption, high first pass effect) and uncertainty on GI safety have been limiting factors. Some oral formulations are under investigation (Table 4).

These buprenorphine products are classified as Schedule III controlled. The Tables 2 and 4 gives a summary of marketed and under development buprenorphine formulations.

Q10. Immediate-release buprenorphine use in acute care — formulation options and ED practice are described. Buprenorphine is available in several formulations, some in combination with naloxone; the most commonly used preparations in the emergency department (ED) are sublingual film and sublingual tablets, with little clinical difference between them or compared with less commonly used buccal preparations. Lower-dose preparations (Belbuca and Butrans) are indicated for pain, not OUD treatment. Buprenorphine is also available as an intravenous 0.3-mg/mL solution for injection; this formulation is FDA approved only for acute pain management but can be used for opioid withdrawal when vomiting interferes with sublingual administration. Access to intravenous buprenorphine is not required, as sublingual administration is almost always effective even in the setting of vomiting.

Definitions and Variables

Medication prescribing records contain EPIC-generated medication IDs in addition to text fields containing the medication name, generic name, form, and pharmaceutical class. We searched the generic name field for all opioid medications that can be ordered with a prescription in outpatient settings in the United States (eTable 2 in the Supplement). We included medications with a pharmaceutical class of analgesic and excluded those with class of expectorant, antitussive, antidiarrheal, and all that were not oral or transdermal in form. We excluded buprenorphine with the exception of 2 forms that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for pain (Butrans and Belbuca). Prescription order data included the ordering date, patient ID, prescriber ID, medicine name, strength (eg, 5 mg), number of units (eg, 30 tablets), and number of authorized refills. Refills were counted in the same year or quarter as the initiating prescription. We defined long-acting formulations as those that included the terms extended release or long acting in their generic name or form fields as well as methadone tablets and transdermal formulations. Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) conversion reference table, we calculated the morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) for each prescription as the product of the medication strength, number of units, number of refills, and the relevant conversion factor.

Using the cohort year as the unit of analysis, we calculated several measures of opioid prescribing for each year of the study: (1) percentage of patients who received at least 1 prescription for an opioid by age and sex, (2) number of opioid prescriptions per 100 patients, (3) number of long-acting opioid prescriptions per 100 patients, (4) mean annual MME per patient, (5) mean MME per prescription, (6) number of chronic opioid users, and (7) number of high-dose opioid users. We defined chronic opioid users as patients who were prescribed within any calendar quarter 160 or more opioid pills (short acting or long acting), 90 or more long-acting pills, or any methadone pills or fentanyl patches. Prescription instructions were found to be unreliable in EHR data because many were composed of free text that could not be categorized, complicating the calculation of a daily dose. Therefore, we defined high-dose users as those individuals among chronic opioid users with a mean of more than 90 MMEs/d through any quarter of a calendar year.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Clinical Presentation

The manifestations of acute overdose include pinpoint pupils, sedation, hypotension, hypoglycemia, respiratory depression, and death. Toxic leukoencephalopathy has been reported after opioid overdose and can present hours, days, or weeks after apparent recovery from the initial intoxication.

Treatment of Overdose

In the event of overdose, the respiratory and cardiac status of the patient should be monitored carefully. When respiratory or cardiac functions are depressed, primary attention should be given to the re-establishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation. Oxygen, IV fluids, vasopressors, and other supportive measures should be employed as indicated.

In the case of overdose, the primary management should be the re-establishment of adequate ventilation with mechanical assistance of respiration, if required. An opioid overdose reversal agent may be of value for the management of buprenorphine overdose. Higher than normal doses and repeated administration may be necessary. The long duration of action of Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Tablets should be taken into consideration when determining the length of treatment and medical surveillance needed to reverse the effects of an overdose. Insufficient duration of monitoring may put patients at risk.

### Buprenorphine-an attractive opioid with underutilized potential in treatment of chronic pain [^342360b5]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Efficacy in broad pain phenotypes

Preclinical studies establish effectiveness of buprenorphine under varying pain conditions including formalin injection, cold temperature tail flick, and diffuse noxious inhibitory control tests. Human studies indicate buprenorphine to be effective in broader pain conditions (bone pain, heat pain, pain related to nerve growth factor injections, and cold pressor pain) than fentanyl which was effective only in cold pressor pain. Less dramatic differences were reported in another comparative pain study between fentanyl and buprenorphine. The data, however, support the potential utility of buprenorphine in a range of painful conditions.

Buprenorphine (butrans ® or butoxone) has also been used successfully to treat musculoskeletal, visceral, as well as for chronic headaches. Furthermore, possibly because of kappa antagonism, buprenorphine seems to have antidepressive and antianxiety properties, which also helps in pain management.

Combination and rotation with opioids

Recent studies indicate that buprenorphine could be effectively and safely combined with full μ-agonists, and switching between buprenorphine and another opioid provides comparable pain relief using equianalgesic doses. The results indicate that adding opioids to patients currently receiving buprenorphine therapy is safe and effective, while the addition of buprenorphine to patients receiving other opioid therapy should be used more cautiously. Buprenorphine has been combined with other opioids (morphine, tramadol) and has demonstrated additivity. In one study, supra-additive analgesia has been reported in combination study of buprenorphine with oxycodone or hydromorphone. Although buprenorphine has demonstrated very high affinity for μ-receptors, it occupies fewer receptors for analgesia, which leads to a significant receptor reserve for other μ-agonists. Buprenorphine increases μ-receptor expression, which allows other μ-agonists to interact with receptors.

Supplemental dosing with an opioid is the main treatment suggested to manage breakthrough pain in cancer patients. Combination of immediate release or iv morphine and a basal analgesic regime of transdermal buprenorphine has been used as an effective and safe treatment. Clinically, the treatment shows an additive analgesic effect, without any safety relevant issues. No cross tolerance was observed during rotation between buprenorphine and fentanyl. Future studies will need to confirm combination therapy and the role of buprenorphine in opioid rotation.

### Limited access to on-label formulations of buprenorphine for chronic pain as compared with conventional opioids [^eae9d735]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Importance

Buprenorphine is a Schedule III analgesic that is recommended as the firstline long-acting opioid for the treatment of chronic pain due to its ceiling effect on respiratory depression, adverse effect profile, and analgesic efficacy. However, prescription drug coverage policies commonly require that patients try and fail multiple Schedule II conventional opioids before approval of on-label use of buprenorphine for chronic pain.

Design

A retrospective review was performed looking at coverage of buprenorphine in the forms of Butrans and Belbuca. Patient denial letters, web searches of insurance and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), and an online tool (formularylookup.com) were used to assess the coverage and availability of buprenorphine for chronic pain.

Results

Unrestricted access to Butrans was reported for 42% of commercial lives and 11% of Medicare lives in all locations. Unrestricted access to Belbuca was reported for 53% of commercial lives and 23% of Medicare lives in all locations. Oxycodone immediate-release has unrestricted access for 84% of commercial plans and 97% of Medicare plans. Morphine extended-release has unrestricted access for 62% of commercial lives and 65% of Medicare lives.

Conclusions and Relevance

There are > 17,000 prescription opioid-involved deaths each year in the United States. By substituting buprenorphine as the firstline treatment for chronic and even acute pain, there may be fewer prescribed conventional opioids in the United States. Schedule III buprenorphine formulations for chronic pain should be given unrestricted access for appropriate patients before considering a Schedule II opioid as a public health priority.

### Buprenorphine management in the perioperative period: educational review and recommendations from a multisociety expert panel [^84553104]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Outcome assessment beyond pain — Pain should always be evaluated in context, as a change in activity levels, anxiety, or analgesic usage can significantly affect patient insight. In many interventional pain studies, improvement in function may be a more meaningful and realistic benchmark than pain relief, with several high-impact physical intervention studies using disability as their primary endpoint. For relief of acute pain, many experts advocate the utilization of rescue analgesic medications as an appropriate benchmark for success. There is also an increased interest in pain biomarkers that may help guide diagnosis and response to treatment; however, the research and application of this information is still in its infancy.

### Superiority and cost-effectiveness of monthly extended-release buprenorphine versus daily standard of care medication: a pragmatic, parallel-group, open-label, multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial [^2e784de3]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In the UK, primary and secondary care National Health Service (NHS) clinics and non-governmental (third-sector) services provide the OUD SoC. Treatment is initiated by observed daily dosing at community pharmacies. Adherent patients can collect their prescription at set intervals for up to 14 days to take medication at home. During April 2019–March 2022, 71,034 people in England were enrolled in the SoC — the majority with heroin use disorder. A further 69,565 people were enrolled in the SoC with dual OUD and cocaine use disorder (OUD-CUD). Use of illicit benzodiazepines among the OUD population is also a recognised problem contributing to the risk of fatal overdose.

On average, MET or BUP-SL maintenance is associated with reduced opioid use and increased abstinence; a reduced risk of fatal overdose; and improvements on various dimensions of personal and social functioning. However, the SoC is sub-optimal for many patients. For example, in a cohort of 12,745 patients in England enrolled for 12–26 weeks in the SoC, 64% were using heroin on ≥ 10 days in the past month. In another English cohort of 54,347 patients, just 22% were abstinent when they left treatment. There is a meta-analysis estimate that 53% of patients enrolled in BUP-SL and 63% enrolled in MET maintenance complete their treatment successfully; and that 50–90% relapse to opioid use one month after discharge.

### Once-weekly transdermal buprenorphine application results in sustained and consistent steady-state plasma levels [^3ac341c8]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Transdermal formulations of buprenorphine offer controlled delivery of buprenorphine for sustained analgesic efficacy with reduced adverse events (AEs) compared with the other modes of administration. A buprenorphine transdermal system (BTDS) delivering 5, 10, or 20 mcg/hour for seven days is now marketed in the U.S. as Butrans(®) (Lohmann Therapie-System AG, Andernach Germany), a Schedule III single-entity opioid analgesic indicated for the management of moderate and chronic pain in patients requiring continuous around-the-clock analgesia for an extended period.

Objectives

This was a randomized open-label study in healthy subjects to characterize the steady-state buprenorphine pharmacokinetics after the delivery of three consecutive seven-day BTDS applications.

Methods

Thirty-seven subjects were randomized to receive three consecutive BTDS 10 mcg/hour (BTDS 10) patches applied to the deltoid or upper back for seven days each. Blood samples for buprenorphine concentration measurements were taken. Safety was assessed using recorded AEs, clinical laboratory test results, vital signs, pulse oximetry, physical examinations, and electrocardiograms. Patch adhesion assessments were taken.

Results

Analysis of Cmin demonstrated that steady state was reached during the first BTDS 10 application. No significant difference in Cmin was observed across the three applications. Total and peak plasma buprenorphine exposures were similar after each of the seven-day administrations of BTDS.

Conclusion

Three consecutive once-weekly applications of BTDS 10 provided consistent and sustained delivery of buprenorphine. Steady-state plasma concentrations were reached within 48 hours of the first application of BTDS 10. Patch adhesion analysis confirmed the appropriateness of the seven-day application period. Overall, BTDS 10 was safe and well tolerated.

### Buprenorphine, pain, and opioid use in patients taking high-dose long-term opioids: a randomized clinical trial [^d6447ecd]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Guidelines recommend dose reduction or discontinuation of long-term opioid therapy when harm outweighs benefit, but strategies to help patients do so are limited.

Objective

To test optionally switching to buprenorphine as a strategy for improving pain and reducing opioids among patients prescribed high-dose, full agonist long-term opioid therapy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this pragmatic, multisite, 12-month randomized clinical trial with masked outcome assessment, patients treated at Veterans Affairs primary care clinics were recruited from October 2017 to March 2021, with follow-up completed June 2022. Eligible patients had moderate to severe chronic pain despite high-dose opioid therapy (≥ 70 mg/d for at least 3 months). Patients were randomized to having the option to switch to buprenorphine or not having the option to switch.

Interventions

The buprenorphine option was discussed with eligible patients as part of a larger trial of collaborative pain care interventions. Those who switched had structured follow-up to optimize dosing and address adverse effects.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was Brief Pain Inventory total score at 12 months. The main secondary outcome was opioid dose in morphine milligram equivalents at 12 months.

Results

Of 207 included participants, 185 (89.4%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 60.9 (10.2) years. A total of 104 were randomized to the buprenorphine option and 103 to the no buprenorphine option. In the buprenorphine option arm, 27 participants (26.0%) switched. Over 12 months, the mean (SD) Brief Pain Inventory score improved from 6.8 (1.5) to 6.1 (1.9; adjusted mean difference [AMD], -0.59; 95% CI, -0.89 to -0.29) in the buprenorphine option arm and from 6.8 (1.6) to 6.3 (1.7; AMD, -0.50; 95% CI, -0.81 to 0.20) in the no option arm (between-group AMD, -0.09; 95% CI, -0.52 to 0.34). Over 12 months, mean (SD) opioid dosage decreased from 157 (75) mg/d to 94 (98) mg/d in the buprenorphine option arm (AMD, -61.0 mg/d; 95% CI, -74.1 to -47.9) and from 165 (88) mg/d to 107 (89) mg/d (AMD, -58.5 mg/d; 95% CI, -71.6 to -45.4) in the no option arm (between-group AMD, -2.5 mg/d; 95% CI, -21.1 to 16.0).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this trial, outcomes did not differ between groups; both had small improvements in pain and substantial reductions in opioid dosage, but the proportion of participants who switched to buprenorphine was low.

### Effectiveness of injectable extended-release naltrexone vs daily buprenorphine-naloxone for opioid dependence: a randomized clinical noninferiority trial [^70a9ce13]. JAMA Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

To date, extended-release naltrexone hydrochloride has not previously been compared directly with opioid medication treatment (OMT), currently the most commonly prescribed treatment for opioid dependence.

Objective

To determine whether treatment with extended-release naltrexone will be as effective as daily buprenorphine hydrochloride with naloxone hydrochloride in maintaining abstinence from heroin and other illicit substances in newly detoxified individuals.

Design, Setting and Participants

A 12-week, multicenter, outpatient, open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted at 5 urban addiction clinics in Norway between November 1, 2012, and December 23, 2015; the last follow-up was performed on October 23, 2015. A total of 232 adult opioid-dependent (per DSM-IV criteria) individuals were recruited from outpatient addiction clinics and detoxification units and assessed for eligibility. Intention-to-treat analyses of efficacy end points were performed with all randomized participants.

Interventions

Randomization to either daily oral flexible dose buprenorphine-naloxone, 4 to 24 mg/d, or extended-release naltrexone hydrochloride, 380 mg, administered intramuscularly every fourth week for 12 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary end points (protocol) were the randomized clinical trial completion rate, the proportion of opioid-negative urine drug tests, and number of days of use of heroin and other illicit opioids. Secondary end points included number of days of use of other illicit substances. Safety was assessed by adverse event reporting.

Results

Of 159 participants, mean (SD) age was 36 (8.6) years and 44 (27.7%) were women. Eighty individuals were randomized to extended-release naltrexone and 79 to buprenorphine-naloxone; 105 (66.0%) completed the trial. Retention in the extended-release naltrexone group was noninferior to the buprenorphine-naloxone group (difference, -0.1; with 95% CI, -0.2 to 0.1; P = 0.04), with mean (SD) time of 69.3 (25.9) and 63.7 (29.9) days, correspondingly (P = 0.33, log-rank test). Treatment with extended-release naltrexone showed noninferiority to buprenorphine-naloxone on group proportion of total number of opioid-negative urine drug tests (mean [SD], 0.9 [0.3] and 0.8 [0.4], respectively, difference, 0.1 with 95% CI, -0.04 to 0.2; P < .001) and use of heroin (mean difference, -3.2 with 95% CI, -4.9 to -1.5; P < .001) and other illicit opioids (mean difference, -2.7 with 95% CI, -4.6 to -0.9; P < .001). Superiority analysis showed significantly lower use of heroin and other illicit opioids in the extended-release naltrexone group. No significant differences were found between the treatment groups regarding most other illicit substance use.

Conclusions and Relevance

Extended-release naltrexone was as effective as buprenorphine-naloxone in maintaining short-term abstinence from heroin and other illicit substances and should be considered as a treatment option for opioid-dependent individuals.

### State-to-state variation in opioid dispensing changes following the release of the 2016 CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain [^b8461391]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Data and Outcomes

We analyzed monthly opioid dispensing data from the Xponent database (IQVIA)for all 50 states and the District of Columbia (expressed as 51 states hereafter) between 2012 and 2018. This study uses no human participant data and is exempt from institutional review board review and informed consent requirements per the Common Rule; we followed Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

The Xponent administrative database provides weighted projections of outpatient opioid prescriptions from approximately 58 900 US retail pharmacies that dispense approximately 92% of US retail prescriptions. These data have been used in several previous studies of opioid prescribing trajectories. Due to changes in how the number of prescriptions filled are counted after 2018, this analysis only focused on trends up to 2018. All calculations excluded buprenorphine products intended to treat opioid use disorder. Additionally, the only buprenorphine products left in the data set (Butrans and Belbuca) were also excluded from the analysis of mean MME per capita due to the lack of a well-validated MME conversion factor for those medications. A table with all drugs in the data set that met inclusion criteria, and whether or not the drug is long-acting, is given in eTable 1 in Supplement 1.

We used annual US Census state-level population estimates available through the American Community Surveyto compute per capita prescribing measures. Using those data sources, for each month we computed 4 state-level opioid prescribing outcomes. The first was overall opioid dispensing rate, which is the total number of opioid prescriptions dispensed per 100 000 persons. The second was high-dosage dispensing rate, which is the total number of high-dosage opioid prescriptions dispensed (each 90 MME/d or higher) per 100 000 persons. Third, long-acting (eg, methadone) dispensing rate, which is the total number of long-acting opioid prescriptions dispensed per 100 000 persons. And the fourth was mean MME per capita, calculated by dividing the total MME dispensed by the size of the population. MME was calculated as the product of quantity, strength per unit, and MME conversion factor, summed across each month in each state. As shorthand, we refer to the first 3 outcomes as prescriptions per 100 000 persons throughout the study.

### Understanding buprenorphine for use in chronic pain: expert opinion [^5a00a151]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

When used as directed, buprenorphine appears to have a relatively favorable therapeutic index (safety profile) and a slower onset of tolerance than full µ -opioid receptor agonists on the basis of its pharmacological profile; however, patient expectations regarding nausea, which is commonly observed during titration with buprenorphine products in opioid-naïve patients, should be clearly set.

Buprenorphine appears to have a ceiling effect on respiratory depression, and the Pain Management Best Practices Inter-Agency Task Force recently noted that buprenorphine is expected to have reduced risk for respiratory depression and may be better tolerated than full µ -opioid receptor agonists according to currently available data. As a caveat, respiratory depression is still a concern, especially when buprenorphine is used in combination with nonopioid sedatives/anticonvulsants such as benzodiazepines and gabapentin, carisoprodol and other muscle relaxants, amitriptyline, and Z-drugs (nonbenzodiazepine drugs with effects similar to those of benzodiazepines). Although buprenorphine is generally well tolerated, any relevant contraindications and other safety concerns should be considered when prescribing the medication for chronic pain. Combining opioids with other central nervous system suppressants is generally not recommended but may be considered after conducting a thoughtful risk/benefit analysis.

On the basis of the information above, buprenorphine may also be more suitable than Schedule II opioids in certain patient populations. Patients with chronic pain who may benefit from buprenorphine include those with an increased risk of life-threatening opioid-related adverse events (e.g. high body mass index/obstructive sleep apnea, comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, pulmonary disease, concomitant use of drugs known to increase risk [benzodiazepines, gabapentin, pregabalin, muscle relaxants, alcohol], taking a high morphine milligram equivalent [MME]). In addition, those with chronic pain and an increased risk of life-threatening opioid-related aberrant behavior (e.g. indications of OUD or substance use disorder, heightened risk of overdose, elevated Opioid Risk Tool [ORT] or other screening tool score) may benefit from buprenorphine.

Consensus Recommendation

In patients with chronic pain who have been determined via risk/benefit analysis to benefit from opioid treatment, consider prescribing buprenorphine before Schedule II opioids and perhaps before some Schedule IV opioids, such as tramadol, on the basis of the patient's underlying conditions.

### Buprenorphine: considerations for pain management [^c113868d]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2005). Low credibility.

New effective analgesics are needed for the treatment of pain. Buprenorphine, a partial mu-opioid agonist which has been in clinical use for over 25 years, has been found to be amenable to new formulation technology based on its physiochemical and pharmacological profile. Buprenorphine is marketed as parenteral, sublingual, and transdermal formulations. Unlike full mu-opioid agonists, at higher doses, buprenorphine's physiological and subjective effects, including euphoria, reach a plateau. This ceiling may limit the abuse potential and may result in a wider safety margin. Buprenorphine has been used for the treatment of acute and chronic pain, as a supplement to anesthesia, and for behavioral and psychiatric disorders including treatment for opioid addiction. Prolonged use of buprenorphine can result in physical dependence. However, withdrawal symptoms appear to be mild to moderate in intensity compared with those of full mu agonists. Overdoses have primarily involved buprenorphine taken in combination with other central nervous system depressants.

### Transdermal buprenorphine for acute pain in the clinical setting: a narrative review [^144f7853]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Many surgical procedures, such as hip or knee arthroplasty, involve moderate to severe pain over the course of several days following surgery. Such pain can delay ambulation and impede effective rehabilitation strategies. The role of a transdermal opioid patch in this setting may be appropriate as it provides effective analgesic, allows for good compliance, and offers certain advantages over other opioid analgesics, such as a ceiling effect for respiratory depression and less "likeability" as a drug of abuse. Although transdermal buprenorphine is a long-acting opioid, it may be appropriate for acute pain of several days' duration. However, for acute pain or postsurgical pain likely to be of short duration, such as dental pain, it is not useful, because the patch lasts for seven days and has a slow onset of action.

Postsurgical pain control is an important aspect of clinical care and postsurgical pain is often undertreated. Inadequately treated postsurgical pain not only causes unnecessary suffering, it can delay ambulation, interfere with rehabilitation efforts, extend hospital stays, increase costs, decrease patient satisfaction, lead to complications, and has the potential to deteriorate into chronic pain syndromes, which are very challenging to manage effectively. In fact, chronic pain can be life altering for the patients and is associated with disability, depression, social isolation, and disruption in work, home, and family life.

It appears that a major obstacle toward wider acceptance or at least consideration of transdermal buprenorphine as an analgesic agent for acute pain is the fact that buprenorphine is one of the two main agents used in opioid rehabilitation. As such, healthcare professionals may have "typecast" buprenorphine as solely an agent for opioid rehabilitation requiring specific prescribing credentials may be required (special training, X-waiver). Transdermal buprenorphine has been approved for use in treating chronic pain (Butrans ®, Purdue Pharma, LP, Stamford, Connecticut, United States of America). A parenteral form of buprenorphine has also been approved for use in chronic pain patients (Buprenex ®, Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare UK, Ltd, Hull, England). The transdermal buprenorphine product is not indicated for use in opioid rehabilitation. The variety of opioid products and formulations are summarized in Table 2.
