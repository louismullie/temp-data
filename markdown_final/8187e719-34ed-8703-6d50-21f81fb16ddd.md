## Question

How to treat asymptomatic hypotension 2/2 hypovolemia in PEG patient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat asymptomatic hypotension due to hypovolemia in a patient with a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and assessing severity. Then, I should verify the hemodynamic thresholds that change management. Next, I will consider fluid strategy and electrolyte monitoring. After that, I need to check how PEG feeding interacts with hypotension. Finally, I will outline monitoring, escalation triggers, and special considerations like antithrombotics and buried bumper syndrome, and close with a concise plan summary.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity. Asymptomatic hypotension due to hypovolemia implies low blood pressure without dizziness, syncope, or organ dysfunction, but I should double-check for subtle orthostatic symptoms and quantify the deficit using vitals, urine output, and labs such as BUN, creatinine, and electrolytes, because even mild hypovolemia can worsen outcomes in frail or comorbid patients [^acdc0d5e] [^50fb5c9d].

> Wait, let me verify the hemodynamic thresholds that change management. In general, a mean arterial pressure (MAP) below about 60 mmHg warrants active correction of hypovolemia, whereas MAP above 60 mmHg in an asymptomatic patient may allow cautious observation with oral rehydration if reliable, but I should confirm that this aligns with critical care guidance on maintaining perfusion while avoiding overload [^53f326db] [^636adfea].

> I will now examine the fluid strategy. For mild hypovolemia without symptoms, oral rehydration with sodium-containing fluids is reasonable if the patient can safely take fluids by mouth or via PEG, but I need to ensure we do not delay IV therapy if there is any doubt about absorption or if the patient is frail or has comorbidities. For moderate deficits or when oral intake is uncertain, isotonic crystalloids such as normal saline or balanced solutions are first-line, with typical boluses of 500–1000 mL in adults, reassessing after each bolus for blood pressure, heart rate, urine output, and signs of fluid responsiveness. I should confirm that balanced crystalloids are preferred over chloride-rich saline when feasible to reduce the risk of hyperchloremic acidosis, especially in patients with renal or hepatic disease [^acdc0d5e] [^9eca965c] [^a2858dc3].

> Hold on, I should verify electrolyte monitoring and correction. Hypovolemia often coexists with electrolyte disturbances, so I need to check sodium, potassium, and renal function at baseline and after rehydration, correcting abnormalities promptly because electrolyte shifts can precipitate arrhythmias or neurologic complications. This is especially important in patients with PEG tubes, where enteral losses or medication interactions can alter electrolytes [^d53c6ef5] [^682294ec].

> Next, I should review how PEG feeding interacts with hypotension. Initially, I thought enteral nutrition should be held whenever blood pressure is low, but wait, let me verify the latest guidance. Current recommendations support early initiation of tube feeds within about 4 hours after PEG placement in stable patients, and they do not mandate holding feeds solely for mild asymptomatic hypotension. However, if the patient is hemodynamically unstable, on escalating vasopressors, or has severe ileus or bowel ischemia, enteral nutrition should be withheld until stability improves, so I need to individualize this decision and monitor closely for feeding intolerance that could signal gut ischemia [^892d23fb] [^112cc4be] [^636adfea].

> I need to ensure I address postprandial hypotension, which is common in older adults and can be accentuated with enteral feeding. Strategies include smaller, more frequent feeds, ensuring adequate salt and fluid intake, and considering head-up positioning during and after feeds. If symptomatic drops occur, I should confirm the diagnosis with serial blood pressure measurements around feeding times and adjust the feeding regimen accordingly [^dd5fb06b].

> Let me consider special complications that can mimic or worsen hypotension in PEG patients. Buried bumper syndrome can cause obstruction, pain, and sepsis with hypotension. If suspected, I should confirm with imaging and manage with endoscopic or surgical intervention, antibiotics, and supportive care. Similarly, post-PEG bleeding can cause hypovolemia. If bleeding is present, I should follow hemostasis protocols and transfuse as indicated while correcting volume status [^1c555512] [^4385a6ff].

> I should double-check antithrombotic management because it affects bleeding risk and may influence fluid decisions. Recent ASGE guidance suggests against routine withholding of antiplatelet agents for PEG and supports individualized periprocedural anticoagulant management, so I need to balance thrombotic and bleeding risks and coordinate with the procedural and cardiology teams when planning fluids and feeds [^7515ebe9] [^6497e06a].

> Next, I should review monitoring and escalation. Frequent vital signs, strict intake and output, daily weights, and serial electrolytes and renal function are essential. If MAP remains below 60 mmHg despite appropriate crystalloid resuscitation, or if the patient becomes symptomatic, I should escalate to vasopressor support and reassess for ongoing losses or occult bleeding, recognizing that early enteral nutrition can proceed cautiously in patients on stable low-dose vasopressors with close monitoring for intolerance [^da54888e] [^636adfea].

> But wait, what if the patient has autonomic failure or chronic orthostatic hypotension. In that case, nonpharmacologic measures such as increased salt and water intake, compression garments, and medication review are foundational, and I should avoid over-resuscitation that could precipitate fluid overload in susceptible patients, tailoring fluids to symptomatic improvement rather than a rigid blood pressure target [^427e2737] [^6da6a20a].

> Let me synthesize a practical plan. For asymptomatic hypotension due to hypovolemia in a PEG patient with MAP above 60 mmHg, I would start with oral rehydration if reliable, otherwise give isotonic crystalloid boluses of 500–1000 mL with reassessment after each bolus, correct electrolytes as needed, and continue or initiate enteral nutrition if the patient is otherwise stable and there are no contraindications. If MAP is below 60 mmHg or the patient becomes symptomatic, I would prioritize IV crystalloid resuscitation, hold enteral feeds temporarily if instability is present, and escalate to vasopressors if hypotension persists despite adequate volume, with continuous monitoring and reassessment of volume status and feeding tolerance [^acdc0d5e] [^892d23fb] [^da54888e].

---

Treat asymptomatic hypotension from hypovolemia in a PEG patient by **correcting volume status first** with isotonic crystalloids (normal saline or Lactated Ringer's) [^acdc0d5e] using 500–1000 mL boluses, reassessing vitals and urine output after each bolus [^acdc0d5e]. If oral intake is feasible, **encourage oral rehydration with electrolytes**; if not, continue IV fluids. Monitor for refeeding risk if nutrition is initiated after prolonged poor intake, and start feeds cautiously with close monitoring [^1d31ac3b]. Hold or reduce enteral feeds only if hypotension worsens or feeding intolerance develops, and escalate care if MAP remains < 60 mmHg or symptoms emerge [^da54888e].

---

## Clinical assessment and monitoring

- **Vital signs**: Monitor BP, HR, RR, and SpO2 frequently during resuscitation.
- **Urine output**: Aim for ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/hr as a marker of adequate perfusion.
- **Laboratory tests**: Check electrolytes, renal function, and acid-base status to guide correction and detect refeeding risk [^d53c6ef5].

---

## Fluid resuscitation strategy

### Intravenous fluids

- **First-line therapy**: Isotonic crystalloids (normal saline or Lactated Ringer's) are preferred [^acdc0d5e].
- **Bolus dosing**: 500–1000 mL boluses, reassessing vitals and urine output after each bolus.
- **Goal**: Restore intravascular volume and improve MAP to ≥ 60 mmHg while avoiding fluid overload [^636adfea].

---

### Oral rehydration

If the patient is alert and can safely take fluids, **oral rehydration with electrolyte-containing solutions** is reasonable; otherwise, continue IV therapy.

---

## Enteral nutrition considerations

- **Early enteral nutrition**: Generally safe to initiate within 4 hours post-PEG if stable, but monitor closely for intolerance [^892d23fb].
- **Hold feeds**: Only if hypotension worsens or feeding intolerance (e.g. vomiting, distension) develops [^da54888e].
- **Refeeding risk**: If nutrition is initiated after prolonged poor intake, monitor for refeeding syndrome and correct electrolytes before feeding [^1d31ac3b].

---

## Medication review and adjustment

Review and adjust **medications** that may exacerbate hypotension (e.g. diuretics, ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers) as appropriate [^427e2737].

---

## Indications for escalation of care

Escalate care if any of the following occur:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| MAP remains < 60 mmHg despite adequate fluid resuscitation | - Vasopressor support <br/> - ICU transfer [^da54888e] |
| Signs of organ dysfunction (e.g. oliguria, altered mental status) | - ICU transfer <br/> - Advanced hemodynamic monitoring [^acdc0d5e] |
| Suspected ongoing bleeding or sepsis | - Source control <br/> - Blood products <br/> - Antibiotics [^ffdd5446] |

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Confirm diagnosis**: Rule out other causes of hypotension (e.g. bleeding, sepsis, cardiac dysfunction) [^6e270d6c].
- **Fluid resuscitation**: Use isotonic crystalloids with reassessment after each bolus [^acdc0d5e].
- **Enteral nutrition**: Initiate cautiously if stable; hold only if intolerance or worsening hypotension [^892d23fb].
- **Monitor closely**: Vitals, urine output, electrolytes, and signs of refeeding syndrome [^1d31ac3b].
- **Escalate care**: If MAP remains < 60 mmHg or organ dysfunction develops [^da54888e].

---

Asymptomatic hypotension from hypovolemia in a PEG patient should be managed with **careful fluid resuscitation**, cautious enteral feeding, and close monitoring, escalating care only if instability persists or complications arise.

### Vasovagal syncope and related disorders… [^6233a8c4]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

The management of patients in whom a primary abnormality in blood pressure regulation results in hypotension and loss of consciousness presents clinical challenges. The hypotension may be primary, or it may be secondary to a condition such as tachyarrhythmia or bradyarrhythmia. Vasovagal syncope describes this condition, as well as other conditions that are considered to be dysautonomic responses to upright posture, such as orthostatic hypotension and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. In patients with vasovagal syncope, the initial cardiovascular response to an upright posture appears to be relatively normal. Syncope occurs after an abrupt decrease in blood pressure, sometimes accompanied by a marked decrease in heart rate after a delayed period of head-up tilt, which triggers blood pooling in the lower extremities. The mean time to syncope in patients undergoing a tilt-table test is 25 minutes.

The dysautonomic response occurs in the presence of a failing autonomic system. Patients with this condition are unable to compensate for the acute decrease in venous return that occurs with upright position, causing orthostatic hypotension. This failure to compensate can occur immediately or be delayed because of blood pooling in the lower extremities. The difference in mechanisms causing vasovagal syncope and the dysautonomic response result in different treatment considerations. For an algorithm detailing diagnosis and treatment of vasovagal syncope and related disorders. The initial approach to treatment involves education about ways to avoid syncopal episodes. Adjusting potentiating medications, including peripherally active alpha antagonists and nitrates, can be useful in preventing recurrences when clinically possible. An assessment of volume status and an increase in dietary salt may also reduce syncopal episodes.

Empiric therapy with beta blockers or fludrocortisone can be initiated without a tilt-table test in patients with vasovagal syncope, and therapy with fludrocortisone or midodrine is indicated in patients with suspected orthostatic intolerance. Education, reassurance and an increase in dietary salt may be sufficient treatment in many patients. POTS can be treated empirically with beta blockers, salt and fludrocortisone. Orthostatic hypotension can be treated with volume expansion therapy with salt and fludrocortisone and vasoconstrictor therapy with midodrine. Evidence of a dysautonomic response, in which the patient's blood pressure decreases without a significant increase in heart rate, suggests autonomic failure and is treated with fludrocortisone or midodrine.

5.1 Serious Fluid and Serum Chemistry Abnormalities

Advise patients to hydrate adequately before, during, and after the use of PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution. Use caution in patients with congestive heart failure when replacing fluids. If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration including signs of orthostatic hypotension after taking PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution, consider performing post-colonoscopy lab tests (electrolytes, creatinine, and BUN) and treat accordingly. Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution. Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse events including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures and renal impairment. Fluid and electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected before treatment with PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution.

In addition, use caution when prescribing PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution for patients who have conditions, or who are using medications, that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure, arrhythmias, and renal impairment [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]

5.2 Cardiac Arrhythmias

There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation. Use caution when prescribing PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., patients with a history of prolonged QT, uncontrolled arrhythmias, recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or cardiomyopathy). Consider pre-dose and post-colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias.

5.3 Seizures

There have been reports of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and/or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures. The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia) and low serum osmolality. The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities.

Use caution when prescribing PEG-3350 and electrolytes for oral solution for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure, such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants), patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines, or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^45865882]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Parenteral nutrition in hemodynamic and metabolic instability — early phase management: Hemodynamic and metabolic instability is common in the severely ill patient, and during the first 24–48 hours after a significant insult patients enter the "ebb" phase with hypovolemia, shock, and tissue hypoxia, characterized by reduced tissue perfusion, reduced oxygen consumption, and a lower metabolic rate. Severe electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected prior to starting PN, adjustments to the initial PN formulation and a more conservative advancement may help prevent complications, and vigilant laboratory monitoring with prompt intervention will minimize risk.

### Postprandial hypotension in long-term care elderly patients on enteral feeding [^37e0e0d8]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine the prevalence and nature of postprandial hypotension (PPH) in orally fed (OF), nasogastric tube (NGT)-fed, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)-fed older people.

Design

Prospective comparative study.

Setting

Nursing and skilled nursing wards of three geriatrics hospitals.

Participants

Three groups (OF, PEG, NGT) of long-term care patients (50 in each cohort) were enrolled.

Measurements

Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate measurements were obtained just before lunch and at 15-minute intervals for 90 minutes after the completion of the meal. The meals were similar in caloric content and composition.

Results

PPH was evidenced in 64 (43%) patients. No significant intergroup (OF, PEG, NGT) differences were present. In 68% of PPH patients, the systolic BP (SBP) drop appeared within 30 minutes, and 70% reached their systolic nadir at 60 minutes. In 31%, the SBP drop was registered on only one measurement, whereas in 25%, the drop was detected on five to six measurements. All parameters were without notable intergroup differences.

Conclusion

In enterally fed elderly patients (NGT or PEG), the rate and pattern of PPH are similar and not significantly different from that observed in OF patients.

### Guidelines for the provision and assessment of nutrition support therapy in the adult critically ill patient: Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) [^da54888e]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2016). Medium credibility.

Enteral nutrition (EN) during hemodynamic instability — recommendation and cautions: Based on expert consensus, we suggest that in the setting of hemodynamic compromise or instability, EN should be withheld until the patient is fully resuscitated and/ or stable. Initiation/reinitiation of EN may be considered with caution in patients undergoing withdrawal of vasopressor support. While EN may be provided with caution to patients on chronic, stable low doses of vasopressors, EN should be withheld in patients who are hypotensive (mean arterial blood pressure < 50 mm Hg), in patients for whom catecholamine agents (eg, norepinephrine, phenylephrine, epinephrine, dopamine) are being initiated, or in patients for whom escalating doses are required to maintain hemodynamic stability. For patients on vasopressor therapy receiving EN, any signs of intolerance should be closely scrutinized as possible early signs of gut ischemia, and EN should be held until symptoms and interventions stabilize. In a retrospective review of patients requiring stable low doses of vasopressors, early EN was associated with lower ICU mortality (22.5% vs 28.3%; P = 0.03) and hospital mortality (34% vs 44%; P < .001), with a greater benefit in those treated with multiple vasopressors (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.15–0.85).

Case presentation

Case 1

A 76-year-old male with a medical history including atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and congestive heart failure, was admitted to our hospital for intravenous antibiotics to treat a resistant urinary tract infection. The patient was on Apixaban.

Due to poor oral intake, Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG) placement was deemed necessary. Post-procedure, significant bleeding occurred from the stomach wall through the PEG orifice over the first day leading to hypotension and blood transfusion. Promptly, 2500 IU of thrombin were administered, resulting in immediate cessation of bleeding. The patient, who remains on DOAC, has shown no signs of rebleeding in the six months following the intervention.

Case 2

A 38-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital for further management of recurrent cardiovascular accidents that resulted in dense left-side hemiplegia and weakness on the right side associated with dysphagia. The patient has a medical history that includes diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, with a significant history of heavy smoking and nicotine abuse. He is on clopidogrel, aspirin, and low molecular-weight heparin.

At our facility, he underwent gastrostomy which was complicated with site bleeding, leading to symptoms of melena and hematemesis resulting in hypovolemic shock and ICU admission. He had persistent GI bleeding for 2 days. An abdominal CT scan with contrast showed no active intraabdominal bleeding. Following the failed conservative management, a therapeutic intervention involved the administration of 2500 IU of thrombin at the parastomal region under US guidance which directly resolved the bleeding. The patient was also initiated on heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis and subsequently discharged with aspirin. Upon follow-up at 6 months, there were no reports of rebleeding or systematic complications.

Case 3

A 100-year-old lady visited the hospital complaining of poor oral intake persistent for 10 days. She has multiple comorbidities including dementia, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, hyperkalemia, and limited mobility. Accordingly, she was on Apixaban.

On examination, the patient was severely dehydrated.

The poor intake was attributed to the presence of oral ulcers and dental pain. It was decided to perform a gastrostomy procedure. To minimize the risk of post-procedure bleeding, 2500 IU of thrombin was injected at the gastrostomy insertion site under US guidance.

During a 3-month follow-up, there were no signs of bleeding although the patient is on continuous anticoagulation therapy.

ASGE guideline — early tube feed initiation after PEG includes practice recommendations and caveats. The panel made a strong recommendation for early initiation of tube feed after PEG tube placement with overall low to moderate quality evidence. The panel agreed that routine gastric residual measurement should not be performed. The panel noted a misconception that delaying feeds allows the stoma to heal and stated the stoma site takes at least several weeks to heal. It emphasized that early initiation may not be clinically appropriate in some situations (patients on vasopressors, with severe ileus or obstruction, or with bowel ischemia) and that early initiation may not always be feasible due to logistics. The panel also noted that medications may be given immediately via the PEG after placement unless there are contraindications to enteral medications.

### Science and fiction in critical care: established concepts with or without evidence? [^a2858dc3]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

In the absence of evidence, therapies are often based on intuition, belief, common sense or gut feeling. Over the years, some treatment strategies may become dogmas that are eventually considered as state-of-the-art and not questioned any longer. This might be a reason why there are many examples of "strange" treatments in medical history that have been applied in the absence of evidence and later abandoned for good reasons.

In this article, five dogmas relevant to critical care medicine are discussed and reviewed in the light of the available evidence. Dogma #1 relates to the treatment of oliguria with fluids, diuretics, and vasopressors. In this context, it should be considered that oliguria is a symptom rather than a disease. Thus, once hypovolaemia can be excluded as the underlying reason, there is no justification for giving fluids, which may do more harm than good in euvolaemic or hypervolaemic patients. Similarly, there is no solid evidence for forcing diuresis by administering vasopressors and loop diuretics. Dogma #2 addresses the treatment of crush syndrome patients with aggressive fluid therapy using NaCl 0.9%. In fact, this treatment may aggravate renal injury by iatrogenic metabolic acidosis and subsequent renal hypoperfusion. Dogma #3 concerns the administration of NaCl 0.9% to patients undergoing kidney transplantation. Since these patients are usually characterised by hyperkalaemia, the potassium-free solution NaCl 0.9%, containing exclusively 154 mmol/l of sodium and chloride ions each, is often considered as the fluid of choice. However, large volumes of chloride-rich solutions cause hyperchloraemic acidosis in a dose-dependent manner and induce a potassium shift to the extracellular space, thereby increasing serum potassium levels. Thus, balanced electrolyte solutions are to be preferred in this setting. Dogma #4 relates to the fact that enteral nutrition is often withheld for patients with high residual gastric volume due to the theoretical risk of gastro-oesophageal reflux, potentially resulting in aspiration pneumonitis. Despite controversial discussions, there is no clinical data supporting that residual gastric volume should be generally measured, especially not in patients without a gastro-intestinal surgery and/or motility disorders. Clinical evidence rather suggests that abandoning residual gastric volume monitoring does not increase the incidence of pneumonia, but may benefit patients by facilitating adequate enteral feeding. Finally, dogma #5 is about sedating all mechanically ventilated patients because "fighting" against the respirator may cause insufficient ventilation. This concern needs to be balanced against the unwanted consequences of sedation, such as prolonged mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit length of stay as well as increased risk of delirium. Modern concepts based on adequate analgesia and moderate to no sedation appear to be more suitable.

In conclusion, dogmas are still common in clinical practice. Since science rather than fiction should govern our actions in intensive care medicine, it is important to remain critical and challenge long established concepts, especially when the underlying evidence is weak or non-existing.

### When is enteral nutrition indicated? [^636adfea]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Hemodynamically unstable adults receiving vasopressors — vasopressor administration is not a contraindication to providing early EN with careful monitoring; when administering EN concomitantly with vasopressor administration, consider the type of vasopressor agent, vasopressor equivalent dosage, timing of EN, and feeding location; consider trophic only or holding EN if vasopressor dose equivalent (VDE) score is > 12; gastric feeding is preferred during vasopressor administration; insufficient data exist to use lactate levels as a monitoring parameter for EN tolerance; routine monitoring of gastric residual volumes (GRVs) is not recommended in critical illness, and if GRVs are measured, it would be reasonable to hold EN in adults if GRVs > 300 mL based on limited, low-quality evidence; EN may be administered in adults if the mean arterial pressure (MAP) is ≥ 60 mm Hg but should be held when the MAP < 50 mm Hg.

### Ramipril [^5ca2dd65]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Hypotension

General Considerations

Ramipril can cause symptomatic hypotension, after either the initial dose or a later dose when the dosage has been increased. Like other ACE inhibitors, ramipril, has been only rarely associated with hypotension in uncomplicated hypertensive patients. Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume- and/or salt-depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, or vomiting. Correct volume- and salt-depletion before initiating therapy with ramipril.

If excessive hypotension occurs, place the patient in a supine position and, if necessary, treat with intravenous infusion of physiological saline. Ramipril treatment usually can be continued following restoration of blood pressure and volume.

Heart Failure Post-Myocardial Infarction

In patients with heart failure post-myocardial infarction who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally can occur following the initial dose of ramipril. If the initial dose of 2.5 mg ramipril cannot be tolerated, use an initial dose of 1.25 mg ramipril to avoid excessive hypotension. Consider reducing the dose of concomitant diuretic to decrease the incidence of hypotension.

Congestive Heart Failure

In patients with congestive heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, ACE inhibitor therapy may cause excessive hypotension, which may be associated with oliguria or azotemia and rarely, with acute renal failure and death. In such patients, initiate ramipril therapy under close medical supervision and follow patients closely for the first 2 weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of ramipril or diuretic is increased.

Surgery and Anesthesia

In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, ramipril may block angiotensin II formation that would otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release. Hypotension that occurs as a result of this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion.

5.6 Fetal Toxicity

Pregnancy Category D

Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue ramipril as soon as possible [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)].

### Highlights of prescribing information… [^a8439e5d]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

ALBUTEIN- albumin injection, solution GRIFOLS USA, LLC ----------. The colloid-osmotic effect of human albumin 25% is approximately five times that of blood plasma. Therefore, when concentrated albumin is administered, care must be taken to assure adequate hydration of the patient. Patients should be monitored carefully to guard against circulatory overload and hyperhydration. Patients with marked dehydration require administration of additional fluids. 20% – 25% human albumin solutions are relatively low in electrolytes compared to 4% – 5% human albumin solutions. Monitor regularly the electrolyte status of the patient and take appropriate steps to restore or maintain the electrolyte balance when albumin is administered. Regular monitoring of coagulation and hematology parameters is necessary if comparatively large volumes are to be replaced.

Care must be taken to ensure adequate substitution of other blood constituents. Monitor regularly hemodynamic parameters during administration of ALBUTEIN 25%; this may include: ALBUTEIN 25% must not be diluted with sterile water for injection as this may cause hemolysis in recipients. The product can be diluted in an isotonic solution. The most serious adverse reactions are anaphylactic shock, heart failure and pulmonary edema The most common adverse reactions are anaphylactoid type reactions. Adverse reactions to ALBUTEIN 25% normally resolve when the infusion rate is slowed or the infusion is stopped. In case of severe reactions, the infusion is stopped and appropriate treatment initiated. to 500 mL of plasma. Sodium range is 130–160 milliequivalents per liter.

### Critical illness (CI) guideline (2012) [^87632cc1]. AND (2012). Medium credibility.

CI: Initiation of enteral nutrition (EN) — if EN is not contraindicated, the Registered Dietitian (RD) should recommend starting EN within 24 to 48 hours following injury or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) (early EN); research indicates that early initiation of EN (EEN) is associated with a reduction in infectious complications in critically ill adult patients, while the impact on mortality and length of stay (LOS) is unclear. This recommendation is rated Strong and labeled Conditional. EN should be withheld in hypotensive patients with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of < 60 mmHg and/or those receiving escalating doses of pharmacologic agents to maintain hemodynamic stability. Examples of contraindications include hemodynamic instability, bowel obstruction, high output fistula, or severe ileus, benefits of early initiation of EN (EEN) may be lost if there is a delay, and no obvious costs are associated with the application of this recommendation.

### Fentanyl transdermal system [^051c9ad0]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Clinical Presentation

The manifestations of fentanyl overdosage are an extension of its pharmacologic actions with the most serious significant effect being hypoventilation.

Treatment

For the management of hypoventilation, immediate countermeasures include removing the fentanyl transdermal system and physically or verbally stimulating the patient. These actions can be followed by administration of a specific narcotic antagonist such as naloxone. The duration of hypoventilation following an overdose may be longer than the effects of the narcotic antagonist's action (the half-life of naloxone ranges from 30 to 81 minutes). The interval between IV antagonist doses should be carefully chosen because of the possibility of re-narcotization after system removal; repeated administration of naloxone may be necessary. Reversal of the narcotic effect may result in acute onset of pain and the release of catecholamines.

Always ensure a patent airway is established and maintained, administer oxygen and assist or control respiration as indicated and use an oropharyngeal airway or endotracheal tube if necessary. Adequate body temperature and fluid intake should be maintained.

If severe or persistent hypotension occurs, the possibility of hypovolemia should be considered and managed with appropriate parenteral fluid therapy.

Dehydration and drugs — For syncope due to acute dehydration, fluid resuscitation via oral or intravenous bolus is recommended. Reducing or withdrawing medications that may cause hypotension can be beneficial in selected patients with syncope. In selected patients with syncope due to dehydration, it is reasonable to encourage increased salt and fluid intake.

### Nimodipine [^d9402001]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

DO NOT ADMINISTER NIMODIPINE CAPSULES INTRAVENOUSLY OR BY OTHER PARENTERAL ROUTES (see WARNINGS). If nimodipine is inadvertently administered intravenously, clinically significant hypotension may require cardiovascular support with pressor agents. Specific treatments for calcium channel blocker overdose should also be given promptly.

Nimodipine is given orally in the form of soft gelatin 30 mg capsules for subarachnoid hemorrhage.

The recommended oral dose is 60 mg (two 30 mg capsules) every 4 hours for 21 consecutive days. In general, the capsules should be swallowed whole with a little liquid, preferably not less than one hour before or two hours after meals. Grapefruit juice is to be avoided (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Oral nimodipine therapy should commence as soon as possible within 96 hours of the onset of subarachnoid hemorrhage.

If the capsule cannot be swallowed, e.g., at the time of surgery, or if the patient is unconscious, a hole should be made in both ends of the capsule with an 18 gauge needle, and the contents of the capsule extracted into a syringe. A parenteral syringe can be used to extract the liquid inside the capsule, but the liquid should always be transferred to a syringe that cannot accept a needle and that is designed for administration orally or via a naso-gastric tube or PEG. To help minimize administration errors, it is recommended that the syringe used for administration be labeled "Not for IV Use". The contents should then be emptied into the patient's in situ naso-gastric tube and washed down the tube with 30 mL of normal saline (0.9%).

Severely disturbed liver function, particularly liver cirrhosis, may result in an increased bioavailability of nimodipine due to a decreased first pass capacity and a reduced metabolic clearance. The reduction in blood pressure and other adverse effects may be more pronounced in these patients. Dosage should be reduced to one 30 mg capsule every 4 hours with close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate; if necessary, discontinuation of the treatment should be considered.

Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 should not be administered concomitantly with nimodipine (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Strong inducers of CYP3A4 should generally not be administered with nimodipine (see WARNINGS). Patients on moderate and weak inducers of CYP3A4 should be closely monitored for lack of effectiveness, and a nimodipine dose increase may be required. Patients on moderate and weak CYP3A4 inhibitors may require a nimodipine dose reduction in case of hypotension (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Aims and scope

The aim of this ASGE guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations on the management of feeding tubes placed through a gastrostomy in patients requiring enteral access. This article, subtitled "Methodology and review of evidence", provides a detailed account of the evidence synthesis process that ultimately led to our recommendations, summarized in the article subtitled "Summary and recommendations".

This guideline addressed the following clinical PICO questions using the GRADE format.
(1) In patients with normal foregut anatomy needing initial enteral access, is PEG or interventional radiology–guided percutaneous gastrostomy (IR-G) the preferred modality of choice?
(2) In patients undergoing PEG, should antiplatelets or anticoagulants be held before the procedure to prevent continuing bleeding or other adverse events?
(3) In patients who undergo PEG placement, should tube feeds be initiated early or be intentionally delayed?
(4) In patients with malignant dysphagia requiring gastrostomy placement, is transoral "Pull" PEG or transcutaneous "Direct" gastrostomy the preferred modality to reduce the risk of implantation metastasis?

### Diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium (gastrografin) [^85e237af]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Dehydration: Administration of hypertonic
Gastrografin solutions may lead to hypovolemia and hypotension due
to fluid loss from the intestine. A 1 in 4.6 (1:4.6) dilution of Gastrografin
yields an approximately isotonic 16.5 percent diatrizoate salts solution;
less dilute solutions are hypertonic and may lead to intraluminal
movement of fluid with resulting hypovolemia. In young or debilitated
children and in elderly cachectic persons, the loss of plasma fluid
may be sufficient to cause a shock-like state. If Gastrografin is
used in infants and children (under 10 kg) or in dehydrated or debilitated
patients, the solution must be prepared using the specific dilutions
described in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION. In
debilitated patients and in patients with electrolyte imbalances,
postprocedural monitoring of hydration, serum osmolarity, electrolytes
and clinical status is essential. In pediatric or severely debilitated
patients, the maintenance of an open intravenous fluid line for rehydration
may be advisable should hypotension or shock supervene. Electrolyte
disturbances must be corrected prior to the administration of any
hypertonic Gastrografin solutions.

Aspiration: Aspiration of Gastrografin into the trachea and airways
may result in serious pulmonary complications including, pulmonary
edema, pneumonitis or death Bronchial entry of any orally administered
contrast medium causes a copious osmotic effusion. Therefore, avoid
use of Gastrografin in patients with esophagotracheal fistula and
minimize risks for pulmonary aspiration in all patients. If Gastrografin
is given by nasogastric tube, the position of the tube in the stomach
must be verified before administration.

Anaphylactic reactions: Anaphylactic reactions, including
fatalities, have been reported with the use of Gastrografin. Patients
at increased risk include those with a history of a previous reaction
to a contrast medium, patients with a known sensitivity to iodine,
and patients with a known clinical hypersensitivity (bronchial asthma,
hay fever, and food allergies). Medical personnel trained in the treatment
of anaphylactic reactions and the necessary drugs and medical equipment
should always be readily available when Gastrografin is used.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^6e270d6c]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

What are the confounding factors?

In the setting of postoperative care, a number of confounding factors may impact on accurate haemoglobin measurement. Volume overload and haemodilution after major surgery are potential causes for low haemoglobin levels, despite normal and stable red cell mass. Therefore, the diagnosis of anaemia based on simple haemoglobin concentration may be misleading, and is confounded by plasma volume derangements, resulting in significant overdiagnosis 37. Potential volume overload should be taken into account, and may improve after diuresis.

Similar conditions may be present in the peri‐operative setting where prevention of intravascular volume deficit is a cornerstone of peri‐operative management. Here, intravascular volume and fluid therapy are fundamental whenever fasting is indicated for medical reasons; in the event of high‐fluid turnover rates during major surgery, or in cases of reduced enteral resorption due to sustained vomiting, severe diarrhoea or gastro‐intestinal dysfunction following circulatory shock. The primary aim of intravenous fluid therapy (crystalloid and colloid solutions) is the restoration of plasma and blood volume to ensure appropriate cardiac output and tissue perfusion.

Unfortunately, appropriate assessment of volume status is complex. The diagnosis or quantification of moderate‐to‐severe volume deficit and volume responsiveness remains difficult, and may be attempted using laboratory variables (e.g. lactate, base excess), positional manoeuvres (passive lifting of legs), new monitoring devices (measuring pulse variability and stroke volume indexes or other preload variables) or echocardiography. Recent guidelines highlight the importance of avoiding hypervolaemia 7. During postoperative recovery, redistribution and excretion of fluids may lead to rapid recovery of haemodilution‐induced low haemoglobin concentrations.

### Endoscopic management of enteral tubes in adult patients-part 1: definitions and indications. European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^a729cf9c]. Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

ESGE recommends considering the following indications for enteral tube insertion: (i) clinical conditions that make oral intake impossible (neurological conditions, obstructive causes); (ii) acute and/or chronic diseases that result in a catabolic state where oral intake becomes insufficient; and (iii) chronic small-bowel obstruction requiring a decompression gastrostomy. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence.ESGE recommends the use of temporary feeding tubes placed through a natural orifice (either nostril) in patients expected to require enteral nutrition (EN) for less than 4 weeks. If it is anticipated that EN will be required for more than 4 weeks, percutaneous access should be considered, depending on the clinical setting.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on gastrostomy feeding tubes: summary and recommendations [^4b4f3b31]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guideline on percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding tubes — summary and conclusions specify that in patients needing enteral access, the ASGE suggests PEG as the initial intervention while continuing antiplatelet medications and recommends starting tube feeding within 4 hours of placement. Management of anticoagulant medications should be individualized as part of a shared medical decision-making based on a multidisciplinary discussion regarding the risk of bleeding versus cardiovascular events. In patients with malignant dysphagia, either transoral pull PEG or direct PEG can be performed for initial enteral access.

Case presentation

Case

A 68-year-old Danish male presented with multiple episodes of lightheadedness and the feeling of "passing out" while he was getting into his bed or when food was administered to his gastric fistula tube. And he also had sudden onset of hypertensive attacks several times a day. His past medical history was significant for chronic kidney disease and hypertension since he was 30-years-old. The patient was diagnosed having lingual cancer for which he received external radiation therapy (RT) at 51-year-old. Ten years after RT, the patient started having dysphagia and had several episodes of aspiration pneumonia. Modified barium swallow showed he was having silent aspiration and Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG) was created. Although the patient didn't have any oral intake, he still repeated pneumonia and eventually he underwent tracheotomy. At the same time, his renal function declined and hemodialysis was started three times a week. Since then he has been suffering labile blood pressure. During dialysis, interdialytic weight increase was controlled between 1.5–1.7 kg (2–3% of body weight) and ultrafiltration rate was about 6.0–6.3 ml/hr/kg. The patients' sodium concentration was mostly controlled between 140 to 142 mEq/L and diffusive sodium balance during dialysis was negative. Although this stable weight and sodium control, blood pressure fluctuated through 80 mmHg to 240 mmHg especially during dialysis and was difficult to control with medications (Figure 1). His daily blood pressure had been treated by Ca-channel blocker and ARB but the labile blood pressure could not be stabilized and he had frequent episodes of fainting and several occlusion of his arteriovenous fistula (AVF) caused by extreme hypotension. Everyday, there were several timings when the blood pressure dropped. Most of the time it was after inserting food from the PEG and sometimes after lying in bed (Figure 2). His current medication included Droxidopa and Midodrine Hydrochloride for hypotensive episodes but his labile blood pressure was difficult to control with these medications especially during hemodialyisis.

Cardiopulmonary events

Cardiopulmonary adverse events related to sedation and analgesia account for much as 60% of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy adverse events. These events can be minor (eg, changes in oxygen saturation or heart rate) or major (eg, respiratory arrest and aspiration pneumonia). Risk factors can be divided in patient-related factors (eg, advanced age, polymorbidity, severe systemic disease, head and neck cancer) and procedure-related factors (eg, prolonged procedure, difficulty with intubation if needed). Patients should provide informed consent before administering sedation which include a discussion about benefits, risks, limitations as well as possible alternatives to the sedation plan. As example in patients with significant respiratory compromise, (nasal) unsedated PEG placement could be an alternative. Special attention is required for patients who lack decision-making capacity, such as dementia, acquired brain injury or an intellectual disability. Decisions about PEG placement could have major implications for life expectancy, quality of life and survival and the potential to prolong suffering. Recent guidelines consider patient age, the presence of stroke as an indication and preprocedural nutritional and inflammatory status as risk factors for early and long-term PEG-related mortality. In the entire PEG care pathway, but mainly in recognising the complexities of making decisions about PEG placement, the presence of a Nutritional Support Team can offer an important added value where wider issues can be discussed in detail and depth in an ongoing process. Extensive preprocedural preparation and assessment before sedation and intraprocedural patient monitoring during (propofol) sedation are essential prerequisites:

Prevention

Evaluate risk for sedation and potential problems related to pre-existing medical conditions.
Perform a focused physical examination on elements that could impact sedation (eg, history of stridor, sleep apnoea, former adverse reaction to sedation or anaesthesia, oral or neck abnormalities, tobacco use).
Presence of a sedation team with appropriate education and training with at least one person qualified in advanced life support skills throughout (propofol) sedation.
Provide age-appropriate equipment for airway management and resuscitation.

Management options

Administer supplemental oxygen during sedation.
Monitor oxygenation by pulse oximetry, electrocardiography and intermittent blood pressure measurement.
Visually assess ventilator activity, level of consciousness and discomfort.
Consider the use of capnography which has been demonstrated to detect depressed airway respiratory activity before transient hypoxaemia.
Apply airport support manoeuvres if necessary (eg, chin lifts, jaw thrusts, nasal airways).

### Detection of hypovolemia by non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring during major surgery using ringer ´ s solution, 5% albumin, or 20% albumin as infusion fluid: a post-hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^f1ccd989]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment of hemorrhage-induced hypovolemia:

The adult human body responds to hemorrhage up to 1 L by increasing SVR, which is mainly due to secretion of NE. This reaction maintains MAP while CO decreases as there is less blood to pump. Recruitment of interstitial fluid to the plasma by "capillary refill" is initiated but operates too slowly to compensate for major hemorrhage. Experiments in sheep show that capillary refill is seriously blunted by volatile anesthetics, which is probably due to the inhibitory effects on lymphatic pumping by all anesthetic agents.

Volume treatment by infusing fluid that matches the blood loss restores all physiological responses to hypovolemia provided that irreversible shock has not yet developed. Crystalloids are the standard care for the treatment of more-than-minimal hypovolemia. Support for this practice are from animal studies, volunteer experiments, and trauma studies. In addition, a large body of literature has accumulated over the past decades that evaluates the usefulness of hypertonic or hyper-oncotic solutions to combat hypovolemic states, but these approaches are not currently favored. However, the nature of the optimal fluid solution, amount, and timing of administration are still matter of debate. Target endpoints for fluid resuscitation are also still debated and undefined. A too aggressive fluid replacement could result in hypervolemia and re-bleeding due to dilution of coagulation factors, and necessitate a de-escalation therapy thereafter due to fluid accumulation syndrome.

The rationale behind the use of solutions with oncotic strength is a reduced positive fluid balance, increased CO, and decreased SVR if administered in hypovolemic state. Here, this could be demonstrated only in part as SVR increased during the administration of 20% albumin, albeit in non-fluid responding patients.

The concomitant administration of albumin solution in a 5% or 20% concentration and a restricted amount of RL suggests a formulation with potentially high usefulness as conventional resuscitation therapy in hemorrhage and continuous bleeding for a period of around 1 h. Administration of additional fluids is unlikely to be needed, which reduces the positive fluid balance. This is of importance as excessive postoperative fluid balance has been related to poorer outcome including anastomotic leakage in major surgery involving intestines or colon. In addition, our study shows that a replacement in a 3:1 ratio with RL alone resulted in a modest reduced blood volume and elevated PPV value. Reasons to the inability to RL to fully maintain the BV might involve transudation into the operating field or else to accumulation of fluid in the "third fluid space", which is an issue when > 1.5 L of RL has been infused.

Urogynecology (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative management of intravenous fluids — because of liberalized fasting guidelines allowing for intake of clear liquids up to 2 h before surgery, there is no need to administer IV fluids to account for fasting losses, and the goal of intraoperative fluid administration should be to maintain euvolemia. One ERAS pathway used rates of 2 mL/kg/h with boluses of crystalloid for mean arterial pressure < 60 mmHg or < 20% of baseline, and another goal-directed algorithm resulted in a decrease in fluids administered of > 1 L without hypovolemia-related complications. In general, balanced salt solutions should be utilized over normal saline. Postoperatively, IV fluids should be run until the patient is tolerating oral fluids, and a rate of administration of 40 mL/h has been shown to be adequate; IV fluids should be discontinued once the patient is tolerating oral hydration; Grade of recommendation: Strong; Quality of evidence: Moderate.

### Enalapril maleate (enalapril maleate oral solution) [^8924924c]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hypotension

Enalapril can cause symptomatic hypotension, sometimes complicated by oliguria, progressive azotemia, acute renal failure or death. Patients at risk of excessive hypotension include those with the following conditions or characteristics: heart failure with systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, hyponatremia, high dose diuretic therapy, renal dialysis, or severe volume and/or salt depletion of any etiology.

In these patients, enalapril should be started under very close medical supervision and such patients should be followed closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of enalapril and/or diuretic is increased.

Symptomatic hypotension is also possible in patients with severe aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Surgery/Anesthesia

In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, enalapril may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is considered to be through this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion.

5.4 Hepatic Failure

Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis, and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up.

5.5 Impaired Renal Function

Monitor renal function in patients treated with enalapril. Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, post-myocardial infarction or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on enalapril. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on enalapril [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.3)].

5.6 Hyperkalemia

Serum potassium should be monitored in patients receiving enalapril. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

### Buried bumper syndrome [^1c555512]. VideoGIE (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment of buried bumper syndrome from PEG tube

Endoscopic PEG tube extraction can be performed with the patient under general anesthesia. Simple external traction is shown at the end of Video 1 (available online at), with an example of what buried bumper syndrome looks like and how to remove the burred bumper. The PEG tube can be replaced with either another PEG tube or a low-profile Mic-Key G-tube (Halyard, Alpharetta, Ga, USA).

If there is an abscess at the placement site, with or without severe skin infection, this worsens the patient's clinical condition, and the abscess must first be drained surgically. The patient's status is corrected by nutritional support and by fluid and electrolyte adjustments. Finally, to control the infection at the tube site, broad-spectrum antibiotics and local wound care must be used. In these cases, a replacement PEG tube is best inserted at a different site.

### Prevention and management of major complications in percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy [^b03d7279]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Management options

For tubes in place > 4 weeks: Apply blind bedside tube replacement through the tube tract which is generally safe and easy. It should be attempted as soon as possible to prevent the tube tract from closing. A similarly sized Foley catheter is commonly available and makes for a great temporary replacement PEG. If gastric contents can be aspirated with a pH of ≤ 5.5 and the tube flushes problem-free with sterile water, a confirmatory radiographic study is not necessary
For tubes in place < 4 weeks: 'Blind' tube reinsertion should be avoided. The patient should be monitored clinically and broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered in symptomatic patients. A new PEG should be placed once the initial tract has healed. Manage the patient by nasogastric aspiration, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and parenteral nutrition if unable to replace the PEG immediately. Monitor for signs of peritonitis. Consider surgical exploration if the patient demonstrates signs of peritoneal leakage and early peritonitis.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Heart Failure: Initiate at 2.5 mg twice daily. Titrate up to 20 mg twice daily as tolerated. (2.2)

Asymptomatic Left Ventricular Dysfunction: Initiate at 2.5 mg twice daily. Titrate up to 10 mg twice daily. (2.3)

Enalapril maleate oral solution is a ready-to-use solution intended for oral use only.

2.2 Heart Failure

The recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg twice a day titrated up to a maximum of 20 mg twice a day, as tolerated. Doses are usually given in combination with diuretics and digitalis.

In patients with hyponatremia (serum sodium less than 130 mEq/L) or serum creatinine greater than 1.6 mg/dL, the recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg once daily.

Diuretic dose may need to be adjusted to minimize hypovolemia and hypotension. The appearance of hypotension after the initial dose of enalapril maleate oral solution does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug, following effective management of the hypotension.

2.3 Asymptomatic Left Ventricular Dysfunction

The recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg twice a day titrated up to a maximum of 10 mg twice a day, as tolerated. Diuretic dose may need to be adjusted.

Dehydration and drugs — syncope management recommendations state that fluid resuscitation via oral or intravenous bolus is recommended in patients with syncope due to acute dehydration, and reducing or withdrawing medications that may cause hypotension can be beneficial in selected patients with syncope. In selected patients with syncope due to dehydration, it is reasonable to encourage increased salt and fluid intake, and rehydration, whether by intravenous or oral formulation, should include sodium supplementation for more rapid recovery. Additional dietary sodium may be provided as sodium tablets or sodium already dissolved in beverages, and higher-sodium-content beverages with osmolality comparable to normal body osmolality may rehydrate faster than lower-sodium-content beverages; this treatment option is not appropriate for patients with cardiac dysfunction or HF, uncontrolled hypertension, or chronic kidney disease.

### Perioperative care of patients at high risk for stroke during or after non-cardiac, non-neurologic surgery: consensus statement from the society for neuroscience in anesthesiology and critical care* [^778b0f80]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke during noncardiac surgery — blood pressure and hemodynamic management specify that, unless the patient is eligible for acute reperfusion intervention, systolic blood pressure is usually treated only if it is greater than 220 mm Hg and diastolic pressure only if it is greater than 120 mm Hg; in patients who receive rTPA (intravenous or intra-arterial) or undergo mechanical clot retrieval, systolic blood pressure above 180 mm Hg and diastolic pressure above 105 mm Hg should be treated with anti-hypertensive drugs such as labetolol or nicardipine. No data are available to guide selection of medications for the lowering (or raising) of blood pressure in acute ischemic stroke. Both hypovolemia and unstable cardiac arrhythmias that may result in arterial hypotension warrant correction of hypovolemia with normal saline and restoration of normal sinus rhythm, which is stated as beneficial.

### Dexmedetomidine (Igalmi) [^95468e9c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Hypotension, Orthostatic Hypotension, and Bradycardia

IGALMI causes dose-dependent hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, and bradycardia. In clinical studies, 18%, 16%, and 9% of patients treated with 180 mcg of IGALMI, 120 mcg of IGALMI, and placebo, respectively, experienced orthostatic hypotension (defined as SBP decrease ≥ 20 mmHg or DBP decrease ≥ 10 mmHg after 1, 3, or 5 minutes of standing) at 2 hours post-dose. In those studies, 7%, 6%, and 1% of patients treated with 180 mcg of IGALMI, 120 mcg of IGALMI, and placebo, respectively, experienced HR ≤ 50 beats per minute within 2 hours of dosing [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In clinical studies with IGALMI, patients were excluded if they had treatment with alpha-1 noradrenergic blockers, benzodiazepines, other hypnotics or antipsychotic drugs four hours prior to study drug administration; had a history of syncope or syncopal attacks; SBP < 110 mmHg; DBP < 70 mmHg; HR < 55 beats per minute; or had evidence of hypovolemia or orthostatic hypotension.

Reports of hypotension and bradycardia, including some resulting in fatalities, have been associated with the use of another dexmedetomidine product given intravenously (IGALMI is for sublingual or buccal use and is not approved for intravenous use). Clinically significant episodes of bradycardia and sinus arrest have been reported after administration of this other dexmedetomidine product to young, healthy adult volunteers with high vagal tone and when this product was given by rapid intravenous or bolus administration.

Because IGALMI decreases sympathetic nervous system activity, hypotension and/or bradycardia may be more pronounced in patients with hypovolemia, diabetes mellitus, or chronic hypertension, and in geriatric patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Avoid use of IGALMI in patients with hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, advanced heart block, severe ventricular dysfunction, or history of syncope. After IGALMI administration, patients should be adequately hydrated and should sit or lie down until vital signs are within normal range. If a patient is unable to remain seated or lying down, precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of falls. Ensure that a patient is alert and not experiencing orthostatic hypotension or symptomatic hypotension prior to allowing them to resume ambulation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^acdc0d5e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Intensive care unit

Questions:
Which are the indications for intensive care unit (ICU) admission?
When is fluid resuscitation indicated and which fluid should be used? What is the optimal fluid infusion rate and response measurement for initial resuscitation? What is the preferred pharmacologic approach to persistent shock?
What is the correct approach for pain control?
Which are the indications for mechanical ventilation?
What is the medical approach to the abdominal compartment syndrome? What is the role of medications such as Gabexate Mesilate and somatostatin analogues?
Enteral nutrition: which are the indications, what type of nutrition should be used, and which is the best way to administer enteral nutrition?

Statement (monitoring)

Continuous vital signs monitoring in high dependency care unit is needed if organ dysfunction occurs. Persistent organ dysfunction or organ failure occurrence despite adequate fluid resuscitation is an indication for ICU admission (1C).

Discussion

The worldwide heterogeneity in intensive and intermediate care unit settings makes it difficult to define universal pathways. There is no single marker able to define the severity of the illness. Several scoring system should be used to assess the severity in a different phase, place, and patient.

Extensive fluid administration, adequate pain management with potentially harmful strategies, and organ function evaluation during initial treatment are the reason why continuous vital signs monitoring is crucial, whatever the setting is. Persistent organ dysfunction despite adequate fluid resuscitation needing specific organ support is usually delivered only in ICUs.

Statement (fluid resuscitation)

Early fluid resuscitation is indicated to optimize tissue perfusion targets, without waiting for hemodynamic worsening. Fluid administration should be guided by frequent reassessment of the hemodynamic status, since fluid overload is known to have detrimental effects. Isotonic crystalloids are the preferred fluid (1B).

Discussion

The decrease in mortality observed over the last decade might be due to the prevention of pancreatic necrosis by maintenance of microcirculation due to more extensive fluid resuscitation. Data on the amount of fluid needed to prevent necrosis or to improve outcome are contradictory and the volume must be adjusted to the patient's age, weight, and pre-existing renal and/or cardiac conditions.

Hematocrit, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate are laboratory markers of volemia and adequate tissue perfusion, and should be monitored. Ringer's lactate may be associated with anti-inflammatory effect, but the evidence for superiority of Ringer's lactate vs. normal saline based on randomized trials is weak. It could be better in correcting the potassium level. The value of early goal-directed therapy in patients with acute pancreatitis remains unknown.

### Diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium (Md gastroview) [^e87dbd65]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Dehydration: Administration of hypertonic MD-Gastroview solutions may lead to hypovolemia and hypotension due to fluid loss from the intestine. A 1 in 4.6 (1:4.6) dilution of MD-Gastroview yields an approximately isotonic 16.5 percent diatrizoate salts solution; less dilute solutions are hypertonic and may lead to intraluminal movement of fluid with resulting hypovolemia. In young or debilitated children and in elderly cachectic persons, the loss of plasma fluid may be sufficient to cause a shock-like state. If MD-Gastroview is used in infants and children (under 10 kg) or in dehydrated or debilitated patients, the solution must be prepared using the specific dilutions described in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION. In debilitated patients and in patients with electrolyte imbalances, postprocedural monitoring of hydration, serum osmolarity, electrolytes and clinical status is essential. In pediatric or severely debilitated patients, the maintenance of an open intravenous fluid line for rehydration may be advisable should hypotension or shock supervene. Electrolyte disturbances must be corrected prior to the administration of any hypertonic MD-Gastroview solutions.

Aspiration: Aspiration of MD-Gastroview into the trachea and airways may result in serious pulmonary complications including, pulmonary edema, pneumonitis or death. Bronchial entry of any orally administered contrast medium causes a copious osmotic effusion. Therefore, avoid use of MD-Gastroview in patients with esophagotracheal fistula and minimize risks for pulmonary aspiration in all patients. If MD-Gastroview is given by nasogastric tube, the position of the tube in the stomach must be verified before administration.

Anaphylactic Reactions: Anaphylactic reactions, including fatalities, have been reported with the use of MD-Gastroview. Patients at increased risk include those with a history of a previous reaction to a contrast medium, patients with a known sensitivity to iodine, and patients with a known clinical hypersensitivity (bronchial asthma, hay fever, and food allergies). Medical personnel trained in the treatment of anaphylactic reactions and the necessary drugs and medical equipment should always be readily available when MD-Gastroview is used.

### Postprandial hypotension [^dd5fb06b]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Postprandial hypotension is both common in geriatric patients and an important but under-recognized cause of syncope. Other populations at risk include those with Parkinson disease and autonomic failure. The mechanism is not clearly understood, but appears to be secondary to a blunted sympathetic response to a meal. This review discusses the epidemiology, risk factors, and pathophysiology of postprandial hypotension in the elderly, as well as diagnosis and treatment strategies. Diagnosis can be made based on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and patient symptoms. Lifestyle modifications such as increased water intake before eating or substituting 6 smaller meals daily for 3 larger meals may be effective treatment options. However, data from randomized, controlled trials are limited. Increased awareness of this disease may lead to improved quality of life, decreased falls and injuries, and the avoidance of unnecessary testing.

### Randomized clinical trial of fluid and salt restriction compared with a controlled liberal regimen in elective gastrointestinal surgery [^27a3db5f]. The British Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Oral intake was encouraged as much as possible in the postoperative phase in both groups. The colorectal and gastrectomy groups received oral fluids from day 1. Those who underwent oesophagectomy received jejunal feeding via a jejunostomy feeding tube for 4 days, then from day 5 oral fluids were started as tolerated. After operation, the restricted group received intravenous fluid using 5 per cent-glucose at a rate of 1 mL per kg per h until enteral intake was sufficient. The control group received intravenous fluid at a rate of 1.5 mL per kg per h. The type of fluid given in the control group was departmental standard with a mixture of saline-containing crystalloid and 5 per cent-glucose to enable a daily input of 1–2 mmol/kg sodium. Electrolytes were monitored daily and replaced in accordance with current practice.

Drain losses above 500 ml/day were replaced with volume for volume starch-based colloid. In both groups, any additional losses over 500 ml/day were replaced with Hartmann's solution volume for volume.

Postoperative hypotension (defined as a drop of more than 30 per cent in systolic pressure from preoperative values) and oliguria (0.3 mL per kg per h or below for 2 h) was treated according to departmental standards in the control group using adjustment of epidural rate, medications and starch-based colloid boluses. In the restricted group and in the absence of shock this was treated by adjustment of the epidural, review of antihypertensive medications and review after 1 h. Persistent hypotension or oliguria in the absence of tachycardia was treated with 3-mg bolus doses of intravenous ephedrine at 5-min intervals, up to a maximum of 15 mg. In the presence of tachycardia a starch-based colloid was also given in 250-ml boluses to achieve an adequate blood pressure and urine output.

Outcome measures

The primary outcome measure was total postoperative complications of grade II and above (moderate to severe). Secondary outcome measures were 30-day postoperative mortality, length of postoperative hospital stay, change in forced expiratory volume at 1 s (FEV1) measured by spirometry on day 5 compared with preoperative value, and postoperative hypotensive episodes.

### Droperidol [^3d71e319]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Manifestations:

The manifestations of droperidol overdosage are an extension of its pharmacologic actions and may include QT prolongation and serious arrhythmias (e.g., torsade de pointes) (see BOXED WARNING, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS).

Treatment:

In the presence of hypoventilation or apnea, oxygen should be administered and respiration should be assisted or controlled as indicated. A patent airway must be maintained; an oropharyngeal airway or endotracheal tube might be indicated. The patient should be carefully observed for 24 hours; body warmth and adequate fluid intake should be maintained. If hypotension occurs and is severe or persists, the possibility of hypovolemia should be considered and managed with appropriate parenteral fluid therapy. (see PRECAUTIONS).

If significant extrapyramidal reactions occur in the context of an overdose, an anticholinergic should be administered.

The intravenous Median Lethal Dose of droperidol is 20–43 mg/kg in mice; 30 mg/kg in rats; 25 mg/kg in dogs and 11–13 mg/kg in rabbits. The intramuscular Median Lethal Dose of droperidol is 195 mg/kg in mice; 104–110 mg/kg in rats; 97 mg/kg in rabbits and 200 mg/kg in guinea pigs.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to fluid resuscitation, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to determine hydration status and administer IV fluids according to the severity of hypovolemia:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Mild hypovolemia|- 0.9% saline or another balanced crystalloid at a clinically appropriate rate aiming to replace 50% of the estimated fluid deficit in the first 8–12 hours < br > - Add 5% or 10% dextrose to the 0.9% saline/balanced crystalloid when glucose reaches < 250 mg/dL < br > - Start 5% or 10% dextrose alongside 0.9% saline/balanced crystalloid at the start of the insulin treatment in euglycemic DKA (glucose < 200 mg/dL and positive β-hydroxybutyrate)|
|Severe hypovolemia|- 0.9% saline or another balanced crystalloid (1.0 L/hr)|
|Cardiac compromise|- Hemodynamic monitoring/pressors.|

### Polyethylene glycol-3350, sodium chloride, potassium chloride and sodium bicarbonate [^052f33e3]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

General

Patients with impaired gag reflex, unconscious, or semiconscious patients, and patients prone to regurgitation or aspiration should be observed during the administration of PEG-3350, SODIUM CHLORIDE, POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM BICARBONATE, especially if it is administered via nasogastric tube. If a patient experiences severe bloating, distention or abdominal pain, administration should be slowed or temporarily discontinued until the symptoms abate. If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected, appropriate studies should be performed to rule out these conditions before administration of PEG-3350, SODIUM CHLORIDE, POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM BICARBONATE.

Information for Patients

PEG-3350, SODIUM CHLORIDE, POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM BICARBONATE produces a watery stool which cleanses the bowel before examination. Prepare the solution according to the instructions on the bottle. It is more palatable if chilled. For best results, no solid food should be consumed during the 3 to 4 hour period before drinking the solution, but in no case should solid foods be eaten within 2 hours of taking PEG-3350, SODIUM CHLORIDE, POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM BICARBONATE.

Adults drink 240 mL (8 oz.) every 10 minutes. Continue drinking until the watery stool is clear and free of solid matter. This usually requires at least 3 liters. Any unused portion should be discarded. Pediatric patients (aged 6 months or greater) drink 25 mL/kg/hour. Continue drinking until the watery stool is clear and free of solid matter. Any unused portion should be discarded. Rapid drinking of each portion is better than drinking small amounts continuously. The first bowel movement should occur approximately one hour after the start of PEG-3350, SODIUM CHLORIDE, POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM BICARBONATE administration. You may experience some abdominal bloating and distention before the bowels start to move. If severe discomfort or distention occur, stop drinking temporarily or drink each portion at longer intervals until these symptoms disappear.

Use of PEG-3350, SODIUM CHLORIDE, POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, and SODIUM BICARBONATE in children younger than 2 years of age should be carefully monitored for occurrence of possible hypoglycemia, as this solution has no caloric substrate. Dehydration has been reported in 1 child and hypokalemia has been reported in 3 children.

Drug Interactions

Oral medication administered within one hour of the start of administration of PEG-3350, SODIUM CHLORIDE, POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM BICARBONATE may be flushed from the gastrointestinal tract and not absorbed.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Carcinogenic and reproductive studies with animals have not been performed.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on gastrostomy feeding tubes: summary and recommendations [^a3910d6f]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) gastrostomy feeding tubes — this evidence-based guideline, developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework, addresses PEG versus interventional radiology–guided gastrostomy (IR-G), antiplatelet and anticoagulant management, timing of post-PEG feeding, and technique selection in malignant dysphagia. In patients needing enteral access, the ASGE suggests PEG as the preferred technique for initial gastrostomy over IR-G. The ASGE recommends that tube feeding can be safely started within 4 hours of gastrostomy. The ASGE suggests that PEG can be performed without withholding antiplatelet medications, and suggests that the periprocedural management of anticoagulants should be based on a multidisciplinary discussion regarding the risk of bleeding versus cardiovascular events. In patients with malignant dysphagia, either transoral "pull" PEG or direct PEG can be performed for initial enteral access.

### Phase II trial of isotonic fluid resuscitation in Kenyan children with severe malnutrition and hypovolaemia [^1a1cd14f]. BMC Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Ringers Lactate or albumin resuscitation

initial bolus of 10 ml/kg over 30 minutes, repeated only twice over one hour (i.e. up to 30 ml/kg in total) if clinical reassessment demonstrated any of the following features of shock: CRT > 3 s, weak pulse volume, temperature gradient or hypotension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 80 mmHg)).

Additional boluses (10 mls/kg over one hour) were only permitted if oliguria (< 0.5 mls/kg/hour) or hypotension (systolic pressure < 80 mmHg) developed (20 mls/kg over one hour). Maximum bolus volumes given were 40 ml/kg. At each clinical review children were assessed for clinical resolution of shock and examined for signs of pulmonary oedema (if present further boluses withheld and treated with diuretics). No invasive monitoring, such as central venous pressure (CVP) measurement, was used. The children did not receive inotropes, vasopressors, or hydrocortisone. Other than the initial fluid boluses additional intravenous fluids boluses, intravenous rehydration for children with severe diarrhoea or maintenance fluids were not given (as per guideline recommendation). The only exception was if the child was intolerant to feeding when low volume maintenance was provided. Children were continuously and non-invasively monitored for heart and respiratory rate, oxygen saturation using a multi channel Siemens ® monitor and hourly for blood pressure and urine output then every 4 hours after 8 hours. At admission blood gases, plasma biochemistry, and haematology were assessed and reassessed at 8- and 24-hours post-admission. Blood and urine were cultured at admission on all children and lumbar puncture, where indicated. Adherence to protocol was validated by an internal but independent monitoring team. The trial was monitored three times during execution.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on gastrostomy feeding tubes: methodology and review of evidence [^abff3b80]. VideoGIE (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The panelists noted a misconception that the delayed initiation of tube feeds allows the stoma site to heal. Instead, the stoma site takes at least several weeks to heal. Another concern with early tube feed initiation has been that gastric wall injury during PEG placement may transiently decrease gastric motility, resulting in increased gastric residual volume. Although several studies included in our analysis reported gastric residual volume as an outcome, the routine measurement of gastric residuals is of unclear clinical significance and may lead to unnecessary tube feed discontinuation. In addition, the measurement of gastric residual volume and the definition of high gastric residuals are not standardized and varied between the studies that reported them. The panel agreed that routine gastric residual measurement should not be performed, and this was not included in our analysis.

Theoretically, earlier tube feed initiation may allow patients to reach goal rates quicker, resulting in earlier discharge, decreased length of hospitalization, and decreased health care cost. There were no studies that compared cost-effectiveness, time to reach goal tube feed rate, or hospital length of stay. The panel noted that the difference in nutritional status is likely clinically insignificant between early and delayed tube feed initiation, but no studies reported this.

For patient value assessment, our patient advocate emphasized a desire to have tube feeding initiated as soon as possible to not delay or interrupt nutrition therapy and felt reassured that there were no increased adverse events noted for earlier tube feed initiation. The expert panel also noted a theoretical benefit of reducing the risk of ileus with earlier tube feed initiation.

Overall, the evidence was of low to moderate quality. Given the lack of a significant difference in outcomes between the early and delayed groups in RCTs, the theoretical benefits of earlier tube feed initiation, input from the experts on the panel, and the patient value assessment, the panel made a strong recommendation for early initiation of tube feed after PEG tube placement.

The panel emphasized that although earlier tube initiation after PEG tube placement is recommended, there are clinical situations where tube feed initiation after PEG tube placement may not be clinically appropriate, such as patients on vasopressors, with severe ileus or obstruction, or patients with bowel ischemia. In addition, although intentional delay is not recommended, early tube feed initiation after PEG tube placement may not always be feasible due to delays related to the logistics of initiating tube feeds. The panel noted that in most cases, although it was not studied specifically, medications may be given immediately via the PEG after placement, unless there are contraindications to enteral medications.

### Diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium [^caf7b229]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Dehydration: Administration of hypertonic diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium solutions may lead to hypovolemia and hypotension due to fluid loss from the intestine. A 1 in 4.6 (1:4.6) dilution of diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium yields an approximately isotonic 16.5 percent diatrizoate salts solution; less dilute solutions are hypertonic and may lead to intraluminal movement of fluid with resulting hypovolemia. In young or debilitated children and in elderly cachectic persons, the loss of plasma fluid may be sufficient to cause a shock-like state. If diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium solution is used in infants and children (under 10 kg) or in dehydrated or debilitated patients, the solution must be prepared using the specific dilutions described in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION. In debilitated patients and in patients with electrolyte imbalances, postprocedural monitoring of hydration, serum osmolarity, electrolytes and clinical status is essential. In pediatric or severely debilitated patients, the maintenance of an open intravenous fluid line for rehydration may be advisable should hypotension or shock supervene. Electrolyte disturbances must be corrected prior to the administration of any hypertonic diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium solutions.

Aspiration: Aspiration of diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium solution into the trachea and airways may result in serious pulmonary complications including, pulmonary edema, pneumonitis or death bronchial entry of any orally administered contrast medium causes a copious osmotic effusion. Therefore, avoid use of diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium solution in patients with esophagotracheal fistula and minimize risks for pulmonary aspiration in all patients. If diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate

sodium solution is given by nasogastric tube, the position of the tube in the stomach must be verified before administration.

Anaphylactic reactions: Anaphylactic reactions, including fatalities, have been reported with the use of diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium solution. Patients at increased risk include those with a history of a previous reaction to a contrast medium, patients with a known sensitivity to iodine, and patients with a known clinical hypersensitivity (bronchial asthma, hay fever, and food allergies). Medical personnel trained in the treatment of anaphylactic reactions and the necessary drugs and medical equipment should always be readily available when diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium solution is used.

### When is parenteral nutrition appropriate? [^d728c9cc]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for parenteral nutrition, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (indications), ASPEN 2017 guidelines recommend to assess intestinal function and perfusion, as well as overall hemodynamic stability when evaluating readiness for enteral nutrition, rather than relying on strict adherence to a list of contraindications to enteral nutrition, such as the presence of umbilical catheters or use of vasoactive medications.

### Severe hypernatremia as a predictor of mortality after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement [^1d60291c]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is the preferred option for providing enteral nutrition, allowing for an improvement in survival and quality of life.

Aim

To evaluate risk factors for early and delayed mortality after gastrostomy placement.

Methods

A single-center retrospective analysis of a prospectively-collected database including all patients undergoing gastrostomy placement for enteral nutrition was performed. Two operators performed all the procedures according to the most recent guidelines.

Results

Analysis included data on 438 patients [178 male; 80.5 (72–86) year-old]. Indications for PEG were stroke (34.0%), dementia (31.3%), neurodegenerative disorders (18.5%), coma (9.1%) and cancer (7.1%). No periprocedural adverse events was observed. Mean survival was 14.6 ± 3.4months; 1-month and 3-month mortality rates were 4.0% and 8.1%, respectively. Severe hypernatremia (≥ 150mmol/L) was independently related to 1-month mortality (odds ratio 25.4; P < 0.0001), while C-reactive protein level > 4.3mg/dL was independently related to 3-month mortality (odds ratio 5.3; P = 0.003). Kaplan-Meier and Cox-regression analysis identified male gender (hazard ratio 2.32; P = 0.0002), severe hypernatremia (hazard ratio 4.3; P < 0.0001), C-reactive protein > 4.3mg/dL (hazard ratio 3.5; P = 0.0014), leukocytosis (hazard ratio 1.97; P = 0.0036) and presence of underlying malignancy (hazard ratio 2.4; P = 0.0013) as independent risk factors for long-term mortality.

Discussion

Presence of severe hypernatremia and increased C-reactive protein levels were strongly correlated with early and delayed mortality in our population. Studies are necessary to understand whether correcting underlying dehydration and inflammation further improves patients' outcomes.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on gastrostomy feeding tubes: summary and recommendations [^892d23fb]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

Enteral nutrition timing after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement — Given the lack of significant difference in outcomes between the early and delayed feeding groups, the panel made a recommendation for early (within 4 hours) versus intentionally delayed tube feed initiation after PEG tube placement and rated the evidence as moderate quality. Early tube feeding after PEG tube placement may not be clinically appropriate in certain situations, including severe ileus, obstruction, or bowel ischemia, and in most cases medications may be given immediately through the PEG tube after placement unless there are contraindications to enteral medications. Based on the available evidence, the panel agreed that routine gastric residual measurement is not indicated.

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^a4ffa066]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) — timing of diagnostic endoscopy recommendations: Patients with UGIB should generally undergo endoscopy within 24 h of admission, following resuscitative efforts to optimize hemodynamic parameters and other medical problems. In patients who are hemodynamically stable and without serious comorbidities, endoscopy should be performed as soon as possible in a non-emergent setting to identify the substantial proportion with low-risk endoscopic findings who can be safely discharged. In patients with higher risk clinical features (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension, bloody emesis or NG aspirate in hospital), endoscopy within 12 h may be considered to potentially improve clinical outcomes.

### Buried bumper syndrome causing rectus abdominis necrosis in a man with tetraplegia [^e4281eb7]. Spinal Cord (2010). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case report.

Objectives

To enhance the early recognition of buried bumper syndrome in patients with tetraplegia requiring percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

Setting

Inpatient unit, Massachusetts, USA.

Methods

A 44 year-old man with C2 American Spinal Injury Association grade A tetraplegia with a relatively recent PEG insertion secondary to poor nutritional intake.

Results

Several months after PEG placement, patient became febrile, hypotensive and complained of abdominal pain. Plain films showed a dilated bowel suggestive of ileus. Abdominal and pelvic computed tomography with and without contrast revealed PEG tube dislodgement, and a 21 cm x 2.8 cm left anterior abdominal wall collection consisting of air and contrast. Upon surgical intervention, the left rectus abdominis sheath and muscle were found to be necrotic.

Conclusion

Buried bumper syndrome is a serious complication related to PEG tubes. For many people with tetraplegia, PEG is a life-saving procedure with minimal risks. However, emergencies do occur, making prompt recognition imperative to prevent a fatal sequela.

### Critical care management of patients following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: recommendations from the Neurocritical Care Society's multidisciplinary consensus conference [^9a981bd6]. Neurocritical Care (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) — fluid and endocrine measures are directed as follows: Fluid restriction should not be used to treat hyponatremia (weak quality evidence; strong recommendation). Early treatment with hydrocortisone or fludrocortisone may be used to limit natriuresis and hyponatremia (moderate quality evidence; weak recommendation). Mild hypertonic saline solutions can be used to correct hyponatremia (very low quality evidence; strong recommendation). Extreme caution to avoid hypovolemia is needed if vasopressin-receptor antagonists are used for treatment of hyponatremia (weak quality evidence; strong recommendation). Free water intake via intravenous and enteral routes should be limited (very low quality evidence; strong recommendation).
