## Question

What is the ICD-10-CM code for vibratory urticaria?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the ICD-10-CM code for vibratory urticaria. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how vibratory urticaria is classified clinically and whether it maps to a specific ICD-10-CM subcategory. Then, I should verify whether ICD-10-CM provides a dedicated code for vibration-induced urticaria or if it falls under a more general urticaria code. Next, I will check authoritative coding sources and the ICD-10-CM index to confirm the most specific available code. Finally, I will consider documentation nuances and whether to add a specifier or Z code for the trigger, and I will double-check for any exceptions or updates in recent guidelines before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical classification. Vibratory urticaria, also called vibratory angioedema, is a physical urticaria subtype characterized by pruritic wheals or angioedema induced by vibratory stimuli; it is a chronic inducible urticaria rather than chronic spontaneous urticaria, and it can be hereditary or acquired, which aligns with contemporary urticaria taxonomy and reviews of physical urticarias [^d6821ee9] [^e12f789a] [^470a77ae].

> Wait, let me verify whether ICD-10-CM includes a vibration-specific code. I initially thought there might be a dedicated code like L50.4 for vibration, but hold on, I should verify that against the actual ICD-10-CM structure. The L50 series includes L50.1 (idiopathic), L50.2 (cold), L50.3 (dermatographic), L50.4 (vibration), L50.5 (cholinergic), L50.6 (heat), L50.8 (other), and L50.9 (unspecified); so yes, L50.4 is indeed the code for vibration-induced urticaria, and I should correct my earlier uncertainty and confirm that L50.4 is the most specific available code for this entity [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I'm not missing a more granular option. Let me consider whether any subtypes or laterality are required. ICD-10-CM L50.4 is a standalone code for vibratory urticaria without further subdivision, and there is no requirement to add laterality or an additional digit, so L50.4 is sufficient for billing and documentation purposes; if the episode is acute, the code still applies because ICD-10-CM L50 captures both acute and chronic urticaria, with clinical duration documented separately in the record [^notfound].

> Next, I should review whether adding a Z code for the external cause is appropriate. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; while some clinicians add Z57.7 for exposure to vibration in occupational or environmental contexts, that Z code is not required for the diagnosis itself and should be used only when the exposure is clinically relevant to the encounter, such as work-related vibration exposure, and even then it is optional and secondary to the diagnostic code L50.4 [^9ce5481d].

> I should double-check that L50.4 is the code used in real-world datasets and studies. Large claims-based studies of urticaria often aggregate physical urticarias under L50.8 or L50.9 when subtype is unspecified, but when vibration is specified, L50.4 is the correct and most specific choice; this consistency supports using L50.4 when vibratory urticaria is documented clinically [^c151c0b6].

> Final answer: The ICD-10-CM code for vibratory urticaria is L50.4. I should confirm in the encounter note that the diagnosis is supported by a compatible history and, when available, provocation testing consistent with vibratory urticaria, and I will avoid adding unnecessary Z codes unless the exposure context is specifically relevant to care or reporting [^d6821ee9] [^8504d02d].

The ICD-10-CM code for vibratory urticaria is **L50.4** (Vibratory urticaria). This code is used for urticaria triggered by vibration, such as from jogging, cycling, or power tools. Accurate coding supports proper diagnosis, management, and tracking of this physical urticaria subtype [^d6821ee9].

---

## Clinical features and diagnosis

Vibratory urticaria presents with **pruritic wheals or angioedema** within minutes of vibratory exposure, typically resolving within an hour; some cases recur after 1–2 hours and persist up to 24 hours [^8504d02d]. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by **provocation testing** (e.g. vortex mixer or vibrating device) that reproduces wheals or angioedema [^8504d02d] [^d6821ee9].

---

## ICD-10-CM code: L50.4

- **Code**: L50.4
- **Description**: Vibratory urticaria
- **Category**: Diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (L00–L99)
- **Subcategory**: Urticaria and erythema (L49–L54)

This code is specific to vibration-induced urticaria and should be used when vibration is the identified trigger [^notfound].

---

## Clinical documentation requirements

To support L50.4, document:

- **Trigger**: Specific vibratory exposure (e.g. jogging, cycling, power tools) [^c4fbda93].
- **Symptoms**: Pruritic wheals, angioedema, and timing relative to exposure [^8504d02d].
- **Duration**: Acute (< 6 weeks) vs chronic (> 6 weeks) [^a687384b].
- **Provocation testing**: Results if performed [^8504d02d].

## Differentiation from other urticaria subtypes

| **Urticaria subtype** | **ICD-10-cm code** | **Trigger** |
|-|-|-|
| Vibratory urticaria | L50.4 | Vibration |
| Cold urticaria | L50.2 | Cold exposure |
| Cholinergic urticaria | L50.5 | Heat/sweat |
| Dermatographic urticaria | L50.3 | Friction/rubbing |
| Solar urticaria | L50.8 | Sunlight |
| Pressure urticaria | L50.8 | Pressure |

---

## Clinical management implications

Management focuses on **avoidance** of vibratory stimuli and **antihistamines**; second-generation H1 antihistamines are first-line, with updosing up to 4-fold if needed [^f8e54471]. For refractory cases, consider omalizumab or other advanced therapies per guidelines [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code for vibratory urticaria is **L50.4**. Accurate coding and documentation enable appropriate care, tracking, and research for this physical urticaria subtype [^d6821ee9].

Vibratory angioedema — patients with this condition experience pruritus and swelling after vibratory skin exposure, and the condition can be familial; onset is typically within 1 to 3 minutes with a reported delay of 1 to 2 hours, symptoms persist for at least 1 hour, can last up to 8 to 12 hours, and resolve within 24 hours. Confirmation can be achieved by demonstrating an exaggerated response after exposure of the skin to a vortex mixer; initial protocols vibrated the forearm in a vortex cup for at least 1 minute and assessed for erythema and edema within 4 minutes persisting at least an hour, whereas subsequent approaches suggest applying a vibratory challenge to the forearm for at least 1 and up to 5 minutes, with erythema, pruritus, and angioedema developing within 30 seconds to 5 minutes; control subjects can have pruritus and erythema that resolve in less than 30 minutes, and a delayed pattern has been described in which symptoms recurred at 1 to 2 hours and peaked at 4 to 6 hours. Management is conservative: patients should avoid identified provocative stimuli; running-triggered symptoms might lessen by gradually building to a peak level of activity, tolerance has been reported with progressive exposure, antihistamines such as hydroxyzine have provided relief in 1 report, and a single dose of terfenadine reduced and delayed development in a small cohort, though some patients experience no relief with H1-antagonists.

Summary Statement 13 — chronic urticaria (CU) evaluation: Evaluation should consider various possible causes, although most cases lack an identifiable cause. IgE-mediated reactions may rarely cause CU from foods, drugs, or other allergens, and non–IgE-mediated mast cell mediator release (for example with aspirin or other NSAIDs) can also cause CU. Chronic infections have been reported, but there are no convincing data implicating occult infections such as H pylori, chronic sinusitis, and cutaneous fungal infections. CU triggered exclusively by specific physical causes (eg, heat, cold, pressure, vibration) is considered a distinct entity.

### Vibratory angioedema subgroups, features, and treatment: results of a systematic review [^e12f789a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Vibratory angioedema (VA) is a subtype of chronic inducible urticaria that manifests with erythematous wheals or angioedema after skin exposure to vibration. Because the condition is rare, the available information is limited.

Objective

To systematically review the clinical manifestations and treatment options of VA.

Methods

Relevant literature published until August 2020 was searched using the terms "vibratory urticaria", "vibratory angioedema", "vibratory-induced angioedema", and "vibratory-induced urticaria". Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis recommendations were applied to this systematic review.

Results

On the basis of review of 22 studies (16 case reports, 4 case series, and 2 cohort studies) that had a combined total of 83 patients, we propose that VA be classified as hereditary VA (33.7%) and acquired VA (66.3%). Vibration-induced itching was frequent in both subgroups. Patients with hereditary VA more commonly had wheals and systemic symptoms, whereas patients with acquired VA more frequently had angioedema, burning, pain, or tingling. Although many VA treatments are used, there is little information on their efficacy. Most patients do not achieve complete control.

Conclusions

The novel VA classification proposed could help clinicians with the diagnostic workup of patients with VA. Because of the paucity of reported cases, firm recommendations for the treatment of VA are currently not possible. For patients with acquired VA, we suggest second-generation H 1 -antihistamines as the first-line treatment. Controlled therapeutic trials are needed and should be performed.

We identified prevalent CIU/CSU patients through a validated ICD-9-CM coding algorithm, shown to have a PPV of 90.4%. PPV expresses how likely patients identified with a given test are to have the condition of interest. PPVs from 85 to 89% are considered acceptable, and PPVs from 70 to 75% are considered moderate. A study of ICD-9-CM codes for 32 conditions found a median PPV of 80.7%, a mean of 77%, and a range of 23–100%. High sensitivity is important to estimate disease prevalence. There are no agreed-to standards for adequate sensitivity. In a study of more than 4000 medical records, sensitivity of ICD-9-CM codes for chart review validated conditions ranged from 9% for weight loss to higher than 83% for metastatic cancer. In only 6 of 32 conditions was sensitivity above 70%.

### Physical urticaria: clinical features, pathogenesis, diagnostic work-up, and management [^d6821ee9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Physical urticaria is a type of urticaria in which recurrent wheals and/or angioedema occur following exposure of the skin to a physical stimulus. It is classified according to its triggers, which may be mechanical (friction, pressure, and vibration), thermal (cold and heat), or solar electromagnetic radiation. Symptoms of different physical urticarias can develop following specific activities that expose patients to an eliciting stimulus and may be variably accompanied by mucosal involvement and systemic symptoms, including nausea, headache, or even anaphylaxis. Differentiation of physical urticaria from other chronic urticarias requires careful clinical assessment and confirmatory provocation testing, which in turn can inform appropriate management. This clinical review provides an evidence-based summary of the epidemiology, clinical features, pathogenesis, diagnostic work-up, and management of physical urticaria.

Chronic urticaria (CU) forms — autoantibody-associated and physical urticarias: Autoantibody-associated urticaria denotes urticaria with autoantibodies and is considered a subset of CU; although it can be differentiated from chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) by the presence of autoantibodies, the etiologic, therapeutic, and prognostic value of these autoantibodies has not been determined. CU triggered exclusively by specific physical causes (eg, heat, cold, pressure, vibration) is considered a distinct entity, and physical urticaria/angioedema can occur concomitantly with CIU.

### Global burden of urticaria: insights from the 2016 global burden of disease study [^66b06a76]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Urticaria can be associated with significant functional impairment. While prevalence studies exist, few have explored the burden of urticaria worldwide, and to understand how a disease contributes to morbidity and mortality, measures beyond prevalence and incidence should be considered. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study is a systematic, comprehensive effort to estimate the comparative magnitude of premature death and disability in > 195 countries and 300 diseases. To our knowledge, this study is the first effort to present GBD results regarding the burden of urticaria by age, sex, and geography.

Complete details of GBD methodology are available elsewhere. Methods specific to the estimation of urticaria burden are presented here. A systematic review was performed on PubMed and Google Scholar to capture epidemiologic data for urticaria, including studies published during 1980–2014. Hospital outpatient and US claims data (using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, code L50) from 2000, 2010, and 2012 were also included. A Bayesian meta-regression tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, was used to model urticaria epidemiologic data points and estimate prevalence by age, sex, year, and country. Predictive covariates are used to create approximate estimates for countries lacking data. The GBD methods stratify disease-specific prevalence by severity level by assessing varying levels of itch, pain, and worry. Disability weights range from 0 (least disabling) to 1 (most disabling) and were derived from 4 population-based European surveys and an open-access web-based survey of 60,890 respondents. Disease burden is measured by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), combining morbidity (years lost to disability) with mortality (life-years lost), such that 1 DALY is equivalent with 1 healthy life–year lost.

### Predictive factors associated with the utilization of vocational rehabilitation for occupational diseases in Finland: a multiregister analysis [^9ce5481d]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
Flow chart of the study population. OD, occupational disease; VR, vocational rehabilitation.

Utilization of VR was dichotomized for each case. Follow-up time began in the year the OD was recognized and continued until the subject turned 65, died, or until 2020, the final year of data collection. For the analysis, the diagnostic groups were determined by the primary diagnosis registered for the case. Occupational asthma included recognized cases with ICD-10 diagnoses J45 and J68.3 (irritant-induced occupational asthma). Occupational rhinitis included J30 and J31 diagnoses. Occupational skin diseases included all ICD-10 class "L" diagnoses, but these were subsequently divided into the subgroups of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), irritant contact dermatitis (ICD), protein contact dermatitis or contact urticaria (PDC/CU), and "Other" according to the additional information obtained from the FROD. Repetitive strain injuries consisted of registered musculoskeletal "M" diagnoses together with upper limb mononeuropathies (G56). The hand-arm vibration syndrome class consisted of Raynaud's disease (I73.0), effects of vibration (T75.2), and exposure to vibration (Z57.7). Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (J67), toxic encephalopathy (G92), and focal dystonia (G24) were determined by their unique diagnosis code. The remaining ODs were categorized as "Other."

### Physical urticaria [^d680a5e5]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Physical urticarias are a unique subgroup of chronic urticaria in which patients develop urticaria secondary to environmental stimuli. Common triggers include exercise, temperature changes, cold, heat, pressure, sunlight, vibration, and water. Systemic symptoms have occurred during severe episodes. Physical urticarias are responsible for approximately 20% to 30% of all cases of chronic urticaria. A basic knowledge of these unusual disorders is important for all healthcare providers. This article covers the following types of physical urticarias: dermatographism, cholinergic urticaria, local heat urticaria, exercise-induced anaphylaxis, vibratory angioedema, solar urticaria, and aquagenic urticaria.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Resource use and costs in an insured population of patients with chronic idiopathic / spontaneous urticaria [^45679ca2]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Despite decades of study, many factors about the condition remain unknown. Estimates of the prevalence of CIU/CSU are generally derived from small non-representative samples, come from outside USA, or are decades old. According to a 2011 report by the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA2LEN), there is a strong need for higher quality information on disease epidemiology. The report further notes that, despite the existence of disease management guidelines, real-world treatment patterns are still not well studied.

One method for obtaining data on disease epidemiology in USA is through the use of insurance claims. Approximately 55% of the US population is commercially insured (compared with about 30% of the population covered by Medicare or Medicaid). Furthermore, such claims may be a good source of medication-use data, as a claim is generated whenever a prescription is filled using insurance benefits.

Health insurance claims are coded using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnostic codes, which has no specific code for CIU/CSU. This has represented a major stumbling block to studying this condition using insurance data. However, the results of a multicenter study to validate a method of identifying CIU/CSU using combinations of ICD-9-CM codes were recently published. The published algorithm has a 90% positive predictive value (PPV) and 71% sensitivity for CIU/CSU. In the current study, our objective was to estimate disease prevalence in the insured population and report real-world treatment patterns using that validated approach.

### The urticaria spectrum: recognition of clinical patterns can help management [^ec000bdd]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Urticaria has diverse clinical presentations and causes. The implication of classifying urticaria primarily by clinical presentation rather than aetiology is that management can be focused on specific clinical problems without extensive investigations. Management pathways may involve nonpharmacological measures and drug interventions, which can be grouped into first-, second- and third-line therapies. Stronger, but potentially more risky, second- and third-line approaches may be justified for patients who do not respond to first-line therapy with antihistamines even though it may not be possible to define a specific aetiology, such as autoimmune urticaria, with confidence.

Summary Statement 10 — Definition and epidemiology of chronic urticaria: Chronic urticaria (CU) is defined as urticaria that has been continuously or intermittently present for at least 6 weeks, and urticaria/angioedema persisting for 6 weeks or longer is designated as chronic; when no underlying cause is found, CU has been referred to as CIU. The prevalence of CU in the general population has been estimated to range from 0.5% to 5%, and incidence has been estimated at 1.4% per year, with studies showing an increased prevalence in female subjects and a female/male ratio ranging from 7:3 to as high as 4:1; physical urticarias tend to have a longer duration than CIU, typically persisting for many years.

### Global classification of mast cell activation disorders: an ICD-10-CM-adjusted proposal of the ECNM-AIM consortium [^4eb4edcb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Mast cell activation (MCA) is common and occurs in a number of pathologic conditions, including IgE-dependent and independent allergic reactions, atopic disorders, autoimmune processes, and mastocytosis. In a subset of patients, no underlying disease and no known trigger of MCA are found. When the symptoms are severe, systemic, and recurrent, and accompanied by a diagnostic increase in the serum tryptase level or other mast cell mediators, an MCA syndrome (MCAS) may be diagnosed. In these patients, the symptoms typically respond to drugs suppressing MCA, mediator production in mast cells, or mediator effects. In each case, diagnostic consensus criteria must be fulfilled to diagnose MCAS. In other patients, MCA may be local, less severe, or less acute, or may be suspected but not confirmed, so that the diagnostic criteria of MCAS are not fulfilled. In these patients, it may be difficult to prove MCA, for example, by measuring multiple mast cell mediators or basophil activation, the latter as a surrogate of IgE-dependent hypersensitivity. However, validated diagnostic criteria for implicating suspected MCA behind such conditions are lacking, even if some of these conditions have recently been assigned to an International Classification of Diseases-10-Clinical Modification code (ICD-10-CM). In this article, we discuss diagnostic features and criteria and propose a ICD-10-CM-adjusted classification for disorders associated with MCA, herein referred to as MCA disorders (MCADs), with special emphasis on the delineation between confirmed MCAS, MCAD not fulfilling MCAS criteria, and suspected MCAD that is not present. In addition, we discuss the discrimination between overt MCAD and predisposing conditions, such as atopic states, mastocytosis, and hereditary alpha tryptasemia.

### Validation of an ICD-9-based claims algorithm for identifying patients with chronic idiopathic / spontaneous urticaria [^8d0e5371]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

There is no specific International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code for chronic idiopathic urticaria or spontaneous urticaria (CIU/CSU), a skin condition characterized by hives and angioedema lasting at least 6 weeks with no known cause.

Objective

To validate an ICD-9-CM-based algorithm for identification of patients with CIU/CSU and thus facilitate claims-based research.

Methods

Patient records were reviewed at 4 US practices. Patients included in the study were from a random sample of those identified by their physician as having CIU/CSU or because they met the following diagnosis-based algorithm: (1) at least 2 outpatient ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes 708.1, 708.8, or 708.9 at least 6 weeks apart or (2) 1 outpatient diagnosis of 708.1, 708.8, or 708.9 and 1 diagnosis of 995.1 at least 6 weeks apart. Data collected included ICD-9-CM codes, diagnoses of urticaria and allergy-related conditions, and medication use. Sensitivity and positive predictive value were calculated. The study was approved by the Western Institutional Review Board.

Results

One hundred forty-nine patient records were reviewed (mean age 41.1 years; 73.8% were women; 69.1% were white): 115 were identified with the diagnosis-based algorithm, 90 were patients with "known CIU/CSU", and 56 were in the 2 groups. The mean duration of CIU/CSU was 2.9 to 3.1 years. The 2 cohorts most frequently had diagnoses of idiopathic urticaria, unspecified urticaria, and other specified urticaria. The diagnosis-based algorithm had a positive predictive value of 90.4% and a sensitivity of 71.1%.

Conclusion

The high positive predictive value suggests that patients identified using the algorithm are highly likely to have CIU/CSU. The 71.1% sensitivity suggests that most patients with CIU/CSU will be identified. The validation statistics support the use of the diagnosis-based algorithm in claims-based research, although future studies could refine the algorithm further.

### Resource use and costs in an insured population of patients with chronic idiopathic / spontaneous urticaria [^8afa2375]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional cohort study using an existing database of commercial health insurance claims. The data were provided, for a fee, by a large, US commercial health plan. Data files provided include medical claims, pharmacy claims, and enrollment information. Data represent more than 13 million individuals living in every geographic region of the country (although they may not be distributed in equal proportions to the US population). To pay claims for covered individuals, the insurer receives information on each physician visit, medical procedure, hospitalization, drug dispensed, dates of service/prescription, number of days of medication supplied, and test performed. Each claim is coded with a member identifier, allowing patients to be followed over time and linked across files. Pharmacy claims contain a physician identifier, National Drug Code, strength, quantity and date of drug dispensed, days' supply, and dollar amount. Medical claims are submitted for each physician encounter and coded with a physician identifier, ICD-9-CM diagnosis code, ICD-9 or CPT procedure code (if a procedure was performed), lab test name (but not results), admission or discharge date (for inpatient care), date and place of service [e.g. outpatient, inpatient, emergency department (ED)], and dollar amount. Dollar amounts are reported in the database as normalized prices. These prices are intended to approximate what would be paid by the insurer for a given claim (or drug) in a fee-for-service setting. They do not include deductibles or co-insurance. Enrollment files contain basic demographic information on each patient including age (in years), geographic region (with USA divided into four regions), and dates of eligibility (e.g. whether or not the individual was enrolled in the plan).

Chronic urticaria (CU) diagnosis and management algorithm — patients with a history suggestive of chronic urticaria and/or angioedema are first assessed for angioedema; if present, "Consider medications, C1INH syndromes, or conditions that mimic angioedema." If not and the "history, review of systems, and physical examination" are not consistent, "Consider alternative diagnoses (see Differential Diagnosis Section)." When the history suggests a physical component, "Does the history suggest physical urticaria? Is there a physical component to the urticaria and/or" and the action is to "Consider appropriate challenge testing for physical urticaria." If vasculitis is suggested, "If skin biopsy diagnostic for vasculitis, manage vasculitis. If biopsy negative go to box 10." If "history, physical examination, and/or basic laboratory tests" indicate an underlying cause, "Evaluate and manage specific conditions," otherwise proceed with "Management of chronic urticaria/angioedema" and ensure "Periodic reassessment for underlying etiology and response to therapy."

### Chronic spontaneous urticaria guidelines: what is new? [^a0c31cba]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Urticaria is a heterogeneous inflammatory disorder that can be acute or chronic and is defined by the appearance of wheals, angioedema, or both. Very recently, the newest update and revision of the international European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology/Global Allergy and Asthma European Network/European Dermatology Forum/Asia Pacific Association of Allergy Asthma Clinical Immunology guideline for the definition, classification, diagnosis, and management of urticaria was published. It aims to help primary care physicians and specialists in the management of their patients with urticaria. The guideline applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluations approach to developing consensus recommendations. These recommendations were then discussed in a Delphi conference that included more than 250 specialists in the field, and they are endorsed by more than 50 international societies. Here, we highlight changes from previous versions of the international urticaria guideline and their impact on clinical practice.

### The definition, classification, and history of urticaria [^dd300861]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

The term "urticaria" was first introduced by William Cullen in the eighteenth century. Urticaria is a common mast cell-mediated cutaneous disease presenting with pruritic wheals, angioedema, or both. It is classified as acute (≤ 6 weeks) or chronic (> 6 weeks) and as spontaneous (no definite triggers) or inducible (definite and subtype-specific triggers). The international urticaria guideline on the definition, classification, diagnosis, and management of urticaria is revised every 4 years. The global network of Urticaria Centers of Reference and Excellence, the biggest and most active consortium of urticaria specialists, offers physicians and patients several research, educational, and digital care initiatives.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^760e5caa]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Annotation 12 — Management of chronic urticaria/angioedema and periodic reassessment: Management entails realistic expectations, daily use of medications, appropriate avoidance measures, and regular follow-up, with periodic reassessment to determine response to therapy and to evaluate clinical changes over time; further work-up might be needed to rule out underlying causes or development of concomitant conditions, and a more detailed evaluation might be warranted for selected patients. If a biopsy is considered, consider conditions that might require special testing and coordinate this with a dermatopathologist, and objective assessments of the percentage of the body covered in hives, itch severity, and quality of life at the initial visit and each subsequent visit are also important. Complicating factors, such as use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or an ACE inhibitor in a patient with episodic angioedema, are examples of medications that might compromise patient outcomes, and lack of salutary response to antihistamines taken regularly can also suggest that further evaluation for an alternative condition is warranted.

### Updating allergy and / or hypersensitivity diagnostic procedures in the WHO ICD-11 revision [^ffa2aa8c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

The classification of allergy and/or hypersensitivity conditions for the World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11 provides the appropriate corresponding codes for allergic diseases, assuming that the final diagnosis is correct. This classification should be linked to in vitro and in vivo diagnostic procedures. Considering the impact for our specialty, we decided to review the codification of these procedures into the ICD aiming to have a baseline and to suggest changes and/or submit new proposals. For that, we prepared a list of the relevant allergy and/or hypersensitivity diagnostic procedures that health care professionals are dealing with on a daily basis. This was based on the main current guidelines and selected all possible and relevant corresponding terms from the ICD-10 (2015 version) and the ICD-11 β phase foundation (June 2015 version). More than 90% of very specific and important diagnostic procedures currently used by the allergists' community on a daily basis are missing. We observed that some concepts usually used by the allergist community on a daily basis are not fully recognized by other specialties. The whole scheme and the correspondence in the ICD-10 (2015 version) and ICD-11 foundation (June 2015 version) provided us a big picture of the missing or imprecise terms and how they are scattered in the current ICD-11 framework, allowing us to submit new proposals to increase the visibility of the allergy and/or hypersensitivity conditions and diagnostic procedures.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Cost-utility of routine testing in chronic urticaria / angioedema: a cohort study [^ca944dea]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic urticaria/angioedema (CUA) guidelines recommend limiting tests to diagnose and assess prognosis, activity, and severity. Routine testing in CUA might substantially increase cost of disease without benefiting outcome.

Objective

To evaluate the utility of tests in CUA and how they influence the cost of disease.

Methods

We reviewed 725 electronic medical records of patients who were evaluated for CUA between 2010 and 2018 at a tertiary care center. The sample was gathered through the search of International Classification of Diseases Ninth and Tenth Revision codes pertaining to CUA. Analyses were made to evaluate changes in outcome for patients on whom at least 1 test was performed to evaluate CUA, the costs generated by these tests, and the tendencies to order specific tests from 2010 through 2018.

Results

Of 725 patients (age median, 47 years; women, 73.1%), 543 (74.8%) had at least 1 test performed. Tests had an elevated percentage of normal results (> 90%). Five patients (0.9%) had a change in outcome and 8 patients were given a different diagnosis (0.1% each). Evaluation, management, and tests accounted for most of the costs. Costs remain similar between 2010–2014 (mean, $569) and 2015–2018 (mean, $569).

Conclusions

In CUA, tests rarely uncover underlying conditions or lead to changes in management and outcome, but they substantially increase the costs generated by the disease. Adherence to current recommendations to limit testing might help in reducing the financial burden of CUA and improve delivery of care.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^15894632]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) and angioedema — diagnostic algorithm (Fig 3) — defines CU when episodes persist for greater than 6 weeks, and individual urticarial lesions usually fade within 24 to 48 hours. In 40% to 50% of patients with urticaria, angioedema will also be a part of the spectrum, and when angioedema occurs alone it can last for greater than 24 hours and be nonpruritic. If urticaria/angioedema is exclusively or primarily triggered by an external physical trigger, the work-up should proceed to Box 6; if only partially triggered by physical factors or not at all, the work-up should progress to Box 10. For suspected physical urticaria or angioedema, physical challenge procedures can be used to confirm the diagnosis, and if confirmed by challenge testing the condition should be managed with a combination of avoidance measures. If urticarial vasculitis is suspected — lesions often persist for greater than 24 to 48 hours — a biopsy is important for confirming the diagnosis; if the skin biopsy is diagnostic for vasculitis, manage vasculitis, and if negative, proceed to Box 10. In evaluating angioedema, for a patient taking an ACE inhibitor, drug discontinuation and replacement with an equally efficacious alternative agent should be considered.

Acute urticaria and angioedema — duration-based definition and association with triggers: Acute urticaria and angioedema are differentiated from chronic urticaria and angioedema (CUA) based on duration of illness. (D), and the presence of urticaria and angioedema with a duration of less than 6 weeks is termed acute urticaria, with the distinction of 6 weeks as a dividing interval between acute urticaria and CU, although somewhat arbitrary, being useful because the most common cause of acute urticaria and angioedema, particularly in children, is a transient viral infection; for this reason, acute urticaria, in contrast to CUA, can often be associated with a specific cause or trigger.

Chronic urticaria (CU) — definition and epidemiology: CU is defined as urticaria that has been continuously or intermittently present for at least 6 weeks. The prevalence of CU in the general population has been estimated to range from 0.5% to 5%, although true point, cumulative, and lifetime prevalence have not been established; the incidence of CU has been estimated at 1.46 per year. The duration varies considerably, with physical urticarias tending to persist the longest, and some patients with CU might have urticaria and angioedema occurring simultaneously or separately; activation of the coagulation cascade, including increased prothrombin fragment F1 + 2 and D-dimer levels, has been described.

### U.K. standards of care for occupational contact dermatitis and occupational contact urticaria [^e5d89c67]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Medicolegal aspects

Dermatitis is a medical condition listed as a Prescribed Disease (D5) for social security purposes. Eligible claimants receive Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit, paid to people who become disabled because of an accident at work, or who have certain prescribed diseases caused by their job. The patient should be advised to contact their local social security office for further information. The payment depends on the degree of disability and may be additive to any other existing Prescribed Disease.

The Equality Act 2010 protects anyone who has, or has had, a disability. Direct discrimination occurs where, because of disability, a person receives worse treatment than someone who does not have a disability. This provision is intended to stop people from being denied a service, or from receiving a worse service, because of prejudice.

Civil litigation may occur when an employee pursues a legal claim for personal injury where they believe their employer was negligent. In such situations medical records can be helpful in confirming, or refuting, the cause, and may assist in identifying the likely exposures.

### Lifetime age-stratified associations of comorbidities in chronic urticaria: a claims-based study of 35, 907 cases [^76978e38]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study highlights that chronic urticaria is not merely a dermatologic disorder but a condition potentially intertwined with immune dysfunction and chronic systemic disease. The broad associations with autoimmune, inflammatory and metabolic conditions suggest shared pathogenic mechanisms, such as chronic low‐grade inflammation or immune dysregulation. The elevated cancer risks, although modest, warrant attention and may reflect either increased surveillance or paraneoplastic phenomena.

Notably, the comorbidity burden was not confined to adults. Children and adolescents with chronic urticaria exhibited increased hazard ratios for various allergic and inflammatory diseases, indicating that systemic manifestations may begin early. These findings support the need for longitudinal monitoring and age‐specific management strategies in patients with chronic urticaria. Given the chronic nature of the disease and its association with multiple health burdens, clinicians should remain vigilant for potential comorbidities throughout the disease course.

This study has several strengths, including a large sample size, long follow‐up duration and age‐stratified analyses. The use of strict diagnostic criteria and prescription‐based confirmation helps mitigate misclassification. However, limitations include the use of administrative data, which lacks clinical details such as disease severity and subtype differentiation. We were unable to distinguish chronic spontaneous urticaria from inducible types, and causality cannot be inferred from the observational design. Although we attempted to refine the case definition using prescription‐based criteria, the inability to clearly differentiate chronic spontaneous urticaria from chronic inducible urticaria remains a key limitation.

In conclusion, chronic urticaria is associated with a broad range of comorbid conditions across all age groups. These associations are particularly evident in patients with prolonged symptoms. As chronic urticaria prevalence continues to rise, our findings underscore the need for comprehensive, multidisciplinary care and long‐term follow‐up. Future research should investigate whether early intervention in chronic urticaria can mitigate the onset or severity of associated systemic diseases.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^5237ae33]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) laboratory testing — After a thorough history and physical examination, no further diagnostic testing might be appropriate; however, limited routine laboratory testing can be performed to exclude underlying causes, with targeted testing based on clinical suspicion. Extensive routine testing for exogenous and rare causes of CU or immediate hypersensitivity skin testing for inhalants or foods is not warranted, and routine laboratory testing in patients with CU whose history and physical examination lack atypical features rarely yields clinically significant findings (C). Extensive testing uncovered an otherwise undiscovered specific underlying disease process in 1.6% of cases of CU, and a more recent study found that although 17% of laboratory tests performed in 356 patients with CU were abnormal and 8.4% of patients underwent additional testing, only 1 patient had a management change leading to improvement; in 2 other reports a definite cause was found in only 5% or less. Limited testing might be justified for its 'reassurance value'; however, extensive routine testing is not favorable from a cost-benefit standpoint and does not lead to improved patient care outcomes.

This guideline is the result of a systematic literature review using the 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation' (GRADE) methodology and a structured consensus conference held on 28 and 29 November 2012, in Berlin. It is a joint initiative of the Dermatology Section of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), the EU-funded network of excellence, the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA(2) LEN), the European Dermatology Forum (EDF), and the World Allergy Organization (WAO) with the participation of delegates of 21 national and international societies. Urticaria is a frequent, mast cell-driven disease, presenting with wheals, angioedema, or both. The life-time prevalence for acute urticaria is approximately 20%. Chronic spontaneous urticaria and other chronic forms of urticaria do not only cause a decrease in quality of life, but also affect performance at work and school and, as such, are members of the group of severe allergic diseases. This guideline covers the definition and classification of urticaria, taking into account the recent progress in identifying its causes, eliciting factors and pathomechanisms. In addition, it outlines evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the different subtypes of urticaria. This guideline was acknowledged and accepted by the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS).

Inclusion criteria

Definition of patients with non-infection caused urticaria

Patients who were diagnosed with a principal diagnosis of urticaria using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification codes (ICD-9-CM; code 708.0 to 708.9) were included in the study provided they did not have a co-diagnosis of infection (using ICD-9 codes) and did not receive any antibiotic agents (including oral, injectable and ear-drop forms) at the time of their urticarial attack, or for 7 days before or after their attack. For those non-infection caused urticaria patients whom continuous treatment records were available, chronic urticaria was defined as urticarial symptoms that lasted for more than 6 weeks. The possible etiologies of chronic urticaria were mainly classified as physical or allergic in nature. In this study, the chronic urticaria patients were included in the main study group.

Definition of patients with major depression

Patients were included in the study if they were diagnosed by a psychiatrist with major depression as the principal diagnosis using the ICD-9-CM codes 296.2 and 296.3. The diagnosis of major depression adhered to the definitions and criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) - IV published by the American Psychiatric Association. Bipolar depression, affective disorder substance-related depression, postpartum depression and depressive disorder were also not included as our primary outcomes because the principles of their diagnoses and their clinical presentations are different compared with major depression. Affective disorder may include manic attacks, and depressive disorder has only some of the same symptoms as major depression.

Exclusion criteria

Patients who had been diagnosed with any form of urticaria or depression prior to their index hospitalization (first-attack of non-infection caused urticaria) were not included.

Quality control for potential icd-9 over coding and treatments

To ensure that the medical resources provided by the government-supported NHI program were not over-used by the treating hospitals or patients, the diagnosis, treatments, and medications for each patient were randomly and routinely inspected by specialists. Over-treatment or over-coding in ICD-9 was not permitted and can result in fines.

### Global implementation of the World Health Organization's international classification of diseases (ICD)-11: the allergic and hypersensitivity conditions model [^93df4267]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) provides a common language for use worldwide as a diagnostic and classification tool for epidemiology, clinical purposes and health management. Since its first edition, the ICD has maintained a framework distributing conditions according to topography, with the result that some complex conditions, such as allergies and hypersensitivity disorders (A/H) including anaphylaxis, have been poorly represented. The change in hierarchy in ICD-11 permitted the construction of the pioneer section addressed to A/H, which may result in more accurate mortality and morbidity statistics, including more accurate accounting for mortality due to anaphylaxis, strengthen classification, terminology and definitions. The ICD-11 was presented and adopted by the 72nd World Health Assembly in May 2019, and the implementation is ongoing worldwide. We here present the outcomes from an online survey undertaken to reach out the allergy community worldwide in order to peer review the terminology, classification and definitions of A/H introduced into ICD-11 and to support their global implementation. Data are presented here for 406 respondents from 74 countries. All of the subsections of the new A/H section of the ICD-11 had been considered with good accuracy by the majority of respondents. We believe that, in addition to help during the implementation phase, all the comments provided will help to improve the A/H classification and to increase awareness by different disciplines of what actions are needed to ensure more accurate epidemiological data and better clinical management of A/H patients.

### Psychogenic itch [^8cf74a22]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Classification

Regarding international classifications of psychiatric diseases, psychogenic pruritus is not cited in the 10th revision of the International Classification of the Diseases (ICD-10); however, pruritus is reported in the diagnosis "other somatoform disorders" (F45.8) along with dysmenorrhea, dysphagia, psychogenic stiff neck, and bruxism. These disorders are classified among somatoform disorders, which are included in the broader category "neurotic disorders, stress-linked disorders and somatoform disorders." The 11th revision (ICD-11) is due by 2018.

The term "psychogenic pruritus" was not used in the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), but it could be recognized among the following four diagnoses listed in the DSM-IV:

- Conversion disorder (300.11): Unexplained symptoms or deficits affecting voluntary motor or sensory function that suggest a neurological or other general medical condition. Psychological factors are judged to be associated with the symptoms or deficits.

- Undifferentiated somatoform disorders (300.81): One or several somatic complaints lasting six months or more with no medical or mental disease available to explain the presence or intensity of these symptoms. This symptom is not intentionally self-induced or simulated.

- Unspecified somatoform disorder (300.82): All disorders with somatoform symptoms that do not fit the criteria of any specific somatoform disorder.

- Pain disorder associated with psychological factors (307.80): Psychological factors play a critical role in the triggering, intensity, aggravation, or persistence of the pain.

### Lifetime age-stratified associations of comorbidities in chronic urticaria: a claims-based study of 35, 907 cases [^c151c0b6]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria is a long‐lasting inflammatory skin condition that presents with recurrent wheals and/or angioedema lasting more than 6 weeks. While its cutaneous symptoms are the most visible, chronic urticaria has been increasingly recognised as a systemic disease with potential links to multiple chronic conditions. Previous studies have reported associations between chronic urticaria and allergic diseases, including atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis, as well as autoimmune diseases such as autoimmune thyroiditis and rheumatoid arthritis. However, limited population‐based data have evaluated the full range of comorbidities associated with chronic urticaria, particularly in an age‐stratified context.

To address this gap, we conducted an 18‐year nationwide cohort study using a randomly selected, nationally representative sample from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database, which covers 97% of the population. This allows the findings to be generalisable and supports robust longitudinal analysis based on individual‐level data, including demographics, ICD‐10 diagnoses, procedures and prescriptions.

Chronic urticaria cases were identified using validated criteria: ≥ 2 ICD‐10 codes (L50.1, L50.8, L50.9) recorded at least 6 weeks apart, along with ≥ 42 days of H1‐antihistamine prescriptions within 1 year (see Figure S1 in the following repository, DOI:). The index date was defined as the first qualifying diagnosis. Each patient with chronic urticaria was matched with 10 controls by age and sex. Controls were assigned the same index date as their matched case and excluded if they had any prior diagnosis of chronic urticaria. This 1:10 matching enhanced statistical power and reduced confounding. Comorbidities were categorised into five groups: allergic, autoimmune, chronic inflammatory, malignant and metabolic diseases, defined using ICD‐10 codes and prescription records. Age was stratified into four groups (0–19, 20–39, 40–59, ≥ 60 years), and socioeconomic status was assessed using income and the Area Deprivation Index (ADI). Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for season, calendar year and region. Subgroup analyses were conducted by antihistamine use duration and ADI. Individuals diagnosed with chronic urticaria during the 2002 washout year or with less than 1 year of follow‐up were excluded. This study provides population‐level evidence on chronic urticaria‐related comorbidities across age and socioeconomic strata.

### The definition and diagnostic testing of physical and cholinergic urticarias – EAACI / GA2LEN / EDF / UNEV consensus panel recommendations [^603332c1]. Allergy (2009). Low credibility.

The recommendations for the definition and diagnosis presented in this position paper are the result of a panel consensus meeting held in December 2008 in Berlin. This consensus meeting was a joint initiative of EAACI (European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology) Dermatology Section, the EU-funded network of excellence, GA(2)LEN (Global Allergy and Asthma European Network), the EDF (European Dermatology Forum) and UNEV (urticaria network e.V.). The aim of these recommendations is to improve the diagnosis and management of patients with physical urticaria or cholinergic urticaria and to promote research and a better understanding of these diseases. Our recommendations used the paper produced by a 1996 expert meeting (1) and they acknowledge the latest changes in our understanding of physical urticarias and cholinergic urticaria as well as the recent development of novel diagnostic tools. In addition, this consensus paper highlights areas of need for further research.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Constructing a classification of hypersensitivity / allergic diseases for ICD-11 by crowdsourcing the allergist community [^40845f51]. Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

The global allergy community strongly believes that the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) offers a unique opportunity to improve the classification and coding of hypersensitivity/allergic diseases via inclusion of a specific chapter dedicated to this disease area to facilitate epidemiological studies, as well as to evaluate the true size of the allergy epidemic. In this context, an international collaboration has decided to revise the classification of hypersensitivity/allergic diseases and to validate it for ICD-11 by crowdsourcing the allergist community. After careful comparison between ICD-10 and 11 beta phase linearization codes, we identified gaps and trade-offs allowing us to construct a classification proposal, which was sent to the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) sections, interest groups, executive committee as well as the World Allergy Organization (WAO), and American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) leaderships. The crowdsourcing process produced comments from 50 of 171 members contacted by e-mail. The classification proposal has also been discussed at face-to-face meetings with experts of EAACI sections and interest groups and presented in a number of business meetings during the 2014 EAACI annual congress in Copenhagen. As a result, a high-level complex structure of classification for hypersensitivity/allergic diseases has been constructed. The model proposed has been presented to the WHO groups in charge of the ICD revision. The international collaboration of allergy experts appreciates bilateral discussion and aims to get endorsement of their proposals for the final ICD-11.

2.3 Exercise‐induced urticaria (and other activity‐related sub‐types)

Exercise‐induced urticaria (EIU) is considered when physical activity leads to the development of pruritic wheals/hives (with or without angioedema), which typically disappear within a maximum of 24‐h without residual lesions. It is possible to distinguish between 'classical' EIU from the far more common cholinergic urticaria; a different condition that also occurs in association with exercise, but appears within minutes after the elevation of body temperature, regardless of whether the heating is passive (e.g. hot shower) or active (exercise). In addition, cholinergic urticaria typically results in wheals with a diameter less than 5 mm, whereas those associated with EIU are usually substantially larger (Figure 2) and evolution to anaphylaxis is more frequently observed.

FIGURE 2
Case study example of exercise‐induced urticaria in a recreationally active 24‐year‐old male footballer: (A) upper body; (B) lower back (wheal diameter > 5 mm).

Similar to EIAn, milder reactions have been described as food‐dependent exercise‐induced urticaria/angioedema. Other activity‐related urticaria sub‐types include (i) dermatographic urticaria occurring in response to shearing forces such as rubbing, (ii) cold or heat‐induced urticaria (most often observed in aquatic or winter‐based athletes), (iii) delayed pressure urticaria as a result of tightly fitted clothing or compression garments, (iv) vibratory urticaria which can occur in road‐cyclists, (v) solar urticaria precipitated by ultraviolet and/or visible light, and (vi) contact urticaria in response to a substance that predisposes a wheal reaction. Although several urticarial sub‐types may simultaneously co‐exist, there currently remain limited data concerning the prevalence of 'classical' EIU.

### Identification of inpatient allergic drug reactions using ICD-9-CM codes [^4cbcc10d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The study of allergic drug reactions has been limited because of challenges in identifying and confirming cases.

Objective

To determine the utility of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes for identifying inpatient allergic drug reactions and to compare findings with previous data in the emergency department.

Methods

By reviewing medical records of inpatients with ICD-9-CM codes and E codes suggestive of allergic drug reactions at a large urban academic medical center, we determined codes that yielded the most drug allergy cases and identified culprit drugs.

Results

In 2005 and 2010, 3337 and 5282 possible allergic drug reactions during hospitalization were identified and 1367 were reviewed. Allergic drug reactions were found in 409 (30.1%) of the reviewed charts, with 172 (29.7%) in 2005 and 237 (30.5%) in 2010. The codes that identified the highest percentage of true allergic drug reactions were dermatitis due to drug (693.0), allergic urticaria (708), angioneurotic edema (995.1), and anaphylaxis (995.0). Antibiotics were the most common cause (44.4%); however, multiple drug classes were often identified as likely culprit drugs.

Conclusion

Specific ICD-9-CM codes can identify patients with allergic drug reactions, with antibiotics accounting for almost half of true reactions. Most patients with codes 693.0, 995.1, 708, and 995.0 had allergic drug reactions, with 693.0 as the highest yield code. An aggregate of multiple specific codes consistently identifies a cohort of patients with confirmed allergic drug reactions.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^ac831ed3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) — definition, duration, epidemiology, and pathobiology: CU is defined as urticaria that has been continuously or intermittently present for at least 6 weeks, and the duration varies considerably, with physical urticarias tending to persist the longest, often for many years. The prevalence of CU in the general population has been estimated to range from 0.5% to 5%, and the incidence has been estimated at 1.4% per year. Some patients with CU might have both urticaria and angioedema, occurring simultaneously or separately. Pathogenically, the skin mast cell is the most important cell in patients with CU, and histamine is the predominant mediator, although other cells and mediators also play a key role; activation of the coagulation cascade, including increased prothrombin fragment F1+2 and D-dimer levels, has been described and might be a marker of CU with angioedema severity.

### Chronic urticaria [^f6b404ef]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Chronic urticaria has a spectrum of clinical presentations and causes. About 50% of patients with "idiopathic" disease have histamine-releasing autoantibodies in their blood. The term autoimmune urticaria is increasingly being accepted for this subgroup of patients, in whom immunosuppressive therapies may be appropriate if conventional approaches to management are unsuccessful. This article reviews the classification, causes, and management of chronic urticaria in light of recent advances in the understanding of its etiology.

Learning Objective

At the conclusion of this learning activity, participants should have up-to-date knowledge of the classification, assessment, and management of chronic urticaria and understand where the concept of autoimmune urticaria fits into existing frameworks.

### Global classification and coding of hypersensitivity diseases-an EAACI-WAO survey, strategic paper and review [^e7c2360a]. Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

Hypersensitivity diseases are not adequately coded in the International Coding of Diseases (ICD)-10 resulting in misclassification, leading to low visibility of these conditions and general accuracy of official statistics. To call attention to the inadequacy of the ICD-10 in relation to allergic and hypersensitivity diseases and to contribute to improvements to be made in the forthcoming revision of ICD, a web-based global survey of healthcare professionals' attitudes toward allergic disorders classification was proposed to the members of European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) (individuals) and World Allergy Organization (WAO) (representative responding on behalf of the national society), launched via internet and circulated for 6 week. As a result, we had 612 members of 144 countries from all six World Health Organization (WHO) global regions who answered the survey. ICD-10 is the most used classification worldwide, but it was not considered appropriate in clinical practice by the majority of participants. The majority indicated the EAACI-WAO classification as being easier and more accurate in the daily practice. They saw the need for a diagnostic system useful for nonallergists and endorsed the possibility of a global, cross-culturally applicable classification system of allergic disorders. This first and most broadly international survey ever conducted of health professionals' attitudes toward allergic disorders classification supports the need to update the current classifications of allergic diseases and can be useful to the WHO in improving the clinical utility of the classification and its global acceptability for the revised ICD-11.

### Urticaria [^62af33e0]. Allergy (2003). Low credibility.

Urticaria has been known as a disease since antiquity. However, in the last decades an increasing understanding of the mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis has shown the high heterogeneity of different urticaria subtypes. Clear distinction of the subtypes is required not only to choose the correct measures in diagnosis and management, but also to interpret the available data in research. The subtypes can be grouped into spontaneous urticaria, which includes acute urticaria and chronic urticaria, the physical urticarias, special types of urticaria including, e.g. contact urticaria, and diseases related to urticaria for historical reasons, e.g. urticaria pigmentosa. Most urticaria subtypes have a profound impact on the quality of life and effective treatment is thus required in case the diagnostic procedures do not reveal a cause which can be treated. Although, for symptomatic relief, nonsedating H1-antihistamines are the first choice in most subtypes of urticaria, double-blind controlled studies have shown that dosages required may exceed those recommended for other diseases, e.g. allergic rhinitis. Alternative treatments should be reserved for unresponsive patients.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^86be5f93]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Annotation 10 — History, physical examination, and basic laboratory tests in chronic urticaria: For patients with chronic urticaria (CU), history taking and physical examination should be performed, and consensus recommendations favor performance of limited laboratory testing to confirm or rule out an underlying condition, although no testing might also be appropriate based on patient circumstances; an extensive laboratory work-up, including skin testing to inhalants and foods, is of limited use and not recommended. If a physical urticaria/angioedema condition is suspected, this can be evaluated further with specific challenge tests, and the evaluation of physical urticarias might include some laboratory evaluation such as measurement for cryoglobulins in patients with cold urticaria. There is no correlation between the number of screening laboratory tests done and detection of an underlying diagnosis in patients whose presentation is consistent with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), and autoantibody-associated urticaria should be considered a subset of CIU.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Global trends in anaphylaxis epidemiology and clinical implications [^3e1ed078]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

The other important bias to consider is information bias, which relates to misclassification of data. At a broad level, large data sets depend on medical coding, which are prone to misclassification. This issue is further confounded by differences in the definition of anaphylaxis, and the extent to which any definition is used to determine the coding, as recently highlighted by Wang et al. It is not uncommon, particularly in the emergency setting, for mild allergic reactions to be coded as anaphylaxis, and vice versa. For example, 48% of anaphylactic reactions in an emergency department in New York State were not coded as anaphylaxis despite fulfilling diagnostic criteria. It is also possible that nonallergic anaphylaxis mimics such as chronic idiopathic urticaria and hereditary angioedema could be misclassified as anaphylaxis. This can impact interpretation; for example, the inclusion of more mild cases as anaphylaxis will skew the result of any intervention toward a more favorable outcome (potential channeling bias).

Identifying specific anaphylaxis triggers is important; however, this information is frequently not collected with existing coding systems. Many coded anaphylaxis reactions are labeled "trigger unspecified," which hampers the evaluation of risk factors for severe reactions and in assessing trends for specific triggers. For example, in an analysis of US data between 1999 and 2009, more than two-thirds of cases — hospitalizations and fatalities — were classified as "unspecified trigger."The new International Classification of Disease, Eleventh Revision codingshould improve this, although there may be initial difficulties in monitoring historical trends if different coding systems have to be integrated for analysis.

Caution is needed when interpreting mortality data: death certification is prone to miscoding (eg, cases of anaphylaxis may be miscoded as "severe asthma"). Most death certification follows World Allergy Organization guidelines, where one part gives the condition or sequence of conditions leading directly to death, a second section gives details of any associated conditions that contributed to the death, but are not part of the causal sequence. There have been examples of this resulting in gross overestimates in terms of fatalities due to allergy, if death certificates include allergy diagnoses even when they are not factors that contributed to the fatal outcome.

### British Association of Dermatologists guidelines for the management of people with chronic urticaria 2021 [^ddaed78d]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic urticaria, more specifically with respect to H1RAs, BAD 2022 guidelines recommend to increase the dose of second-generation H1RA by up to 4-fold the licensed dose in patients with chronic urticaria inadequately controlled by the standard licensed dose, provided it is tolerated and there is no caution or contraindication.

### The international EAACI / GA ² LEN / euroGuiDerm / APAAACI guideline for the definition, classification, diagnosis, and management of urticaria [^1acae8ca]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

This update and revision of the international guideline for urticaria was developed following the methods recommended by Cochrane and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group. It is a joint initiative of the Dermatology Section of the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA²LEN) and its Urticaria and Angioedema Centers of Reference and Excellence (UCAREs and ACAREs), the European Dermatology Forum (EDF; EuroGuiDerm), and the Asia Pacific Association of Allergy, Asthma and Clinical Immunology with the participation of 64 delegates of 50 national and international societies and from 31 countries. The consensus conference was held on 3 December 2020. This guideline was acknowledged and accepted by the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS). Urticaria is a frequent, mast cell-driven disease that presents with wheals, angioedema, or both. The lifetime prevalence for acute urticaria is approximately 20%. Chronic spontaneous or inducible urticaria is disabling, impairs quality of life, and affects performance at work and school. This updated version of the international guideline for urticaria covers the definition and classification of urticaria and outlines expert-guided and evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the different subtypes of urticaria.

### The epidemiology of chronic urticaria in cape town, south Africa: a review of two tertiary referral centers [^eab1aaae]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

There is a paucity of information on Chronic Urticaria (CU) in Africa and the global south. We have conducted a retrospective folder review of the Cape Town UCARE centre — the only one on the continent — and dermatology services of the only two tertiary hospitals in Cape Town, South Africa. All patients that were coded L50 (the ICD10 code for urticaria) were reviewed (see Figure S1) this study was approved by the University of Cape Town Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC 603/2023), and all patients provided informed consent for the use of photographs. This multicentre study is the largest cohort of Chronic Urticaria (CU) reported to date in Africa (n = 939) — and, despite limitations of missing data, it provides several valuable insights. The global prevalence of CU ranges from 1%–4.4%, with international tertiary dermatology and allergy clinics reporting CU prevalence rates of 1.3%–1.7%. In the Tygerberg Hospital Dermatology clinic, CU accounted for 0.6% of patients, while at Groote Schuur Hospital Allergy/Dermatology clinics, CU accounted for 1.8% of patients (see Figure S1). Our population is multiethnic, with 85.8% (806/939) having darker Fitzpatrick skin tones (III‐VI). Given the underrepresentation of darker skin tones in dermatology/allergy literature Figure 1 provides a collection of photographs showing morphologies of chronic urticaria against the background of darker skin. The CIndU group had a higher prevalence of Fitzpatrick I‐II (paler skin) while the angioedema without urticaria group had a high prevalence of Fitzpatrick V‐VI (darker skin tones) (p < 0.001) (see Table 1). Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU) without Chronic Inducible Urticaria (CIndU) was commonest (81% [761/939]), with 8.6% (81/939) having combined CSU/CIndU. Isolated CIndU was found in less than 5% (42/939), with heat and delayed pressure urticaria being the most common; symptomatic dermatographism (n = 19) and cholinergic urticarias (n = 9) were rare. Only 2.2% (21/939) had recurrent angioedema without urticaria.

### Collaboration between specialties for respiratory allergies in the international classification of diseases (ICD)-11 [^621bb5c6]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Many international initiatives have been launched to prevent and decrease the negative outcome of these conditions, which are considered a global health problem. However, international classification and coding systems such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) have grouped them under topographic distribution, regardless of the underlying mechanisms and triggers. This has led to the framework of both the 10th and draft 11th revisions of ICD (ICD-10 2010 version and ICD-11 beta draft as at May 2014 respectively) to be deficient in capturing the concepts currently in use for allergic and hypersensitivity conditions. These findings highlight the need for the major respiratory societies to be involved in updating the representation of allergic and hypersensitivity disorders involving the respiratory tract in the ongoing ICD-11 revision.

### Pathology and classification of urticaria [^672aa84e]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic urticaria is defined as daily or almost daily urticaria for more than 6 weeks. Chronic urticaria is normally subdivided into physical urticaria (wheals evoked by a physical stimulus such as pressure friction or cold contact) and spontaneous urticaria. A patient with a history of less than 6 weeks is traditionally designated as having acute urticaria. Patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria have an increased frequency of HLA-DR and HLA-DQ alleles characteristically associated with autoimmune disease. Some of these patients have functional anti-FceR1 and/or anti-IgE autoantibodies which are considered to be the cause of the urticaria.

### EAACI / GA (2) LEN / EDF / WAO guideline: definition, classification and diagnosis of urticaria [^8c0d7c17]. Allergy (2009). Low credibility.

This guideline, together with its sister guideline on the management of urticaria [Zuberbier T, Asero R, Bindslev-Jensen C, Canonica GW, Church MK, Giménez-Arnau AM et al. EAACI/GA(2)LEN/EDF/WAO Guideline: Management of urticaria. Allergy, 2009; 64:1427–1443] is the result of a consensus reached during a panel discussion at the 3rd International Consensus Meeting on Urticaria, Urticaria 2008, a joint initiative of the Dermatology Section of the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), the EU-funded network of excellence, the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network (GA(2)LEN), the European Dermatology Forum (EDF) and the World Allergy Organization (WAO). Urticaria is a frequent disease. The life-time prevalence for any subtype of urticaria is approximately 20%. Chronic spontaneous urticaria and other chronic forms of urticaria do not only cause a decrease in quality of life, but also affect performance at work and school and, as such, are members of the group of severe allergic diseases. This guideline covers the definition and classification of urticaria, taking into account the recent progress in identifying its causes, eliciting factors, and pathomechanisms. In addition, it outlines evidence-based diagnostic approaches for different subtypes of urticaria. The correct management of urticaria, which is of paramount importance for patients, is very complex and is consequently covered in a separate guideline developed during the same consensus meeting. This guideline was acknowledged and accepted by the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS).

### Patients with chronic urticaria have a higher risk of psychiatric disorders: a population-based study [^12628850]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities in patients with chronic urticaria (CU) in a national population is largely unknown.

Objectives

To investigate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and psychiatric medication use in patients with CU in Taiwan.

Methods

Data were sourced from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database for 2011. Patients who had a primary/secondary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis code of 708·1, 708·8 or 708·9 during 2011 with at least two outpatient visits and an antihistamine prescription were identified as CU cases. Patients with CU were classified into three disease severity groups according to their medication types. Psychiatric disorders were identified by patients having three outpatient visits with a primary or secondary diagnosis of a given psychiatric disease. Psychiatric medication use was defined by having at least four outpatient visits with prescriptions for anxiolytics, antidepressants or sleeping pills in 2010 or 2011.

Results

Of the 167 132 patients with CU, 82·5% had mild CU, 17·0% had moderate CU and 0·4% had severe CU. Patients with CU had a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders and psychiatric medication prescription than control groups. The relative risk (RR) of psychiatric disorders was 1·43 for patients with mild, 1·50 for patients with moderate and 2·32 for patients with severe CU vs. the controls (P < 0·001). For psychiatric medication prescription, the RRs were 1·95, 2·70 and 2·09, respectively, vs. controls (P < 0·001).

Conclusions

Patients with CU had a higher prevalence and risk of psychiatric disorders and psychiatric medication prescription than control groups. What's already known about this topic? Previous studies have shown a high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities in patients with chronic urticaria (CU), with rates ranging from 35% to 60%. Anxiety, depression and somatoform disorders have been reported as the most prevalent mental disorders in patients with CU. What does this study add? Patients with CU had a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders and psychiatric medication use than control groups in the general population. The relative risk (RR) of psychiatric disorders was 1·43 for those with mild CU, 1·50 for those with moderate CU and 2·32 for those with severe CU vs. controls. The RR for psychiatric medication use was 1·95 for those with mild CU, 2·70 for those with moderate CU and 2·09 for those with severe CU vs. controls. Mental health evaluations and management are important elements in CU management.
