## Question

What is the antibiotherapy and dosage for CAP in adult without co morbidities

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended antibiotics and dosing regimens for treating community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompetent adult outpatients without comorbidities, including alternatives, duration of therapy, stewardship, and monitoring considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the patient profile and care setting. Then, I should verify the guideline-endorsed first-line agents and exact dosing. Next, I will examine the role and constraints of macrolide monotherapy, including local resistance thresholds. After that, I need to consider patient-specific contraindications and allergies. I will then review duration and the principle of clinical stability. Finally, I should double-check special situations like viral coinfection, summarize options succinctly, and ensure stewardship alignment is explicit.

> Let me first confirm the target population and setting to anchor recommendations correctly. For adult outpatients with CAP who are immunocompetent and have no chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease, diabetes, alcoholism, malignancy, or asplenia, and who also lack risk factors for MRSA or Pseudomonas, guideline-concordant empiric therapy should be narrow-spectrum whenever feasible to support antimicrobial stewardship goals [^113g1GAS] [^111GyoZg] [^115TSttT].

> I need to verify the preferred first-line agent and dosing. The 2019 ATS/IDSA guideline strongly recommends high-dose amoxicillin as first choice: amoxicillin 1 g orally three times daily, with the FDA label concurring on a 1 g TID regimen and supporting a minimum of 5 days and continuation until clinical stability is achieved, which operationalizes the stability-guided duration principle from ATS/IDSA [^113g1GAS] [^112EaToB] [^11422hz5].

> Hold on, I should verify the evidence strength and why amoxicillin is favored. ATS/IDSA assigns a strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence to amoxicillin monotherapy for healthy outpatients, and although some authors have argued for more parsimonious, Access-category regimens as defaults, the guideline itself does elevate amoxicillin alongside doxycycline and conditionally allows macrolides in low-resistance settings, which reflects a stewardship-aware but evidence-driven stance [^113g1GAS] [^115ZzQTE] [^117Dmz7Y].

> Next, I should review doxycycline as a validated alternative. Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily is a conditional recommendation with low-quality evidence. It is appropriate when beta-lactams are unsuitable, though some experts load with 200 mg on day 1, which is reasonable though not mandated by the guideline text, so I should present it as optional rather than required [^113g1GAS] [^112EaToB] [^116R7qqa].

> Wait, let me verify macrolide monotherapy before recommending it. ATS/IDSA does not give a strong recommendation for routine macrolide monotherapy in the United States because macrolide resistance among pneumococci exceeds 30% nationally; macrolide monotherapy is only reasonable where local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is documented to be less than 25%, with dosing options including azithromycin 500 mg on day 1 then 250 mg daily, clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily, or clarithromycin extended-release 1,000 mg once daily, and I should confirm local antibiograms before choosing this route [^113g1GAS] [^115Q2y7p] [^116R7qqa].

> I should confirm how comorbidities shift therapy so I don't conflate this with the no-comorbidity group. Patients with comorbidities or higher risk generally warrant broader regimens such as amoxicillin/clavulanate combined with a macrolide or doxycycline, or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone; importantly, beta-lactam monotherapy is discouraged for inpatients with nonsevere CAP in favor of beta-lactam plus macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy, which underscores why amoxicillin monotherapy is reserved for low-risk outpatients [^117JT7za] [^117DLH1Y] [^111GyoZg].

> Let me think about duration next, and I should double-check that I tie it to clinical stability. The minimum duration is 5 days for most patients, with therapy continued until the patient achieves clinical stability, defined by resolution of abnormal vital signs and return of normal mentation and oral intake; this means total therapy may extend beyond 5 days if stability is not yet reached, whereas extension to 7 days is reserved for MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage scenarios rather than routine CAP without those risks [^11422hz5] [^112RuRoF].

> But wait, what if the patient has a true penicillin allergy. I need to ensure I specify the appropriate alternative. For severe beta-lactam allergy, doxycycline is a suitable choice, and in select settings with documented low macrolide resistance, a macrolide may be considered; if both macrolides and fluoroquinolones are contraindicated in more complex cases, beta-lactam plus doxycycline is an option, though that inpatient strategy does not directly map to the no-comorbidity outpatient cohort, so I should be careful not to overextend it [^1113jsxi] [^117KRFW6] [^113g1GAS].

> I will now examine viral coinfection considerations because I recall a shift in guidance. Initially, I thought standard antibacterial therapy should always be given to adults with CAP who test positive for influenza, and indeed ATS/IDSA recommends initial standard antibacterial therapy for adults with clinical and radiographic CAP who test positive for influenza, given the risk of bacterial coinfection, with consideration of earlier discontinuation at 48–72 hours if bacterial infection is excluded and the patient is clinically stable [^113tR9LR]. However, hold on, I should verify the most recent ATS guidance; the 2025 update advises against initiating empiric antibiotics in immunocompetent adult outpatients without comorbidities who have clinical and imaging evidence of CAP but test positive for a respiratory virus, emphasizing a stewardship approach with close follow-up, so I must reconcile this by noting that while 2019 supports initial antibacterial therapy in influenza-positive CAP, 2025 recommends avoiding empiric antibiotics in low-risk viral-positive outpatients, which can guide outpatient withholding when reliable follow-up is assured [^112S2QnK] [^1153KRfw] [^113tR9LR].

> Next, I should review how to monitor and adjust therapy. I need to ensure clinical stability is reassessed within 48–72 hours. If the patient is not improving as expected, I should reconsider the diagnosis, evaluate for complications or alternative pathogens, and, if appropriate, obtain sputum cultures to guide de-escalation or redirection of therapy, consistent with the broader microbiologic testing stance adopted in the 2019 guideline to curb unnecessary broad-spectrum use [^112nw1MB] [^115WEwym].

> Let me reconsider stewardship messaging to ensure the recommendation is actionable. Choosing amoxicillin 1 g TID for otherwise healthy outpatients aligns with Access-category stewardship priorities and minimizes collateral damage from broader agents, and while macrolides and fluoroquinolones remain options in defined contexts, their use should be judicious and grounded in local resistance data and patient-specific risk–benefit considerations rather than habit [^115ZzQTE] [^113g1GAS].

> Finally, I should double-check that I've integrated the dosing and duration cleanly. Recommended regimens for adult outpatients without comorbidities include amoxicillin 1 g orally three times daily as preferred, doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily as an alternative, and macrolide monotherapy only when local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is under 25%, with therapy continued for a minimum of 5 days and until clinical stability is achieved, extending to 7 days if MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage was indicated, which it should not be in this low-risk outpatient scenario [^113g1GAS] [^11422hz5] [^117GrKZi].

For adults with community-acquired pneumonia and no comorbidities, the recommended empiric antibiotic therapy is **amoxicillin 1 g orally three times daily** [^113g1GAS] or **doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily** [^116R7qqa]. A macrolide (azithromycin 500 mg on day 1, then 250 mg daily; clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily; or clarithromycin ER 1,000 mg daily) is an alternative only if local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is **< 25%** [^113g1GAS] [^115Q2y7p]. Treat for a minimum of 5 days, ensuring clinical stability for 48–72 hours before stopping [^11422hz5] [^112RuRoF].

---

## Recommended empiric antibiotic therapy

The **first-line options** are amoxicillin 1 g orally three times daily or doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily [^113g1GAS] [^116EUyQ5]. An **alternative** is a macrolide (azithromycin 500 mg on day 1, then 250 mg daily; clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily; or clarithromycin ER 1,000 mg daily) only if local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is **< 25%** [^113g1GAS] [^115Q2y7p].

---

## Dosage and duration of therapy

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Amoxicillin | 1 g orally three times daily | ≥ 5 days |
| Doxycycline | 100 mg orally twice daily | ≥ 5 days |
| Azithromycin | 500 mg on day 1, then 250 mg daily | ≥ 5 days |
| Clarithromycin | 500 mg twice daily | ≥ 5 days |
| Clarithromycin ER | 1,000 mg daily | ≥ 5 days |

---

Continue treatment for a minimum of 5 days, ensuring clinical stability for 48–72 hours before discontinuation [^11422hz5] [^112RuRoF].

---

## Clinical considerations

- **Clinical stability**: Ensure clinical stability (normalization of vital signs, ability to eat, normal mentation) before discontinuing therapy [^112RuRoF].

- **Adverse effects**: Monitor for gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and allergic reactions [^115xQSYv].

- **Patient education**: Emphasize adherence, potential side effects, and the importance of completing the full course of therapy [^114NCFtS].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: Amoxicillin 1 g orally three times daily or doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily [^113g1GAS] [^116EUyQ5].

- **Alternative therapy**: Macrolide (azithromycin, clarithromycin) only if local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is < 25% [^113g1GAS] [^115Q2y7p].

- **Duration**: Minimum of 5 days, ensuring clinical stability for 48–72 hours before discontinuation [^11422hz5] [^112RuRoF].

---

Amoxicillin or doxycycline are the **preferred empiric therapies** for adults with CAP and no comorbidities, with macrolides reserved for areas with low resistance. Therapy should continue for at least 5 days, with discontinuation only after clinical stability is achieved.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expenditure of resources. When followed, guidelines for CAP management have been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes; however, several issues are still open. This review summarizes the recent advances in this field and the priority needs for future research.

Recent Findings

Recently identified clinical and biochemical tools promise to improve the assessment of CAP severity; however, definition of the most accurate and feasible rule(s) for clinical practice is now necessary. Some empirical antimicrobial regimens are still being debated, such as the need for atypical pathogen coverage in home-treated and nonsevere hospitalized patients and the inclusion of respiratory fluoroquinolones among first-choice molecules. New drugs such as tigecycline and cethromycin appear promising. Pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin/clavulanate is highly effective, even for treating CAP caused by multiple-drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other aspects recently clarified include the inappropriateness of rigid time-to-first-antibiotic-dose rules, the advantages of shorter antibiotic treatments for nonsevere patients and the need of special clinical attention for acute myocardial infarction among patients with severe CAP or clinical failure.

Summary

Recent developments have significantly contributed to refine the management of CAP patients. However, various hot topics remain undefined as yet and urgently require ad-hoc research in order to optimize the outcomes and the costs of this highly social-impacting disease.

### Managing community-acquired pneumonia: a European perspective [^112DfDgG]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disease and a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It puts an enormous burden on medical and economic resources, particularly if hospitalization is required. Initial antibacterial therapy for CAP is usually empirical, as culture and antibacterial sensitivity test results are rarely available at initial diagnosis. Any agent selected for empirical therapy should have good activity against the pathogens commonly associated with CAP, a favorable tolerability profile, and be administered in a simple dosage regimen for good compliance. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common causative pathogen, although the incidence of this organism varies widely. Streptococcus pneumoniae strains with decreased susceptibility to penicillin have become increasingly prevalent over the past 30 years and are now a serious problem worldwide. In addition, an increase in the prevalence of pneumococci resistant to macrolides has been observed in Europe over recent years. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae are among the most common atypical pathogens isolated from patients with CAP. Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Moraxella catarrhalis are less commonly identified as causative organisms. The emergence and spread of resistance to commonly used antibiotics has challenged the management of CAP. Multiple sets of CAP guidelines have been published to address the continued changes in this complex disease.

### Managing CAP patients at risk of clinical failure [^115LsUQR]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a curable disease. Both the European and American clinical practice guidelines provide algorithms how to manage patients with CAP. However, as populations worldwide are ageing and bacteria are becoming multidrug resistant, it is necessary to address the major factors that put patients at risk of poor outcome. These may include age, comorbidities, the settings where pneumonia was acquired or treated, the need for hospitalisation or ICU admission, likely causative pathogen (bacteria or virus) in a certain region and their local susceptibility pattern. One complicating fact is the lack of definite causative pathogen in approximately 50% of patients making it difficult to choose the most appropriate antibiotic treatment. When risk factors are present simultaneously in patients, fewer treatment options could be rather challenging for physicians. For example, the presence of comorbidities (renal, cardiac, hepatic) may exclude certain antibiotics due to potential adverse events. Assessing the severity of the disease and monitoring biomarkers, however, could help physicians to estimate patient prognosis once diagnosis is confirmed and treatment has been initiated. This review article addresses the most important risk factors of poor outcome in CAP patients.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in adults: diagnosis and management [^112ENfbz]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a leading cause of death. Risk factors include older age and medical comorbidities. Diagnosis is suggested by a history of cough, dyspnea, pleuritic pain, or acute functional or cognitive decline, with abnormal vital signs (e.g., fever, tachycardia) and lung examination findings. Diagnosis should be confirmed by chest radiography or ultrasonography. Validated prediction scores for pneumonia severity can guide the decision between outpatient and inpatient therapy. Using procalcitonin as a biomarker for severe infection may further assist with risk stratification. Most outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia do not require microbiologic testing of sputum or blood and can be treated empirically with a macrolide, doxycycline, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Patients requiring hospitalization should be treated with a fluoroquinolone or a combination of beta-lactam plus macrolide antibiotics. Patients with severe infection requiring admission to the intensive care unit require dual antibiotic therapy including a third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide alone or in combination with a fluoroquinolone. Treatment options for patients with risk factors for Pseudomonas species include administration of an antipseudomonal antibiotic and an aminoglycoside, plus azithromycin or a fluoroquinolone. Patients with risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should be given vancomycin or linezolid, or ceftaroline in resistant cases. Administration of corticosteroids within 36 hours of hospital admission for patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia decreases the risk of adult respiratory distress syndrome and length of treatment. The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccinations are both recommended for adults 65 years and older to decrease the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia.

### What is the role of antimicrobial stewardship in improving outcomes of patients with CAP? [^111Z9J6W]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most common infectious diagnoses encountered in clinical practice and one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Adherence to antibiotic treatment guidelines is inconsistent and the erroneous diagnosis of CAP and misuse of antibiotics is prevalent in both inpatients and outpatients. This review summarizes interventions that may be promoted by antimicrobial stewardship programs to improve outcomes for patients with CAP.

### Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompromised adults: a consensus statement regarding initial strategies [^117F8r49]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines have improved the treatment and outcomes of patients with CAP, primarily by standardization of initial empirical therapy. But current society-published guidelines exclude immunocompromised patients.

Research Question

There is no consensus regarding the initial treatment of immunocompromised patients with suspected CAP.

Study Design and Methods

This consensus document was created by a multidisciplinary panel of 45 physicians with experience in the treatment of CAP in immunocompromised patients. The Delphi survey methodology was used to reach consensus.

Results

The panel focused on 21 questions addressing initial management strategies. The panel achieved consensus in defining the population, site of care, likely pathogens, microbiologic workup, general principles of empirical therapy, and empirical therapy for specific pathogens.

Interpretation

This document offers general suggestions for the initial treatment of the immunocompromised patient who arrives at the hospital with pneumonia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115WEwym]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adult community-acquired pneumonia — empiric therapy and cultures by risk strata — There is sufficient evidence that prior identification of MRSA or P. aeruginosa in the respiratory tract within the prior year predicts a very high risk, and therefore we see sufficient indications to recommend blood and sputum cultures and empiric therapy for these pathogens in patients with CAP in addition to coverage for standard CAP pathogens, with deescalation at 48 hours if cultures are negative. In patients with recent hospitalization and exposure to parenteral antibiotics, we recommend microbiological testing without empiric extended-spectrum therapy for treatment of nonsevere CAP and microbiological testing with extended-spectrum empiric therapy at admission to cover for treatment of severe CAP, with deescalation at 48 hours if cultures are negative and the patient is improving.

ATS/IDSA community-acquired pneumonia — Inpatient nonsevere CAP without risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa is treated empirically with either a β-lactam plus a macrolide (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence) or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). For adults with CAP who have contraindications to both macrolides and fluoroquinolones, a third option is a β-lactam plus doxycycline (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). The panel suggests that β-lactam monotherapy should not be routinely used for inpatients with CAP over fluoroquinolone monotherapy or β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy.

### Choosing antibiotic therapy for severe community-acquired pneumonia [^113HbCQx]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is known as a major worldwide health concern considering it has been shown to account for 78% of infection-related deaths in the USA. It is a common cause for hospitalization with a continued incidence rise in the elderly, high mortality rate and long-term sequelae in critically ill patients. Severe CAP (sCAP) is an accepted terminology used to describe ICU admitted patients with CAP. The aim of this review is to further report on the major advances in treatment for patients with sCAP including new antibiotic treatments despite macrolide resistance as seen in the ICU, and multifaceted antibiotic stewardship interventions that may lead to the reduction broad-spectrum antibiotic use in CAP.

Recent Findings

We aim to examine the most recent findings in order to determine appropriate empirical antibiotic choices, timing regimens and evidence for clinical effectiveness. This will be addressed by focusing on the use combination therapies, the usefulness of severity scores and the difficulty to treat multidrug-resistant pathogens, including gram negatives such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Relevant reports referenced within included randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, observational studies, systematic reviews and international guidelines where applicable.

Summary

New antibiotics have been recently launched with direct agent-specific properties that have been shown to avoid the overuse of previous broad-spectrum antibiotics when treating patients sCAP. Although narrow-spectrum antibiotics are now recommended and imperative in improving a patients' prognosis, there are also some considerations when prescribing antibiotics that are beyond the spectrum. There is a need to implement effective policies of de-escalation to avoid antibiotic resistance and the risk for developing subsequent infections by combining informed clinical judgement and the application of biomarkers. Reaching clinical stability and avoidance of treatment failure are the most important pillars in treatment success.

### Factors associated with treatment failure in moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^117XVXpo]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the risk factors for treatment failure in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who reached clinical stability after 3 days of β-lactam treatment?

Findings

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial that included 291 adults, only male sex and age were associated with failure in the multivariable analysis. These results were independent of antibiotic treatment duration and biomarker levels.

Meaning

In this study, among patients with CAP who reached clinical stability after 3 days of antibiotic treatment, male sex and age were associated with higher risk of failure, suggesting that these factors should be taken in account in the treatment of patients with the condition.

### Antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia in adult outpatients [^115xQSYv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is the third leading cause of death worldwide and the first leading cause of death in low-income countries. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common condition that causes a significant disease burden for the community, particularly in children younger than five years, the elderly and immunocompromised people. Antibiotics are the standard treatment for CAP. However, increasing antibiotic use is associated with the development of bacterial resistance and side effects for the patient. Several studies have been published regarding optimal antibiotic treatment for CAP but many of these data address treatments in hospitalised patients. This is an update of our 2009 Cochrane Review and addresses antibiotic therapies for CAP in outpatient settings.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of different antibiotic treatments for CAP in participants older than 12 years treated in outpatient settings with respect to clinical, radiological and bacteriological outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 3, 2014), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2014), CINAHL (2009 to March 2014), Web of Science (2009 to March 2014) and LILACS (2009 to March 2014).

Selection Criteria

We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), fully published in peer-reviewed journals, of antibiotics versus placebo as well as antibiotics versus another antibiotic for the treatment of CAP in outpatient settings in participants older than 12 years of age. However, we did not find any studies of antibiotics versus placebo. Therefore, this review includes RCTs of one or more antibiotics, which report the diagnostic criteria and describe the clinical outcomes considered for inclusion in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (LMB, TJMV) independently assessed study reports in the first publication. In the 2009 update, LMB performed study selection, which was checked by TJMV and MMK. In this 2014 update, two review authors (SP, SM) independently performed and checked study selection. We contacted trial authors to resolve any ambiguities in the study reports. We compiled and analysed the data. We resolved differences between review authors by discussion and consensus.

Main Results

We included 11 RCTs in this review update (3352 participants older than 12 years with a diagnosis of CAP); 10 RCTs assessed nine antibiotic pairs (3321 participants) and one RCT assessed four antibiotics (31 participants) in people with CAP. The study quality was generally good, with some differences in the extent of the reporting. A variety of clinical, bacteriological and adverse events were reported. Overall, there was no significant difference in the efficacy of the various antibiotics. Studies evaluating clarithromycin and amoxicillin provided only descriptive data regarding the primary outcome. Though the majority of adverse events were similar between all antibiotics, nemonoxacin demonstrated higher gastrointestinal and nervous system adverse events when compared to levofloxacin, while cethromycin demonstrated significantly more nervous system side effects, especially dysgeusia, when compared to clarithromycin. Similarly, high-dose amoxicillin (1 g three times a day) was associated with higher incidence of gastritis and diarrhoea compared to clarithromycin, azithromycin and levofloxacin.

Authors' Conclusions

Available evidence from recent RCTs is insufficient to make new evidence-based recommendations for the choice of antibiotic to be used for the treatment of CAP in outpatient settings. Pooling of study data was limited by the very low number of studies assessing the same antibiotic pairs. Individual study results do not reveal significant differences in efficacy between various antibiotics and antibiotic groups. However, two studies did find significantly more adverse events with use of cethromycin as compared to clarithromycin and nemonoxacin when compared to levofloxacin. Multi-drug comparisons using similar administration schedules are needed to provide the evidence necessary for practice recommendations. Further studies focusing on diagnosis, management, cost-effectiveness and misuse of antibiotics in CAP and LRTI are warranted in high-, middle- and low-income countries.

### Viewing the community-acquired pneumonia guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship lens [^116NEoCU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

We read with interest the article titled "Diagnosis and Treatment of Adults with Community-acquired Pneumonia. An Official Clinical Practice Guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America". We congratulate the authors on their comprehensive review of the evidence. Although we understand that they are limited in their ability to establish recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system process, we believe it would be helpful for the practicing clinician to understand how to interpret the guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship (AS) lens. Below, we discuss three AS-guided recommendations that should be considered when interpreting the community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines.

### Diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^112ZbpHr]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is diagnosed by clinical features (e.g., cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain) and by lung imaging, usually an infiltrate seen on chest radiography. Initial evaluation should determine the need for hospitalization versus outpatient management using validated mortality or severity prediction scores. Selected diagnostic laboratory testing, such as sputum and blood cultures, is indicated for inpatients with severe illness but is rarely useful for outpatients. Initial outpatient therapy should include a macrolide or doxycycline. For outpatients with comorbidities or who have used antibiotics within the previous three months, a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, gemifloxacin, or moxifloxacin), or an oral beta-lactam antibiotic plus a macrolide should be used. Inpatients not admitted to an intensive care unit should receive a respiratory fluoroquinolone, or a beta-lactam antibiotic plus a macrolide. Patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia or who are admitted to the intensive care unit should be treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic, plus azithromycin or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Those with risk factors for Pseudomonas should be treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic (piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem, doripenem, or cefepime), plus an aminoglycoside and azithromycin or an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin). Those with risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should be given vancomycin or linezolid. Hospitalized patients may be switched from intravenous to oral antibiotics after they have clinical improvement and are able to tolerate oral medications, typically in the first three days. Adherence to the Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia has been shown to improve patient outcomes. Physicians should promote pneumococcal and influenza vaccination as a means to prevent community-acquired pneumonia and pneumococcal bacteremia.

### Principles of antibiotic treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in the outpatient setting [^115H89mJ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common illness with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Nearly 80% of the treatment for this condition is provided in the outpatient setting. Among the etiologic agents associated with bacterial CAP, the predominant pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Treatment of CAP for the most part is empirical; therefore, any antibiotic treatment should cover both typical and atypical pathogens. The beta-lactams have historically been considered standard therapy for the treatment of CAP. However, the impact of rising resistance rates is now a primary concern facing physicians. For patients with comorbidities or recent antibiotic therapy, current guidelines recommend either combination therapy with a beta-lactam and a macrolide or an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone alone. Fluoroquinolones are broad-spectrum antibiotics that exhibit high levels of penetration into the lungs and low levels of resistance. Evidence from clinical trials indicates clinical success rates of > 90% for moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and levofloxacin in the treatment of CAP due to S pneumoniae. Data from comparative clinical trials suggest fluoroquinolone monotherapy is as efficacious as beta-lactam-macrolide combination therapy in the treatment of CAP patients. The respiratory fluoroquinolone levofloxacin has also been shown to be effective in CAP patients for the treatment of macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae. The use of azithromycin, telithromycin, and fluoroquinolones in short-course regimens has been shown to be efficacious, safe, and tolerable in patients with CAP. Based on clinical evidence, high-dose, short-course therapies may represent a significant advance in the management of CAP.

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^111wTGxs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved because of changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

### New guidelines for the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia [^117D5zA2]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease. International societies have published and revised guidelines aiming to improve the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia, based on the best available evidence. The aim of this review is to compare the current guideline recommendations.

Recent Findings

Aspects of guidelines differ based on local factors including resources and antimicrobial factors, as well as the differences in interpretation of existing evidence.

Summary

The lack of robust evidence behind aspects of guideline recommendations as well as the lack of adherence to published guidelines both need to be addressed if the management of community-acquired pneumonia is to be improved.

Outpatient community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) without comorbidities — initial antibiotic choices and macrolide use: For patients without comorbidities, the panel recommended amoxicillin 1 g every 8 hours or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily; some experts recommend that the first dose of oral doxycycline be 200 mg. In a departure from prior CAP guidelines, the panel did not give a strong recommendation for routine use of a macrolide antibiotic as monotherapy for outpatient CAP, citing a macrolide resistance rate of > 30% among S. pneumoniae isolates in the United States; however, in settings where macrolide resistance is documented to be low and there are contraindications to alternative therapies, a macrolide as monotherapy is a treatment option.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — key changes versus 2007 — state that sputum culture is "Now recommended in patients with severe disease as well as in all inpatients empirically treated for MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa", and blood culture is "Now recommended in patients with severe disease as well as in all inpatients empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa". Macrolide monotherapy carries a "Conditional recommendation for outpatients based on resistance levels". Use of procalcitonin is "Not recommended to determine need for initial antibacterial therapy", and corticosteroids are "Recommended not to use. May be considered in patients with refractory septic shock". The healthcare-associated pneumonia category has a directive to "Recommend abandoning this categorization. Emphasis on local epidemiology and validated risk factors to determine need for MRSA or P. aeruginosa coverage. Increased emphasis on deescalation of treatment if cultures are negative". For standard empiric therapy for severe CAP, "Both accepted but stronger evidence in favor of β-lactam/macrolide combination", and follow-up chest imaging is "Recommended not to obtain. Patients may be eligible for lung cancer screening, which should be performed as clinically indicated".

### Community-acquired pneumonia: the evolving challenge [^11314Sjb]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2001). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that has been the focus of a major international research effort to define its epidemiology, etiology and management. The microbial etiology of CAP is complex and severity assessment is important in identifying at-risk populations as well as defining therapeutic strategies. Laboratory investigations rarely influence initial therapy, which remains empirical. Guidelines have been developed in many countries in response to the need to optimize management and outcomes. However, many of these guidelines have been based on expert opinion rather than robust evidence. New evidence-based guidelines have been developed that take into account disease severity, the local distribution of pathogens and their likely susceptibility to antimicrobials, and that include newer treatment options. Macrolide and fluoroquinolone antimicrobials feature heavily in these new treatment recommendations. Promising new therapies continue to emerge that may offer advantages over fluoroquinolones and macrolides, in particular with regard to the problem of resistance. Of these, the ketolides are of special interest. Telithromycin, the first ketolide antibacterial, has been evaluated in the treatment of > 700 patients with CAP. A once-daily oral dose of telithromycin 800 mg for 7–10 days produces clinical and bacteriological success rates > 90% and equivalent to standard comparator agents, whilst maintaining efficacy against resistant pathogens.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in adults: rapid evidence review [^117Kgrtr]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common condition with a hospitalization rate of about 2% in people 65 years or older and is associated with a 30-day mortality rate of 6% in hospitalized patients. In studies conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic, a bacterial pathogen was identified in 11% of patients, a viral pathogen in 23% of patients, and no organism in 62% of patients. Certain signs and symptoms can be helpful in diagnosing CAP and selecting imaging studies. Diagnosis is usually made with a combination of history, physical examination, and findings on chest radiography, lung ultrasonography, or computed tomography. Procalcitonin measurement is not recommended. CRB-65 (confusion, respiratory rate, blood pressure, 65 years of age) is a well-validated risk stratification tool in the primary care setting and does not require laboratory testing. For outpatients without comorbidities, treatment with amoxicillin, doxycycline, or a macrolide is recommended (the latter only in areas where pneumococcal resistance to macrolides is less than 25%). In outpatients with comorbidities and inpatients with nonsevere pneumonia, a combination of a beta-lactam or third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide, or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone is recommended. Patients should be treated for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas infection only if they present with risk factors for those pathogens. All adults 65 years or older or those 19 to 64 with underlying conditions should receive the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine alone or the 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine followed by 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine one year later. The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is no longer recommended for routine administration. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends vaccination against influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses for all adults.

### Reply to huttner: 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^117Dmz7Y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

From the Authors:

We appreciate this additional letter submitted in response to the recently published guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults.

Huttner and colleagues emphasize the importance of antimicrobial stewardship principles in shaping antibiotic treatment guidelines. We strongly agree. The adult CAP guideline emphasizes that when multiple options are presented the final antibiotic choice should be influenced by local and individual patient factors. We also emphasized the importance of deescalating antibiotics when appropriate and limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy. However, our highest priority was to assure that adequate empiric treatment is provided, especially for patients with more severe CAP. We did recommend amoxicillin as monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, but the recommendation for expanded antibiotic therapy for outpatients with comorbidities reflected the need to cover for a broader range of potential pathogens. These outpatients represent a group that has not been clearly shown to be safely treated with β-lactam monotherapy. Ceftaroline was included as an option for treatment of inpatients with CAP given the available high-grade evidence (cited by Huttner and colleagues) that it is at least equivalent if not superior to ceftriaxone without evidence of an increased adverse event profile.

Finally, although we acknowledge that antimicrobial stewardship is relevant for all antibiotic prescribing decisions, it is important to highlight that, in a recent analysis of all outpatient antibiotic prescribing in the United States, pneumonia was only the 14th most common diagnosis, accounting for a small percentage of all antibiotics prescribed. For antimicrobial stewardship to actually impact the individual and population risks of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, including the risks attributed to respiratory fluoroquinolones, more gains will be achieved by focusing on treatment strategies for upper respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal infections.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians is a revision of the 2009 "Clinical Policy: Critical Issues in the Management of Adult Patients Presenting to the Emergency Department With Community-Acquired Pneumonia". A writing subcommittee conducted a systematic review of the literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to answer the following clinical questions: (1) In the adult emergency department patient diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, what clinical decision aids can inform the determination of patient disposition? (2) In the adult emergency department patient with community-acquired pneumonia, what biomarkers can be used to direct initial antimicrobial therapy? (3) In the adult emergency department patient diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, does a single dose of parenteral antibiotics in the emergency department followed by oral treatment versus oral treatment alone improve outcomes? Evidence was graded and recommendations were made based on the strength of the available data.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^114NCFtS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 6 in 10 adults have one chronic disease, and 4 in 10 adults have two or more chronic diseases, so the recommendation for amoxicillin will be applicable to a minority of adults with CAP. Therefore, U.S. physicians will most likely continue to treat many patients with the Watch group respiratory fluoroquinolones, a class of antibiotics with a well-documented propensity to favor the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance and Clostridioides difficile infections, as well as an increased risk of adverse events (U.S. Food and Drug Administration alert).

This will hamper the CDC's efforts to reduce overall antibiotic consumption and fluoroquinolone use in the United States. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee also suggested that guidelines should include recommendations to educate patients about antibiotic therapy when appropriate. Accordingly, the developers of the CAP guidelines could have considered providing guidance to physicians regarding the use of Access group antibiotics such as amoxicillin and doxycycline in select patients with stable comorbid conditions, along with close monitoring and adequate patient education.

Even more surprising is the listing of the Reserve group fifth-generation cephalosporin ceftaroline as a first-choice empiric treatment option for CAP (in combination with a macrolide) in hospitalized adults without risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Efficacy data from phase III trials suggesting that ceftaroline is superior to ceftriaxone with regard to clinical cure require further scrutiny, and its current listing as a first-choice option violates basic antibiotic stewardship considerations.

Given that respiratory tract infections are one of the most frequent reasons for antibiotic prescriptions worldwide, and that in many countries the U.S. treatment recommendations are still considered an important reference, it seems to us, as members of the WHO EML Antibiotics Working Group, that this represents a lost opportunity for antibiotic stewardship. We believe there is a clear need to better align all treatment guidelines to the same guiding principles, and to establish a global set of evidence-based recommendations with a focus on enhancing the use of Access group antibiotics.

### Management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^115WQTJY]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Despite many advances in medical science, the mortality rate from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has changed little in the past four decades. Death and adverse outcomes from CAP result from a complex interplay between the pathogen and the host. Newer information about the effect of pneumonia on comorbidity and underlying diseases, especially long term, suggests this is an important additional axis that differs from the traditional triangular concept of pathogen, host defense, and antibiotic treatment. A number of clinical scoring systems have been developed to help physicians identify patients with CAP at risk of adverse outcomes. None of the criteria have been prospectively demonstrated to avoid late intensive care unit transfers or lower mortality, raising interest in the use of biomarkers such as procalcitonin. Quantitative bacterial genomic load represents a potentially important risk stratification. Optimal antibiotic management appears to include use of a macrolide, although the mechanism of benefit remains unclear. Attempts to improve CAP outcomes through setting measurable process of care standards are to be applauded, but making sure that these standards do not become the end in themselves, but rather that the entire process of care is improved, remains critical.

### Short-course versus long-course therapy of the same antibiotic for community-acquired pneumonia in adolescent and adult outpatients [^116JyveS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a lung infection that can be acquired during day-to-day activities in the community (not while receiving care in a hospital). Community-acquired pneumonia poses a significant public health burden in terms of mortality, morbidity, and costs. Shorter antibiotic courses for CAP may limit treatment costs and adverse effects, but the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment is uncertain.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of short-course versus longer-course treatment with the same antibiotic at the same daily dosage for CAP in non-hospitalised adolescents and adults (outpatients). We planned to investigate non-inferiority of short-course versus longer-term course treatment for efficacy outcomes, and superiority of short-course treatment for safety outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, Embase, five other databases, and three trials registers on 28 September 2017 together with conference proceedings, reference checking, and contact with experts and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing short- and long-courses of the same antibiotic for CAP in adolescent and adult outpatients.

Data Collection and Analysis

We planned to use standard Cochrane methods.

Main Results

Our searches identified 5260 records. We did not identify any RCTs that compared short- and longer-courses of the same antibiotic for the treatment of adolescents and adult outpatients with CAP. We excluded two RCTs that compared short courses (five compared to seven days) of the same antibiotic at the same daily dose because they evaluated antibiotics (gemifloxacin and telithromycin) not commonly used in practice for the treatment of CAP. In particular, gemifloxacin is no longer approved for the treatment of mild-to-moderate CAP due to its questionable risk-benefit balance, and reported adverse effects. Moreover, the safety profile of telithromycin is also cause for concern. We found one ongoing study that we will assess for inclusion in future updates of the review.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no eligible RCTs that studied a short-course of antibiotic compared to a longer-course (with the same antibiotic at the same daily dosage) for CAP in adolescent and adult outpatients. The effects of antibiotic therapy duration for CAP in adolescent and adult outpatients remains unclear.

### How would you treat this patient hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^111p1VTX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, leading to 1.5 million hospitalizations and at least 200 000 deaths annually. The 2019 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia provides an evidence-based overview of this common illness. Here, 2 experts, a general internist who served as the co-primary author of the guidelines and a pulmonary and critical care physician, debate the management of a patient hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. They discuss disease severity stratification methods, whether to use adjunctive corticosteroids, and when to prescribe empirical treatment for multidrug-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians focuses on critical issues concerning the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED)with community-acquired pneumonia. It is an update of the 2001 clinical policy for the management and risk stratification of adult patients presenting to the ED with community-acquired pneumonia. A subcommittee reviewed the current literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to help answer the following questions: (1) Are routine blood cultures indicated in patients admitted with community-acquired pneumonia? (2) In adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia without severe sepsis, is there a benefit in mortality or morbidity from the administration of antibiotics within aspecific time course? The evidence was graded and recommendations were given based on the strength of evidence.

### Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in an ambulatory setting [^113aEzsS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and advances in critical care. Frequently, the diagnosis is confounded by coexisting cardiac or pulmonary conditions. Recognition of patients at risk for complications from pneumonia is critical when making the decision of how and where to treat. This review summarizes the diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia with oral antibiotics in an outpatient setting. Specific pathogens and clinical presentations in certain at-risk populations are highlighted. Also presented are validated algorithms for evaluating and identifying patients who may be at risk for serious complications of pneumonia and require treatment in an inpatient setting.

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who are improving — duration of therapy guided by clinical stability. We recommend that the duration of antibiotic therapy should be guided by a validated measure of clinical stability (resolution of vital sign abnormalities [heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and temperature], ability to eat, and normal mentation), and antibiotic therapy should be continued until the patient achieves stability and for no less than a total of 5 days (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In randomized trials, no difference was observed between 5 additional days of oral amoxicillin compared with placebo after 3 days of intravenous amoxicillin, or between 2 days of intravenous cefuroxime followed by 5 days versus 8 days of oral cefuroxime; similar results were obtained with 5 days of levofloxacin 750 mg daily compared with 10 days of levofloxacin 500 mg daily and 5 days of intravenous ceftriaxone compared with 10 days. Failure to achieve clinical stability within 5 days is associated with higher mortality and worse clinical outcomes, and serial procalcitonin measurement is therefore likely to be useful primarily in settings where the average length of stay for patients with CAP exceeds normal practice (e.g., 5–7 d).

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who test positive for influenza — initial antibacterial therapy and potential early discontinuation. We recommend that standard antibacterial treatment be initially prescribed for adults with clinical and radiographic evidence of CAP who test positive for influenza in the inpatient and outpatient settings (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Bacterial pneumonia can occur concurrently with influenza virus infection or present later as a worsening of symptoms in patients who were recovering from their primary influenza virus infection. However in patients with CAP, a positive influenza test, no evidence of a bacterial pathogen (including a low procalcitonin level), and early clinical stability, consideration could be given to earlier discontinuation of antibiotic treatment at 48 to 72 hours; randomized controlled studies are needed to establish whether antibacterial therapy can be stopped at 48 hours in such patients.

### Improving outcomes in community-acquired pneumonia [^115T3ckC]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a pervasive disease that is encountered in outpatient and inpatient settings. CAP is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease and accounts for significant worldwide morbidity and mortality. This update reviews current advances that can be used to promote improved outcomes in CAP.

Recent Findings

Early recognition of CAP and its severe presentations, with appropriate site of care decisions, leads to reduced patient mortality. In addition to traditional prognostic tools, certain serum biomarkers can assist in defining disease severity and guide treatment and management strategies. The use of macrolides as part of combination antibiotic therapy has shown beneficial mortality effects across the CAP disease spectrum, especially for those with severe illness. When treating community-associated, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, use of an antitoxin antibiotic is likely to be valuable. Adjunctive therapy with corticosteroids may prevent delayed clinical resolution in selected patients with severe CAP. Recent data expand on the interaction of CAP with comorbid disease, particularly cardiovascular disease, and its impact on mortality in CAP patients.

Summary

Improved diagnostic tools, optimized treatment regimens, and enhanced understanding of CAP-induced perturbations in comorbid disease states hold promise to improve patient outcomes.

### Clinical efficacy of newer agents in short-duration therapy for community-acquired pneumonia [^111prQpn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most important respiratory tract pathogen implicated in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), is becoming increasingly resistant in vitro to the beta -lactams and macrolides, and fluoroquinolone resistance has been detected. A growing body of evidence suggests that prolonged antimicrobial use may contribute directly and indirectly to increased antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Long-term exposure to antimicrobial agents, especially less-potent agents, directly increases selection pressure for resistance. Indirectly, poor patient compliance, multiple daily dosing, and the increased risk of adverse events further complicate the resistance issue and diminish the efficacy of long-term antimicrobial use. Controlled clinical trials addressing the appropriate duration of therapy for CAP are lacking. However, available data suggest that with appropriate antibiotic selection, based on appropriate spectrum, potency, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, lower respiratory tract infections in outpatients can be successfully treated in < 7 days rather than the 7–14 days currently recommended.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) without severe sepsis in the emergency department — antibiotic timing: Patient Management Recommendations state "Level A recommendations. None specified", "Level B recommendations. There is insufficient evidence to establish a benefit in mortality or morbidity from antibiotics administered in less than 4, 6, or 8 hours from ED arrival", and "Level C recommendations. Administer antibiotics as soon as feasible once the diagnosis of CAP is established; there is insufficient evidence to establish a benefit in morbidity or mortality from antibiotics administered within any specific time course". National guidance notes "for patients admitted through the ED, the first antibiotic dose should be administered while [the patient is] still in the ED". Evidence cited includes a retrospective multicenter Class III study of "13,771 Medicare patients" "older than 65 years", where antibiotics "administered within 4 hours" were associated with "a decreased 30-day mortality, with an OR of 0.85 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.95)". However, "Other cutoff times from 3 to 8 hours were associated with similar 30-day mortality", "adjusted ORs of the 4- and 8-hour cutoffs were identical", and "patients who received antibiotics between 0 and 2 hours did not have any significant mortality reduction". A prospective Class II study "confirmed the aforementioned association between time to first antibiotic dose less than 4 hours and mortality" in "patients older than 18 years".

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^114cq6uM]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is not usually considered a high-priority problem by the public, although it is responsible for substantial mortality, with a third of patients dying within 1 year after being discharged from hospital for pneumoniae. Although up to 18% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia who were hospitalised (admitted to hospital and treated there) have at least one risk factor for immunosuppression worldwide, strong evidence on community-acquired pneumonia management in this population is scarce. Several features of clinical management for community-acquired pneumonia should be addressed to reduce mortality, morbidity, and complications related to community-acquired pneumonia in patients who are immunocompetent and patients who are immunocompromised. These features include rapid diagnosis, microbiological investigation, prevention and management of complications (eg, respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiorgan failure), empirical antibiotic therapy in accordance with patient's risk factors and local microbiological epidemiology, individualised antibiotic therapy according to microbiological data, appropriate outcomes for therapeutic switch from parenteral to oral antibiotics, discharge planning, and long-term follow-up. This Seminar offers an updated view on community-acquired pneumonia in adults, with suggestions for clinical and translational research.

### Antibiotic therapy for adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review [^116oDx2e]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Antibiotic therapy is the cornerstone of medical management for community-acquired pneumonia.

Objective

To assess the associations between 3 key aspects of antibiotic therapy (optimal time to antibiotic initiation, initial antibiotic selection, and criteria for the transition from intravenous to oral therapy) and short-term mortality in adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia.

Evidence Review

Bibliographic databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Collaboration were searched for studies of adults hospitalized with radiographically confirmed community-acquired pneumonia published from January 1, 1995, until November 5, 2015.

Findings

Twenty studies (17 observational and 3 randomized trials) met eligibility criteria. Among 8 observational studies identified, the 4 largest (study populations of 2878 to 1,170,022) found that antibiotic initiation within 4 to 8 hours of hospital arrival was associated with relative reductions of 5% to 43% in mortality; the 4 smallest studies (study populations of 451 to 2076) found no associations between the timing of antibiotic initiation and mortality. One cluster randomized trial (n = 1737) demonstrated noninferiority of β-lactam monotherapy (n = 506) vs β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy (n = 566), with an absolute adjusted difference of 2.5% (90% CI, -0.6% to 5.2%) in 90-day mortality favoring β-lactam monotherapy. A second randomized trial (n = 580) failed to demonstrate noninferiority of β-lactam monotherapy vs β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy, with an absolute difference of 7.6% (1-sided 90% CI upper limit, 13.0%) in attainment of clinical stability on hospital day 7 favoring β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy. Six of 8 observational studies (study populations of 1188 to 24,780) found that β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy was associated with relative reductions of 26% to 68% in short-term mortality and all 3 observational studies (study populations of 2068 to 24,780) reported that fluoroquinolone monotherapy was associated with relative reductions of 30% to 43% in mortality compared with β-lactam monotherapy. One randomized trial (n = 302) reported significantly reduced hospital length of stay (absolute difference, 1.9 days; 95% CI, 0.6 to 3.2 days), but no differences in treatment failure when objective clinical criteria were used to decide when to transition patients from intravenous to oral therapy.

Conclusions and Relevance

In adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia, antibiotic therapy consisting of β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy or fluoroquinolone monotherapy initiated within 4 to 8 hours of hospital arrival was associated with lower adjusted short-term mortality, supported predominantly by low-quality observational studies. One randomized trial supports the use of objective clinical criteria to guide the transition from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults — microbiologic testing stance and sampling strategy: Microbiological testing has yet to deliver fast, accurate, and affordable testing with proven benefit, with exceptions including rapid testing for MRSA and influenza; this guideline significantly increases the proportion of patients in whom we recommend routinely obtaining respiratory tract samples for microbiologic studies, a change largely aimed at correcting overuse of anti-MRSA and antipseudomonal therapy since the introduction of the HCAP classification (which we recommend abandoning) rather than based on high-quality evidence, and clinicians must validate any empiric approach based on local spectrum and frequency of resistant pathogens.

The panel addressed 16 specific areas spanning diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions, formulating recommendations and rationale on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult CAP. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. The contents highlight early diagnostic questions for adults with CAP, including whether Gram stain and culture of lower respiratory secretions or blood cultures should be obtained at the time of diagnosis, and also list a third question beginning "Question 3: In Adults with CAP, Should Legionella and".

### Guidelines for empiric antimicrobial prescribing in community-acquired pneumonia [^116DFxue]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Empiric antimicrobial prescribing for community-acquired pneumonia remains a challenge, despite the availability of treatment guidelines. A number of key differences exist between North American and European guidelines, mainly in the outpatient setting. The North American approach is to use initial antimicrobial therapy, which provides coverage for Streptococcus pneumoniae plus atypical pathogens. Europeans tend to focus on providing pneumococcal coverage with less emphasis on covering for an atypical pathogen. Ambulatory patients without comorbidity are more likely to receive macrolide therapy in North America, whereas in Europe these patients would probably receive a beta-lactam agent. Major issues that are fundamental to this difference include the importance of providing therapy for atypical pathogens and the clinical significance of macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae. Prospective data are required to evaluate which of these two approaches offers clinical superiority.

Although most patients with suspected CAP respond to empiric therapy, a small number of patients do not respond in the expected fashion. Age and underlying comorbid conditions have a strong influence on the course of illness. Less common causes of treatment failures include overwhelming infection, antimicrobial resistance, and misdiagnosis. It is a common practice for empiric antimicrobial treatment of CAP to be initiated without microbiologic studies. Clinicians carefully should observe these patients for unusual or slow responses and should be ready to pursue a more extensive search for the cause of treatment failure.

### The role of new therapies for severe community-acquired pneumonia [^115iwg2w]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the most common cause of death from infectious diseases. CAP patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission carry the highest mortality rates. This paper aims to review the current literature regarding epidemiology, risk factors, severity criteria and reasons for admitting the hospitalized patient to the ICU, and the empiric and specific antibiotic therapeutic regimens employed.

Recent Findings

Multiple sets of clinical practice guidelines have been published in the past few years addressing the treatment of CAP. The guidelines all agree that CAP patients admitted to the hospital represent a major concern, and appropriate empiric therapy should be instituted to improve clinical outcomes.

Summary

The cost, morbidity and mortality of CAP patients requiring ICU admission remain unacceptably high. These are heterogeneous groups of patients, so it is important to use risk-stratification based on clinical parameters and prediction tools. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is an important component in the management of both groups of patients. In particular, it is essential to administer an appropriate antimicrobial agent from the initiation of therapy, so that the risks of treatment failure and the morbidity of CAP may be minimized.

The guideline centers on patients in the United States without recent foreign travel and on adults without an immunocompromising condition, including those actively receiving cancer chemotherapy, patients infected with HIV with suppressed CD4 counts, and solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients. Although CAP may be diagnosed without a chest radiograph in ambulatory settings, the guideline emphasizes studies using radiographic criteria given the known inaccuracy of clinical signs and symptoms alone. Empiric antibiotic recommendations are based on agents effective against major treatable bacterial causes, traditionally including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.

### Antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia in adult outpatients [^1131ADAR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common condition representing a significant disease burden for the community, particularly for the elderly. Because antibiotics are helpful in treating CAP, they are the standard treatment and CAP thus contributes significantly to antibiotic use, which is associated with the development of bacterial resistance and side-effects. Although several studies have been published concerning CAP and its treatment, the available data arises mainly from studies conducted in hospitalized patients and outpatients. There is no concise summary of the available evidence that can help clinicians in choosing the most appropriate antibiotic.

Objectives

Our goal was to summarize the evidence currently available from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning the efficacy of alternative antibiotic treatments for CAP in ambulatory patients above 12 years of age.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2003) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's trial register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to September week 3, 2003), and EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2003). Studies were also identified by checking the bibliographies of studies and review articles retrieved as well as by perusing medical journals. To identify any additional published or unpublished studies, we contacted the following antibiotics manufacturers: Abbott, AstraZeneca, Aventis, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers-Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Hoffmann-LaRoche, Lilly, Merck, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Novartis, Pfizer, Pharmacia, Sanofi, and Yamanouchi. No language restrictions were applied in any of the search strategies.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which one or more antibiotics were tested for the treatment of CAP in ambulatory adolescent or adult patients. Studies testing one or more antibiotic and reporting the diagnostic criteria used in selecting patients as well as the clinical outcomes achieved were included. No language restrictions were applied.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted and study reports assessed by two independent reviewers (LMB and TJMV). Authors of studies were contacted as needed to resolve any ambiguities in the study reports. The data were analyzed using the Cochrane Collaboration's RevMan 4.2.2 Software. Differences between reviewers were resolved by discussion and consensus.

Main Results

Three randomized controlled trials involving a total of 622 patients aged 12 years and older diagnosed with community acquired pneumonia were included. The quality of the studies and of the reporting was variable. A variety of clinical, radiological and bacteriological diagnostic criteria and outcomes were reported. Overall there was no significant difference in the efficacy of the various antibiotics under study.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Currently available evidence from RCTs is insufficient to make evidence-based recommendations for the choice of antibiotic to be used for the treatment of community acquired pneumonia in ambulatory patients. Pooling of study data was limited by the very low number of studies. Individual study results do not reveal significant differences in efficacy between various antibiotics and antibiotic groups. Multi-drug comparisons using similar administration schedules are needed to provide the evidence necessary for practice recommendations.

### Update in adult community-acquired pneumonia: key points from the new American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 guideline [^11421XKj]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America recently released their joint guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The co-chairs of the guideline committee provide a summary of the guideline process, key recommendations from the new guideline and future directions for CAP research.

Recent Findings

The guideline committee included 14 experts from the two societies. Sixteen questions for the guideline were selected using the PICO format. The GRADE approach was utilized to review the available evidence and generate recommendations. The recommendations included expanded microbiological testing for patients suspected of drug-resistant infections, empiric first-line therapy recommendations for outpatients and inpatients including use of beta-lactam monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, elimination of healthcare-associated pneumonia as a treatment category, and not recommending corticosteroids as routine adjunct therapy.

Summary

CAP is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Effective antibiotic therapy is available and remains largely empirical. New diagnostic tests and treatment options are emerging and will lead to guideline updates in the future.

To the Editor:

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently published updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the 12 years since the previous edition of the guidelines was published, the importance of incorporating antimicrobial stewardship principles into treatment guidelines has been increasingly recognized. In 2017, the U.S. Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee provided guidance regarding this issue for U.S. treatment guidelines. One of the recommendations states that "when multiple therapeutic options are available, a hierarchy of antibiotic treatment recommendations should be provided with 'first choice' options being those with adequate therapeutic efficacy, the lowest risk of facilitating antimicrobial resistance, and the lowest risk of promoting C. difficile and other adverse events, with consideration of healthcare value". The World Health Organization (WHO) recently developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve) framework for classifying antibiotics based on antibiotic stewardship principles, and recommends its use in treatment guidelines.

We are therefore concerned that the 2019 version of the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines seems to give disappointingly little weight to such antibiotic stewardship principles while continuing to recommend WHO Watch and Reserve antibiotics as first-line options for CAP in most of the target populations. We suggest that Access antibiotics would be sufficient for many patients and would be preferable from an antibiotic stewardship perspective. Amoxicillin, which is the first-choice treatment for CAP based on the 2019 WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, and is also listed as a first-choice option in many guidelines outside the United States, is only recommended in the ATS/IDSA guidelines, together with doxycycline and macrolides as equivalent options, for patients without comorbidities (very broadly stated as "chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease; diabetes mellitus; alcoholism; malignancy; or asplenia").

Fluoroquinolone Use

Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are recommended as a first-line option along with β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy for ambulatory patients with CAP and comorbidities and for inpatients. The increased compliance issues regarding the use of two medications may drive clinicians to prescribe FQs, especially in the outpatient setting. The authors mention that adverse reactions to FQs are rare; however, FQ use is among the strongest risk factors for Clostridioides difficile infections, and the list of U.S. Food and Drug Administration black-box warnings associated with FQ use continues to grow.

Outpatient CAP with comorbidities — broader-spectrum regimens and fluoroquinolone considerations: Patients with comorbidities should receive broader-spectrum treatment, with regimens recommended that include a β-lactam or cephalosporin in combination with either a macrolide or doxycycline; these combinations should effectively treat macrolide- and doxycycline-resistant S. pneumoniae, β-lactamase–producing strains of H. influenzae, many enteric gram-negative bacilli, most methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae. Despite increasing reports of adverse events related to fluoroquinolone use, the panel believed that fluoroquinolone therapy was justified for adults with comorbidities and CAP managed in the outpatient setting. The guideline adopts the convention to recommend that patients with recent exposure to one antibiotic class receive treatment with a different class, and notes that both sets of treatment recommendations contain multiple antibiotic options without specifying a preference order, requiring a risk–benefit assessment that weighs local epidemiology and individual risk factors such as documented β-lactam or macrolide allergy, cardiac arrhythmia (macrolides), vascular disease (fluoroquinolones), and history of infection with Clostridium difficile.

Regarding medical management for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotic therapy, inpatient setting, severe CAP, ATS/IDSA 2019 guidelines recommend to discontinue use of the previously recommended categorization of healthcare-associated pneumonia as a means to guide extended-spectrum antibiotic coverage in adult patients with CAP.

Inpatient setting — adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and corticosteroids: We recommend not routinely using corticosteroids in adults with nonsevere CAP (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). We suggest not routinely using corticosteroids in adults with severe CAP (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence) and suggest not routinely using corticosteroids in adults with severe influenza pneumonia (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We endorse the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommendations on the use of corticosteroids in patients with CAP and refractory septic shock. Risk considerations note that the risk of corticosteroids in the dose range up to 240 mg of hydrocortisone equivalent per day for a maximum of 7 days is predominantly hyperglycemia, with concerns about greater complications in the following 30 to 90 days.
