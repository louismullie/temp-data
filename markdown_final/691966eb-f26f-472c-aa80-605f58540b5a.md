## Question

Mechanism of duputryen contracture in cld

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how chronic liver disease (CLD) is mechanistically linked to Dupuytren's contracture (DC). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiologic association between CLD and DC. Then, I should verify the strength and consistency of that association across studies. Next, I will examine plausible biological mechanisms, including alcohol-related effects, metabolic and inflammatory pathways, and genetic susceptibility. After that, I need to integrate these into a coherent mechanistic model and consider clinical implications and limitations of the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiologic signal. Multiple authoritative sources list Dupuytren's contracture among the stigmata of alcohol-associated liver disease, which supports a clinical association between CLD and DC, particularly in the context of alcohol use disorder and cirrhosis [^1114yB7i] [^111dWsVc]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of association rather than assume causality; a meta-analysis reported a pooled sex-adjusted odds ratio of approximately 2.92 for DC in patients with liver disease compared with controls, indicating a consistent and moderately strong association, though confounding by alcohol exposure and other factors remains a concern [^116TZ2CJ]. I should also note that historical cohort data suggest the association with alcoholism emerges after age 50 and is not solely explained by cirrhosis, implying additional pathophysiologic contributors beyond end-stage liver disease alone [^116ViwC1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. I need to check whether the association persists after adjusting for alcohol exposure and other confounders. Some meta-analytic data were limited by incomplete adjustment for alcohol intake, which weakens causal inference, so I should be cautious in attributing a direct causal role from CLD to DC without better-controlled data [^114r1rjR]. But wait, what if the association reflects shared upstream drivers like alcohol and metabolic traits rather than liver disease per se; indeed, large epidemiologic datasets show patients with DC have higher rates of smoking, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, and mortality analyses suggest part of the excess risk is explained by these factors, reinforcing a multifactorial model rather than a purely liver-centric causal pathway [^115jGdCw] [^113p6Z3t].

> Next, I should review the core biology of DC to anchor mechanisms. DC is a fibroproliferative disorder driven by myofibroblast-rich nodules and cords that express alpha-smooth muscle actin and remodel the extracellular matrix toward a higher type III to type I collagen ratio, producing contracture; this myofibroblast-centric biology is well established and provides the scaffold onto which systemic influences from CLD could act [^113NhV3e] [^112oYxmn]. I will now examine whether CLD could amplify these fibrotic programs via cytokines, matrix regulators, or mechanical cues, which seems biologically plausible given the centrality of TGF-β, WNT, and matrix metalloproteinase pathways in fibrosis [^111p1UCA].

> Let me consider alcohol-related mechanisms first. Chronic alcohol use can directly injure palmar fascia through oxidative stress and acetaldehyde-mediated protein adducts, while also inducing hepatic injury and systemic inflammation; these insults can converge on TGF-β–driven myofibroblast activation and extracellular matrix remodeling, aligning with the fibrotic phenotype of DC [^111p1UCA]. I should double-check whether alcohol-related liver injury specifically upregulates fibrogenic pathways that overlap with DC; yes, alcohol-associated liver disease features stellate cell activation and collagen deposition, paralleling the myofibroblast-driven matrix accumulation seen in DC, supporting mechanistic convergence even if the tissue compartments differ [^111p1UCA].

> Now, I will examine metabolic and inflammatory links, especially diabetes and dyslipidemia, which frequently co-travel with CLD. Hyperglycemia drives advanced glycation end-products that increase matrix stiffness and mechanotransduction, and both TGF-β and WNT signaling are upregulated in DC and in diabetes-associated fibroses; these pathways enhance myofibroblast differentiation and contractility, providing a direct bridge from metabolic dysfunction to DC biology [^117H3sR5]. Wait, let me verify the WNT signal in DC; multiple GWAS and functional studies implicate WNT pathway perturbation, including decreased SFRP4 secretion, which disinhibits WNT signaling and promotes α-SMA expression and contractility, a pattern that could be amplified by systemic inflammatory states in CLD [^111aYq4i] [^113NhV3e].

> I need to ensure I account for matrix regulation. In DC, there is dysregulation of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors, with a lower MMP-to-TIMP ratio favoring collagen accumulation; similarly, CLD involves altered matrix turnover, so shared matrix biology could potentiate fibrosis in the palmar fascia when systemic MMP/TIMP balance is perturbed by liver disease or alcohol exposure [^1171MD79] [^111p1UCA]. But wait, what if specific matrix regulators are genetically primed; indeed, variants near MMP14 and DDR2 have been implicated in DC, suggesting that baseline matrix pathway susceptibility could interact with CLD-related signals to accelerate fibrosis [^112oYxmn].

> Let me think about genetic susceptibility, because not everyone with CLD develops DC. Twin and GWAS data indicate high heritability for DC, with multiple loci converging on WNT signaling, ECM modulation, and inflammation; this polygenic architecture likely lowers the threshold for environmental triggers such as alcohol, metabolic stress, and systemic inflammation to initiate palmar fibrosis [^113NhV3e] [^1112w5oT]. Hold on, I should verify whether CLD could modulate expression of these risk genes; integrative eQTL analyses show tissue-specific expression effects at several DC loci, supporting a model wherein systemic inflammatory or metabolic milieus in CLD could alter transcription of fibrosis-related genes in palmar fascia [^116mzfsZ].

> I will now integrate these strands into a coherent model. In patients with CLD — particularly alcohol-related disease — direct alcohol toxicity, systemic inflammation, and metabolic derangements converge to activate TGF-β and WNT pathways, shift the MMP/TIMP balance toward matrix accumulation, and promote myofibroblast differentiation and contractility in genetically susceptible palmar fascia, culminating in nodule and cord formation with fixed contractures; this model aligns with both epidemiologic associations and mechanistic data from DC tissue and cells [^111p1UCA] [^113NhV3e]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially implied CLD might be necessary for DC, but that overstates the evidence; DC occurs without CLD, so CLD functions as a significant amplifier of fibrotic risk rather than a sole cause, which better fits the multifactorial and polygenic nature of DC [^113NhV3e] [^1133LFYp].

> Next, I should review clinical implications and limitations. Recognition of DC in a patient with CLD should prompt evaluation and counseling for alcohol use disorder, diabetes, and cardiovascular risk, given the clustering of risk factors and the observed mortality associations; this is a teachable moment to address modifiable risks that may also influence DC progression and recurrence [^1114yB7i] [^115f4pBw]. I need to ensure I acknowledge uncertainty: many association studies are observational and confounded, and alcohol exposure data are often incomplete, so causality remains probable but not definitive; nonetheless, the convergence of epidemiology, genetics, and cell biology makes the mechanistic link biologically credible and clinically actionable [^116TZ2CJ] [^114r1rjR].

> In summary, chronic liver disease — especially alcohol-related — likely contributes to Dupuytren's contracture through a triad of alcohol-related tissue injury, systemic inflammatory and metabolic stress, and genetic susceptibility that together amplify myofibroblast activation, matrix remodeling, and contracture in the palmar fascia; while CLD is not strictly necessary for DC, it meaningfully increases risk and should trigger comprehensive risk-factor management when DC is identified [^1114yB7i] [^116TZ2CJ] [^113NhV3e].

Dupuytren's contracture in chronic liver disease (CLD) reflects a **fibroproliferative palmar fascia disorder** driven by myofibroblast activation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and altered matrix metalloproteinase/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (MMP/TIMP) balance [^113NhV3e] [^1171MD79]. CLD-related **oxidative stress, TGF-β signaling, and Wnt pathway dysregulation** amplify fibrosis, while advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) from hepatic dysfunction increase collagen cross-linking and stiffness, promoting contracture [^111jrkA1] [^1152mzUS] [^117H3sR5]. These mechanisms converge to cause irreversible palmar fascia thickening and digital flexion contractures in CLD [^111dWsVc].

---

## Histopathological features

Histopathologically, Dupuytren's contracture in CLD shows **myofibroblast proliferation** — activated fibroblasts expressing alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) generate contractile force and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition — and **extracellular matrix remodeling**, with increased collagen (especially type III), fibronectin, and proteoglycans that thicken and stiffen the palmar fascia [^113NhV3e]. An altered **MMP/TIMP balance** — with elevated TIMP-1 and reduced MMP activity — promotes collagen accumulation and fibrosis [^1171MD79].

---

## Molecular and cellular mechanisms

Several **molecular and cellular mechanisms** underlie Dupuytren's contracture in CLD:

- **Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling**: TGF-β1 is a key fibrogenic cytokine that promotes myofibroblast differentiation, collagen synthesis, and ECM remodeling. Elevated TGF-β1 levels are consistently observed in Dupuytren's tissue and are further upregulated in CLD, exacerbating fibrosis [^114YNUFt].

- **Wnt signaling pathway**: Wnt signaling, particularly the canonical β-catenin pathway, is implicated in fibroblast proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation. Genetic studies have identified Wnt pathway genes (e.g. WNT2, WNT4, WNT7B, SFRP4) as risk loci for Dupuytren's disease, and dysregulation of this pathway contributes to fibrosis in CLD [^1152mzUS] [^111aYq4i].

- **Oxidative stress**: Chronic liver disease is characterized by increased oxidative stress, which activates fibroblasts and promotes ECM deposition. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis, further contributing to palmar fascia fibrosis [^113M8mmu].

- **Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs)**: Hepatic dysfunction leads to accumulation of AGEs, which increase collagen cross-linking, stiffness, and resistance to enzymatic degradation. This enhances the mechanical properties of the palmar fascia, promoting contracture formation [^117H3sR5].

---

## Genetic predisposition

Genetic factors significantly influence susceptibility to Dupuytren's contracture in CLD. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple loci associated with Dupuytren's disease, including Wnt pathway genes, ECM-related genes (e.g. DDR2, MMP14, ITGA11), and transcription factors (e.g. EPDR1) [^1112w5oT] [^112oYxmn]. These genetic variants predispose individuals to fibroproliferative disorders, including Dupuytren's contracture, and may interact with environmental and metabolic factors in CLD to precipitate disease manifestation [^116mzfsZ].

---

## Environmental and lifestyle factors

Environmental and lifestyle factors associated with CLD — particularly **alcohol consumption** and **smoking** — significantly increase the risk and severity of Dupuytren's contracture. Alcohol-related liver disease is strongly associated with Dupuytren's contracture, likely through direct toxic effects on palmar fascia fibroblasts and indirect effects via hepatic dysfunction and metabolic disturbances [^1114yB7i]. Smoking further elevates risk by increasing oxidative stress and promoting fibroblast proliferation and ECM deposition [^1133LFYp].

---

## Clinical implications

Understanding the mechanism of Dupuytren's contracture in CLD has important clinical implications:

- **Early detection and management**: Recognizing the association between CLD and Dupuytren's contracture enables early intervention, including lifestyle modifications (alcohol cessation, smoking cessation) and medical management of liver disease [^1114yB7i].

- **Therapeutic strategies**: Targeting fibroproliferative pathways (e.g. TGF-β, Wnt signaling) and modulating ECM remodeling (e.g. collagenase injection) are promising therapeutic approaches [^116LjziU].

- **Patient counseling**: Patients with CLD should be informed about the increased risk of developing Dupuytren's contracture and educated about early signs and symptoms to facilitate timely treatment [^116TZ2CJ].

---

Dupuytren's contracture in chronic liver disease is a **complex fibroproliferative disorder** characterized by myofibroblast proliferation, ECM remodeling, and altered MMP/TIMP balance. CLD-related oxidative stress, TGF-β signaling, Wnt pathway dysregulation, and AGE accumulation collectively drive palmar fascia fibrosis and contracture formation. Genetic predisposition and environmental factors, such as alcohol consumption and smoking, further exacerbate disease susceptibility and severity.

Meaning of Findings and Future Research

Our results show that DD is an important health condition in the older population, frequently requiring surgical intervention. Our results, combined with previous findings that DD often recurs after treatment, indicate that the burden of this disease is substantial. As there are no preventive treatments available at the moment, DD research should focus on the mechanism of disease to make a future treatment preventing progression available.

Introduction

Dupuytren disease (DD [MIM:]) is a progressive fibroproliferative disease of the palmar fascia and the most common inherited disorder of the connective tissue. It is the most frequent example of a tissue-specific fibrotic disease: others include pulmonary, renal, hepatic, and skin fibrosis. It is accepted that there are common features of all fibrotic diseases, but some pathologic pathways are likely to be tissue specific.

DD is characterized by the initial development of myofibroblast-rich nodules in the palm of the hand. These myofibroblasts express alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and secrete types III and I collagen, leading to the formation of abnormal cords in the palm of the hand. In a proportion of people with DD, the myofibroblasts cause contraction, leading to flexion contractures of the involved digits and subsequent functional impairment. As the hand is the sensorimotor end-organ of the upper limb, impairment here has a disproportionate effect on the quality of life of the individual. Additionally, because DD is associated with other forms of fibrosis, it may serve as an ideal human model system for fibrotic disease, and the routine excision of tissue as a part of treatment facilitates experimental medicine studies.

DD is very common, affecting 5%–25% of people in populations of European descent, and there is evidence that the prevalence is increasing. The mainstay of treatment for DD is surgery, though newer modalities are increasing in popularity. Despite this, complications and recurrence of disease are both common, even after adequate primary treatment.

DD has a substantial heritable component. A twin study from Denmark estimated the heritability of DD at 80%and a sibling recurrence study from the UK estimated the λ S to be 4.48, confirming a strong genetic predisposition to DD. Furthermore, age at first surgical intervention is significantly younger in those with a positive family history. Similarly, there is evidence that multiple non-genetic factors, such as smoking, alcohol intake, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, also play a role in disease development.

1 INTRODUCTION

In genetically susceptible individuals, chronic hyperglycaemia due to diabetes mellitus can cause tissue injury that may result in the development of fibrosis. 1 Fibrosis is characterized by dysregulation, accumulation and change in the quality of the extracellular matrix resulting from an abnormal or uncontrolled tissue repair response. The extracellular matrix provides mechanical support for cells and facilitates cell‐cell communication through an insoluble network of collagen, elastins, structural glycoproteins, proteoglycans‐hyaluronans and integrins. 1 The extracellular matrix is constantly being synthesized and degraded, and this turnover is important to ensure normal structure and function of organs and tissues. Fibrosis in people with diabetes can affect almost every organ in the body, including the heart, eyes, liver, kidney, skin and vascular system. 1 Many people with diabetes have arthropathies, such as thickened skin and limited mobility of the joints of the hands and fingers, leading to flexion contracture(s). 2 Endocrinologists may overlook limited joint mobility in people with diabetes or may not consider it a diabetes‐related complication.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Understand the current molecular biology of Dupuytren disease. 2. Critically evaluate the functional outcomes of treatment. 3. Confidently use any of the commonly used treatments. 4. Provide patients with appropriately selected treatment choices.

Summary

Dupuytren disease is a fibroproliferative disease of the palmar fascia that results in debilitating digital contractures. Despite medical advances, the measurement of disease severity, functional deficits, and treatment outcomes remains challenging. Treatment options vary widely, yet practitioners often use only a small number of modalities. These options range from minimally invasive office procedures to extensive surgery, with adjuncts such as radiation and soft-tissue flaps. A thorough understanding of disease pathophysiology and treatment options can help surgeons offer more individualized care for this elusive disease.

Extracellular Matrix Modulation

Fibrotic disease is characterized by abnormal and excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. In DD, the abnormal fibrotic cords are composed mainly of collagen, with a higher type III to type I collagen ratio than in unaffected palmar fascia. Several of our additional associated loci harbor genes that are known to interact with and modulate the ECM: DDR2 (MIM:) at chromosome 1q23.3 (rs17433710, OR = 0.81, p meta = 1.99 × 10⁻¹⁰), MMP14 (MIM:) at chromosome 14q11.2 (rs1042704, OR = 1.26, p meta = 2.49 × 10⁻¹⁹), ITGA11 (MIM:) at chromosome 15q23 (rs2306022, OR = 1.28, p meta = 8.70 × 10⁻¹¹), ACAN (MIM:) at chromosome 15q26.1 (rs6496519, OR = 0.79, p meta = 7.18 × 10⁻¹⁷), and CHST6 (MIM:) at chromosome 16q22 (rs977987, OR = 1.15, p meta = 4.82 × 10⁻¹⁰).

Discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) is a membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinase that contains an extracellular discoidin homology domain. The functional ligand for DDR2 is fibrillar collagen (types I–III), though it has also been shown to bind type X collagen.DDR2 has previously been shown to play a role in collagen production and migration through the basement membrane by skin fibroblasts. Furthermore, DDR2 plays a complex role in liver fibrosis. DDR2 expression is induced by acute liver injury in a mouse model, and expression of a constitutionally active form of DDR2 enhances proliferation and invasion of hepatic stellate cells. However, in contrast to the acute injury model, DDR2 knockout mice are more susceptible to chronic inflammation and fibrosis in a carbon tetrachloride model of chronic liver injury. Intriguingly, this increased susceptibility to chronic fibrosis is mediated in part by attenuating the interaction of hepatic stellate cells with macrophages, suggesting a link between DDR2 and pro-inflammatory pathways (see below).

### Pharmacotherapies in dupuytren disease: current and novel strategies [^117AMYLh]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Dupuytren disease is a benign, progressive fibroproliferative disorder of the hands. To date, only one pharmacotherapy (clostridial collagenase) has been approved for use in Dupuytren disease. There is a great need for additional nonsurgical methods that can be used to either avoid the risks of invasive treatments or help minimize recurrence rates following treatment. A number of nonsurgical modalities have been discussed in the past and continue to appear in discussions among hand surgeons, despite highly variable and often poor or no long-term clinical data. This article reviews many of the pharmacotherapies discussed in the treatment of Dupuytren disease and novel therapies used in inflammation and fibrosis that offer potential treatment options.

### Dupuytren's disease predicts increased all-cause and cancer-specific mortality: analysis of a large cohort from the U.K. clinical practice research datalink [^115f4pBw]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Physicians, general practitioners, and surgeons treating patients with Dupuytren's disease should recognize its presence as a sign of poor general health and act to modify risk factors for mortality in their patients. There is an unfavorable outlook with regard to cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, endocrine disturbance, liver pathology, and mental health. We have shown that several of the contributing causes of death in this cohort are in part attributable to smoking status, these being cancer, chronic lower respiratory tract disease, and cardiovascular disease. Importantly, this study has identified a 12-year window of opportunity for clinical and lifestyle intervention to avoid premature mortality, particularly with regard to smoking cessation and treatment of diabetes and hyperlipidemia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-associated liver diseases: 2019 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1114yB7i]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol-associated liver disease — clinical presentation and AUD recognition: There is no unique presentation of ALD that can be distinguished with confidence from other forms of liver disease, and alcohol use is often not disclosed by the affected patient, whereas liver injury, whether due to alcohol or other causes, often proceeds silently. Although not all patients with ALD meet the criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD), failure to recognize AUD remains a significant clinical problem, and providers need to have a high index of suspicion for AUD in patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms and signs given in Table 6. Table 6 lists symptoms such as odor of alcohol on breath, tiredness, abdominal pain, day/night reversal (sleepy by day; wakeful at night), peripheral neuropathy, weight gain (due to ascites), weight loss (due to loss of proximal muscle mass), confusion (as part of hepatic encephalopathy), loss of sexual drive, and amenorrhea, and signs including spider angioma, palmar erythema, leukonychia, ecchymoses, icteric conjunctivae, loss of proximal muscle mass, systemic hypotension; tachycardia suggests alcohol withdrawal syndrome, ascites, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, bruises, gynecomastia, gonadal atrophy in men, neurological findings of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (fine tremor, psychomotor agitation, transient hallucinations or illusions) and hepatic encephalopathy (coarse flapping tremor [asterixis], altered consciousness), as well as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and Dupuytren's contracture.

### Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum for dupuytren's contracture [^1174d6Qi]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Importance Of The Field

Dupuytren's disease is a non-malignant, progressive disorder of the hands that can severely limit hand function and diminish overall quality of life. With global life expectancy increasing, the prevalence of this disease appears to be increasing amongst all ethnic groups. Treatment has traditionally remained surgical with few effective, nonsurgical options. However, with the introduction of collagenase clostridium histolyticum to treat Dupuytren's contractures, physicians and surgeons may be provided with a new, office-based, non-surgical option to treat this disease.

Areas Covered In This Review

The literature behind the use of collagenase to treat Dupuytren's disease; including its mechanism of action, safety, efficacy and clinical evidence behind its recent FDA approval.

What The Reader Will Gain

The latest information available on collagenase through a comprehensive review of PubMed and the websites of licensing organizations for medicinal products.

Take Home Message

Phase III, clinical trials on collagenase for treatment of Dupuytren's contractures have recently been completed. Meeting primary and secondary objectives, collagenase has obtained FDA approval for clinical use. Collagenase now provides a non-operative option for Dupuytren's disease. Although short-term results show that collagenase is safe and efficacious, long-term effects of repeat injections and contracture recurrence rates have yet to be examined.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis on the strength and consistency of the associations between dupuytren disease and diabetes mellitus, liver disease, and epilepsy [^1158dpca]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

This meta-analysis showed that Dupuytren disease and diabetes mellitus are strongly associated, even after adjustment for age differences between groups. Furthermore, an association between Dupuytren disease and liver disease adjusted for sex, and between Dupuytren disease and epilepsy was found.

The finding that Dupuytren disease and diabetes mellitus are associated suggests that Dupuytren disease and diabetes mellitus may have common factors that contribute to their pathogenesis. The suspected disease mechanism relates to biochemical changes that occur as a result of diabetes mellitus. It is known that many complications of diabetes mellitus are caused by nonenzymatic glycation of proteins. In the literature, there is increasing evidence for the role of nonenzymatic glycation in fibrotic diseases that are associated with diabetes mellitus, such as cardiomyopathy. The biochemical changes that occur as a result of diabetes mellitus cause oxidative stress that produces advanced-glycated end-products. Advanced-glycated end-products interact with advanced-glycated end-product receptors present on cell surfaces, which causes up-regulation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β.TGF-β plays a key role in the pathology of fibrotic diseases, and up-regulation has been associated with Dupuytren disease. In addition, the up-regulation of TGF-β also causes synthesis of type III collagen, the type of collagen that is predominantly found in Dupuytren disease tissue. Moreover, collagen tends to stiffen by cross-linking because of nonenzymatic glycation. Furthermore, biochemical studies have shown that diabetes mellitus metabolites stimulate the development of myofibroblasts, the most important cell in Dupuytren disease nodules. Thus, it has been shown that biochemical consequences of diabetes mellitus play an important role in fibrotic diseases. Therefore, it is likely that the same pathogenic pathways underlie the association between Dupuytren disease and diabetes mellitus. In addition, it is possible that the peripheral vascular changes that can occur as a consequence of diabetes mellitus aggravate the oxidative stress. This has previously been suggested as a trigger for Dupuytren disease. There was no statistically significant difference between the odds ratio of diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis on the strength and consistency of the associations between dupuytren disease and diabetes mellitus, liver disease, and epilepsy [^114r1rjR]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Although we planned to correct the association between Dupuytren disease and liver disease for the amount of alcohol consumed, this was not possible, because those data were not reported in the included studies. In such cases, it is advised to contact the authors for additional information. However, the included articles were published more than 20 years ago (1956 to 1992), making it difficult to contact the authors. Therefore, we want to emphasize that the results of our meta-analyses do not present information about causality. Furthermore, there were two articles in the association between Dupuytren disease and liver disease with a confidence interval overlapping 1.0. This indicates that the association was not significant, whereas the other articles demonstrated a significant association. However, the intraclass correlation coefficient indicated that heterogeneity was very low. Although this may seem contradictory, the point estimates of these studies were above an odds ratio of 1.0. The low intraclass correlation coefficient value ensures that this overlap is not caused by heterogeneity, but rather by a lack of sample size within studies, leading to a wide confidence interval. The same was seen in the association between Dupuytren disease and diabetes mellitus.

Introduction

Fibrosis, the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix components, can affect nearly every tissue in the body and is increasingly recognized as a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a fibrotic disorder of the fascias of the hand that causes fingers to irreversibly contract. It is also associated with excess mortality due to a wide range of causes, including cancer. DD is very common and its prevalence increases with age, affecting 12% of Western population aged 55 years to 29% of those aged 75 years. The initial presentation is as a highly cellular nodule that progresses to form fibrous cords. As the cords extend into the finger and undergo remodeling and shortening, patients develop contractures that impair function and quality of life. Treatment of DD is currently limited to late-stage disease to reduce flexion contractures by disrupting or excising the cords. However, recurrence rates are high, and there is no cure for this debilitating disease.

Current understanding of the etiology of DD is limited, with a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. There is strong evidence for an association with advanced age, male sex, family history of DD, heavy alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and manual work exposure. Furthermore DD shares a genetic etiology with body mass index (BMI), type II diabetes mellitus (T2D), and levels of triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Intriguingly, adiposity is causally protective against DD. Genome-wide associations studies (GWASs) have so far identified 61 genetic risk variants –. The overall (broad-sense) heritability of DD was estimated to be 80%, of which 67% is attributable to common genetic variants. However, the variance explained by known genetic variants was estimated as 11.3%. Thus, much of the genetic susceptibility for DD remains to be elucidated.

Development of novel therapeutic approaches requires a systematic approach of identification of novel genetic risk factors, broadening our understanding of the mechanisms involved with these genetic susceptibility loci, and studying their functional consequences. Here we addressed these aims by performing meta-analysis of GWAS data from six cohorts to prioritize genes involved in DD.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Cohort Description

For this study, our previously described cohort of DD patients was used. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the medical ethics committee of the University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands (2007/067). Briefly, phenotype and genotype data of total of 1669 DD patients were collected between 2007 and 2016. Phenotype data included data on clinometrics of flexion contractures; characteristics such as age at onset; family history (defined anamnestically as having at least one affected family member in the first or second degree); bilateral disease; ectopic disease; observed recurrence (defined as recurrence of flexion contracture or new signs of DD tissue in previously cleared areas); surgical recurrence (defined as two or more surgical interventions in the same ray); and the associated disorders diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, and liver disease. LifeLines is a multidisciplinary, prospective, population-based cohort study examining, in a unique three-generation design, the health and health-related behaviors of 167,729 persons living in the northern Netherlands. A detailed description of the LifeLines cohort genotype calling and quality control (QC) pipeline can be found on Github.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis on the strength and consistency of the associations between dupuytren disease and diabetes mellitus, liver disease, and epilepsy [^111vV5QC]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The precise cause of Dupuytren disease remains incompletely understood. Genetic factors are clearly involved in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren disease, as illustrated by family studies and by a genomewide association study. – In addition, environmental factors are believed to play a role in the development of the condition. Dupuytren disease has been observed in association with hand trauma, manual work, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption. – Moreover, Dupuytren disease has often been linked to diseases such as diabetes mellitus, liver disease, and epilepsy.–

In particular, diabetes mellitus has frequently been studied in relation to Dupuytren disease, and diabetes mellitus is considered an important risk factor for the development of Dupuytren disease. However, the studies reporting an association between Dupuytren disease and diabetes mellitus have conflicting results. In some studies, a strong association between the two conditions was observed, – but these results could not always be replicated in other studies.

### Beta-catenin signaling in fibroproliferative disease [^112R8YH1]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-catenin has been historically recognized as both an intermediate in the "canonical Wnt signaling pathway" and as a component of functional adherens junctions.

Materials and Methods

Cellular accumulation of beta-catenin levels can result in transactivation of gene transcription and cellular proliferation during normal cellular and disease development. Recent evidence has identified beta-catenin in an additional role as a component of cutaneous wound healing.

Results

This finding is in keeping with previous observations that post-translational modifications of beta-catenin that are associated with its cytoplasmic accumulation are frequently observed in fibroproliferative diseases with characteristics of dysregulated wound healing. These diseases include hypertrophic scar formation, aggressive fibromatoses, Lederhose disease, and Dupuytren's contracture (DC).

Conclusions

While its precise roles in disease initiation and progression remain to be explored, this review highlights our current knowledge of beta-catenin regulation and describes some potential upstream mediators of beta-catenin accumulation and signaling in fibroproliferative disease.

### Biological targets for dupuytren disease [^1171KbzR]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Dupuytren disease is a connective tissue disorder occurring on the palm, causing flexion contractures of fingers. There is a pressing need for therapeutic interventions that can slow, stop, or even incrementally reverse the progression of the disease. Numerous in vitro studies have shed light on cellular and molecular agents that contribute to contractures. This article comprehensively reviews various growth factors that can be targeted to prevent and limit the progression and recurrence of Dupuytren contracture (DC). Fibroblasts are the major cell population that has been reported for the contractures in DC, and they are also known to exacerbate the cytokine production. Limiting the fibroblast function by targeting the growth factor production will be of great benefit in treating DC. This review will focus on the studies that have shown to limit the exaggerated function of fibroblasts by reducing the expression of profibrotic growth factors by using antagonizing agents.

### Dupuytren disease: prevalence, incidence, and lifetime risk of surgical intervention. A population-based cohort analysis [^115DHyxx]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Dupuytren disease (DD) is the most common organ-specific fibrotic disease. Patients develop nodules in the palmar side of the hand, which can progress into cords and may lead to finger contractures. These contractures lead to problems with hand function and interfere with activities of daily living. – The disease occurs more frequently in men. The cause is multifactorial: there is a strong familial component, – and several nongenetic associations, including exposure to smoking, alcohol intake, and diabetes. Current treatment is focused on relieving symptoms, and finger contractures are mostly treated by surgical division or excision of the cords. Unfortunately, the self-reported functional outcome after surgical treatment is poor in 22% to 59%. The mean annual costs of surgical treatment for DD in the United Kingdom (UK) are £3100 per patient, with higher costs for revision surgery. Because the disease tends to recur after treatment and the number of patients needing revision surgery is increasing, it is also expected that the costs of management of DD will increase.

Reported prevalence rates of DD vary widely, from 0.6% to 31.6% in the general population. Few studies report prevalence rates in the UK, but these studies included small samples and did not study a random sample of the population, possibly providing a biased view. Only one previous study has reported incidence rates in the UK, but this was carried out over 15 years ago. We are not aware of any literature reporting on the incidence of DD treatment per se. Reliable reports on prevalence and incidence of DD, and incidence of surgical intervention are relevant for the range of clinicians involved in management of DD, and for cost-effectiveness analyses of treatment modalities. They also provide vital information for commissioners planning the provision of services. In this cohort study, we used the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) database combined with Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) Admitted Patient Care data to answer the following research questions: What are the prevalence and incidence of DD? What is the incidence of first surgical intervention for DD? What is the lifetime risk of surgical intervention after DD diagnosis?

### Microarray gene analysis and expression profiles of dupuytren's contracture [^112ejpGA]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Dupuytren's disease, although not altogether uncommon, has eluded scientists who have sought to explain the cause of this palmar fibroproliferative disorder. It can lead to severe limitations of hand function if left untreated. This study is the first broad genetic survey using microarray technology to find gene products that are overexpressed or underexpressed in diseased tissues. The authors found 23 genes with levels that differ consistently from control levels. Nine were selected for further verification using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. These genes hold potential promise in explaining some of the demographic trends seen with disease, such as correlation with alcoholism and the striking predisposition for the male gender.

### Dupuytren's disease: diagnosis and treatment [^116GMkwL]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Dupuytren's disease is a progressive condition that causes the fibrous tissue of the palmar fascia to shorten and thicken. The disease is common in men older than 40 years; in persons of Northern European descent; and in persons who smoke, use alcohol, or have diabetes. Patients present with a small, pitted nodule (or multiple nodules) on the palm, which slowly progresses to contracture of the fingers. The disease initially can be managed with observation and nonsurgical therapy. It will regress without treatment in approximately 10 percent of patients. Steroid injection into the nodule has been shown to reduce the need for surgery. Surgical referral should be made when metacarpophalangeal joint contracture reaches 30 degrees or when proximal interphalangeal joint contracture occurs at any degree. Timing of surgical intervention varies, but surgery is usually performed when the metacarpophalangeal joint contracture exceeds 40 degrees or when the proximal interphalangeal joint contracture exceeds 20 degrees. In-office percutaneous needle aponeurotomy is an alternative to surgery.

### Aggressive dupuytren's diathesis in a young woman [^116JQaJW]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Dupuytren's disease is a palmar fascia pathology characterised by flexion contracture of the involved fingers in late stages. It has been described a higher prevalence in northern populations, especially in men in the fifth or sixth decade of life.1 Alcohol consumption, liver disease, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy and some of its treatments, tobacco smokers or hand workers are only a example of the different aetiologies proposed. There are a group of patients presenting with more aggressive clinical manifestation named Dupuytren's diathesis. This subtype could frequently present a positive family history, ectopic fibromatosis and bilateral hand affectation. The authors present a 24-year-old woman referred to the Plastic Surgery Department because severe fingers contracture with an associated aggressive plantar fibromatosis. She referred familial history in her first degree relatives (mother and three of seven brothers and sisters). The first clinical manifestations in her hand began when she was 7 years old.

### A genome-wide association study of dupuytren disease reveals 17 additional variants implicated in fibrosis [^1152mzUS]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Individuals with Dupuytren disease (DD) are commonly seen by physicians and surgeons across multiple specialties. It is an increasingly common and disabling fibroproliferative disorder of the palmar fascia, which leads to flexion contractures of the digits, and is associated with other tissue-specific fibroses. DD affects between 5% and 25% of people of European descent and is the most common inherited disease of connective tissue. We undertook the largest GWAS to date in individuals with a surgically validated diagnosis of DD from the UK, with replication in British, Dutch, and German individuals. We validated association at all nine previously described signals and discovered 17 additional variants with p ≤ 5 × 10⁻⁸. As a proof of principle, we demonstrated correlation of the high-risk genotype at the statistically most strongly associated variant with decreased secretion of the soluble WNT-antagonist SFRP4, in surgical specimen-derived DD myofibroblasts. These results highlight important pathways involved in the pathogenesis of fibrosis, including WNT signaling, extracellular matrix modulation, and inflammation. In addition, many associated loci contain genes that were hitherto unrecognized as playing a role in fibrosis, opening up new avenues of research that may lead to novel treatments for DD and fibrosis more generally. DD represents an ideal human model disease for fibrosis research.

### Dupuytren's disease predicts increased all-cause and cancer-specific mortality: analysis of a large cohort from the U.K. clinical practice research datalink [^113p6Z3t]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our study has demonstrated an increased risk of death in patients with Dupuytren's disease, a very common fibroproliferative disorder of the hand. This excess mortality is accounted for by increase in death from cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, liver disease, and suicide. Importantly, for most causes of excess mortality, there is a delay of 12 years before this increase becomes evident, representing an important therapeutic window for intervention by healthcare professionals. Adjusting for smoking and diabetic status in our multivariable regression model reduced the effect size of increased mortality in patients with Dupuytren's disease, which suggests that these factors are at least partially responsible. We recommend that special attention be paid to smoking cessation, control of diabetes, and dyslipidemia management in this group of patients when they first present to medical services. We hypothesize that there is a 12-year delay in increased mortality secondary to the nature of the causes of death that we have identified. For example, it may take 12 years for a poor cardiovascular profile to manifest into a life-threatening myocardial infarction.

Intriguingly, we found that there remained an increase in all-cause and cancer-related mortality after adjustment for confounding factors associated with both Dupuytren's disease and mortality. Dupuytren's disease is a complex genetic disease, with multiple genetic loci interacting with environmental factors, leading to the disease phenotype. A previous genome-wide association study identified nine genetic loci associated with Dupuytren's disease, of which six were involved in the WNT signaling pathway, a family of proteins that regulate cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation. Deregulation of WNT signaling is implicated in the development of multiple cancers, including colorectal, breast, prostate, and oropharyngeal cancer. – It is conceivable that there may be a shared genetic predisposition to both cancer and Dupuytren's disease, and this hypothesis deserves further study.

### Scientific understanding and clinical management of dupuytren disease [^113M8mmu]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Dupuytren disease (DD) is a fibroproliferative disorder of unknown etiology that often results in shortening and thickening of the palmar fascia, leading to permanent and irreversible flexion contracture of the digits. This Review provides a detailed update of the scientific understanding of DD and its clinical management, with perspectives on emerging research and therapy. Established risk factors include genetic predisposition and ethnicity, as well as sex and age. Several environmental risk factors (some considered controversial) include smoking, alcohol intake, trauma, diabetes, epilepsy and use of anticonvulsant drugs, and exposure to vibration. DD has been variously attributed to the presence of oxygen free radicals, trauma to the palmar fascia, or aberrant immune responses with altered antigen presentation, or to interactions between these proposed mechanisms. The presence of immune cells and related phenomena in DD-affected tissue suggests that DD is possibly immune-related. Mechanically, digital contracture is caused by myofibroblasts in the DD palmar fascia; however, the exact origin of this cell type remains unknown. The mainstay of treatment is surgical release or excision of the affected palmodigital tissue, but symptoms often recur. Nonsurgical correction of DD contractures can be achieved by Clostridium histolyticum collagenase injection, although the long-term safety and recurrence rate of this procedure requires further assessment.

### A retrospective review of the management of dupuytren's nodules [^1139jLup]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the progression of Depuytren's nodules with more than 6 years of follow-up study.

Methods

Fifty-nine patients who presented initially with Dupuytren's nodules returned for physical examination at an average follow-up period of 8.7 years (range, 6–15 y). Patients were questioned regarding family history of Dupuytren's disease, family ethnicity, alcohol consumption, smoking, liver disease, seizures, diabetes, and signs of systemic disease such as knuckle pads and plantar nodules. Physical examination evaluated disease state, loss of extension of the finger joints, and disease location.

Results

Thirty of the 59 patients with previously diagnosed isolated nodules developed a cord. Twenty-two percent of patients presented with bilateral disease and another 26% developed bilateral disease. Of those patients whose disease progressed 43% had European heritage, 37% had disease onset before the age of 50 years, 30% had bilateral disease, 23% had a family history of Dupuytren's disease, and 13% had plantar nodules. Five patients lost extension averaging 60 degrees at the metacarpophalangeal joint and 40 degrees at the proximal interphalangeal joint. Three of these 5 had surgical excision because they had a flexion contracture of the metacarpophalangeal or proximal interphalangeal joints averaging 60 degrees and 43 degrees, respectively. Another 7 patients did not meet standard criteria but had surgery for persistent pain associated with grasping objects (without contracture). All surgically treated patients had at least 1 risk factor and 7 patients had more than 1 risk factor. In 7 patients the Dupuytren's nodule had resolved at the time of follow-up evaluation.

Conclusions

The progression of the nodular form of Dupuytren's disease to cord-like disease is common but not inevitable. This evaluation of Dupuytren's nodules has shown that at an average of 8.7 years after diagnosis 5 patients met standard surgical criteria of metacarpophalangeal contracture of greater than 30 degrees or any proximal interphalangeal contracture. Age of onset (before 50 years) is correlated most closely with disease progression, and the disease regressed in 7 patients (12%).

### A genome-wide association study of dupuytren disease reveals 17 additional variants implicated in fibrosis [^111aYq4i]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

We have completed the largest GWAS to date in DD, the most common inherited disorder of connective tissue. Our results have almost tripled the known loci associated with this localized fibrosis and have also highlighted the role of fundamental biological processes in the pathophysiology of fibrosis, in the context of DD. Several associated loci harbor potentially attractive drug targets and are the subject of active further research. While we acknowledge that the mechanistic link between associated SNPs and pathophysiological function can often be obscure and requires experimental validation, we think that certain biological processes deserve discussion.

WNT Signaling

The importance of WNT signaling in fibrosis, as exemplified by DD, has been confirmed by this work. All previously reported loci that harbor WNT pathway genes have been replicated in this larger study, including WNT ligands WNT2, WNT4, and WNT7B, a co-signaling molecule RSPO2, and WNT antagonist SFRP4.

Our detailed functional studies on the statistically most strongly associated variant (rs16879765) have suggested that a subtle imbalance of WNT signaling contributes to the fibrotic phenotype. We postulate that the decreased SFRP4 secretion seen in individuals homozygous for the high-risk allele at rs16879765 allows a subtle increase in WNT3A signaling through the non-canonical pathway. This could lead to greater α-SMA expression and hence contraction of the DD cords. This contraction is characteristic of the latter stages of DD and requires surgical treatment.

Taken as a whole, our genetic results suggest that subtle variations in the level of WNT signaling are likely to be responsible for the fibrosis seen in DD. The genetic variants cluster around ligands, a co-stimulatory molecule, and a WNT antagonist. This contrasts with variants in the WNT signaling pathway that predispose to cancer, which tend to be downstream of the receptor and lead to receptor-independent signaling and unrestrained cellular growth and proliferation. While DD does share some clinical features with cancer, such as excess cellular proliferation, abnormal extracellular matrix deposition, and the tendency to recur after treatment, it is ultimately a benign phenotype.

### Ethnic differences in prevalence of dupuytren disease can partly be explained by known genetic risk variants [^115UbkKi]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dupuytren disease (DD) is a fibroproliferative disorder that causes nodules and cords to form in the palmar fascias. These may extend into the digits and contract, resulting in limited finger extension and function. DD is most often reported in Caucasians of North-Western European descent. The prevalence of DD is high in the UK (8.0–30.0%), in Scandinavian countries (3.2–36.0%), in the Netherlands (22.1%; > 50 years of age), in Flanders (32%; > 50 years of age), and in Australia (22%; > 60 years of age). It increases with age and is thought to be associated with hand work, diabetes, epilepsy, and liver disease. The number of papers reporting DD in non-Caucasians is increasing, but the reported prevalences are lower than in Caucasians. Saboeiro et al. described a population of over 3 million multi-ethnic individuals including 9938 DD patients. In this population, the prevalence of DD was estimated 0.73% for whites, 0.13% for blacks, 0.24% for Hispanics, 0.07% for Asians, and 0.14% for native Americans. Yeh et al. described a prevalence of 5.65/10⁵ for men and 3.39/10⁵ for women in 1078 Chinese individuals living in Taiwan. A recent study by Lee et al. found a prevalence of 32.2/10⁵ in a large Korean population. Weinstein et al. found a prevalence of 0.53% in Hispanics. Cases of DD in Africans have been described by several authors, but no epidemiological studies have been done. However, DD is thought to be very rare in this ethnicity. In 2014, Lanting et al. systematically reviewed the reported DD prevalences of 212 articles and concluded 23 studies had sufficient quality. They found prevalence rates ranging from 0.6% to 31.6% in different population groups and concluded that this spread in prevalence was based on the heterogeneity of the study populations. Hindocha et al. stated that it was not clear whether the extremely variable prevalence of DD in different geographical locations was due to genetic or environmental factors, or a combination of both. However, marked differences in prevalences in combination with the observation of familial clustering point to a genetic component in DD.

### Cellular census of human fibrosis defines functionally distinct stromal cell types and States [^1124SsYk]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Fibrotic disorders are some of the most devastating and poorly treated conditions in developed nations, yet effective therapeutics are not identified for many of them. A major barrier for the identification of targets and successful clinical translation is a limited understanding of the human fibrotic microenvironment. Here, we construct a stromal cell atlas of human fibrosis at single cell resolution from patients with Dupuytren's disease, a localized fibrotic condition of the hand. A molecular taxonomy of the fibrotic milieu characterises functionally distinct stromal cell types and states, including a subset of immune regulatory ICAM1 + fibroblasts. In developing fibrosis, myofibroblasts exist along an activation continuum of phenotypically distinct populations. We also show that the tetraspanin CD82 regulates cell cycle progression and can be used as a cell surface marker of myofibroblasts. These findings have important implications for targeting core pathogenic drivers of human fibrosis.

### Integrative analysis of dupuytren's disease identifies novel risk locus and reveals a shared genetic etiology with BMI [^116mzfsZ]. Genetic Epidemiology (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Dupuytren's disease (DD [MIM: 126900]) is a common and disabling connective tissue disorder affecting 5–25% of individuals of European ancestry, characterized by progressive and irreversible fibroblastic proliferation affecting the palmar fascia of the hand (Dupuytren, 1834; Gudmundsson, Arngrímsson, Sigfússon, Björnsson, & Jónsson, 2000). DD initially manifests as nodules in the palm of the hand, resulting in contraction and ultimately flexion contractures of the digits in a proportion of individuals affected with DD. Recent twin studies estimate the heritability (i.e. the proportion of phenotypic variation explained by genetics) of DD to be ~80% (Larsen et al. 2015). The largest previous genome‐wide association study (GWAS) of DD in individuals of European ancestry identified 26 genome‐wide significant single‐nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations in 24 independent risk regions (Ng et al. 2017), and estimated the proportion of phenotypic variance attributable to additive effects of common variants (i.e. SNP‐heritability) to be 0.53 (Ng et al. 2017; Yang, Lee, Goddard, & Visscher, 2011). The vast majority (23 of 24) of DD associations lie in noncoding genomic regions with only one located in an intron (Ng et al. 2017), thus the biological implications of these associations are not immediately clear. Investigations into the mechanisms behind the strongest GWAS association, rs16879765, located in the intron of EPDR1, revealed an effect on expression and protein secretion of the nearby gene SFRP4 (Ng et al. 2017) but implicated EPDR1 functionally (Staats, Wu, Gan, O'Gorman, & Ophoff, 2016). Overall, the regulatory mechanisms driving signal at the GWAS associations on DD remains unknown.

### Matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases in sera and tissue of patients with dupuytren's disease [^1171MD79]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Dupuytren's contracture is a fibroproliferative disorder characterized by progressive deposition of mature collagen fibers. In other fibrotic diseases affecting organs such as the liver, lung, heart, and skin, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their natural inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), play an important role. In this study, serum concentrations of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 were determined in 22 patients (five women and 17 men; average age, 67 ± 11 years) with Dupuytren's disease using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Tissue samples were obtained for standard histological and immunohistochemical analyses. Sera and samples of palmar fascia from 20 patients (13 women and seven men; average age, 60 ± 15 years) who had undergone hand surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome were used as the control group. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test. Patients with Dupuytren's contracture presented with a TIMP-1 concentration of 437 ± 160 ng/ml, a significantly higher TIMP-1 concentration than that seen in the control patients, who had a concentration of 321 ± 70 ng/ml (p < 0.05). Patients with a proliferative active disease (n = 14) had a significantly higher TIMP-1 concentration (525 ± 136 ng/ml) than patients (n = 8) with a contracture in the late involutional and residual phase (286 ± 41 ng/ml; p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the TIMP-2, MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 serum concentrations between patients with palmar fibromatosis and the control group. Patients with Dupuytren's disease had a significantly lower MMP-to-TIMP ratio (1.1 ± 0.3; p < 0.05) than the control group (1.5 ± 0.35). Patients with an active palmar fibromatosis presented a significantly (p < 0.05) reduced ratio (1 ± 0.2) compared with those in later phases (1.4 ± 0.3). TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 could be detected in tissue of patients with Dupuytren's contracture, with an accumulation in proliferative areas. MMPs could be detected locally in Dupuytren's tissue in a few patients, with less positive staining than for TIMPs. In the control group, there was just little or no staining for TIMPs and MMPs. The data indicate that the physiological balance between MMPs and their natural inhibitors is disturbed in patients with a proliferative active Dupuytren's disease. The decrease in the systemic MMP-to-TIMP ratio can cause increased synthesis and deposition of collagen, leading to palmar fibromatosis.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis on the strength and consistency of the associations between dupuytren disease and diabetes mellitus, liver disease, and epilepsy [^111Z6KCW]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

With respect to the association between Dupuytren disease and liver disease, nine articles reported data on an association (Table 4). In this association, a potential confounder is sex. The sex distribution was reported in almost all articles. Two additional articles were excluded because they reported incomplete data. Thus, five articles entered the meta-analysis (Table 4). One of the included articles reported that participants were matched on age and sex, but the sex distribution was not reported. The missing data on sex was imputed for this article.

Table 4.
Characteristics of Articles Included in the Meta-Analysis on the Association between Dupuytren Disease and Liver Disease

Seven articles reported data on an association between Dupuytren disease and epilepsy. However, six articles were included in the meta-analysis (Table 5), because one article reported incomplete data. One of the included articles provided data that were separated for the different types of anticonvulsant medication that the participants used.

### A genome-wide association study of dupuytren disease reveals 17 additional variants implicated in fibrosis [^112eBWCa]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

For the discovery phase, we performed association analysis using logistic regression with sex and the first two principal component (PC1 and PC2) of the PCA as covariates. We did not use further principal components in our regression model as after adjustment for PC2, we saw no further separation of distinct subsets, and the genomic inflation factor did not decrease further (λ GC unadjusted = 1.104; adjusted for PC1 λ GC = 1.089; adjusted for PC1 and PC2 λ GC = 1.089; PC1, PC2, and PC3 λ GC = 1.090). We calculated this overdispersion factor of association test statistics (λ GC) using observed versus expected p values, and adjusted for sample size by calculating λ₁₀₀₀ (Figure S3). Conditional analysis was performed at each associated locus, again using logistic regression conditioning on the most statistically associated SNP at each locus. If a second independent signal was detected (p ≤ 5.0 × 10⁻⁸), we conditioned on that SNP, repeating the process until no further independent associations were evident.

### A genome-wide association study of dupuytren disease reveals 17 additional variants implicated in fibrosis [^1177YHuc]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Conditional analysis at all associated loci confirmed two independent signals at two loci. On chromosome 7, after conditioning on rs16879765, rs2598107 showed residual evidence of association (r² ∼0, frequency 44.7%, OR = 1.48, p cond = 6.85 × 10⁻³¹). Similarly, on chromosome 8, after conditioning on rs629535, rs2912522 showed residual evidence of association (r² ∼0, frequency 19.7%, OR = 0.73, p cond = 1.31 × 10⁻¹⁴; Table 1).

To further characterize the genetic architecture of DD, we tested first the contribution of all autosomal common-frequency variants (MAF ≥ 0.05) and second the 26 genome-wide significant variants alone to trait variance using genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA)and estimated them to be 53.1% and 11.3%, respectively.

Imputation and Construction of 99% Credible Sets

We imputed our dataset using the Haplotype Reference Consortium resource. We calculated single SNP Bayes Factors (BF) for 7,218,238 SNPs within our imputed dataset, containing variants that passed our QC criteria. Variants with the highest BF within each associated region from our meta-analysis were used as the index SNP for the construction of 99% credible sets. Similar to our primary analysis, conditional analysis revealed the same two loci with two independent signals. On chromosome 7, after conditioning on rs117402009 (BF = 9.87 × 10⁴⁵), we found residual evidence of association for rs2598100 (BF cond = 7.29 × 10³¹), and on chromosome 8, after conditioning on rs2472141 (BF = 2.22 × 10²⁸), we found residual association for rs2981040 (BF cond = 1.75 × 10¹¹). We therefore constructed independent credible sets based around each independent signal at these loci (Figure S7 and Table S2). Intriguingly, for one of the credible sets constructed, the genotyped SNP rs1042704 (BF = 1.67 × 10¹⁰) had a posterior probability greater than 0.99 and therefore appears to be the causative allele at that locus. Overall, the credible sets range in size from 1 to 293 variants, with a median size of 27.5. Details of the 99% credible sets can be found in Table S2 and Figure S7.

We have previously undertaken a pilot GWAS in 960 Dutch DD-affected individuals to begin to delineate the common genetic variation underlying this predisposition. This defined nine susceptibility loci and revealed the hitherto unsuspected importance of components of the WNT signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of DD. To boost power for the detection of common-frequency signals, here we undertook a 4-fold larger GWAS in 3,871 UK individuals with surgically validated DD. Replication of significant and suggestive loci was performed in a total of 4,041 surgically validated DD-affected case subjects from the UK, the Netherlands, and Germany.

This case series explores the use of sorafenib in patients with advanced Dupuytren and/or Ledderhose disease not amenable to further local interventions due to procedural morbidity. Sorafenib exhibited an expected side-effect profile. Importantly, all 5 patients demonstrated an objective response which was associated with substantial symptomatic improvement. These responses were durable even with dose reductions of sorafenib, suggesting that lower doses, which are associated with significantly lower rates of adverse events, may be efficacious. This is important as ongoing treatment was required to maintain disease response in this case series.

The outcomes of these 5 patients suggest the efficacy of a relatively well-tolerated oral agent in the treatment of Dupuytren and/or Ledderhose disease, offering the potential of sparing patients the morbidity of repeated invasive procedures, and suggest the need for future controlled studies. This study highlights the power of re-purposing oncological drugs in a benign condition and aims to aid our understanding into the underlying biology; given the pleiotropic effects of sorafenib, further investigation is required to better define the mechanism driving disease response, possibly through inhibition of the PDGF pathway.

### Outcomes of management of recurrent dupuytren contracture: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112zySQm]. Hand (2022). Medium credibility.

Data Extraction and Quality Assessment

Data from the included articles were independently extracted in duplicate by 2 reviewers (C.W. and R.F.) using a predefined, standardized data collection instrument. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion to reach a consensus. If a consensus could not be obtained, any conflicts were resolved by the third author (M.H.). The extracted data included demographic information (age, sex, comorbidities, smoking status, previous treatments, baseline severity of disease, etc), type of study, management of recurrent Dupuytren contracture, objective outcome measures (ie, improvement in range of motion), patient-reported outcomes, rates of complication, and follow-up time.

Two reviewers (C.W. and M.H.) independently assessed the studies for risk of bias and applicability of the study methodology. For each article, the risk of bias assessment was performed using the ROBINS-I tool (Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions)for nonrandomized studies.

The ROBINS-I tool was used to assess the risk of bias and quality of nonrandomized studies in 7 key domains: (1) bias due to confounding; (2) bias in selection of participants into the study; (3) bias in classification of interventions; (4) bias due to deviations from intended interventions; (5) bias due to missing outcome data; (6) bias in measurement of the outcome; and (7) bias in selection of the reported result. Risk of bias could be scored as no information, low, moderate, serious, or critical. Disagreements between reviewers (C.W. and R.F.) were resolved through consensus. If a consensus could not be obtained, any conflicts were resolved by the third author (M.H.). Interrater reliability was calculated using Cohen's κ score.

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics were reported for patient demographic information, study characteristics, previous treatments, and patient outcomes. The improvement in ROM was synthesized via meta-analytic pooling of proportions from the included studies using a DerSimonian-Laird random effects model. Only ROM was included in the quantitative analysis as the remaining outcome variables had high rates of missing data and limited number of studies. Heterogeneity was quantified using I² statistics. No transformation of data was required. Due to the inconsistency of outcome reporting and missing data, a regression analysis could not be performed. All data analyses were performed in R statistical software (version 3.6.1).

### Fibroproliferative disorders and diabetes: understanding the pathophysiologic relationship between Peyronie's disease, dupuytren disease and diabetes [^1165G7N5]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

6 CONCLUSION

Believed to occur as part of a systemic fibroproliferative disorder, Peyronie's disease and advanced Dupuytren disease (ie Dupuytren contracture) share some common traits, including inflammation, collagen degradation, ossification and myofibroblast differentiation. Inheritance of Dupuytren disease or Peyronie's disease is autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance; however, specific genes that identify an increased risk of developing Peyronie's disease or Dupuytren disease have not been identified. Even though a notable percentage of people with diabetes have comorbid Peyronie's disease and/or Dupuytren disease, studies have not been performed to identify fibroproliferative pathways that all 3 conditions might have in common. Based on this review of the literature, data suggest a possible common link among the pathways involved in the fibroproliferative processes of Peyronie's disease, Dupuytren disease and diabetes.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis on the strength and consistency of the associations between dupuytren disease and diabetes mellitus, liver disease, and epilepsy [^1166SrcK]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Dupuytren Disease and Diabetes Mellitus

The average prevalence of Dupuytren disease was 31 percent (range, 0.45 to 69 percent) in patients with diabetes mellitus (Table 3). In controls, the mean average prevalence was 14 percent (range, 0.0 to 49 percent). An association between Dupuytren disease and diabetes mellitus (irrespective of the type) was found, indicated by a pooled odds ratio of 3.06 (95 percent CI, 2.69 to 3.48). The heterogeneity between studies was moderate, indicated by an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.56. This indicates that the consistency was also moderate, which corresponds with the findings with respect to the odds ratios (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2.
Forest plot showing the association between Dupuytren disease and diabetes mellitus as calculated from the different articles. The size of the square indicates the weight of the study. The horizontal lines represent the 95 percent confidence interval. Note that this figure shows crude odds ratios.

Almost half of the studies specified the type of diabetes mellitus, or reported data for the different types of diabetes mellitus separately. For type 1 diabetes mellitus, the age-adjusted odds ratio was 3.90 (95 percent CI, 2.48 to 6.12), whereas for type 2 diabetes mellitus an odds ratio of 3.04 (95 percent CI, 2.18 to 4.23) was found. A difference between the odds ratios of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus could not be demonstrated (p = 0.24). Heterogeneity was low, as indicated by an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.05.

RESULTS

Results of the Literature Search

The initial search yielded 1309 articles, of which 1260 were unique (Fig. 1). After assessing the titles and abstracts, 166 articles were subjected to full-text analysis. Some articles reported data on two of the three diseases. These articles were included in all full-text analyses for the two diseases separately. This is the reason why the total number of articles included in the full-text analysis for diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, and liver disease combined, as presented in Figure 1, is larger than 166. In the full-text assessment round, the majority of articles were excluded because there was no control group included in the study. In three articles, a questionnaire was used to diagnose Dupuytren disease instead of a physical examination; and in one article, the results were presented only for the number of hands, making it impossible to calculate an odds ratio on a participant level. These articles were excluded from the analyses.

Fig. 1.
Flowchart of the study selection process. DD, Dupuytren disease.

Of the 1260 unique articles that were obtained, 39 articles reported data on an association between Dupuytren disease and diabetes mellitus. Although many studies took the possible confounding effect of age into account by matching, in some studies this was lacking.– In a large number of articles, age was not reported for subgroups, nor were the participants matched on age. These articles were therefore excluded, along with five articles that reported incomplete data.– A total of 21 articles were included in the meta-analysis on the association between Dupuytren disease and diabetes mellitus (Table 3). They all reported age of the diabetics and control group separately.

### Bilateral dupuytren's contractures of the thumb interphalangeal joints [^111BGdn2]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Dupuytren's disease was first described by Baron Guillaume Dupuytren in 1831. He outlined the pathology of palmar fascia thickening and contracture resulting in flexion of one or more digits. Dupuytren's disease usually affects the little or ring fingers, with the thumb rarely affected. Furthermore, the thumb in isolation is only affected in 0.5% of cases, with contracture at the metacarpophalangeal joint. We present a unique and interesting case of Dupuytren's disease predominantly of the thumbs, with isolated contractures bilaterally at the interphalangeal joints, in a 59 year old lady with epilepsy who was otherwise fit and well. To our knowledge this disease pattern has never been reported in the literature. Furthermore a relevant literature review of Dupuytren's disease affecting the thumb, in particular the interphalangeal joint, is presented. Our interesting and unique case reinforces the notion that the disease pathogenesis is diverse and multifactorial, and provides a further interesting example for the literature.

### Trends in the management and burden of alcoholic liver disease [^116Wxnis]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease

In its early stages, ALD is a silent disease and can only be detected by laboratory tests or imaging techniques. There are few programs aimed at early detection of ALD at its asymptomatic stages. Some patients with early ALD can show stigmata of alcohol abuse such as bilateral parotid gland hypertrophy, muscle wasting, malnutrition, Dupuytren's sign, and signs of peripheral neuropathy. In patients with cirrhosis, most physical findings are not specific of the etiology. However, some signs such as gynecomastia and extensive spider angiomas may be more frequently seen in those with alcohol as the main cause of liver disease. The diagnosis of ALD is frequently suspected upon documentation of excessive alcohol consumption (> 40–50 g/day) and the presence of clinical and/or biological abnormalities suggestive of liver injury. Laboratory blood tests such as mean corpuscular volume, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST) can indicate early ALD whereas advanced ALD is suspected if there is decreased albumin, increased INR, elevated bilirubin level or low platelet count. There are several laboratory markers that estimate persistent alcohol intake. Among them, carbohydrate deficient transferrin and GGT are the most frequently used markers to detect previous alcohol consumption. In patients with ALD, the AST/ALT ratio typically is greater than 1. This ratio is typically greater than 2 in AH and can also be found in patients with advanced cirrhosis regardless of the etiology.

Liver biopsy is not clearly indicated in patients with early stages of ALD or when established cirrhosis is revealed by clinical, analytical and imaging data. The liver biopsy can be done percutaneously in most patients but requires a transjugular approach in patients with a low platelet count and/or a prolonged prothrombin time. The precise indications of liver biopsy are not well established in routine practice. However, it is suggested in patients with aggressive forms of ALD such as AH requiring specific therapies (e.g. corticosteroids and/or pentoxifylline) and in patients with other cofactors suspected of contributing to liver disease. In the setting of clinical trials, the assessment of liver histology by performing a liver biopsy is recommended. The typical findings in patients with ALD include steatosis, hepatocellular damage (ballooning and/or Mallory-Denk bodies), an inflammatory infiltrate basically composed of PMN cells that predominates in the lobules, and a variable degree of fibrosis and lobular distortion that may progress to cirrhosis.

### Integrative analysis of dupuytren's disease identifies novel risk locus and reveals a shared genetic etiology with BMI [^116Tq7VG]. Genetic Epidemiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Future work should be taken in multiple directions. First, we provide additional evidence that EPDR1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of DD; further work should be dedicated to functionally validate and understand this gene in connection with DD, as it may represent an attractive therapeutic target. Second, there is strong evidence for a relationship between BMI/TG and DD‐elucidating the mechanism may lead to interesting observations with implications for the treatment of both traits. Third, additional GWAS, with larger sample sizes and in additional populations, will uncover more of the contribution of genetic variation to DD. And fourth, given the putative oligogenic architecture of DD, and that our tissue and cell type analyses lacked consistent results, it might also be rewarding to generate more functional‐omics data, such as reference gene expression panels or chromatin accessibility data in the palmar fascia tissue. These resources would offer valuable insight into the underlying mechanisms of DD and opportunity to explore therapeutic avenues.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis on the strength and consistency of the associations between dupuytren disease and diabetes mellitus, liver disease, and epilepsy [^116TZ2CJ]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Dupuytren Disease and Liver Disease

The average prevalence of Dupuytren disease was 22.3 percent (range, 18.9 to 47.4 percent) in patients with liver disease (Table 4). In controls, the average prevalence was 9.7 percent (range, 7.5 to 14.0 percent). The sex-adjusted odds ratio of the association between Dupuytren disease and liver disease was 2.92 (95 percent CI, 2.08 to 4.12). Heterogeneity was low, as indicated by an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.05, indicating that the association between Dupuytren disease and liver disease was consistent (Fig. 3). The majority of the studies included participants with liver cirrhosis,– and two articles made a distinction between alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver cirrhosis. In one article, the type of liver disease was not reported.

Fig. 3.
Forest plot showing the association between Dupuytren disease and liver disease as calculated from the different articles. The size of the square indicates the weight of the study. Note that this figure shows crude odds ratios.

Dupuytren Disease and Epilepsy

The average prevalence of Dupuytren disease was 40.3 percent (range, 7.9 to 70.5 percent) in patients with epilepsy (Table 5). In controls, the average prevalence was 29.2 percent (range, 6.0 to 49.2 percent). There was an association between Dupuytren disease and epilepsy (OR, 2.80; 95 percent CI, 2.49 to 3.15). One of these studies provided an odds ratio that was smaller than 1, indicating that epileptic patients were less likely to have Dupuytren disease in this study (Fig. 4). The heterogeneity between studies was moderate, as indicated by an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.55. Unfortunately, only one study reported frequencies for different medication types, and thus further analyses on medication were not possible.

### Dupuytren's disease predicts increased all-cause and cancer-specific mortality: analysis of a large cohort from the U.K. clinical practice research datalink [^115HyynK]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

However, several limitations must be taken into account. As with any observational study, unmeasured confounding could be responsible for the effects seen. Our work relies on clinical coding of Dupuytren's disease and comorbidities in general practice, and inaccurate coding could lead to misclassification bias. Coding of Dupuytren's disease may not be at the actual onset of disease, and there is likely to be a lag between its development and eventual diagnosis in primary care. To address these sources of bias, we used matched controls and set their entry into the study at the time of diagnosis of Dupuytren's disease. We could not account for severity of disease, which could introduce bias: patients are more likely to be coded as having Dupuytren's disease if it is more severe. We were unable to incorporate alcohol use into our multivariable model due to a high proportion of missing data and inability to impute this data. Alcohol use has traditionally been associated with development of Dupuytren's disease and is associated with increased mortality. Finally, we did not assess the impact of medications on mortality, including control of diabetes mellitus and the use of statins in lipid regulation.

### Disease course of primary dupuytren disease: 5-year results of a prospective cohort study [^113tZ5ZA]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Predicting progression of Dupuytren disease becomes relevant in an upcoming era with progression-preventing treatment. This study aimed to determine the course of Dupuytren disease and identify factors associated with progression.

Methods

Two hundred fifty-eight patients with Dupuytren disease participated in this prospective cohort study, obtaining 17,645 observations in 5 years. Outcomes were disease extent (surface area) and contracture severity (total passive extension deficit). Demographics, lifestyle, health status, exposure to manual work, and genetic risk scores were gathered as potential predictors. Subject-specific, mixed-effects models were used to estimate disease course, and logistic regression with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was used to evaluate factors associated with the presence of progression.

Results

On average, Dupuytren disease was progressive in all finger rays with regard to area [yearly increase, 0.07 cm2 (95% CI, 0.02 to 0.13 cm2) to 0.25 cm2 (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.39 cm2)]. Progression in total passive extension deficit was only present on the small finger side [yearly increase, 1.75 degrees (95% CI, 0.30 to 3.20 degrees) to 6.25 degrees (95% CI, 2.81 to 9.69 degrees)]. Stability or regression in area and total passive extension deficit was observed in 11 and 13 percent and 16 and 15 percent (dominant and nondominant hands), respectively. Smoking, cancer, genetic risk score, and hand injury were univariate associated with progression in area, but after multivariate variable selection, none of these associations remained. No predictors for progression in total passive extension deficit were found.

Conclusions

Dupuytren disease is progressive, especially with respect to disease extent. Progression in contracture severity is mainly present on the small finger side of the hand. None of the traditional risk and diathesis factors were associated with progression, indicating that new hypotheses about Dupuytren disease progression might be needed.

### The contractile properties and responses to tensional loading of dupuytren's disease – derived fibroblasts are altered: a cause of the contracture? [^112NxZtL]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Dupuytren's disease causes disability because of the development of finger flexion deformities, with distinct nodule and cord formation. This results in physical shortening of the diseased fascial tissue through a combination of cell-mediated contraction and matrix remodeling. It is this fixed tissue fabric shortening that prevents finger extension. In this experimental study, the relative contractile properties of Dupuytren nodule- and cord-derived fibroblasts were quantified in a culture force monitor model, in comparison with normal carpal ligament fibroblasts. Nine nodule, 10 cord, and four carpal ligament fibroblast cell lines were studied; each cell line was derived from a separate patient. The contractile forces generated by nodule and cord fibroblasts were significantly greater than the force generated by carpal ligament fibroblasts. There were also significant differences between nodule- and cord-derived fibroblasts, with the nodule cells demonstrating the greatest contractile force generation. The contraction profiles of both cord and nodule Dupuytren fibroblasts demonstrated delays in the attainment of tensional homeostasis, with an absence of a plateau phase by 20 hours. After the contraction phase, cell-seeded constructs were subjected to a series of four uniaxial mechanical overloads and cellular responses were monitored during each subsequent 30-minute period. Dupuytren nodule and cord fibroblast responses were significantly altered, compared with carpal ligament fibroblasts, exhibiting an increased and opposite response. Dupuytren fibroblasts, particularly nodule fibroblasts, exhibited increased force generation and a delay in reaching tensional homeostasis. The data suggest that these cells have an inherently higher basal tension and contractile ability. This results in increased shortening of the matrix, and the delay in reaching tensional homeostasis might exacerbate this response. These results represent a theoretical framework regarding the fundamental processes involved in the pathogenesis and progression of clinical flexion deformities in Dupuytren disease.

### Integrative analysis of dupuytren's disease identifies novel risk locus and reveals a shared genetic etiology with BMI [^112cKtyV]. Genetic Epidemiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Dupuytren's disease is a common inherited tissue‐specific fibrotic disorder, characterized by progressive and irreversible fibroblastic proliferation affecting the palmar fascia of the hand. Although genome‐wide association study (GWAS) have identified 24 genomic regions associated with Dupuytrens risk, the biological mechanisms driving signal at these regions remain elusive. We identify potential biological mechanisms for Dupuytren's disease by integrating the most recent, largest GWAS (3,871 cases and 4,686 controls) with eQTLs (47 tissue panels from five consortia, total n = 3,975) to perform a transcriptome‐wide association study. We identify 43 tissue‐specific gene associations with Dupuytren's risk, including one in a novel risk region. We also estimate the genome‐wide genetic correlation between Dupuytren's disease and 45 complex traits and find significant genetic correlations between Dupuytren's disease and body mass index (BMI), type II diabetes, triglycerides, and high‐density lipoprotein (HDL), suggesting a shared genetic etiology between these traits. We further examine local genetic correlation to identify 8 and 3 novel regions significantly correlated with BMI and HDL respectively. Our results are consistent with previous epidemiological findings showing that lower BMI increases risk for Dupuytren's disease. These 12 novel risk regions provide new insight into the biological mechanisms of Dupuytren's disease and serve as a starting point for functional validation.

### Isometric contraction of dupuytren's myofibroblasts is inhibited by blocking intercellular junctions [^1164Kvyf]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Myofibroblasts (MFs) are responsible for both physiological wound and scar contraction. However, it is not known whether these cells act individually to contract the surrounding matrix or whether they behave in a coordinated manner. Therefore, we studied intercellular junctions of primary human MFs derived from patients with Dupuytren's disease, a fibrotic disorder of the dermis and subdermal tissues of the palm. The cells were maintained in anchored three-dimensional collagen lattices to closely mimic conditions in vivo. We found that selective blockade of adherens, mechanosensitive, or gap junctions effectively inhibited contraction of the collagen matrices and downregulated the MF phenotype. Our data indicate that MFs in part function as a coordinated cellular syncytium, and disruption of intercellular communication may provide a therapeutic target in diseases characterized by an overabundance of these contractile cells.

### The prevalence of dupuytren's disease in patients with diabetes mellitus [^117H3sR5]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Multiple risk factors have been implicated in the incidence and pathogenesis of DD. Commonly cited risk factors include alcoholism, HIV, smoking, seizure disorder, and DM. Of these, the relationship between DM and DD has been extensively investigated. It has been reported that patients with diabetes have a 3.1 times greater chance of developing DD, regardless of the patient's gender. One study showed an incidence of DD in patients with diabetes to be as high as 20%. In the senior clinical author's case logs for DD, 14% of patients had DM. The association between these two diseases has been theorized to be related to the pathogenesis of each disease. DM leads to the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are also associated with other systemic fibroses. It has been shown that patients with diabetes and DD have higher levels of AGEs than controls. The increased AGEs in DD increase fascial stiffness, which through mechanotransduction, accentuates Dupuytren's contractures. Additionally, the hyperglycemia associated with chronic diabetes can further contribute to systematic increases in fibrosis. An example of this is diabetic cheiroarthropathy or limited joint mobility syndrome (LJMS), which is seen in 30–40% of patients with chronic diabetes. LJMS is diagnosed by the clinical features of progressive pain-free joint stiffness in the hands and feet, impaired grip and fine motor, and a positive prayer sign, as shown in Fig. 5. This hyperglycemia and fibrosis have been further associated with TGFβ activation, increased WNT signaling, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) dysregulation. This increased WNT and TGFβ activity, along with MMP dysregulation, has also been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of DD.

### Plasma endotrophin, reflecting tissue fibrosis, is associated with graft failure and mortality in KTRs: results from two prospective cohort studies [^117JnJR3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Since fibrosis and inflammation in the kidney graft are known causes of graft dysfunction, it is biologically plausible that collagen type VI upregulation may be associated with graft outcome. Indeed, our study shows that endotrophin is robustly associated with a higher risk of graft failure, independent of adjustments for known confounders. In Cox regression, we also adjusted for variables potentially in the causal path of endotrophin expression. For example, a history of rejection and anti-HLA class II antibodies may induce fibrosis, which may then be reflected by increased endotrophin concentrations. However, the association of endotrophin with graft failure was robust, even after adjustment for these variables in the causal path. Notably, the associations of endotrophin with graft failure also remained after additional adjustment for markers of tubular injury that were shown to be important prognostic factors in previous studies. We speculate that where these markers mainly reflect kidney injury, they do not particularly reflect fibrosis and abnormal extracellular matrix turnover. This may be the reason why endotrophin, which is tightly linked to those processes in particular, provides additional information on top of existing markers.

In addition to local effects on the kidney, upregulation of collagen type VI also has systemic effects. For instance, the increased expression of collagen type VI is well-established in Dupuytren's disease and lung and liver fibrosis. Other studies have reported that collagen type VI promotes tumour growth, and a lack of collagen type VI improves cardiac function and remodelling after myocardial infarction. Consequently, it has been suggested that endotrophin and collagen type VI formation may mechanistically contribute to fibrosis, accelerated aging and increased risk of mortality. Indeed, associations of endotrophin with clinical outcome have been reported in patients with CKD, diabetes and other diseases. Our findings are fully in line with these studies, since our analyses show strong associations between endotrophin and all-cause mortality independent of kidney function, urinary protein excretion and tubular injury. This further suggests that fibrosis and abnormalities in the extracellular matrix, as measured using plasma endotrophin, are clinically relevant with regard to patient outcome.

### Fibroproliferative disorders and diabetes: understanding the pathophysiologic relationship between Peyronie's disease, dupuytren disease and diabetes [^115zBLAQ]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

One drawback to current treatments for Dupuytren disease is that they are employed in more advanced disease settings. 73 A systematic review highlighted the lack of evidence for treatments that target the early stages of Dupuytren disease fibroproliferative processes. 73 TNF has been implicated in the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts in people with Dupuytren disease, and an in vitro study showed that anti‐TNF neutralizing antibody reduced isometric contraction of myofibroblasts from participants with Dupuytren disease in a dose‐dependent manner. 32 A dose‐escalation study with the anti‐TNF antibody adalimumab (15 mg, 35 mg, or 40 mg) or placebo (saline) was performed in 28 participants with early‐stage Dupuytren disease. 82 Two weeks after administration of the antibody, Dupuytren nodules were excised and protein expression (mean ± SD) was analysed; levels of α‐smooth muscle actin, a biomarker of myofibroblast differentiation, were significantly reduced in treated participants compared with placebo (40‐mg treatment group, 1.1 ± 0.1 ng/µg of total protein; placebo group, 1.5 ± 0.1 ng/µg of total protein; p = 0.006). 82 Procollagen type 1 was also significantly reduced compared with placebo (40‐mg treatment group, 474 ± 84 pg/µg of total protein; placebo group, 817 ± 78 pg/µg of total protein; p = 0.019). 82 The results indicate that treatment with an anti‐TNF antibody downregulates the myofibroblast phenotype and suggest that treatments targeting the WNT signalling pathway may be promising for the treatment of early‐stage Dupuytren disease. 82

### Fibroproliferative disorders and diabetes: understanding the pathophysiologic relationship between Peyronie's disease, dupuytren disease and diabetes [^114YNUFt]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

An immunohistochemical study with nodule and cord tissue from 40 people with Dupuytren disease reported a correlation between the number of macrophages and number of myofibroblasts in nodules (rₛ = 0.58, P < .05). 4 It has also been shown that mesenchymal stem cells, which are precursors for myofibroblast differentiation, may be present in fat and dermal tissues surrounding Dupuytren nodules. 47 Furthermore, flow cytometry data indicated that immune cells (primarily macrophages) from disaggregated Dupuytren nodule tissue secrete a variety of proinflammatory cytokines (eg transforming growth factor beta [TGF‐β1], TNF and interleukin‐6). 32 This study also compared palmar fibroblasts from people with Dupuytren disease to nonpalmar fibroblasts from these same individuals or to palmar cells from healthy individuals to evaluate the effects of cytokine activity on contraction and profibrotic signalling pathways. Exogenous addition of recombinant human TNF increased contraction of fibroblasts from people with Dupuytren disease but not in control tissues, 32 and isolated cells from Dupuytren nodules secreted TNF at concentrations (mean ± SD, 78 ± 26 pg/mL) necessary for differentiation of palmar dermal fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. 32 Consistent with GWAS data, 33, 34, 61 biochemical studies confirmed that myofibroblast differentiation occurred via the WNT signalling pathway. 32

TGF‐β1 stimulates myofibroblast differentiation and is a primary inducer of fibrosis in multiple tissues, such as breast, 62 kidney, 63 heart, 64 lung 65 and liver. 66 In dermal fibroblasts obtained from 12 people with Dupuytren disease (mean age, 55 years; range, 42‐72 years), the production of TGF‐β1 was greater than that of TGF‐β2, and addition of TGF‐β1 (5 ng/mL) to Dupuytren disease cultures increased mitogenesis by up to fivefold. 57 TGF‐β1 also plays a role in Peyronie's disease pathogenesis. Peyronie's disease plaques arise following penile trauma leading to deposition of fibrin, which attracts inflammatory cells (eg macrophages, mast cells), which in turn secrete TGF‐β1. 58, 59, 60

### Postapproval clinical experience in the treatment of dupuytren's contracture with collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH): the first 1, 000 days [^114ZMfui]. Hand (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Dupuytren's contracture (DC) is a connective tissue disorder of the hand in which the development of tissue abnormalities and subsequent contractures within the palmar fascia can cause flexion deformity of the affected fingers, subsequently limiting use of the hand. The disease may initially present as firm nodule(s) in the palm proximal to the metacarpophalangeal (MP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints and then can progress to form cords. Additionally, nodules, skin pitting, dimpling, tenderness, and contracture of the MP or PIP joints may be present upon examination. Typically, the disease progresses slowly, and patients may put off consulting their physician until the degree of disability keeps them from performing work or recreational activities that require manual dexterity of the affected hand; Dupuytren's contracture can also limit a patient's ability to perform activities of daily living.

Epidemiology

Dupuytren's disease (DD) is thought to mainly affect older persons of northern European descent. The prevalence of DD varies with age, population groups surveyed (e.g. geographic location, age, patient characteristics), and methods of data collection, with estimated prevalence rates ranging widely from 0.2% (in the general population) to as high as 56% (in subgroups of patients with factors associated with DD). DiBenedetti estimated an incidence of 3 cases per 10,000 people in a large US population survey, consistent with an earlier survey in a British population. Bilateral disease appears to be more common in men than women. Men typically present sooner than women, perhaps by as much as 10 years, and often present with more severe disease. A familial component is recognized, with a pattern of inheritance suggesting an autosomal dominance with variable penetrance.

Results

GWAS

In the GWAS discovery phase, we used the Illumina HumanCoreExome array to test 238,825 common-frequency variants (MAF ≥ 0.05) for association with DD in 3,871 UK case subjects and 4,686 UK control subjects, after quality control. This yielded genome-wide significant associations (p ≤ 5 × 10⁻⁸) at 14 variants, including 8 of the 9 previously reported loci (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Manhattan Plot for the Discovery Association Analysis

The horizontal blue line represents p = 1 × 10⁻⁵ and the horizontal red line indicates p = 5 × 10⁻⁸. Variants colored in cyan are suggestive of association (p ≤ 1 × 10⁻⁵) and those colored red have genome-wide significant association (p ≤ 5 × 10⁻⁸). The nine previously reported associated loci are indicated by an open circle surrounding the SNP.

In the replication phase, we genotyped 45 SNPs with p ≤ 1 × 10⁻⁵ in the discovery set, in a total of 4,041 case subjects and 8,251 control subjects from the UK, the Netherlands, and Germany. In addition, there were a further four SNPs with suggestive association (p ≤ 1 × 10⁻⁵) and one with genome-wide significant association (rs246105, frequency 20.1%, OR = 0.796, p = 1.34 × 10⁻⁸) for which we were unable to design an appropriate assay (Tables 1 and S1). After fixed-effects meta-analysis, we confirmed association at all 9 previously reported loci and defined 15 further loci with genome-wide significant evidence of association (Table 1; Figure S6).

### Nongenetic factors associated with dupuytren's disease: a systematic review [^1133LFYp]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Dupuytren's disease is a common complex disease caused by genetic and nongenetic factors. The role of many nongenetic risk factors is still unclear and debatable. This study aimed to systematically review the association between Dupuytren's disease and nongenetic risk factors.

Methods

A search strategy was developed based on the Population, Exposure, Comparison, Outcomes and Study framework. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-compliant literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to November of 2018. Title and abstract and then full-text screening against eligibility criteria was performed independently by two reviewers, and consensus was achieved by a third reviewer. The Effective Public Health Practice Project and the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine tools were used to assess study quality and to evaluate the level of evidence of included studies, respectively.

Results

Reviewers identified 4434 studies, of which 54 were included in the analysis. There was strong evidence for the association between Dupuytren's disease and advanced age, male sex, family history of Dupuytren's disease, and diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, heavy alcohol drinking, cigarette smoking, and manual work exposure showed a significant dose-response relationship. The quality of the included studies was mainly low or moderate, and most studies were level 3 or 4 on the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine scale.

Conclusions

The study results show a strong association between Dupuytren's disease and advanced age, male sex, family history of Dupuytren's disease, diabetes mellitus, heavy alcohol drinking, cigarette smoking, and manual work exposure. Further studies are required to explain the causal relationship of these associations.

### Dupuytren's disease predicts increased all-cause and cancer-specific mortality: analysis of a large cohort from the U.K. clinical practice research datalink [^1146ZFzB]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Dupuytren's disease is a benign, progressive fibroproliferative disease of the palmar fascia that results in flexion contractures of the involved digits and significant functional impairment. It is also associated with debilitating fibromatoses of the feet (Ledderhose disease) and the penis (Peyronie's disease). Dupuytren's disease is very common, affecting 5 percent to 30 percent of people in populations of European descent. In the United Kingdom in 2004, the incidence of new consultations with general practitioners for Dupuytren's disease was 34.3 per 100,000 men/year, and there is evidence that the prevalence is increasing.

A genetic predisposition to Dupuytren's disease is well recognized. – There is also a clear nongenetic influence on development of the disease: reported risk factors in hospital-based case-control studies include hypercholesterolemia, smoking and alcohol intake, diabetes, and epilepsy. Rheumatoid arthritis and increasing body mass index are thought to be protective against developing the disease.

Patients with Dupuytren's disease have also been reported to have a higher mortality rate than unaffected control subjects in small studies from Scandinavia and Iceland. – This may be accounted for by the aforementioned nongenetic risk factors, but these studies were too small to answer this question. Despite being benign, Dupuytren's disease shares many clinical and cell biological features with cancer, namely, increased cell proliferation, formation of tumor-like nodules, and the propensity to local recurrence after excision. Furthermore, a Swedish study has suggested a higher cancer incidence in patients with the disease. It is feasible that beyond the known common risk factors for Dupuytren's disease and cancer, other factors (for example, genetic variants predisposing to the disease) might also predispose to certain types of cancer and again lead to an excess mortality rate in those affected.

The aim of this study was to identify any excess mortality associated with the diagnosis of Dupuytren's disease compared with matched control patients in a large prospective cohort within the United Kingdom, and to quantify the contribution of environmental risk factors to mortality.

### A genome-wide association study of dupuytren disease reveals 17 additional variants implicated in fibrosis [^115vqA9f]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

ITGA11 encodes integrin alpha11, a member of the integrin family of cell-surface-adhesion receptors. These type I transmembrane proteins act as heterodimers composed of an α and β subunit, and through binding to the ECM transmit both mechanical and chemical signals to the cell. Heterodimers consisting of integrin α11β1 are fibroblast-specific collagen receptors, which are mechanically induced, and regulate myofibroblast differentiation. Furthermore, ITGA11 has recently been shown to be overexpressed in lung samples from individuals with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Also, a variant near PTK2 (encoding focal adhesion kinase [FAK] [MIM:]) at chromosome 8q24.3 showed suggestive evidence of association in our discovery cohort (rs12677559, OR = 0.86, p = 5.75 × 10 −6; Table S3; Figure S9 A), but we were unable to design a suitable assay within the replication set. FAK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is an integral part of focal adhesion structureand is phosphorylated in response to integrin engagement. In a mouse model of hypertrophic scarring, another example of a localized fibrosis, fibroblast-specific FAK knockout attenuated both fibrosis and inflammation (see below), emphasizing the importance of this signaling pathway in fibrosis.

### Postapproval clinical experience in the treatment of dupuytren's contracture with collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH): the first 1, 000 days [^114uy9BL]. Hand (2014). Low credibility.

Dupuytren's contracture is a benign fibromatosis of the palmar and digital fascia of the hand of uncertain etiology, resulting in nodules and cords beneath the skin of the palm of the hands that may lead to the development of contractures. Surgical intervention is often considered when metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint contracture is 30° or more, or when there is any degree of proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint contracture. Collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) is a nonsurgical, minimally invasive enzymatic drug indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Dupuytren's contracture (DC) and palpable cord. CCH has been available for approximately 3.5 years, and postapproval experience indicates that the effectiveness of CCH is equivalent to or better than efficacy observed in clinical trials, as seen by lower injection rates to achieve clinical success. Postapproval experience has shown a risk-benefit profile that favors CCH for patients not indicated for surgery based on current recommendations and shows also that treating earlier-stage vs later-stage joint contracture results in significantly better outcomes on average. Postapproval surveillance reveals a safety profile similar to that observed in clinical trials. Nonserious adverse events are mainly local reactions; tendon rupture, a serious adverse event, is reported rarely in the clinical practice setting and at a lower rate than in clinical trials. Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) training is designed to mitigate benefit vs risk to achieve safe and effective use of CCH.

One region of interest is on chromosome 7, where EPDR1 was found to be significant in 10 different tissue panels (most significant in lung tissue). This region has been previously investigated because of its strong association signal (Odds Ratio 1.93 and) with DD (Ng et al. 2017). The variant with the strongest association in this region, rs16879765, is in an intron of EPDR1. Although the decreased secretion of the nearby WNT‐agonist SFRP4 was correlated with the high‐risk genotype (Ng et al. 2017), genetic and functional evidence point toward EPDR1 being the disease‐relevant gene for this region, which has been functionally validated as contributing to myofibroblast contractility (Staats et al. 2016). All three transcripts of EPDR1 are found in affected DD tissue and knockdown of EPDR1 attenuates contractility in fibroblast‐populated collagen lattice assays (Staats et al. 2016).

### Dupuytren in a child: rare presentation of a rare clinical entity [^116uVpej]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Dupuytren disease in children younger than 10 years is rare and only 8 histologically proven cases have been reported. A histologically proven Dupuytren disease in a 10-year-old with an uncommon clinical presentation as a nodule on the radial side of the middle phalanx of the little finger is documented. Dupuytren's disease should be in the differential diagnosis in cases of nodules and contractures in the palm and fingers of children.

### The mechanism of skin graft contraction: an update on current research and potential future therapies [^1134kUdA]. Burns (2008). Low credibility.

Skin graft contraction is a common and intractable problem. The current treatments focus on mechanical opposition of contractile forces using splints and on compression of the grafted skin with pressure garments. For the patients, this causes significant morbidity with restriction of joint mobility and often requires multiple episodes of corrective surgery. Despite 50 years of research in this area, treatment and prevention of graft contraction have progressed very little and understanding of the underlying mechanism remains poor. This article reviews the clinical problem and the approaches used to prevent or treat graft contracture. It also considers to what extent we currently understand the cellular basis of graft contracture, based on in vitro models of skin contraction and in vivo observation of patients.

There is a well-established association with ectopic fibrosis in Dupuytren's disease, but involvement of the wrist is rare. To our knowledge there have been only 5 cases reported in the literature. The authors present a patient with Dupuytren's disease involving only the proximal palm and wrist who presented with functional limitation and a rapid clinical progression.

### Genetic susceptibility to dupuytren disease: association of Zf9 transcription factor gene [^116fMLRf]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) is a key fibrogenic cytokine that has been shown to stimulate fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren disease. Zf9 is a transcription factor that increases TGF-beta 1 expression in tissue. The authors previously demonstrated a lack of association between common TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 polymorphisms and Dupuytren disease. Therefore, Zf9 transcription factor represents an additional candidate susceptibility gene for investigating hereditary predisposition to Dupuytren disease. Dupuytren disease, or Dupuytren contracture, is a progressive and recurrent fibroproliferative disease of unknown etiology that affects the human hands. It is often a familial disorder affecting Northern European Caucasians. Genes implicated in the development of Dupuytren disease have not yet been found. Using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment polymorphism method, the authors genotyped a novel single nucleotide polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of the Zf9 gene. A case-control association study of 138 patients with Dupuytren disease versus 255 controls demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the genotype and allele frequencies between patients and controls for Zf9 gene polymorphism. Presence of the G allele versus the A allele is associated with an increased risk of developing Dupuytren disease (odds ratio, 1.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 2.9). The authors believe this to be the first report of a positive genetic association study in Dupuytren disease using single nucleotide polymorphisms.

### Dupuytren's disease is a work-related disorder: results of a population-based cohort study [^114hx7VA]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dupuytren's disease is a common connective tissue disorder of the hand. Patients develop fibrous nodules in the palm of the hand, which can evolve into cords which may contract, causing one or more fingers to be pulled into a flexed position. The disease is present in up to 31.6% of the general population, and men are more frequently affected than women. Although the disease was named after French surgeon Baron Dupuytren who famously operated on his wine merchant, Sir Henry Cline of London was one of the first to give an appropriate description of the affection in 1777. He addressed the palmar fibrosis as a disease of 'laborious people'. Nowadays, there is consensus about certain risk factors for Dupuytren's disease, such as smoking, alcohol intake, diabetes mellitus (DM) and genetic predisposition, but the role of manual work exposure in the disease aetiology remains unclear.

Several studies on the association between manual work exposure and Dupuytren's disease show conflicting results. Although most publications on this subject report a positive association between manual work and Dupuytren's disease, the majority of these studies were limited by a highly selected or small study population, and the lack of adjustment for important confounders. Obtaining a definitive answer to the question of whether Dupuytren's disease is an occupational disease would give us more insight into its aetiology, and would be of great value in informing preventative strategies.

In this population-based cohort study, we aimed to investigate whether occupational exposure to manual work is associated with Dupuytren's disease, and whether a dose–response relationship is present.

### Cellular census of human fibrosis defines functionally distinct stromal cell types and States [^115bXFHi]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Fibrosis is defined as the accumulation of excess matrix proteins and contributes to a significant proportion of the mortality in developed nations. Important mediators of fibrosis are collagen-producing stromal cells, the activation of which coordinates a pathogenic system that can compromise organ function. To develop effective therapeutics, we must first have a detailed understanding of the states, subtypes and functional properties of fibrotic stromal cells –. A major challenge in studying fibrosis is the availability of well-characterised patient samples to dissect the molecular landscape of these disorders.

Patients with localized fibrotic diseases are a rich source of readily accessible early stage tissue. Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a common and progressive fibroproliferative disorder of the palmar and digital fascia of the hand and, in developed nations affects 12% of those aged 55 years, increasing to 29% of those 75 years and older. The initial clinical presentation is the appearance of a firm nodule in the palm that expands into fibrous collagenous cords extending into the digits. Dupuytren's nodules, which represent the early stage of the disease, are a highly cellular fibrotic ecosystem and are an important model to examine developing fibrosis in humans.

In this study, using clinical samples from patients with DD, we construct a molecular taxonomy of human fibrosis. Our single cell atlas of the fibrotic milieu elucidates functionally distinct stromal cell types and states, including ICAM1 + fibroblasts and CD82 high myofibroblasts that contribute discrete pro-fibrotic functions. In addition, we demonstrate that the tetraspanin CD82 is expressed on human myofibroblasts and functions to regulate cell cycle progression in this population.

### Molecular phenotypic descriptors of dupuytren's disease defined using informatics analysis of the transcriptome [^117HGqNc]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a fibroproliferative disorder of unknown etiopathogenesis, which may cause progressive, permanent contracture of digits. Previous studies provide compelling evidence that genetic alterations play an important role. Macroscopically affected areas demonstrate phenotypic differences between the two structurally distinct fibrotic elements in DD (ie, the nodule and the cord). In this study, we set out to (1) compare gene expression profiles between DD and transverse carpal fascia of control subjects (external control); (2) profile DD cords and nodules from the palm against the unaffected transverse palmar fascia (internal control); and (3) identify biologically important candidate genes from the transcriptome profiles.

Methods

RNA samples from DD nodules (n = 4), cords (n = 4), and internal control (n = 4) as well as external control (n = 4) from unaffected individuals were subjected to differential gene expression profile analysis. Changes of more than 2-fold in DD groups and controls were recorded. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions were performed to validate 16 implicated genes, which included developmental control genes, matrix metalloproteinases, and apoptotic genes.

Results

Several genes associated with DD formation were common across all 6 pairwise analyses. Genes markedly upregulated shared common expression levels across all pairwise analysis studies. Pairs involving the DD nodule arrays were notably distinguishable from all other permutations. The majority of genes dysregulated in the DD cords demonstrated an increase in fold change when compared with the DD nodule tissues. Key collagens, collagenases, metalloproteinases, and inhibitors were identified. Genes involved in cytoskeleton development and lipid metabolism were markedly dysregulated. Confirmations of these alterations were obtained in quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.

Conclusions

These data demonstrate a gradation in expression of certain genes in DD tissue phenotypes compared with control fascia. Transcriptome profiling is predictive not only of disease but also of disease phenotype. These results indicate a number of important candidate genes associated with DD formation, which may provide clues for molecular mechanisms involved in DD pathogenesis.

### A single-cell and spatial genomics atlas of human skin fibroblasts reveals shared disease-related fibroblast subtypes across tissues [^113xv35o]. Nature Immunology (2025). High credibility.

We identified distinct fibroblast compositions for each scarring risk category (Fig. 4b). Low scarring risk diseases were characterized by a high prevalence of F1: superficial (CRABP + CYP27B1 +) and F3: FRC-like fibroblasts (CXCL9 + / ADAMDEC1 +) (Fig. 4b), without notable F6–F8 myofibroblast populations. This finding agrees with the regenerative-associated gene profile of disease-associated F1: superficial fibroblasts and a role for F3: FRC-like fibroblasts in maintaining immune niches.

Diseases with scarring risk were characterized by a uniquely high prevalence of F6: inflammatory myofibroblasts, which was not observed in low scarring risk or established fibrosis (Fig. 4b). F7: myofibroblasts were observed at a similar prevalence in diseases with scarring risk and established fibrosis. These data point toward F6: inflammatory myofibroblast as a population influencing scarring risk, but which are largely absent in established fibrosis. F8: fascia-like myofibroblasts were also elevated in established fibrosis but were predominantly observed in Dupuytren contracture, a fibroproliferative disease of the palmar fascia (Fig. 4a).

### Targeting myofibroblasts as a treatment modality for dupuytren disease [^112X5RjS]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Currently, no treatment corrects the contractile nature of Dupuytren myofibroblasts (DMFs) or prevents recurrence following surgery. Antifibrotic and proadipogenic growth factors are released when adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are cultured with platelet-rich plasma (PRP), a platelet concentration from whole blood. Reprograming myofibroblasts into adipocytes via growth factors is proposed as a powerful potential tool to target fibrosis. We aimed to assess whether the combination of ASCs and PRP reprograms DMFs into adipocytes in vitro and alters their contractile nature in vivo.

Methods

Normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) and DMFs from Dupuytren patients were isolated and cocultured with ASCs and PRP either alone or together. Adipocytes were detected by Oil Red O and perilipin staining. DMFs and NHDFs were transplanted into the forepaws of rats (Rowett Nude [rnu/rnu]) and treated with saline, PRP+ASCs, or collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (clinical comparison) 2 months later. After 2 weeks, the tissue was harvested and subjected to Masson trichrome staining, and collagen I and III and alpha-smooth muscle actin detection by immunohistochemistry.

Results

Myofibroblasts transform into adipocytes upon coculture with PRP+ASCs. DMFs show increased alpha-smooth muscle actin expression in vivo compared with NHDFs, which is significantly decreased after PRP+ASCs and collagenase Clostridium histolyticum treatments. DMFs induce collagen I and III expressions in rat paws compared with NHDFs, with a type III to I ratio increase. Treatment with PRP+ASC reduced the ratio, but collagenase Clostridium histolyticum did not.

Conclusions

Treating DMFs with PRP+ASCs provides factors that induce myofibroblast to adipocyte transformation. This treatment reduces the contractile phenotype and fibrosis markers in vivo. Future studies should detail the mechanism of this conversion.

Clinical Relevance

The combination of PRP and ASCs to induce the differentiation of DMFs into adipocytes may serve to limit surgery to a percutaneous contracture release and biological injection, rather than a moderate or radical fasciectomy, and reduce the recurrence of Dupuytren contracture.

### Dupuytren's disease is a work-related disorder: results of a population-based cohort study [^116MF8rm]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a fibroproliferative disorder of the hands, characterised by the development of fibrous nodules and cords that may cause disabling contractures of the fingers. The role of manual work exposure in the aetiology of DD is controversial. We investigated whether current occupational exposure to manual work is associated with DD, and if there is a dose-response relationship.

Methods

In this population-based cohort analysis, we used data from the UK Biobank cohort. Our primary outcome was the presence of DD. The exposure of interest was manual work, measured for each participant in two different ways to allow two independent analyses to be undertaken: (1) the current manual work status of the occupation at the time of recruitment, and (2) a cumulative manual work exposure score, calculated based on the occupational history. We performed propensity score matching and applied a logistic regression model.

Results

We included 196265 participants for the current manual work analysis, and 96563 participants for the dose-response analysis. Participants whose current occupation usually/always involved manual work were more often affected with DD than participants whose occupation sometimes/never involved manual work (OR 1.29, 95%CI 1.12 to 1.49, p < 0.001). There was a positive dose-response relationship between cumulative manual work exposure score and DD. Each increment in cumulative work exposure score increased the odds by 17% (OR 1.17, 95%CI 1.08 to 1.27, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Manual work exposure is a risk factor for DD, with a clear dose-response relationship. Physicians treating patients should recognise DD as a work-related disorder and inform patients accordingly.

### Adipose-derived stem cells inhibit the contractile myofibroblast in dupuytren's disease [^112NCUWe]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In an attempt to provide minimally invasive treatment for Dupuytren's disease, percutaneous disruption of the affected tissue followed by lipografting is being tested. Contractile myofibroblasts drive this fibroproliferative disorder, whereas stem cells have recently been implicated in preventing fibrosis. Therefore, the authors tested the role of stem cells in modulating myofibroblast activity in Dupuytren's disease.

Methods

The authors compared the effect of co-culturing Dupuytren's myofibroblasts with either adipose-derived or bone-marrow-derived stem cells on isometric force contraction and associated levels of α-smooth muscle actin mRNA and protein expression. The authors also tested the effect of these stem cells on Dupuytren's myofibroblast proliferation and assessed whether this was mediated by cell-to-cell contact or by a paracrine mechanism.

Results

Addition of adipose-derived stem cells to Dupuytren's myofibroblasts reduced the contraction of the latter, with a corresponding reduction of α-smooth muscle actin protein expression, probably through a dilution effect. In contrast, bone marrow-derived stem cells increased myofibroblast contractility. In addition, adipose-derived stem cells inhibit myofibroblast proliferation and mediate these effects by soluble factors, influenced by cell-to-cell contact-dependent signaling.

Conclusion

Adipose-derived stem cells inhibit the contractile myofibroblast in Dupuytren's disease, and these findings lend support to the potential benefit of lipografting in conjunction with aponeurotomy as a novel strategy for the treatment of Dupuytren's disease.

### Prevalence of dupuytren disease in the Netherlands [^114LNEor]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Dupuytren disease is a fibroproliferative disease of palmar fascias of the hand. The prevalence of Dupuytren disease and the association with potential risk factors have been the subject of several studies, although there is a paucity of such data from The Netherlands.

Methods

To study the prevalence of Dupuytren disease, the authors drew a random sample of 1360 individuals, stratified by age, from the northern part of The Netherlands. Of this sample, 763 individuals aged 50 to 89 years participated in this cross-sectional study. The authors examined both hands for signs of Dupuytren disease, and a questionnaire was conducted to identify potential risk factors. The effects of these risk factors were investigated using logistic regression analysis. Additional analyses were performed to develop a logistic prediction model for the prevalence of Dupuytren disease.

Results

The prevalence of Dupuytren disease was 22.1 percent. Nodules and cords were seen in 17.9 percent, and flexion contractures were present in 4.2 percent of the study population. Prevalence increased with age, from 4.9 percent in participants aged 50 to 55 years to 52.6 percent among those aged 76 to 80 years. Men were more often affected than women; 26.4 percent versus 18.6 percent, respectively (p = 0.007). Other significant risk factors were previous hand injury, excessive alcohol consumption, familial occurrence of Dupuytren disease, and presence of Ledderhose disease.

Conclusions

The results show a high prevalence of Dupuytren disease in The Netherlands, particularly the nodular form. Using the developed logistic prediction model, the prevalence of Dupuytren disease can be estimated, based on the presence of significant risk factors.

### Postapproval clinical experience in the treatment of dupuytren's contracture with collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH): the first 1, 000 days [^114hij9U]. Hand (2014). Low credibility.

Finger extension technique

Skin lacerations are common and treatment-related lacerations occurred at a rate of 11% in the clinical trials. Risk of skin tears is greater as severity of contracture increases, and these lacerations occurred primarily in patients who had experienced severe baseline contracture over many years. The cord can become adherent to the skin overlying the cord, which often becomes thin and more easily damaged. Thus, over-strenuous postinjection manipulation should be avoided to reduce the risk of skin laceration, which can also interfere with fitting a good splint because of pain. In the clinical trials, skin lacerations healed without treatment and did not affect clinical outcome. In the published 1-year postapproval surveillance review, skin tear was reported at a rate of 6.5 per 1,000 injections.

Adherence to the recommended CCH postinjection standardized manipulation procedure is advised to reduce the risk of skin tear, especially in more advanced disease. The procedure for finger manipulation is also discussed in the REMS for CCH. Practitioner experience over time helps to reduce the incidence of skin tears, and follow-up care is very important in achieving the desired outcomes. Patients should be instructed to perform daily finger extension and flexion exercises during recovery and not to perform strenuous activity with the injected hand along with the proper, compliant use of nighttime splint.

Erectile function depends on the compliance of penile sinusoids, which is conferred by elastic fibres. In DM, however, the amount of elastic fibres is reduced, accompanied by increased collagen deposition. These changes, along with alterations in smooth muscle, affect sinusoidal histology and function.

In DM, oxidative stress and inflammation can impair matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, resulting in ECM imbalance and fibrosis, which contribute to fibroproliferative dysfunction. Furthermore, DM‐related alterations in MMP activity may impair smooth muscle cell function, reducing structural elasticity and thus decreasing blood flow to the corpora cavernosa. A study by Muniz et al. demonstrated reduced net matrix metalloproteinase‐9 (MMP‐9) activity in patients with diabetic ED, but no significant changes in circulating levels of MMP‐9 or MMP‐2.

Degenerative changes in the tunica albuginea and other penile tissues may lead to insufficient compression of the emissary and subtunical veins, impairing the veno‐occlusive mechanism. Genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) and gene expression analyses have demonstrated that DM may dysregulate fibroproliferative processes, similar to those observed in Peyronie's disease and Dupuytren's contracture, both of which are recognised risk factors for ED. Furthermore, chronic hyperglycaemia can lead to tissue injury and subsequent fibrosis. DM itself is also a risk factor for Peyronie's disease and Dupuytren's contracture.

### Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (Xiaflex) [^114fp6bB]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 6 shows the baseline disease characteristics of patients with Dupuytren's contracture in Studies 1 and 2.

In Studies 1 and 2, the primary endpoint was to evaluate the proportion of patients who achieved a reduction in contracture of the selected primary joint (MP or PIP) to within 0 to 5 degrees of normal, 30 days after the last injection of that joint on Days 30, 60, or 90 (after up to 3 injections). As shown in Table 7, a greater proportion of XIAFLEX-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients achieved the primary endpoint.

The proportion of patients who achieved a contracture reduction of the primary joint to 0 to 5 degrees after the first injection was 39% and 1% in Study 1 and 27% and 5% in Study 2 in the XIAFLEX and placebo groups respectively.

XIAFLEX-treated patients, compared to placebo-treated patients, showed a greater increase from baseline in the range of motion of MP and PIP joints (see Table 8).

Recurrence

A long-term, observational, Year 2 to Year 5, follow-up study (Study 4) was undertaken to evaluate recurrence of contracture and long-term safety in subjects who received up to 8 single injections of XIAFLEX 0.58 mg in a previous Phase 3 open-label or double-blind with open-label extension study. Of the 950 patients eligible for Study 4, only 645 patients enrolled. Of the 645 patients enrolled, 30% discontinued the study. Recurrence was assessed in successfully treated joints (i.e., subjects had a reduction in contracture to 5 degrees or less at the Day 30 evaluation after the last injection of XIAFLEX in a previous study) and was defined as an increase in joint contracture by at least 20 degrees in the presence of a palpable cord, or the joint underwent medical or surgical intervention primarily to correct a new or worsening Dupuytren's contracture in that joint. Data on remaining recurrence free following successful treatment with XIAFLEX are provided in Figure 1.

### A genome-wide association study of dupuytren disease reveals 17 additional variants implicated in fibrosis [^113BnDAk]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

DDR2 expression has also been shown to be increased both in mouse models of osteoarthritis (OA) and in human OA. In this context, the effect of DDR2 is mediated by its induction of matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13), the major MMP responsible for type II collagen degradation in OA. Decreased expression of DDR2 in heterozygous knockout mice lead to the attenuation of OA after joint destabilization. This raises the possibility of cross talk between DDR2 and MMP pathways that may be relevant in DD pathogenesis. DDR2 represents an attractive therapeutic target in DD and other fibrotic diseases and is currently under active investigation by several pharmaceutical companies.

Matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14 or MT1-MMP) is a type 1 transmembrane protein and member of the MMP family of proteases, initially characterized for their ability to degrade the extracellular matrix. MMP14 was the first membrane-bound MMP to be discovered and was initially characterized as a pro-MMP2 activator, though now at least 42 substrates have been defined, including fibrillar collagen and the WNT antagonist DKK1. There is some evidence for the involvement of MMP14 in DD pathogenesis. In clinical trials, broad-spectrum MMP inhibition caused some individuals to develop DD.MMP14 is overexpressed in DD nodules, and knockdown of MMP14 in DD-derived cells reduced both contraction and MMP2 activation in vitro. Interestingly, knockdown of MMPs including MMP14 did not change the rate of collagen breakdown, suggesting that non-proteolytic effects of MMP14 are responsible for the pro-fibrotic phenotype. Further characterization of the mechanism of action of MMP14 in DD may lead to the validation of this protein as a therapeutic target in fibrosis.

### Transforming growth factor-beta1 stimulation enhances dupuytren's fibroblast contraction in response to uniaxial mechanical load within a 3-dimensional collagen gel [^111jrkA1]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

A function of fibroblasts is the generation of cytomechanical force within their surrounding extracellular matrix. Abnormalities in force generation may be the cause of many pathologic conditions including scarring, and some fibroproliferative disorders such as Dupuytren's disease, which is the focus of this report.

Methods

This work investigated the cytomechanical responses of Dupuytren's-derived fibroblasts to externally applied mechanical force using a culture force monitor model, with and without stimulation with the fibrosis-linked cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). We compared these responses with cytomechanical responses of fibroblasts derived from the transverse carpal ligament.

Results

Dupuytren's fibroblasts display a significantly greater ability to contract a collagen matrix compared with control fibroblasts, with a maximum generated force of 131 dynes (p < .001). These cells did not exhibit a characteristic plateau phase in the contraction, which indicates a delay in achieving tensional homeostasis from Dupuytren's-derived cells. After being subjected to uniaxial overload and underload, Dupuytren's fibroblasts responded by increased force generation, whereas control fibroblasts responded by a reduction in force in response to an overload, and contraction in response to an underload. These changes were exacerbated by the addition of the profibrotic factor TGF-beta1, with a significant increase in generated force for all cell types, in particular during the early phase of fibroblast attachment and contraction, and a positive contraction gradient in response to overloading forces.

Conclusions

These data suggest that cells derived from this fibrotic disease display characteristic abnormalities in force generation profiles. Their default response to loading or underloading is contraction, or increased force generation. This work highlights the role of TGF-beta1 as a mechano-transduction cytokine, which has an influence on the early phase cell of force generation, as well as a role in mechanical responses of cells to external mechanical stimuli. This, in turn, may influence the progression of Dupuytren's disease and the high rates of recurrence seen postoperatively.

### Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (Xiaflex) [^116LjziU]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Collagenases are proteinases that hydrolyze collagen in its native triple helical conformation under physiological conditions, resulting in lysis of collagen deposits.

Injection of XIAFLEX into a Dupuytren's cord, which is comprised mostly of collagen, may result in enzymatic disruption of the cord.

The signs and symptoms of Peyronie's disease are caused by a collagen plaque. Injection of XIAFLEX into a Peyronie's plaque, which is comprised mostly of collagen, may result in enzymatic disruption of the plaque. Following this disruption of the plaque, penile curvature deformity and patient bother caused by Peyronie's disease are reduced [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Results of in vitro studies, including those of explant tissues containing Peyronie's plaques, suggest that XIAFLEX disrupts the predominant collagen found in plaques (Types I and III). At higher doses and longer incubation times, non-fibrillar Type IV collagen was affected causing collagen lysis in small veins, but did not cause structural damage to arteries, nerves or large veins which contain Type IV collagen in in vitro or in vivo studies.

Results of in vitro studies suggest that the collagenases (AUX-I and AUX-II) worked synergistically to provide hydrolyzing activity towards collagen. However, there are no clinical data regarding the relative contributions of the individual collagenases (AUX-I or AUX-II) to the efficacy of XIAFLEX in the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture or Peyronie's disease.

Collagen fragments generated from clostridial collagenase have been shown to generate increased vascular permeability, inflammatory responses, and regenerative changes. However, the effects of the formation of the collagen fragments derived from the collagen plaque are unknown.

### Tamoxifen decreases fibroblast function and downregulates TGF (beta2) in dupuytren's affected palmar fascia [^115vXDis]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Dupuytren's contracture is a fibroproliferative disorder that is associated with increased collagen deposition. Isoforms of transforming growth factor beta (TGF(beta)), normally TGF(beta1) and TGF(beta2), are involved in the progressive fibrosis of Dupuytren's disease. It has been suggested that downregulation of TGF(beta) may be useful in the treatment of the condition. Tamoxifen, a synthetic nonsteroidal antiestrogen, is known to modulate the production of TGF(beta). This study examined the role of tamoxifen in decreasing fibroblast function and downregulating TGF(beta2).

Methods

Primary cultures of fibroblasts were obtained from Dupuytren's affected fascia and carpal tunnel affected fascia as a control. Collagen lattices were prepared and populated with the fibroblasts. The fibroblast-populated collagen lattices (FPCL) were then measured for contraction every 24 h for 5 days. Supernatant was obtained from the culture medium following completion of the FPCL portion of the experiment and used for a TGF(beta2) immunoassay.

Results

Dupuytren's affected fibroblasts contracted the FPCLs significantly more than carpal tunnel control fibroblasts. Treating the fibroblasts with tamoxifen caused a decreased contraction rate in both Dupuytren's affected fibroblasts and carpal tunnel controls. There was increased TGF(beta2) expression in the Dupuytren's affected fascia group compared to the carpal tunnel control group. Tamoxifen decreased TGF(beta2) expression in Dupuytren's affected fascia group but not in the carpal tunnel control group.

Conclusion

TGF(beta) appears to be the key cytokine in the fibrogenic nature of Dupuytren's disease. Tamoxifen treatment has been demonstrated to decrease the function of fibroblasts derived from Dupuytren's affected fascia and downregulated TGF(beta2) production in these same fibroblasts. These data suggest a method to manipulate and control Dupuytren's contracture in the clinical setting.

### Dupuytren's disease predicts increased all-cause and cancer-specific mortality: analysis of a large cohort from the U.K. clinical practice research datalink [^112UNRm2]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
Baseline Characteristics According to Dupuytren's Disease Status in the U.K. Clinical Research Practice Datalink Database from 1995 to 2013

We used logistic regression to report odds ratios between cases of Dupuytren's disease and their matched control cases for potential confounders defined from the literature, namely, body mass index, smoking, alcohol, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, epilepsy, and rheumatoid arthritis. When odds ratios were found to be significantly increased in Dupuytren's disease compared with Dupuytren's disease–free patients, they were included in the multivariable model.

We used Cox proportional hazards models stratified by matched sets to calculate hazard ratios according to Dupuytren's disease status. We evaluated the effect of the disease on all-cause mortality and our predefined list of secondary outcomes. We tested the proportional hazards assumption using Schoenfeld's residuals. Where this was violated, we analyzed survival in sections determined by the time point where there was deviation from proportionality, using the method of episode splitting to address time-varying covariates. This method is recommended as a clear and simple approach to nonproportionality in the event that only one covariate, or a few covariates, is nonproportional. 22

We did not adjust for age, sex, or location, as these variables were matched for in our selection of control patients. We performed stepwise adjustment of our model using the following confounders: smoking status, diabetes mellitus, body mass index, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Our final multivariable model included only smoking, body mass index, and diabetic status. We stratified patients with categorical diagnoses into three groups (diagnosed prior to the index date, diagnosed after the index date, or never diagnosed) and also evaluated the effect of body mass index and smoking exposure (defined above) on our primary and secondary outcomes.

### Mechanisms of fibrosis: therapeutic translation for fibrotic disease [^111p1UCA]. Nature Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

Fibrosis is a pathological feature of most chronic inflammatory diseases. Fibrosis, or scarring, is defined by the accumulation of excess extracellular matrix components. If highly progressive, the fibrotic process eventually leads to organ malfunction and death. Fibrosis affects nearly every tissue in the body. Here we discuss how key components of the innate and adaptive immune response contribute to the pathogenesis of fibrosis. We also describe how cell-intrinsic changes in important structural cells can perpetuate the fibrotic response by regulating the differentiation, recruitment, proliferation and activation of extracellular matrix-producing myofibroblasts. Finally, we highlight some of the key mechanisms and pathways of fibrosis that are being targeted as potential therapies for a variety of important human diseases.

### Busting the myth of methotrexate chronic hepatotoxicity [^113fA4Bc]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Methotrexate is a key component of the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases and the mainstay of therapy in rheumatoid arthritis. Hepatotoxicity has long been a concern for prescribers envisaging long-term treatment with methotrexate for their patients. However, the putative liver toxicity of methotrexate should be evaluated in the context of advances in our knowledge of the pathogenesis and natural history of liver disease, especially non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Notably, patients with NAFLD are at increased risk for methotrexate hepatotoxicity, and methotrexate can worsen the course of NAFLD. Understanding the mechanisms of acute hepatotoxicity can facilitate the interpretation of elevated concentrations of liver enzymes in this context. Liver fibrosis and the mechanisms of fibrogenesis also need to be considered in relation to chronic exposure to methotrexate. A number of non-invasive tests for liver fibrosis are available for use in patients with rheumatic disease, in addition to liver biopsy, which can be appropriate for particular individuals. On the basis of the available evidence, practical suggestions for pretreatment screening and long-term monitoring of methotrexate therapy can be made for patients who have (or are at risk for) chronic liver disease.

### Treatment of Peyronie's disease with PDE5 inhibitors: an antifibrotic strategy [^116zF9j7]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

Peyronie's disease (PD) is a localized fibrotic condition of the tunica albuginea that is associated with risk factors for corpora cavernosa fibrosis (such as advanced age and diabetes) and Dupuytren contracture, another localized fibrotic process. Most of the current pharmacological treatments for PD are not based on antifibrotic approaches that have shown promising results in animal models and clinical efficacy in other fibrotic conditions, which may explain why they are generally unsuccessful. Evidence gathered in human specimens and animal models of PD have elucidated aspects of its etiology and histopathology, showing that overexpression of transforming growth factor beta1, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, reactive oxygen species and other profibrotic factors, which are, in most cases, assumed to be induced by trauma to the tunica albuginea, leads to myofibroblast accumulation and excessive deposition of collagen. At the same time, a steady overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, leading to increased nitric oxide and cGMP levels, seems to act as an endogenous antifibrotic mechanism. This process has also been reported in corporal and cardiovascular fibrosis, and has led to the demonstration that long-term continuous administration of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors counteracts the development of a PD-like fibrotic plaque in a rat model, and later extended to the prevention of corporal fibrosis in animal models of erectile dysfunction.

### Vascular and collagen target: a rational approach to hypertrophic scar management [^113SBVGw]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Collagenase intervention

Collagenase is a metal-binding protease that is a member of the MMP protein family and it was first identified in 1962. Collagenase hydrolyzes the triple helical domain present in the four most abundant collagens (types I, II, III, and IV). Collagenase has been employed as a treatment for diseases caused by excessive collagen deposition, such as Dupuytren's contracture. Compared with surgical fasciotomy, collagenase injection is more efficient in treating Dupuytren's contracture, producing fewer side effects with a greater reduction in contracture. Collagenase administration is also widely used for the clinical management of Peyronie's disease, intervertebral disk herniation, and wound debridement.

Using the popular rabbit ear scar wound-healing model, Jia et al. reported that collagenase administration significantly reduced the growth of scar tissue compared with the untreated control. Bae-Harboe et al. treated earlobe keloids in six patients by injecting a commercial collagenase preparation combined with compression therapy over a 12-month period and observed that the size of individual keloids was reduced by more than 50%; however, complete regression was not achieved. Notably, a number of adverse side effects were reported in this study and included injection site swelling, tenderness, and self-resolvable ulceration. However, Kang et al. observed the recurrence of keloids, and HS was observed in some patients within 6 months after receiving collagenase injection. The apparent inconsistency between these two studies might be attributed to the absence of compression therapy in the latter study; however, from a patient perspective, collagenase is an effective treatment for keloids. The potential mechanism underlying collagen disruption for scar remediation could be that changes in collagen stiffness have an effect on fibroblast activity. There is evidence that changes in matrix stiffness can regulate cell behavior.

These findings also suggest that the combined application of vascular- and collagen-targeted therapies delivers improved therapeutic outcomes for patients. Several therapies that target collagen are now available, for example, MMPs such as collagenase, gelatinase, and stromalysin, as well as other proteases that hydrolyze components of the extracellular matrix. However, the clinical application of collagenase therapy remains largely overlooked and unutilized. It has yet to be included in standard recommendations and clinical guidelines for the management of pathological scars. Exploring clinical applications for these bioactive compounds holds promise for the management of mature scar tissue.

METHODS

Ethical Approval

This study was approved by the Independent Scientific Advisory Committee for Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency Database Research (protocol 14_196R).

Data Sources and Study Participants

We analyzed data from the United Kingdom Clinical Research Practice Datalink, a primary care database containing the anonymized health records of approximately 6.9 percent of the U.K. population, for the period between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2013. Subjects were eligible for inclusion after completing 1 year of registration in a Clinical Research Practice Datalink–contributing, research-quality general practice. Dupuytren's disease–exposed subjects were identified according to a Read code list defined independently by two clinically qualified researchers (R.K. and D.F.), with consensus reached by a third (D.P.-A.). (See Table, Supplemental Digital Content 1, which lists of all Read codes used to identify cases of Dupuytren's disease within the Clinical Research Practice Datalink database and all risk factors studied, including smoking, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, epilepsy, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and alcohol consumption,.) We excluded patients who did not have a recorded gender and those who were less than 18 or over 109 years of age on the date of diagnosis. The date of diagnosis was defined as the date that the patient had his or her first consultation with a general practitioner regarding Dupuytren's disease.

We matched each Dupuytren's disease participant to five disease-free control patients, who were defined as those never having been diagnosed with Dupuytren's disease at the time of data extraction (August 25, 2015). Control patients were matched by age (± 2 years), sex, and general practitioner's practice.

Data extracted from the U.K. Clinical Research Practice Datalink included demographic details and diagnostic and therapeutic data regarding potential confounding factors, namely, body mass index, smoking and alcohol status, diabetes, epilepsy, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypercholesterolemia. Previously validated code lists were identified for smoking status, alcohol use, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, and rheumatoid arthritis. (See Document, Supplemental Digital Content 2, which contains a list of references that were used to identify previously validated code lists for risk factors,.) A code list was generated for Dupuytren's disease, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia, as described above. Information regarding mortality rate was extracted using data linkage from the Office of National Statistics.

Hypertrophic scarring (HSc) is an age-old problem that still affects millions of people physically, psychologically, and economically. Despite advances in surgical techniques and wound care, prevention and treatment of HSc remains a challenge. Elucidation of factors involved in the development of this common fibroproliferative disorder is crucial for further progress in preventive and/or therapeutic measures. Our knowledge about pathophysiology of HSc at the cellular and molecular level has grown considerably in recent decades. In this article, current knowledge of predisposing factors and the cellular and molecular mechanisms of HSc has been reviewed.

RESULTS

Baseline Characteristics

We identified 41,965 eligible patients with Dupuytren's disease and matched them to 209,825 control patients. There were 41,438 observed deaths during follow-up, 6016 of which occurred in Dupuytren's disease patients.

Patients with Dupuytren's disease were more likely to have a poor cardiovascular risk profile, including a history of current/past smoking (odds ratio, 2.21; 99% CI, 2.14 to 2.27; p < 0.0001), diabetes mellitus (odds ratio, 1.37; 99% CI, 1.31 to 1.42; p < 0.0001), and hypercholesterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia (odds ratio, 1.27; 99% CI, 1.22 to 1.33; p < 0.0001). They were no more likely to have a diagnosis of epilepsy than control patients. We found no protective association between rheumatoid arthritis and Dupuytren's disease. Compared with participants with body mass index of 25 kg/m² or less, other participants were less likely to have Dupuytren's disease.

There was a high level of missing data for ethnicity (80.4 percent for Dupuytren's disease patients and 82.3 percent for controls). This is similar to previously published literature on the completeness of ethnicity data within the U.K. Clinical Research Practice Datalink database. There have previously been observed differences in mortality rates among ethnic groups; however, this effect has been attributed to differences in socioeconomic status, body mass index, and health behaviors (e.g. smoking and alcohol). We accounted for these factors in our multivariable model.

### Dupuytren's contracture… [^116ViwC1]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The incidence of Dupuytren's contracture in 405 male patients was studied with particular reference to its association with alcoholism and hepatic cirrhosis. As in reports by others, Dupuytren's contracture rarely occurred in patients of less than 40 years of age. In ages 41 to 50 years there was no apparent increase among alcoholics when compared to nonalcoholic controls of the same age. However, in ages 51 to 60 years Dupuytren's contracture was significantly increased in alcoholics when compared to controls. These differences were unrelated to the presence or absence of hepatic cirrhosis. Su C, Patek AJ. Dupuytren's Contracture: Its Association With Alcoholism and Cirrhosis.

Perinatal Nicotine Vaping Exposure Induces Pro-myofibroblastic Phenotype in Rat Bone Marrow-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells 10–2024 By Yu, Celia; Liu, Jie; Sakurai, Reiko;. Source: Reprod Toxicol. 129: 108673 English. Details: Alternative Title: Reprod Toxicol Personal Author: Yu, Celia; Liu, Jie; Sakurai, Reiko; Wang, Ying; Afrose, Leela;. More +. Description: Perinatal nicotine exposure via tobacco smoking results in increased proclivity to chronic lung disease; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We previously demonstrated that in addition to nicotine's direct effects on the developing lung, there are also adverse molecular alterations in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, which are vital to lung injury repair.

At postnatal day 21, offspring BMSCs were isolated and studied for cell proliferation, migration, wound healing response, and expression of key Wnt and PPARγ signaling intermediates and myogenic markers proteins using immunoblotting. Compared to controls, perinatal e-cig exposure resulted in significant decrease in BMSC proliferation, migration, and wound healing response. The expression of key Wnt signaling intermediates and myogenic markers increased significantly, while PPARγ signaling intermediates decreased significantly. Based on these data, we conclude that perinatally e-cig exposed BMSCs demonstrate pro-myofibroblastic phenotype and impaired injury-repair potential, indicating a potentially similar susceptibility to CLD following perinatal nicotine exposure via vaping as seen following parenteral perinatal nicotine exposure.
