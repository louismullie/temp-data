## Question

Treatment option for candidemia in a pregnant patient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment options for candidemia in a pregnant patient. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why candidemia in pregnancy is high-stakes. Then, I should verify first-trimester teratogenic risks and the safest systemic option. Next, I will examine dosing choices for amphotericin B and the role of lipid formulations. After that, I need to check source control, especially catheter management. Then, I should review duration and monitoring, including ophthalmologic and neurologic assessments. Finally, I will consider second- and third-trimester options, species-specific issues, and neonatal implications, and close with a concise, guideline-concordant recommendation summary.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and urgency. Candidemia in pregnancy is rare but associated with high mortality, and delays in effective therapy worsen outcomes, so I need to ensure early, appropriate antifungal therapy and prompt source control are prioritized to mitigate maternal and fetal risk [^116NncJe] [^112xTzaw].

> Now, I should verify first-trimester teratogenic risks and the safest systemic agent. Fluconazole has documented associations with spontaneous abortion and congenital anomalies in the first trimester, including cardiac septal defects and a described fluconazole embryopathy with chronic high-dose exposure, so it should be avoided in the first trimester unless benefits clearly outweigh risks; azoles in general are best avoided early in gestation, and voriconazole is contraindicated in pregnancy, which pushes me toward amphotericin B as the preferred systemic therapy in early pregnancy [^115o713P] [^115KNcRd] [^113bnKG2].

> Wait, let me verify the preferred amphotericin formulation and dosing. Extensive clinical experience with amphotericin B deoxycholate has not shown teratogenicity, and lipid formulations are reasonable alternatives with less nephrotoxicity; typical dosing is amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.7–1.0 mg/kg IV daily or a lipid formulation such as liposomal amphotericin B 3–5 mg/kg IV daily, with some guidance suggesting 3–4 mg/kg for lipid formulations in pregnancy, and using ideal body weight may minimize fetal exposure while maintaining efficacy; I should confirm that these ranges align with contemporary guidance, which they do [^113bnKG2] [^1121fSKo] [^1121fSKo] [^115xeM1k].

> Hold on, I should verify source control because it materially alters outcomes. Central venous catheters should be removed or exchanged as early as safely possible when they are the suspected source, as failure to remove infected catheters prolongs bacteremia, increases mortality, and risks persistent infection; this applies across trimesters in pregnancy as well, with individualized risk assessment for timing and access needs [^111eyR7u] [^111iyEuM].

> Next, I should review duration and monitoring. I need to ensure therapy continues for at least 2 weeks after documented clearance of Candida from the bloodstream and resolution of symptoms, with follow-up blood cultures every day or every other day to confirm clearance; a dilated ophthalmologic examination should be performed within the first week after diagnosis to evaluate for endophthalmitis, and if CNS disease is suspected, lumbar puncture and neuroimaging should be pursued, adjusting duration accordingly if CNS involvement is present [^113EUQN6] [^1115UwHA].

> Let me consider second and third trimesters carefully. After the first trimester, if the maternal condition is stable and the isolate is susceptible, a cautious switch to fluconazole for consolidation or step-down therapy can be considered, balancing the ongoing pregnancy risks against the clinical trajectory; however, I should confirm that this is framed as a risk–benefit decision rather than a blanket endorsement, which it is in guideline statements [^1129m3Wt] [^115KNcRd].

> But wait, what if the species is Candida glabrata or another intrinsically fluconazole-resistant organism. I need to ensure I do not default to fluconazole in that scenario, particularly in the first trimester; amphotericin B remains preferred given azole resistance and first-trimester safety concerns, and echinocandins should generally be avoided in pregnancy due to limited human data and animal toxicity signals, reserving them for salvage scenarios if amphotericin is not feasible or tolerated [^112iFkju] [^115KNcRd] [^1171gc5S].

> I should double-check neonatal implications and delivery planning. Infants exposed to chronic amphotericin B near delivery should be monitored for renal dysfunction and hypokalemia, and maternal–fetal medicine should coordinate timing and neonatal assessment plans; if invasive candidiasis was diagnosed late in gestation, heightened neonatal surveillance for congenital candidiasis is warranted even if maternal therapy was effective [^113bnKG2] [^113g2y8M].

> Let me synthesize a practical, trimester-specific approach. In the first trimester, start amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.7–1.0 mg/kg IV daily or a lipid formulation 3–5 mg/kg IV daily, remove or exchange any central venous catheter promptly, obtain daily blood cultures until clearance, and plan ophthalmologic examination within a week; in the second or third trimester, continue amphotericin B or consider a carefully selected switch to fluconazole if clinically stable and the isolate is susceptible, maintaining the same clearance and duration principles and ensuring close maternal–fetal monitoring [^115KNcRd] [^1122Hvhp] [^113EUQN6] [^1115UwHA].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought echinocandins might be reasonable in pregnancy because they are first-line in many nonpregnant adults with candidemia; hold on, I should verify that assumption. The absence of adequate human pregnancy safety data and animal toxicity findings mean echinocandins are not recommended in pregnancy outside salvage contexts, so I need to correct that earlier inclination and keep them reserved for exceptional circumstances where amphotericin cannot be used [^115KNcRd] [^1171gc5S].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan addresses multidisciplinary coordination. Infectious diseases, maternal–fetal medicine, and neonatology should be engaged early, with daily reassessment of cultures, renal and electrolyte monitoring during amphotericin therapy, and individualized decisions about timing of catheter manipulation and delivery planning to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes [^1115UwHA] [^111eyR7u].

For candidemia in pregnancy, **amphotericin B is first-line** [^115KNcRd] because it has no known teratogenic risk and is supported by extensive clinical experience [^113bnKG2]. Lipid formulations (liposomal amphotericin B 3–5 mg/kg/day) are preferred for lower nephrotoxicity and similar efficacy [^1122Hvhp] [^117YV1xP]. Fluconazole is **avoided in the first trimester** due to teratogenic risk [^115o713P]; if needed after the first trimester, use only when benefits clearly outweigh risks [^111ZxT7t]. Echinocandins are not recommended in pregnancy due to limited human data and animal toxicity [^1171gc5S]. Remove or replace infected catheters promptly [^111eyR7u], and treat for at least 2 weeks after clearance of Candida from the bloodstream and symptom resolution [^113EUQN6].

## Pharmacological considerations in pregnancy

### Amphotericin B

- **Safety**: No known teratogenicity; extensive clinical experience in pregnancy [^113bnKG2] [^117YV1xP].
- **Formulations**: Deoxycholate (0.7–1.0 mg/kg/day IV) or lipid formulations (3–5 mg/kg/day IV) [^1121fSKo] [^1122Hvhp].
- **Advantages**: Lipid formulations have lower nephrotoxicity and similar efficacy [^117YV1xP].
- **Monitoring**: Renal function and electrolytes during therapy [^notfound].

---

### Fluconazole

- **First trimester**: Avoid due to teratogenic risk (cardiac septal defects, craniofacial anomalies) [^115o713P] [^115L2VdC].
- **Second/third trimesters**: Use only if benefits clearly outweigh risks [^111ZxT7t].
- **Dosing**: 400–800 mg/day IV/PO if used after the first trimester [^114kmNgH].

---

### Echinocandins (caspofungin, micafungin, anidulafungin)

Echinocandins are **not recommended** in pregnancy due to limited human data and animal toxicity [^115Hsb2e] [^1171gc5S]. Reserve them for refractory cases when amphotericin B is contraindicated or not tolerated.

---

## Clinical management guidelines

### Initial assessment and diagnostic evaluation

Confirm diagnosis with **blood cultures** and species identification [^111QXTCt]. Assess severity and complications — including end-organ involvement (CNS, eyes, hepatosplenic) [^1115UwHA]. Perform a **comprehensive maternal–fetal assessment** to guide therapy and monitoring.

---

### Antifungal therapy recommendations

| **Antifungal agent** | **Recommended use in pregnancy** | **Dosing** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Amphotericin B (deoxycholate) | First-line | 0.7–1.0 mg/kg/day IV | Extensive experience; no known teratogenicity [^113bnKG2] [^111rrgZR] |
| Liposomal amphotericin B | Preferred first-line | 3–5 mg/kg/day IV | Lower nephrotoxicity; similar efficacy [^117YV1xP] |
| Fluconazole | Avoid in first trimester; use cautiously after | 400–800 mg/day IV/PO | Teratogenic risk; use only if benefits outweigh risks [^115o713P] [^1129m3Wt] |
| Echinocandins | Not recommended | N/A | Limited data; animal toxicity [^115Hsb2e] [^1171gc5S] |

---

### Adjunctive measures

Remove or replace **infected catheters** promptly [^117Q1oKW]. Treat for **at least 2 weeks** after clearance of Candida from the bloodstream and symptom resolution [^113EUQN6]. Monitor **maternal and fetal well-being** throughout therapy.

---

## Potential risks and benefits of antifungal therapy

### Maternal risks and benefits

Maternal risks include nephrotoxicity, electrolyte disturbances, and infusion-related reactions, particularly with amphotericin B. Maternal benefits include effective treatment of candidemia, reduced risk of maternal sepsis, and improved overall outcomes [^112xTzaw].

---

### Fetal risks and benefits

Fetal risks include potential exposure to antifungal agents and associated teratogenic risks (notably with fluconazole in the first trimester) [^115o713P]. Fetal benefits include reduced risk of fetal infection, preterm birth, and improved fetal growth and development.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Maternal monitoring**: Renal function, electrolytes, liver function tests, and clinical response.
- **Fetal monitoring**: Regular ultrasounds, fetal growth assessments, and fetal well-being checks.
- **Postpartum monitoring**: Continued antifungal therapy until completion of recommended duration; monitor for relapse or recurrence.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: Amphotericin B (preferably lipid formulation) [^1122Hvhp].
- **Avoid**: Fluconazole in the first trimester; use cautiously after if benefits outweigh risks [^115o713P] [^1129m3Wt].
- **Not recommended**: Echinocandins due to limited data and animal toxicity [^115Hsb2e] [^1171gc5S].
- **Adjunctive measures**: Catheter removal/replacement and at least 2 weeks of therapy after clearance and symptom resolution [^111eyR7u] [^113EUQN6].

---

Amphotericin B is the **preferred therapy** for candidemia in pregnancy, with lipid formulations favored for lower nephrotoxicity. Fluconazole is avoided in the first trimester and used cautiously thereafter, while echinocandins are not recommended. Catheter management and sustained therapy are essential to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes.

Guidelines for the management of patients with invasive candidiasis and mucosal candidiasis were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. These updated guidelines replace the previous guidelines published in the 15 January 2004 issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases and are intended for use by health care providers who care for patients who either have or are at risk of these infections. Since 2004, several new antifungal agents have become available, and several new studies have been published relating to the treatment of candidemia, other forms of invasive candidiasis, and mucosal disease, including oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis. There are also recent prospective data on the prevention of invasive candidiasis in high-risk neonates and adults and on the empiric treatment of suspected invasive candidiasis in adults. This new information is incorporated into this revised document.

Fungal sepsis accounts for 5% of all sepsis cases in the general population, and is an increasingly frequent cause of sepsis in critically ill patients. Candida species account for the majority of cases of fungal sepsis. Fortunately, fungal sepsis is extremely rare in pregnancy and postpartum, but is associated with a very high mortality rate. Table 3 reviews the presenting symptoms and signs and recommended treatment for common viral and fungal infections that cause maternal sepsis.

### The personalized treatment of invasive candidiasis still has a long way to go [^114geuHD]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The individualization of treatment duration for candidemia and/or IC remains challenging.

The prolonged use of antibiotics can disrupt the host's microbiota and induce resistance in pathogens, leading to suggestions from guidelines such as the Surviving Sepsis Campaign's sepsis and septic shock guidelines to use shorter courses of treatment whenever possible. However, these suggestions are limited to bacterial causes of pneumonia, intra-abdominal infections, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections, excluding candidemia and/or IC. Currently, treatment continues for two weeks after two negative blood cultures, following infectious diseases society of America (IDSA) and European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases (ESCMID) guidelines, to prevent recurrence. However, this "one-size-fits-all" approach may not suit all patients and could unnecessarily prolong hospital stays, increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) and antibiotic resistance, and escalate healthcare costs.

Special considerations during pregnancy — fluconazole risks and first‑trimester management include the following: Topical therapy is preferable for treatment of oral candidiasis in pregnancy, but is essential for vulvovaginal candidiasis, especially during the first trimester. Fluconazole should not be used at any dose (including a single 150-mg dose) in the first trimester due to the risk of spontaneous abortion, and higher exposures (> 150 mg dosing) in the first trimester are associated with cardiac septal closure defects; five cases of fluconazole embryopathy have been reported with chronic dosing at 400 mg daily or higher in pregnancy. A report from a national cohort register in Denmark found an increased hazard ratio (HR) of 1.48 (95% CI, 1.23–1.77) for spontaneous pregnancy loss with any exposure to oral fluconazole from 7 to 22 weeks of pregnancy, and an increased HR of 1.47 (95% CI, 1.22–1.77) with low-dose (150–300 mg cumulative dose) exposure; no increase in stillbirth was seen broadly, but increased risk of stillbirth (HR, 4.10; CI 95%, 1.89–8.90) occurred with doses > 300 mg. Based on these data, substitution of amphotericin B for fluconazole in the first trimester is recommended for invasive or refractory esophageal candidal infections (AIII), and neonates born to women receiving chronic amphotericin B at delivery should be evaluated for renal dysfunction and hypokalemia.

Cryptococcosis in pregnancy — treatment choices and azole cautions: Lipid formulations of amphotericin B are the preferred initial regimen for the treatment of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, disseminated disease, or severe pulmonary cryptococcosis in pregnant patients, and extensive clinical experience with amphotericin has not documented teratogenicity; neonates born to women on chronic amphotericin B at delivery should be evaluated for renal dysfunction and hypokalemia. Flucytosine was teratogenic in animal studies, and its use should be considered only when the benefits outweigh its risks to the fetus (CIII). Congenital malformations have been reported in infants exposed to fluconazole at doses of ≥ 400 mg/day or more through or beyond the first trimester of pregnancy, and the FDA changed the pregnancy category for fluconazole from C to D for any use other than a single, low dose for treatment of vaginal candidiasis. Use of fluconazole in the first trimester should be considered only if the benefits clearly outweigh risks, and after the first trimester switching to oral fluconazole may be considered, if clinically appropriate. However, in general azole antifungals should be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy (BIII), and voriconazole and posaconazole are teratogenic and embryotoxic in animal studies. Treatment should be initiated promptly after a diagnosis is confirmed, and the postpartum period may be a high-risk period for the development of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).

Candidiasis in pregnancy — antifungal use and prophylaxis: For voriconazole, evidence is inconclusive or inadequate for determining fetal risk during pregnancy and human data are not available, so its use is not recommended. For micafungin, anidulafungin, and caspofungin, animal abnormalities are reported and human data are not available, thus their use in human pregnancy is not recommended (AIII). The recently FDA-approved drugs for vulvovaginal candidiasis ibrexafungerp and oteseconazole are contraindicated in pregnancy as animal studies have shown fetal malformations including ocular toxicity from oteseconazole. Chemoprophylaxis — either chronic maintenance therapy or secondary prophylaxis — against oropharyngeal, esophageal, or vaginal candidiasis using systemically absorbed azoles should not be initiated during pregnancy (AIII), and prophylaxis with systemic azoles should be discontinued during pregnancy (AIII).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116shDW3]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Considerations during pregnancy and lactation — antifungal use in HIV state that topical therapy is preferable for treatment of oral candidiasis and vulvovaginal candidiasis in pregnancy, and oral fluconazole should be avoided when treating vulvovaginal candidiasis in the first trimester (AIII). During pregnancy, substitution of amphotericin B for fluconazole in the first trimester is recommended for invasive or refractory esophageal Candida infections (AIII). Human data are not available for micafungin, anidulafungin, and caspofungin, thus their use in human pregnancy is not recommended (AIII); human data on voriconazole are also not available, so its use is not recommended. Oteseconazole is contraindicated during pregnancy and when lactating, and due to its long half-life it is also contraindicated in females of reproductive potential despite the use of oral or other contraception. Ibrexafungerp is teratogenic in animal studies, and use during pregnancy and when lactating is contraindicated.

Pregnancy and antifungal therapy — safety guidance states that extensive clinical experience with amphotericin B has not documented teratogenicity, and infants born to women treated with amphotericin B should be evaluated for renal dysfunction and hypokalemia. In general, azole antifungals should be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy (BIII). Congenital malformations have been reported in infants born to mothers who received fluconazole at doses ≥ 400 mg/day throughout or beyond the first trimester of pregnancy, and the Food and Drug Administration has changed the pregnancy category for fluconazole for any use other than a single, low dose for treatment of vaginal candidiasis from category C to category D. In animals, voriconazole (at doses lower than recommended human doses) and posaconazole are teratogenic and embryotoxic, and use of voriconazole and posaconazole should be avoided in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester (AIII).

### Miconazole nitrate [^1126mo3b]. FDA. Low credibility.

Regarding the use of miconazole PV (also known as Micatin, Oravig) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Pregnancy predisposes patients to the development of vaginal candidiasis due to changes in the vaginal tract. Miconazole has been used in several clinical trials for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis, generally during the second and third trimesters, without evidence of fetal harm. Miconazole has not officially been assigned to a pregnancy category by the FDA. In clinical trials, miconazole treatment of vaginal candidiasis has not been associated with fetal harm. Miconazole is only recommended for use during pregnancy when there are no alternatives and the benefit outweighs the risk. The drug miconazole PV (also known as Micatin, Oravig) is classified under category A in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by a large number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without any proven increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus having been observed.

### Treatment of asymptomatic vaginal candidiasis in pregnancy to prevent preterm birth: an open-label pilot randomized controlled trial [^11229C6P]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We believe a large, adequately powered, randomized trial of clotrimazole to prevent preterm birth in women with asymptomatic candidiasis is both feasible and warranted. This pilot study has informed the development and funding application for such a trial. Should this intervention prove effective, a screening protocol could be readily incorporated into routine antenatal care and treatment is available and widely accepted. If it can be demonstrated that treatment of asymptomatic candidiasis reduces preterm births this will change current practice internationally and will directly impact the management of every pregnant woman.

### Treatment for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^114kDkmq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) affects up to 5% of women. No comprehensive systematic review of treatments for RVVC has been published.

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for RVVC. The secondary objective was to assess patient preference of treatment options.

Search Methods

We conducted electronic searches of bibliographic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (search date 6 October 2021). We also handsearched reference lists of identified trials and contacted authors of identified trials, experts in RVVC, and manufacturers of products for vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Selection Criteria

We considered all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials evaluating RVVC treatments for at least six months, in women with four or more symptomatic episodes of vulvovaginal candidiasis in the past year. We excluded women with immunosuppressive disorders or taking immunosuppressant medication. We included women with diabetes mellitus and pregnant women. Diagnosis of RVVC must have been confirmed by presence of symptoms and a positive culture and/or microscopy. We included all drug and non-drug therapies and partner treatment, assessing the following primary outcomes:

- number of clinical recurrences per participant per year (recurrence defined as clinical signs and positive culture/microscopy);
- proportion of participants with at least one clinical recurrence during the treatment and follow-up period; and
- adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts to identify eligible trials. Duplicate data extraction was completed independently by two authors. We assessed risk of bias as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We used the fixed-effects model for pooling and expressed the results as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where important statistical heterogeneity was present we either did not pool data (I² > 70%) or used a random-effects model (I² 40–70%). We used the GRADE tool to assess overall certainty of the evidence for the pooled primary outcomes.

Main Results

Studies: Twenty-three studies involving 2212 women aged 17 to 67 years met the inclusion criteria. Most studies excluded pregnant women and women with diabetes or immunosuppression. The predominant species found on culture at study entry was Candida albicans. Overall, the included studies were small (< 100 participants). Six studies compared antifungal treatment with placebo (607 participants); four studies compared oral versus topical antifungals (543 participants); one study compared different oral antifungals (45 participants); two studies compared different dosing regimens for antifungals (100 participants); one study compared two different dosing regimens of the same topical agent (23 participants); one study compared short versus longer treatment duration (26 participants); two studies assessed the effect of partner treatment (98 participants); one study compared a complementary treatment (Lactobacillus vaginal tablets and probiotic oral tablets) with placebo (34 participants); three studies compared complementary medicine with antifungals (354 participants); two studies compared 'dermasilk' briefs with cotton briefs (130 participants); one study examined Lactobacillus vaccination versus heliotherapy versus ciclopyroxolamine (90 participants); one study compared CAM treatments to an antifungal treatment combined with CAM treatments (68 participants). We did not find any studies comparing different topical antifungals. Nine studies reported industry funding, three were funded by an independent source and eleven did not report their funding source. Risk of bias: Overall, the risk of bias was high or unclear due to insufficient blinding of allocation and participants and poor reporting. Primary outcomes: Meta-analyses comparing drug treatments (oral and topical) with placebo or no treatment showed there may be a clinically relevant reduction in clinical recurrence at 6 months (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.63; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 2; participants = 607; studies = 6; I² = 82%; low-certainty evidence) and 12 months (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.89; NNTB = 6; participants = 585; studies = 6; I² = 21%; low-certainty evidence). No study reported on the number of clinical recurrences per participant per year. We are very uncertain whether oral drug treatment compared to topical treatment increases the risk of clinical recurrence at 6 months (RR 1.66, 95% CI 0.83 to 3.31; participants = 206; studies = 3; I² = 0%; very low-certainty evidence) and reduces the risk of clinical recurrence at 12 months (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.27; participants = 206; studies = 3; I² = 10%; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported on the number of clinical recurrences per participant per year. Adverse events were scarce across both treatment and control groups in both comparisons. The reporting of adverse events varied amongst studies, was generally of very low quality and could not be pooled. Overall the adverse event rate was low for both placebo and treatment arms and ranged from less than 5% to no side effects or complications.

Authors' Conclusions

In women with RVVC, treatment with oral or topical antifungals may reduce symptomatic clinical recurrences when compared to placebo or no treatment. We were unable to find clear differences between different treatment options (e.g. oral versus topical treatment, different doses and durations). These findings are not applicable to pregnant or immunocompromised women and women with diabetes as the studies did not include or report on them. More research is needed to determine the optimal medication, dose and frequency.

Special Considerations

Compromised Host

Women with underlying immunodeficiency, those with poorly controlled diabetes or other immunocompromising conditions (e.g. HIV), and those receiving immunosuppression therapy (e.g. corticosteroid treatment) might not respond as well to short-term therapies. Efforts to correct modifiable conditions should be made, and more prolonged (i.e. 7–14 days) conventional treatment is necessary.

Pregnancy

VVC occurs frequently during pregnancy. Only topical azole therapies, applied for 7 days, are recommended for use among pregnant women. Epidemiologic studies indicate a single 150-mg dose of fluconazole might be associated with spontaneous abortion and congenital anomalies; therefore, it should not be used.

HIV Infection

Vaginal Candida colonization rates among women with HIV infection are higher than among women without HIV with similar demographic and risk behavior characteristics, and the colonization rates correlate with increasing severity of immunosuppression. Symptomatic VVC is also more frequent among women with HIV infection and similarly correlates with severity of immunodeficiency. In addition, among women with HIV, systemic azole exposure is associated with isolation of non– albicans Candida species from the vagina.

Treatment for uncomplicated and complicated VVC among women with HIV infection should not differ from that for women who do not have HIV. Although long-term prophylactic therapy with fluconazole 200 mg weekly has been effective in reducing C. albicans colonization and symptomatic VVC, this regimen is not recommended for women with HIV infection in the absence of complicated VVC. Although VVC is associated with increased HIV seroconversion among HIV-negative women and increased HIV cervicovaginal levels among women with HIV infection, the effect of treatment for VVC on HIV acquisition and transmission remains unknown.

### Fetal outcomes after maternal exposure to oral antifungal agents during pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115wUaUQ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

It is estimated that over 60% of healthy premenopausal women are colonized with candida, and 75% of all women will experience at least one episode of symptoms due to candida in their lifetime. 1 Owing to increased levels of sex hormones, vulvovaginal candidiasis occurs more frequently, and may be prolonged and associated with more severe symptoms in pregnancy. 2 In general, only topical azoles are recommended in pregnancy, but oral azoles are prescribed when topical treatment fails.

Nevertheless, the safety of oral antifungal agents during pregnancy is controversial. Some studies have reported birth defects among newborns of women who used antifungal agents during pregnancy, 3, 4, 5 whereas others found no difference between antifungal agent exposure and non‐exposure groups. To our knowledge, there has been no systematic review of the safety of oral antifungal agents used in pregnancy. The aim of the present study was therefore to conduct a systematic review of observational studies and a meta‐analysis to provide an up‐to‐date and comprehensive assessment of the fetal safety of oral antifungal agents.

Candidiasis

Candidiasis commonly called "yeast infection" or "thrush" is a fungal infection (mycosis) which occurs when there is overgrowth of any of the Candida species, of which Candida albicans is the most common. Candida is normally found on skin or mucous membranes including the vagina. However, if the environment becomes imbalanced, such as when the normal acidity of the mucous membrane changes or when the hormonal balance changes, Candida can multiply. When that happens, symptomatic candidiasis can occur, ranging from oral thrush and vaginitis, to systemic and potentially life-threatening diseases. Candida infections of the latter category are usually confined to severely immunocompromised persons.

Vaginal candidiasis, usually (90%) due to Candida albicans, is often harmless and causes no symptoms. However it can also cause vaginal soreness, itching and discharge. Approximately 75% of all healthy women of fertile age suffer from at least one episode of vaginal candidiasis, with associated physical and psychological morbidity and approximately half will have a recurrence. Vaginal candidiasis (referred to as 'candidiasis' in this protocol) is not traditionally classified as a sexually transmitted infection, since it occurs in celibate women, and is considered part of the normal vaginal flora. This does not mean that sexual transmission does not occur, although the contribution of sexual transmission to the pathogenesis of infection is unknown. Importantly treatment of male partners has not been effective in reducing recurrence of vaginal candidiasis.

Up to 40% of pregnant women may have vaginal colonisation by Candida species, a two-fold increase from the prevalence rate in non-pregnant women. This association is believed to be driven by increased levels of circulating oestrogens and deposition of glycogen and other substrates in the vagina during pregnancy.

Candidiasis and preterm birth

The role of Candida colonisation on the pathway to preterm birth has not been pursued with the vigour ascribed to bacterial vaginosis and other vaginal organisms, possibly because it is considered a normal vaginal commensal organism. However, several factors indicate an association between vaginal candidiasis and preterm birth:

- the rate of spontaneous preterm birth in women with untreated, asymptomatic candidiasis is higher than among women with normal flora - 7.6% versus 2.8% (P = 0.009) in a low-risk obstetric population,

- in a high-risk population, there was increased rate of preterm birth among women with non-albicans Candida compared with uncolonised women (15.4% versus 11.3%, P = 0.05)

Coccidioidomycosis in pregnancy — All azole antifungals should be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy (BIII), and voriconazole and posaconazole should be avoided in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester (AIII). Intravenous amphotericin B, formulated with deoxycholate or as a lipid preparation, is the preferred treatment for non-meningeal coccidioidomycosis during the first trimester of pregnancy (AIII). One problematic area is coccidioidal meningitis, in which the only alternative treatment to triazole antifungals is IV or intrathecal amphotericin B; for such situations, the decision regarding choice of treatment should be based on considerations of benefit versus potential risk and made in consultation with the mother, the infectious diseases consultant, and the obstetrician. Based on reported birth defects, the Food and Drug Administration has changed the pregnancy category from C to D for fluconazole for any use other than a single, 150 mg dose to treat vaginal candidiasis, and at delivery, infants born to women treated with amphotericin B should be evaluated for renal dysfunction and hypokalemia.

### Multimodal management of cervical insufficiency complicated by intra-amniotic Candida albicans infection [^1155WqCm]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bacteria are the most common pathogens implicated in ascending infections in patients with cervical insufficiency. However, Candida albicans is a rare and serious cause of intra-amniotic infection that should be considered on the differential diagnosis. Upon diagnosis following cerclage placement, patients are generally advised to undergo immediate cerclage removal and discontinuation of the pregnancy due to the high risk of maternal and fetal morbidity. However, some patients decline and instead elect to continue the pregnancy with or without treatment. Limited data exist to guide management of these high-risk patients.

Case Presentation

We describe a case of previable intra-amniotic C. albicans infection diagnosed following physical examination-indicated cerclage placement. The patient declined pregnancy termination and subsequently underwent systemic antifungal therapy as well as serial intra-amniotic fluconazole instillations. Fetal blood sampling confirmed transplacental transfer of maternal systemic antifungal therapy. The fetus delivered preterm and without evidence of fungemia, despite persistently positive amniotic fluid cultures.

Conclusion

In a well-counseled patient with culture-proven intra-amniotic C. albicans infection declining termination of pregnancy, multimodal antifungal therapy in the form of systemic and intra-amniotic fluconazole administration may prevent subsequent fetal or neonatal fungemia and improve postnatal outcomes.

Key Points

· Candida is an uncommon cause of intra-amniotic infection in the setting of cervical insufficiency. · Multimodal antifungal therapy may prevent fetal fungemia related to intra-amniotic Candida infection. · Fetal blood sampling confirmed transplacental passage of fluconazole after maternal administration.

Cryptococcosis treatment in pregnancy — amphotericin B guidance notes that extensive clinical experience with amphotericin B deoxycholate has not been associated with teratogenicity, and this remains a preferred therapy for cryptococcosis in the first trimester of pregnancy (AIII). Although there is less experience in pregnancy with lipid formulations of amphotericin B, these products have been associated with less nephrotoxicity and electrolyte abnormalities than amphotericin B deoxycholate and are an alternative as a preferred therapy for the initial regimen for the treatment of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, disseminated disease, or severe pulmonary cryptococcosis during pregnancy (AIII). Optimal dosing of liposomal amphotericin B in pregnancy is unknown, and a recent review of dosing strategies in pregnancy recommended use of ideal body weight rather than total body weight to minimize risk of adverse effects to the fetus while maintaining efficacy (BII). Neonates born to women on chronic amphotericin B at delivery may be at increased risk for renal toxicity and electrolyte abnormalities and should be appropriately evaluated as newborns.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116G6rGz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Invasive candidiasis antifungal selection — echinocandins have emerged as preferred agents for most episodes of candidemia and invasive candidiasis except central nervous system (CNS), eye, and urinary tract infections. This preference is based on a strong safety profile, convenience, early fungicidal activity, a trend toward better outcomes, and the emergence of azole-resistant Candida species, but the recent emergence of multidrug-resistant Candida species further complicates therapy and there are no good prospective data to guide therapy. Additionally, voriconazole is as effective as sequential AmB and fluconazole for candidemia, but few would choose voriconazole because there is little advantage and potentially greater toxicity compared to other therapies.

Candida is a leading cause of late onset infection (> 3 days of age) in the premature infant. Therefore, decisions about the diagnosis and management of infections caused by Candida are commonplace in the neonatal intensive care unit. Despite this fact, there are few comparative trials about treatment of neonatal Candida infections to guide the practitioner. New antifungals have been developed in the past decade and some clinical experience has been reported that can be used to guide the treatment of infants with serious Candida infections. This article reviews recent pertinent data with regard to dosing guidelines, efficacy, and toxicities of available systemic antifungal agents in the newborn.

The National Institutes of Health, the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and CDC have developed guidelines for treatment of opportunistic infections (OIs) among adults and adolescents infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These guidelines are intended for clinicians and other health-care providers who care for HIV-infected adults and adolescents, including pregnant women; they complement companion guidelines for treatment of OIs among HIV-infected children and previously published guidelines for prevention of OIs in these populations. They include evidence-based guidelines for treatment of 28 OIs caused by protozoa, bacteria, fungi, and viruses, including certain OIs endemic in other parts of the world but that might be observed in patients in the United States. Each OI section includes information on epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment recommendations, monitoring and adverse events, management of treatment failure, prevention of recurrence, and special considerations in pregnancy. Tables address drugs and doses, drug toxicities, drug interactions, adjustment of drug doses in persons with reduced renal function, and data about use of drugs in pregnant women.

Fifty percent of all women will experience ≥ 1 episode of VVC by 25 years of age, and approximately 75% of women will experience a VVC episode in their lifetime (with ≥ 2 episodes occurring in 40%–45% of women). Comorbid conditions including uncontrolled diabetes, genetic predisposition, immunocompromising conditions, and medications (eg, antibiotics) have been associated with VVC. Given the wide availability of over-the-counter therapies, which often results in patient self-treatment in lieu of professional care, the exact incidence of VVC is grossly under reported.

VVC treatments have historically been predominantly limited to the azole class of fungistatic agents. Routine treatment includes topical azole formulations, up to week-long courses, or oral fluconazole given as 150-mg single doses. Limitations of these treatments include possible intolerance to topical formulations, idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity with fluconazole, and fluconazole-associated risk of fetal harm if taken during pregnancy. Given the previous lack of approved non-azole therapies, treatment options for VVC have been limited in cases of azole-resistant organisms or for patients with azole intolerance or for whom its use is contraindicated. New oral treatments are warranted, particularly those with broad fungal coverage, a good safety profile (especially no risk of fetal harm), and limited drug-to-drug interactions.

### Candida septicemia in a pregnant woman with hyperemesis receiving parenteral nutrition [^115vBxob]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Intravascular catheter placement carries the risk of a life-threatening systemic fungal infection. In addition to antifungal therapy, removal of the catheter is often considered to be an important part of management.

Case

A 33-year-old multipara with hyperemesis underwent placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter for parenteral nutrition. She subsequently developed candidemia with both blood and the peripherally inserted central catheter tip cultures positive for Candida parapsilosis. The catheter was removed, the patient was started on intravenous amphotericin B, and due to side effects, she was switched to intravenous fluconazole. She recovered fully, was discharged home on oral fluconazole, and delivered a healthy infant at term.

Conclusion

Peripherally inserted central catheter placement may be complicated by candidemia. Intravenous fluconazole and removal of the contaminated catheter successfully eradicated systemic infection with C parapsilosis.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Talaromycosis — special considerations during pregnancy: Amphotericin B has not been shown to be teratogenic in animals and no increase in fetal anomalies has been seen in humans; neonates born to women on chronic amphotericin B at delivery should be evaluated for renal dysfunction and hypokalemia. Itraconazole at high doses has been teratogenic in animals, but human case series do not suggest an increased risk of birth defects though experience is very limited. Voriconazole is Food and Drug Administration Category D, and with no human data its use in the first trimester is not recommended. Substitution of amphotericin B for high-dose azoles in the first trimester is recommended (BIII). Women on secondary prophylaxis with itraconazole or other azoles should postpone pregnancy until CD4 counts have been restored with ART such that prophylaxis can be discontinued (BIII), and if pregnancy occurs while on itraconazole prophylaxis, continuation should be individualized based on CD4 count, viral suppression, and patient preference.

### Top 10 pearls for the recognition, evaluation, and management of maternal sepsis [^117X3GPU]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Pearl 6. Move fast during the golden hour to save lives: choose antimicrobials tailored to the most likely diagnosis.

The appropriate initial selection of antibiotics in nonobstetric patients has been shown to decrease mortality. – Therefore, once the diagnosis of sepsis is suspected, broad-spectrum antibiotics tailored to the most likely diagnosis should be initiated. Because most cases of maternal sepsis are due to genitourinary sources, a cost-effective, first-line therapy with intravenous ampicillin, gentamicin, and clindamycin is usually suitable, especially if the source is unknown. However, if a soft tissue infection is present, or if initial evaluation suggests a respiratory cause, first-line antibiotic selection will differ (Table 4). In addition, local resistance patterns as well as emerging strains of resistance and prior antibiotic exposure in the prior 30 days should be considered. – After initiating first-line antibiotics, reviewing the hospital antibiogram of antimicrobial susceptibilities and consulting with an infectious disease specialist may be useful to help tailor antibiotic selection. If a viral or fungal etiology is suspected, targeted antimicrobial treatment can be concurrently administered (Table 3).

Table 4.
Common Antibiotic Regimens for Maternal Sepsis by Suspected Etiology

In certain situations, drug monitoring may be considered; this should be performed in patients with 1) septic shock or admitted to the intensive care unit, 2) liver or kidney impairment, or 3) a large volume of distribution. The antibiotic regimen should be reassessed daily, with the goal of narrowing the spectrum as soon as possible. Clinical improvement or isolation of a pathogen with susceptibility patterns should prompt de-escalation of antibiotic therapy. This is necessary to prevent the development of antibiotic resistance, and to reduce the risk of superinfection (eg, candida, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and clostridium), toxicity, and costs.

Key messages

- Fluconazole is the most common systemic antifungal agent prescribed for treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis; however, the 2009 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) treatment guidelines favor an echinocandin as initial therapy for candidemia in patients with moderately severe to severe illness.

- This retrospective review of data from the prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial demonstrated that anidulafungin is more effective than fluconazole for treatment of severely ill patients with candidemia, thus supporting the 2009 IDSA guidelines.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115L2VdC]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pregnancy management of oral and vulvovaginal candidiasis in people with HIV — topical therapy is preferable for treatment of oral candidiasis and vulvovaginal candidiasis in pregnancy, and oral fluconazole should be avoided when treating vulvovaginal candidiasis in the first trimester (AIII). Data derived from women with vulvovaginal candidiasis suggest that fluconazole should not be used at any dose (including a single 150-mg dose) in the first trimester due to the risk of spontaneous abortion, while higher exposures (> 150 mg dosing) during the first trimester are associated with cardiac septal closure defects; however, a recent analysis of registry data from Sweden and Denmark did not find any increase in stillbirth or neonatal death associated with exposure to fluconazole at any dose during pregnancy. Five cases of a syndrome consisting of craniosynostosis, characteristic facies, digital synostosis, and limb contractures (fluconazole embryopathy) have been reported in women chronically prescribed fluconazole at doses of 400 mg daily or higher in pregnancy. A national cohort register in Denmark found an increased hazard ratio (HR) of 1.48 for spontaneous pregnancy loss with any exposure to oral fluconazole from 7 to 22 weeks of pregnancy, and an increased HR of 1.47 was noted with low-dose (150–300 mg cumulative dose) exposure; no increase in stillbirth was seen with fluconazole exposure broadly, but an increase in risk of stillbirth (HR, 4.10) was noted with doses > 300 mg.

### Probiotics for vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant women [^116Z52HJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is estimated to be the second most common form of infection after bacterial vaginosis. The ability of probiotics in maintaining and recovering the normal vaginal microbiota, and their potential ability to resist Candidas give rise to the concept of using probiotics for the treatment of VVC.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant women.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases to October 2017: Sexually Transmitted Infections Cochrane Review Group's Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and eight other databases. We searched in following international resources: World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, Web of Science and OpenGrey. We checked specialty journals, reference lists of published articles and conference proceedings. We collected information from pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCT) using probiotics, alone or as adjuvants to conventional antifungal drugs, to treat VVC in non-pregnant women. Trials recruiting women with recurrent VVC, coinfection with other vulvovaginal infections, diabetes mellitus, immunosuppressive disorders or taking immunosuppressant medication were ineligible for inclusion. Probiotics were included if they were made from single or multiple species and in any preparation type/dosage/route of administration.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and quality and extracted data. We resolved any disagreements through consensus. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Ten RCTs (1656 participants) met our inclusion criteria, and pharmaceutical industry funded none of these trials. All trials used probiotics as adjuvant therapy to antifungal drugs. Probiotics increased the rate of short-term clinical cure (risk ratio (RR) 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 1.24, 695 participants, 5 studies, low quality evidence) and mycological cure (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.10, 969 participants, 7 studies, low quality evidence) and decreased relapse rate at one month (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.68, 388 participants, 3 studies, very low quality evidence). However, this effect did not translate into a higher frequency of long-term clinical cure (one month after treatment: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.33, 172 participants, 1 study, very low quality evidence; three months after treatment: RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.70, 172 participants, one study, very low quality evidence) or mycological cure (one month after treatment: RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.71, 627 participants, 3 studies, very low quality evidence; three months after treatment: RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.35, 172 participants, one study, very low quality evidence). Probiotics use did not increase the frequency of serious (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.94; 440 participants, 2 studies, low quality evidence). We found no eligible RCTs for outcomes as time to first relapse, need for additional treatment at the end of therapy, patient satisfaction and cost effectiveness.

Authors' Conclusions

Low and very low quality evidence shows that, compared with conventional treatment, the use of probiotics as an adjuvant therapy could increases the rate of short-term clinical and mycological cure and decrease the relapse rate at one month but this did not translate into a higher frequency of long-term clinical or mycological cure. Probiotics use does not seem to increase the frequency of serious or non-serious adverse events. There is a need for well-designed RCTs with standardized methodologies, longer follow-up and larger sample size.

Pregnancy and azole antifungals — adults and adolescents with HIV: In general, azole antifungals should be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy unless the benefit is felt to outweigh the risk (BIII). After the first trimester or when disease is diagnosed after the first trimester, treatment with fluconazole or itraconazole could be considered (AIII). Fluconazole has teratogenic potential in the first trimester, congenital malformations have been reported in infants born to mothers who received fluconazole through or beyond the first trimester of pregnancy, and animal data suggest that moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy may increase the potency of fluconazole resulting in increased risk of craniofacial defects.

### Chorioamnionitis in a twin pregnancy following in vitro fertilisation: a rare cause of septic miscarriage [^112iFkju]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Table 1
All previously reported cases of C. glabrata chorioamnionitis

Notably, almost all cases occurred in the second trimester, suggesting a possible latent incubation phase between antenatal instrumentation and presentation of frank infection. Our case presented at 17+4 weeks, which posed a therapeutic dilemma in management at the point of presentation — to advocate for termination of pregnancy given the significant fetal mortality for presumed fungal chorioamnionitis, or to continue treating the presumptive chorioamnionitis by administering systemic maternal antifungal treatment with their attendant potential drug toxicities, till fetal viability could be attained.

In the case of C. glabrata chorioamnionitis, administering systemic maternal antifungal treatment is a non-trivial undertaking, as the optimal choice and duration of antenatal antifungal therapy for this unusual organism is yet to be clearly defined. Fetal considerations also further complicate antimicrobial choice. As C. glabrata commonly exhibits inherent resistance to azoles such as fluconazole, higher doses are required for effective treatment. However, high doses of azoles in pregnancy (400–600 mg/day) are contraindicated due to potential fetotoxicity (FDA Category D). The echinocandin class of antifungals which include anidulafungin have limited human data regarding safety in pregnancy, with teratogenic effects reported in animal studies (FDA Category C). Polyenes such as amphotericin B are generally considered the safest for the treatment of C. glabrata sepsis in pregnancy (Category B); the placenta tissue also appears to act as a reservoir for slow release of amphotericin B into the intrauterine environment. However, use of amphotericin B is associated with significant side effects such as nephrotoxicity and electrolyte imbalances. In our review of the literature, 50.0% (6/12) of the cases received systemic maternal antifungal treatment, with the majority treated with amphotericin B. Maternal candidaemia, such as occurred in our case, was an additional indication for systemic antifungal treatment. The majority of cases with maternal candidaemia were treated with amphotericin Bas well. In the two cases of untreated maternal candidaemia, candidaemia occurred shortly before or just after delivery. No cases of maternal mortality were reported.

### Candida bloodstream infection in neonates [^115wZZY3]. Seminars in Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Neonatal candidemia is poorly understood and is a leading cause of nosocomial infectious mortality in the nursery. Prevention of candidemia has been difficult, although a combined approach of antifungal prophylaxis and targeted empirical therapy may eventually reduce morbidity and mortality. Multicenter prospective testing of an integrated approach to early diagnosis of neonatal candidemia using newer molecular techniques is also needed. Candidemia in the infant is cause for prompt removal (or replacement) of central vascular catheters and institution of antifungal therapy. End-organ evaluation is also probably warranted to guide treatment and facilitate prognostication. Given the continuing progress in clinical research infrastructure and development of new diagnostic tests and antifungal agents, substantial improvement in the prevention, diagnosis, and management of neonatal candidemia is plausible over the next decade.

In general, azole antifungal agents should be avoided in the first trimester of pregnancy because of potential teratogenic effect unless benefit is thought to outweigh risk (BIII), and after the first trimester or when disease is diagnosed after the first trimester, treatment with fluconazole or itraconazole could be considered (AIII).

### Oral versus intra-vaginal imidazole and triazole anti-fungal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^116ghHAD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-fungals are available for oral and intra-vaginal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review is to assess the relative effectiveness (clinical cure) of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals for the treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. Secondary objectives include the assessment of the relative effectiveness in terms of mycological cure, in addition to safety, side effects, treatment preference, time to first relief of symptoms, and costs.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers on 29 August 2019 together with reference checking and citation searching.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials published in any language comparing at least one oral anti-fungal with one intra-vaginal anti-fungal in women (aged 16 years or over) with a mycological diagnosis (positive culture, microscopy for yeast, or both) of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. We excluded trials if they solely involved participants who were HIV positive, immunocompromised, pregnant, breast feeding or diabetic.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

This review includes 26 trials (5007 participants). Eight anti-fungals are represented. All but three trials included participants with acute vulvovaginal candidiasis. Trials were conducted in Europe: UK (3), Croatia (2). Finland (2), the Netherlands (2), Germany (1), Italy (1), Sweden (1) and one trial across multiple European countries, USA (7) Thailand (2), Iran (2), Japan (1) and Africa (Nigeria) (1). The duration of follow-up varied between trials. The overall risk of bias of the included trials was high. There was probably little or no difference shown between oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungal treatment for clinical cure at short-term follow-up (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.43; 13 trials; 1859 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and long-term follow-up (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.50; 9 trials; 1042 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of clinical cure at short-term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 77%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 75% and 83%; if the rate of clinical cure at long term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 84%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 80% and 89%. Oral treatment probably improves mycological cure over intra-vaginal treatment at short term (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.50: 19 trials; 3057 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and long-term follow-up (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.60; 13 trials; 1661 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of mycological cure at short-term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 80%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 80% and 85%; if the rate of mycological cure at long-term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 66%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 67% and 76%. In terms of patient safety, there is a low risk of participants withdrawing from the studies due to adverse drug effects for either treatment (23 trials; 4637 participants; high-certainty evidence). Due to the low certainty of evidence, it is undetermined whether oral treatments reduced the number of side effects compared with intra-vaginal treatments (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.29; 16 trials; 3155 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of side effects with intra-vaginal treatment is 12%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 10% and 15%. We noted that the type of side effects differed, with intra-vaginal treatments being more often associated with local reactions, and oral treatments being more often associated with systemic effects including gastro-intestinal symptoms and headaches. Oral treatment appeared to be the favoured treatment preference over intra-vaginal treatment or no preference (12 trials; 2206 participants), however the data were poorly reported and the certainty of the evidence was low. There was little or no difference in time to first relief of symptoms between oral and intra-vaginal treatments: four trials favoured the oral treatment, four favoured intra-vaginal, one study reported no difference and one was unclear. The measurements varied between the 10 trials (1910 participants) and the certainty of the evidence was low. Costs were not reported in any of the trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Oral anti-fungal treatment probably improves short- and long-term mycological cure over intra-vaginal treatment for uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. Oral treatment was the favoured treatment preference by participants, though the certainty of this evidence is low. The decision to prescribe or recommend an anti-fungal for oral or intra-vaginal administration should take into consideration safety in terms of withdrawals and side effects, as well as cost and treatment preference. Unless there is a previous history of adverse reaction to one route of administration or contraindications, women who are purchasing their own treatment should be given full information about the characteristics and costs of treatment to make their own decision. If health services are paying the treatment cost, decision-makers should consider whether the higher cost of some oral anti-fungals is worth the gain in convenience, if this is the patient's preference.

Background

Anti-fungals are available for oral and intra-vaginal treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush).

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to assess the relative effectiveness of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals for the treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. The secondary objectives of the review were to assess the cost-effectiveness, safety and patient preference of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals.

Search Strategy

The following sources were searched: The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 1999), MEDLINE (January 1985 to May 2000), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2000) and the Cochrane Collaboration Sexually Transmitted Disease Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials. The reference lists of retrieved articles were reviewed manually. The manufacturers of anti-fungals available in the UK were contacted.

Selection Criteria

~Bullet~Randomised controlled trials published in any language. ~Bullet~Trials had to compare at least one oral anti-fungal with one intra-vaginal anti-fungal. ~Bullet~Women (aged 16 years or over) with uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. ~Bullet~The diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis to be made mycologically (i.e. a positive culture and / or microscopy for yeast). ~Bullet~Trials were excluded if they solely involved subjects who were HIV positive, immunocompromised, pregnant, breastfeeding or diabetic. ~Bullet~The primary outcome measure was clinical cure.

Data Collection and Analysis

Duplicate scrutiny was performed of the titles and abstracts of the electronic search results. Full article formats of all selected abstracts were retrieved and independently assessed by two reviewers. Independent duplicate abstraction was performed by four reviewers. Disagreements regarding trial inclusion or data abstraction were resolved by discussion between the reviewers. Odds ratios were pooled using the random effects model. Chi-squared tests with a p-value of less than 0.1 indicated heterogeneity in the results.

Main Results

Seventeen trials are included in the review, reporting 19 oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungal comparisons. No statistically significant differences were shown between oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungal treatment for clinical cure at short term (OR 1.00 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.40)) and long term (OR 1.03 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.49)) follow-up. No statistically significant differences for mycological cure were observed between oral and intra-vaginal treatment at short term (OR 1.20(95% CI, 0.87 to 1.65)) or long term follow-up (OR 1.30 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.71)). Two trials each reported one withdrawal from treatment due to an adverse reaction. Treatment preference data were poorly reported.

Reviewer's Conclusions

No differences exist in terms of the relative effectiveness (measured as clinical and mycological cure) of anti-fungals administered by the oral and intra-vaginal routes for the treatment of uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. No definitive conclusion can be made regarding the relative safety of oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungals for uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. The oral route of administration is the preferred route for anti-fungals for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. The decision to prescribe or recommend the purchase of an anti-fungal for oral or intra-vaginal administration should take into consideration: safety, cost and treatment preference. Unless there is a previous history of adverse reaction to one route of administration or contraindications: if women are purchasing their own treatment, they should be given full information about the characteristics and costs of treatment to make their own decision. If health services are paying the treatment cost, decision-makers should consider whether the higher cost of oral anti-fungal administration is worth the gain in convenience, if this is the patient's preference.

No statistically significant differences for mycological cure were observed between oral and intra-vaginal treatment at short term (OR 1.20 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.65)) or long term follow-up (OR 1.30 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.71)). Two trials each reported one withdrawal from treatment due to an adverse reaction. Treatment preference data were poorly reported.

Reviewer's Conclusions

No differences exist in terms of the relative effectiveness (measured as clinical and mycological cure) of anti-fungals administered by the oral and intra-vaginal routes for the treatment of uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. No definitive conclusion can be made regarding the relative safety of oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungals for uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. The oral route of administration is the preferred route for anti-fungals for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. The decision to prescribe or recommend the purchase of an anti-fungal for oral or intra-vaginal administration should take into consideration: safety, cost and treatment preference. Unless there is a previous history of adverse reaction to one route of administration or contraindications, women who are purchasing their own treatment should be given full information about the characteristics and costs of treatment to make their own decision. If health services are paying the treatment cost, decision-makers should consider whether the higher cost of oral anti-fungal administration is worth the gain in convenience, if this is the patient's preference.

Candida species are the predominant cause of fungal infections in patients treated in hospital, contributing substantially to morbidity and mortality. Candidaemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis primarily affect patients who are immunocompromised or critically ill. In contrast, mucocutaneous forms of candidiasis, such as oral thrush and vulvovaginal candidiasis, can occur in otherwise healthy individuals. Although mucocutaneous candidiasis is generally not life-threatening, it can cause considerable discomfort, recurrent infections, and complications, particularly in patients with underlying conditions such as diabetes or in those taking immunosuppressive therapies. The rise of difficult-to-treat Candida infections is driven by new host factors and antifungal resistance. Pathogens, such as Candida auris (Candidozyma auris) and fluconazole-resistant Candida parapsilosis, pose serious global health risks. Recent taxonomic revisions have reclassified several Candida spp, potentially causing confusion in clinical practice. Current management guidelines are limited in scope, with poor coverage of emerging pathogens and new treatment options. In this Review, we provide updated recommendations for managing Candida infections, with detailed evidence summaries available in the appendix.

WARNING: RISK OF EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY

BREXAFEMME is contraindicated in pregnancy because it may cause fetal harm based on findings from animal reproductive studies [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
For females of reproductive potential, verify that the patient is not pregnant prior to initiating BREXAFEMME treatment. Reassessing pregnancy status prior to each dose is recommended when BREXAFEMME is used monthly for 6 months for reduction in the incidence of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and throughout the 6-month treatment period for reduction in the incidence of RVVC with BREXAFEMME and, for 4 days after the last dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

Treatment Short-course topical formulations effectively treat uncomplicated VVC. Treatment with azoles results in relief of symptoms and negative cultures in 80%–90% of patients who complete therapy. Over-the-Counter Intravaginal Agents. Clotrimazole 1% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7–14 days OR Clotrimazole 2% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days OR Miconazole 2% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7 days. OR Miconazole 4% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days OR Miconazole 100 mg vaginal suppository one suppository daily for 7 days OR Miconazole 200 mg vaginal suppository one suppository for 3 days. OR Terconazole 0. 4% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 7 days OR Terconazole
0. 8% cream 5 g intravaginally daily for 3 days OR Terconazole 80 mg vaginal suppository one suppository daily for 3 days. Oral fluconazole weekly for 6 months is the indicated maintenance regimen. If this regimen is not feasible, topical treatments used intermittently can also be considered. Suppressive maintenance therapies are effective at controlling recurrent VVC but are rarely curative long-term. Because C. albicans azole resistance is becoming more common, susceptibility tests, if available, should be obtained among symptomatic patients who remain culture positive despite maintenance therapy. These women should be managed in consultation with a specialist. Non– albicans Vulvovaginal Candidiasis Because approximately 50% of women with a positive culture for non–. Pregnancy VVC occurs frequently during pregnancy. Only topical azole therapies, applied for 7 days, are recommended for use among pregnant women.

Epidemiologic studies indicate a single 150-mg dose of fluconazole might be associated with spontaneous abortion and congenital anomalies; therefore, it should not be used.

Key points
- Candidiasis is treated with antifungal medication.
- **Antifungal medications come in different forms**: creams, oral gels, pills, or intravenous.
- The type of antifungal, dose, and length of treatment depend on the type and severity of infection and the patient's overall health.
- Take antifungal medications as instructed for as long as directed. Treatment Vaginal candidiasis Treatment is usually an antifungal cream applied inside the vagina or a single dose of fluconazole taken by mouth. Creams can be sold over the counter, but testing is recommended before starting a treatment. If symptoms return, don't improve, or get worse after starting treatment, healthcare providers may adjust the treatment by prescribing:

- More doses of fluconazole taken by mouth.
- Other medicines applied inside the vagina, such as boric acid, nystatin, or flucytosine.

Candidiasis of the mouth and throat Mild to moderate infections: Treatment for most infections include an antifungal oral gel applied inside the mouth for 7–14 days. Types of antifungals used include clotrimazole, miconazole, or nystatin. Severe infections: Antifungal medication in pill form or through an IV. The most common type of antifungal used is fluconazole. Candidiasis of the esophagus The antifungal medication fluconazole is almost always used to treat candidiasis of the esophagus. It can be taken as a pill or, for severe infections, through an IV. Other antifungal medications may be used if fluconazole is not working. The initial recommended antifungal treatment for most adults is an echinocandin given through the vein. Fluconazole, amphotericin B, and other antifungal medications may also be appropriate in certain situations.

For Health Care ProvidersClinical Overview of Invasive Candidiasis. Length of treatment For bloodstream Candida infections, treatment should continue for 2 weeks after signs and symptoms have resolved and Candida yeasts are no longer in the bloodstream. Other forms of invasive candidiasis, such as infections in the bones, joints, heart, or central nervous system, usually need to be treated for a longer period of time.

Risk factors Common risk factors for invasive candidiasis include:

- Critical illness with a prolonged intensive care unit stay.
- Presence of central venous catheters.
- Use of broad-spectrum antibiotics or total parenteral nutrition.
- Hematologic or solid organ malignancy, or neutropenia.
- Stem cell transplantation.
- Abdominal surgery.
- Pre-term infancy with a very low birth weight.
- Renal failure or hemodialysis
- Injection drug use. Prevention In healthcare settings, these measures are important to prevent invasive candidiasis:

- Adhering to hand hygiene recommendations
- Following recommendations for placement and maintenance of central venous catheters
- Practicing antimicrobial stewardship Some groups of patients may benefit from antifungal prophylaxis:

- Some solid organ transplant recipients
- High-risk ICU patients
- Patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia
- Stem cell transplant recipients with neutropenia.

Diagnosis Invasive candidiasis is primarily diagnosed with blood culture. Newer culture-independent diagnostic methods are promising but are not yet widely used. The Beta-D-glucan assay is approved as an adjunctive diagnostic tool but is not a very specific test for Candida. Determining the species of Candida causing the infection is important to guide appropriate antifungal treatment. Treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis Initial treatment For most adult patients with candidemia, an echinocandin is recommended as initial therapy. Fluconazole is an alternative initial treatment in patients who are not critically ill when fluconazole-resistance is considered unlikely. Other treatments include voriconazole and amphotericin B formulations. Transitional treatment The infectious Diseases Society of America recommends retesting patients every day or every other day. Once blood cultures clear transition to fluconazole if susceptible to azoles.

Duration of treatment In general, treatment should continue for two weeks after clearance of Candida and resolution of symptoms. Intravenous catheter removal is recommended for non-neutropenic patients and can be considered for neutropenic patients. For neonatal candidiasis, the recommended primary treatment is amphotericin B deoxycholate or fluconazole. The treatment duration is two weeks after clearance of Candida from the bloodstream and symptom resolution. Treatment for invasive candidiasis including candidemia vary by type of infection.
