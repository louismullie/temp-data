## Question

How would you approach potential esophageal varices in a patient with a history of alcohol abuse presenting with hematemesis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to approach suspected esophageal variceal bleeding in a patient with alcohol use disorder who presents with hematemesis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate hemodynamic assessment and resuscitation. Then, I should verify early pharmacologic therapy and antibiotics. Next, I will consider transfusion thresholds and what not to give. After that, I need to plan endoscopy timing and pre-endoscopic preparation. Then, I will review endoscopic therapy choices by variceal type and salvage strategies. I should confirm risk stratification and preemptive TIPS indications. Next, I will examine secondary prophylaxis. Finally, I need to ensure alcohol use disorder management and outline a long-term surveillance plan, making sure I cross-check each step against current guidelines as I go.

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment and resuscitation priorities: establish two large-bore IVs, start crystalloids, and apply a restrictive transfusion strategy with a hemoglobin threshold around 7 g/dL in hemodynamically stable patients without significant cardiovascular disease, targeting 7–9 g/dL post-transfusion, while simultaneously calculating Child-Pugh and MELD-Na to stratify risk and anticipate need for ICU or step-down care, because these steps materially influence mortality and triage decisions in acute variceal hemorrhage [^111Cnsyr] [^116p3mip] [^112sfwy6].

> Wait, let me verify early pharmacologic therapy and antibiotics before endoscopy: vasoactive agents such as terlipressin, octreotide, or somatostatin should be initiated immediately and continued for 2–5 days to reduce portal pressure and control bleeding, and prophylactic antibiotics, typically ceftriaxone 1 g daily for up to 5–7 days, should be started on presentation given high infection risk and its association with rebleeding and mortality in ACLD, so I should not delay these while waiting for endoscopy [^111Cnsyr] [^116p3mip] [^112sfwy6].

> Hold on, I should verify transfusion and coagulation management nuances: avoid routine fresh frozen plasma and platelets solely based on INR or platelet count because there is no benefit and potential harm, and do not over-transfuse. Maintain a restrictive strategy unless there is active ischemia or specific cardiovascular indications, and remember that coagulopathy in cirrhosis is rebalanced, so aggressive correction can be counterproductive unless there is procedural need or life-threatening bleeding [^116p3mip] [^111Cnsyr].

> I need to check endoscopy timing and pre-endoscopic preparation: upper endoscopy should be performed within 12 hours of presentation once the patient is hemodynamically stabilized, with erythromycin 250 mg IV 30–120 minutes pre-procedure to improve visualization, and I should consider airway protection with intubation if there is ongoing hematemesis, encephalopathy, or aspiration risk. If the patient remains unstable, I should not delay endoscopy but proceed as soon as safely feasible in an appropriate setting [^111Cnsyr] [^116p3mip] [^112sfwy6] [^113yiYjf].

> Let me think about endoscopic therapy choices by lesion: for esophageal varices, endoscopic band ligation is the treatment of choice. For GOV1, EBL is also appropriate. For GOV2 or isolated fundal gastric varices, cyanoacrylate injection is preferred. If bleeding persists despite pharmacologic and endoscopic therapy, I should escalate to rescue TIPS or BRTO depending on anatomy and local expertise, and I should confirm that these salvage pathways are available or arrange transfer early [^111Cnsyr] [^116p3mip] [^112hXX1u].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "balloon tamponade is first-line for active variceal bleeding", but hold on, I should verify and correct that: balloon tamponade is a temporizing rescue maneuver for uncontrolled bleeding when endoscopy is unavailable or delayed, not first-line therapy, and it should be followed by definitive endoscopic or radiologic therapy as soon as possible due to aspiration and mucosal injury risks [^114KZjm8].

> Next, I should review risk stratification and preemptive TIPS: in high-risk patients — Child-Pugh C or Child-Pugh B with active bleeding at endoscopy despite vasoactive therapy, or HVPG greater than 20 mmHg — preemptive TIPS within 72 hours (ideally within 24 hours) should be considered because it significantly reduces rebleeding and mortality. I need to ensure early consultation with interventional radiology and transplant hepatology in these scenarios [^111Cnsyr] [^116p3mip] [^116ccDoP].

> I will now examine secondary prophylaxis once hemostasis is achieved: initiate nonselective beta-blockers, preferably carvedilol, and schedule EBL every 2–4 weeks until eradication, then surveillance EGD every 3–6 months in the first year. If the patient underwent preemptive TIPS, additional prophylaxis is not required, but I should monitor for encephalopathy and shunt dysfunction [^111Cnsyr] [^113uwiuX] [^116ccDoP].

> But wait, what if the patient continues to drink alcohol — does that change management? I should confirm that alcohol abstinence counseling and linkage to treatment are essential because continued alcohol use accelerates decompensation, increases variceal bleeding risk, and worsens outcomes; in parallel, I should address nutrition, vaccinations, and surveillance for HCC and other complications of cirrhosis [^1146L51E] [^114GXkNR].

> Let me reconsider long-term surveillance and primary prophylaxis for future risk: for patients with compensated cirrhosis without varices, repeat endoscopy every 2–3 years depending on ongoing liver injury. For small varices, repeat every 1–2 years. For medium to large varices, offer NSBB or EBL for primary prophylaxis, with carvedilol often preferred when tolerated. I should also apply Baveno VI criteria in compensated patients to potentially defer endoscopy when liver stiffness is less than 20 kPa and platelets are greater than 150,000, but I need to ensure annual reassessment if liver injury is active [^114GXkNR] [^112U5frZ] [^111Ju57v] [^113iWybM].

> Hold on, I should verify that my plan aligns with contemporary guidance: the core bundle of restrictive transfusion, early vasoactive therapy, prophylactic antibiotics, and urgent endoscopy with EBL for esophageal varices within 12 hours, followed by secondary prophylaxis with NSBB plus EBL and early consideration of preemptive TIPS in high-risk patients, is consistently supported across ESGE, AASLD, and Baveno-aligned pathways, and I have cross-checked each element accordingly [^111Cnsyr] [^116p3mip] [^112sfwy6].

In a patient with alcohol use disorder and hematemesis, **esophageal varices are the most likely source** due to portal hypertension from cirrhosis [^1169hxde]. Immediate management is **resuscitation, vasoactive therapy, antibiotics, and urgent endoscopy within 12 hours** [^111Cnsyr] [^112sfwy6]. Endoscopic band ligation is first-line for esophageal variceal bleeding [^111Cnsyr]; if bleeding persists, consider rescue TIPS [^111Cnsyr]. Secondary prophylaxis combines nonselective beta-blockers with serial banding; abstinence from alcohol is essential to reduce recurrence and mortality [^113XnJDU] [^1146L51E].

---

## Pathophysiology of esophageal varices in alcohol use disorder

Chronic alcohol use causes **hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis**, leading to portal hypertension and variceal formation [^116fMs6f]. Variceal rupture is often triggered by increased portal pressure, infection, or alcohol-related mucosal injury [^1169hxde].

---

## Clinical presentation and risk factors

Typical features include **hematemesis, melena, hypotension, tachycardia, and encephalopathy** [^114RgdFV] [^113fuoFH] [^113yiYjf]. Risk factors include large varices, high portal pressure, continued alcohol use, and infection [^1169hxde] [^1146L51E].

---

## Initial assessment and stabilization

- **Airway**: Secure if altered mental status or massive bleeding [^notfound].
- **Breathing**: Oxygen to maintain SpO2 ≥ 92% [^notfound].
- **Circulation**: Two large-bore IVs; crystalloids; transfuse to hemoglobin 7–8 g/dL unless cardiovascular disease present [^111Cnsyr] [^116p3mip].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, INR, liver function, renal function, electrolytes, type and crossmatch [^113yiYjf].
- **Risk stratification**: Child-Pugh and MELD scores guide prognosis and management [^113k2fEM].

---

## Pharmacological management

- **Vasoactive agents**: Start terlipressin, octreotide, or somatostatin immediately; continue 2–5 days [^111Cnsyr] [^116p3mip].
- **Antibiotics**: Ceftriaxone 1 g/day for up to 7 days to prevent infection and rebleeding [^111Cnsyr].
- **Proton pump inhibitor**: Use if ulcer is suspected or confirmed [^116sczUY].

---

## Endoscopic management

- **Timing**: Urgent EGD within 12 hours after stabilization [^111Cnsyr] [^112sfwy6].
- **Esophageal varices**: Endoscopic band ligation (EBL) is first-line [^111Cnsyr] [^116p3mip].
- **Gastric varices**: Cyanoacrylate injection is preferred [^111Cnsyr] [^116KJNcF].
- **Failure of endoscopy**: Consider balloon tamponade or rescue TIPS [^111Cnsyr] [^113fuoFH].

---

## Interventional radiology and surgical options

Interventional radiology with **TIPS** is indicated for refractory bleeding or high-risk patients (Child-Pugh C or HVPG > 20 mmHg) [^111Cnsyr] [^113w3VfU]. Surgery is rarely used and reserved for failures of endoscopic and radiologic therapy [^113fuoFH] [^112bxT17].

---

## Secondary prophylaxis and long-term management

- **Nonselective beta-blockers**: Propranolol or carvedilol to reduce portal pressure and rebleeding [^113uwiuX] [^113XnJDU].
- **Serial EBL**: Repeat every 2–4 weeks until eradication, then surveillance every 3–6 months [^111Cnsyr].
- **Alcohol abstinence**: Essential to reduce recurrence and improve survival [^1146L51E].
- **Surveillance**: Regular endoscopy and HCC screening [^114GXkNR].

---

## Complications and prognosis

Complications include **rebleeding, infection, encephalopathy, renal dysfunction, and death** [^113fuoFH] [^113yiYjf]. Prognosis depends on liver function, bleeding control, and abstinence; mortality remains high in decompensated cirrhosis [^113EN7N7] [^113yiYjf] [^114GXkNR].

---

## Summary of management algorithm

1. Resuscitation and stabilization
2. Pharmacological therapy (vasoactive agents, antibiotics)
3. Urgent endoscopy (EBL or cyanoacrylate injection)
4. Rescue TIPS if refractory
5. Secondary prophylaxis (beta-blockers, serial EBL)
6. Alcohol abstinence and long-term surveillance

### Profile and outcome of patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding presenting to urban emergency departments of tertiary hospitals in tanzania [^111q1HFM]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

As part of the ED management, majority of the patients received intravenous fluids and proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). Although international guidelines such as the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Guidelines (ESGE) suggest use of high dose PPI followed by an hourly infusion, 19 (59.4%) patients with a high clinical Rockall score of ≥ 4 received an initial high dose PPI. It is worthy to note that none of the patients received the hourly PPI infusion as recommended in the guidelines. A knowledge gap concerning the current recommendations amongst the medical care providers maybe the plausible to this shortcoming. As per the departmental protocol, PPI should be given to all patients presenting with UGIB. This may reason out to why PPI was the first choice of drug prior to undergoing endoscopy. A small proportion of the patients received octreotide, although only half of them had indication for its use based on historical features (such esophageal varices and liver diseases) and many of those with such a history did not receive this medication. The utilization was probably limited by the availability and the cost of the drug in our setting. But the fact that some received it inappropriately suggests a knowledge gap. Antibiotic administration especially in patients with prior history of liver disease and esophageal varices was low. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK, emphasizes prophylactic antibiotic use in patients with suspected or confirmed variceal bleed or a history suggestive of liver disease including cirrhosis. Provision of antibiotics was associated with increased incidence of mortality only in univariate analysis, probably due to confounding with the presence of liver disease which is associated with a poor outcome. Finally, despite the high proportion of patients with severe anemia, less than half of the patients received transfusion. A previous study carried out at MNH, revealed difficulties in obtaining blood for transfusion, including a general unavailability of blood, scarcity of un-cross matched blood at the blood bank along with delays in obtaining blood. It is worth noting that ED management of UGIB is guided by the presence of departmental protocol for various conditions including UGIB. As such, provision of certain management may be guided by the protocol.

### Gastrointestinal bleeding [^117XngpF]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal bleeding is a common complaint encountered in the emergency department and frequent cause of hospitalization. Important diagnostic factors that increase morbidity and mortality include advanced age, serious comorbid conditions, hemodynamic instability, esophageal varices, significant hematemesis or melena, and marked anemia. Because gastrointestinal bleeding carries a 10% overall mortality rate, emergency physicians must perform timely diagnosis, aggressive resuscitation, risk stratification, and early consultation for these patients.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^114GXkNR]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD portal hypertension — natural history and surveillance intervals in compensated cirrhosis: In the absence of imaging surrogates of CSPH and when TE is not available, patients with cACLD should undergo surveillance endoscopy. In compensated patients, the prevalence of varices at baseline endoscopy was approximately 25%; among those without varices, new varices were detected at approximately 4.4–5% per year, conversion from small to medium or large occurred within 1–2 years in 10–20% of individuals, and annual incident bleeding within 1 year occurred in approximately 15% of cases with large varices; the natural history is significantly impacted by ongoing liver injury, in particular continued alcohol use. Based on this, consensus guidelines recommend that patients with cACLD without varices who have ongoing liver injury should have endoscopy repeated every 2 years, and those without varices with quiescent liver injury should undergo variceal surveillance every 3 years; emerging data suggest that particularly post-SVR, surveillance may be discontinued after the first surveillance endoscopy shows no varices.

### U.K. guidelines on the management of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients [^113w3VfU]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Acute variceal haemorrhage refractory to endoscopic and pharmacological treatments, where TIPSS is usually indicated, must be managed with appropriate resources. TIPSS is an established interventional treatment for refractory or recurrent variceal haemorrhage. It remains a highly specialised procedure, requiring adequate training and experience. Knowledge of the relevant equipment, anatomy and how to deal with any complications is essential. It should therefore be performed in centres with adequate personnel, multidisciplinary support and equipment required to optimise management and minimise risks. Regional centres with easily accessible interventional radiology services are generally best equipped to perform this procedure. Setting up regional agreements and pathways to allow transfer of appropriate patients to hospitals that undertake TIPSS procedures is an important step. These pathways could also be used to provide emergency endoscopic management if necessary due to problems with out-of-hours endoscopic cover in smaller hospitals. This model referred to as "spoke and wheel" or network model, is well established for other complex procedures and helps to expedite and streamline the process. In the NCEPOD report 'Measuring the units' just 15% of hospitals had on-site access to TIPSS, while 72% had access to TIPSS in other centres.

There have been significant efforts to address the need to improve the upper GI bleeding (UGIB) service. A toolkit was produced in collaboration with BSG; Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons (AUGIS); Royal Colleges of Physicians, Radiology and Nursing; and Academy of Medical Royal Colleges. The key nine service standards recommended by the document are detailed below:
There will be a nominated individual with the authority to ensure implementation by the contracted provider.
Contracted providers will ensure the minimum service is adequately resourced.
All patients with suspected UGIB should be properly assessed and their risk scored on presentation.
All patients should be resuscitated before therapeutic intervention.
All high-risk patients with UGIB should be endoscoped within 24 h, preferably on a planned list in the first instance.
For patients who require more urgent intervention either for endoscopy, interventional radiology or surgery formal 24/7 arrangements must be available.
The necessary team, meeting an agreed competency level, should be available throughout the complete patient pathway.
Each stage of the patient pathway should be carried out in an area with 'appropriate' facilities, equipment and support including staff experienced in the management of UGIB.
All hospitals must collect a minimum dataset in order to measure service provision against auditable outcomes (case-mix adjusted as appropriate).

### Hematochezia in a patient with liver cirrhosis [^1171FrmX]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite the lack of standardised clinical care pathways, it is generally accepted that the treatment of rectal varices focuses on the amelioriation of the underlying pathology- that is the portal hypertension. In cases where the bleeding is especially profuse, the majority consensus seems to be on rapid interventional decompression of the mesenteric circulation either by radiological or surgical means. However, in patients whose only symptom is rectal bleeding and whose general medical condition has yet to be physiologically and/or pharmacologically optimized, we suggest that endoscopic intervention may have a role similar to its use in managing patients with bleeding oesophageal varices.

### Bleeding varices associated with hematologic disorders… [^111a3pqh]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Patients with polycythemia vera or other myeloproliferative disorders often develop vascular thromboses. 8, 13 Should this occur in the hepatic veins or in the vessels of the portal venous system, portal hypertension may develop. 9 Bleeding from esophageal varices may, therefore, occur as a complication of myeloproliferative blood disorders. At The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, two patients with esophageal varices and primary hematologic disease were operated upon to control massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage. A review of the literature reveals that documented cases of a similar nature are few. In view of the seeming rarity of this complication, we think it of interest to report our cases and attempt to ascertain the cause and incidence thereof. Report of Cases Case 1. — A 51-year-old white man was admitted to the hospital on June 4, 1957, with the chief complaint of massive hematemesis of two hours' duration. This was his fifth admission AUFSES AH.

### Diagnostic model of esophageal varices in alcoholic liver disease [^115bvHWt]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Esophageal varices may cause life-threatening bleeding with attendant high hospital cost. Since effective preventive modalities for variceal hemorrhage have been established, early detection of esophageal varices is critical for prevention of bleeding. Currently, endoscopic screening is widely recommended to patients who have the diagnosis of cirrhosis. However, the diagnosis of cirrhosis relies on histological evaluations, which is costly and invasive, and endoscopic screening also burdens medical resources. Recent cost-effectiveness studies suggested that empiric prophylaxis with beta-blockers may be viable in comparison with endoscopic screening in patients with cirrhosis. However, this issue need to be also evaluated taking account of societal and patient perspectives and is not yet decided. An accurate non-invasive diagnostic model to predict the presence of esophageal varices may reduce unnecessary endoscopic procedures and prophylactic medication and improve cost-benefit of these approaches. Use of an accurate serum marker for severe hepatic fibrosis may also improve accuracy of non-invasive diagnostic models. Hyaluronic acid, a serum marker for severe hepatic fibrosis, has been reported to have a high diagnostic performance in assessing the severity of hepatic fibrosis in patients with alcoholic liver disease. In this issue, a non-invasive diagnostic model including hyaluronic acid was shown to have excellent performance in excluding the presence of medium to large esophageal varices in severe alcohol abusers. Based on current evidence, the strategy of using a non-invasive diagnostic model together with a serum marker for severe hepatic fibrosis may improve cost-benefit in the prevention of variceal hemorrhage among patients with alcoholic liver disease. The independent verification of such diagnostic models is needed.

### Profile and outcome of patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding presenting to urban emergency departments of tertiary hospitals in tanzania [^114NBxKg]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Upper Gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a medico-surgical emergency. Although there has been a global decline in the mortality associated with UGIB, the incidence and mortality associated with GI bleeding remains high in limited income countries. In the United States, UGIB accounts for 300,000 admissions per year with approximately 5% mortality rate, whereas in several studies from sub-Saharan Africa, mortality ranges from 6 to 30%. It is not clear if the higher mortality seen in low and middle income countries (LIMC's) is due to patient demographics, severity on presentation, etiology or compliance with care standards. Esophageal varices has been implicated as the most common cause of UGIB in several African studies. Rather than being due to alcoholic liver disease as in high income countries (HIC's), varices in sub-Saharan Africa result from Schistosoma-related portal hypertension. This is in contrast to HIC where erosive gastritis has been commonly implicated. Other potential contributors to the higher mortality may be the severity of disease presentation, as there is little primary care in these settings, and many patients seek care very late in their disease.

Another potential contributor is failure to treat patients in accordance with management guidelines. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for those with suspected Non-variceal UGIB (NVUGIB), somatostatin analogues such as octreotide and antibiotics in suspected cases of variceal UGIB (VUGIB) and in those with clinical suspicion of liver disease, timely blood transfusion and early use of endoscopy may not occur in these settings due to lack of appropriate specialists, lack of resources or supply chain issues. A knowledge gap on the current UGIB management guidelines and recommendations amongst the health care providers may also contribute to inadequate management of UGIB cases. Prior studies in Tanzania studies demonstrate lack of appropriate care offered to patients with UGIB. Nearly half of the patients in one the studies did not receive endoscopic evaluation and treatment whereas 47.1% of the patients who required blood transfusion, did not receive blood transfusion in another study.

### Endoscopic diagnosis and management of esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^111Cnsyr]. Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

1: ESGE recommends that patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD; due to viruses, alcohol, and/or nonobese [BMI < 30 kg/m²] nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) and clinically significant portal hypertension (hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] > 10mmHg and/or liver stiffness by transient elastography > 25 kPa) should receive, if no contraindications, nonselective beta blocker (NSBB) therapy (preferably carvedilol) to prevent the development of variceal bleeding. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 2: ESGE recommends that in those patients unable to receive NSBB therapy with a screening upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy that demonstrates high risk esophageal varices, endoscopic band ligation (EBL) is the endoscopic prophylactic treatment of choice. EBL should be repeated every 2–4 weeks until variceal eradication is achieved. Thereafter, surveillance EGD should be performed every 3–6 months in the first year following eradication. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 3: ESGE recommends, in hemodynamically stable patients with acute upper GI hemorrhage (UGIH) and no history of cardiovascular disease, a restrictive red blood cell (RBC) transfusion strategy, with a hemoglobin threshold of ≤ 70g/L prompting RBC transfusion. A post-transfusion target hemoglobin of 70–90g/L is desired. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 4: ESGE recommends that patients with ACLD presenting with suspected acute variceal bleeding be risk stratified according to the Child-Pugh score and MELD score, and by documentation of active/inactive bleeding at the time of upper GI endoscopy. Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence. 5: ESGE recommends the vasoactive agents terlipressin, octreotide, or somatostatin be initiated at the time of presentation in patients with suspected acute variceal bleeding and be continued for a duration of up to 5 days. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 6: ESGE recommends antibiotic prophylaxis using ceftriaxone 1g/day for up to 7 days for all patients with ACLD presenting with acute variceal hemorrhage, or in accordance with local antibiotic resistance and patient allergies. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 7: ESGE recommends, in the absence of contraindications, intravenous erythromycin 250mg be given 30–120 minutes prior to upper GI endoscopy in patients with suspected acute variceal hemorrhage. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 8: ESGE recommends that, in patients with suspected variceal hemorrhage, endoscopic evaluation should take place within 12 hours from the time of patient presentation provided the patient has been hemodynamically resuscitated. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 9: ESGE recommends EBL for the treatment of acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage (EVH). Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 10: ESGE recommends that, in patients at high risk for recurrent esophageal variceal bleeding following successful endoscopic hemostasis (Child-Pugh C ≤ 13 or Child-Pugh B > 7 with active EVH at the time of endoscopy despite vasoactive agents, or HVPG > 20mmHg), pre-emptive transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) within 72 hours (preferably within 24 hours) must be considered. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 11: ESGE recommends that, for persistent esophageal variceal bleeding despite vasoactive pharmacological and endoscopic hemostasis therapy, urgent rescue TIPS should be considered (where available). Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 12: ESGE recommends endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection for acute gastric (cardiofundal) variceal (GOV2, IGV1) hemorrhage. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 13: ESGE recommends endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection or EBL in patients with GOV1-specific bleeding. Strong recommendations, moderate quality evidence. 14: ESGE suggests urgent rescue TIPS or balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) for gastric variceal bleeding when there is a failure of endoscopic hemostasis or early recurrent bleeding. Weak recommendation, low quality evidence. 15: ESGE recommends that patients who have undergone EBL for acute EVH should be scheduled for follow-up EBLs at 1- to 4-weekly intervals to eradicate esophageal varices (secondary prophylaxis). Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 16: ESGE recommends the use of NSBBs (propranolol or carvedilol) in combination with endoscopic therapy for secondary prophylaxis in EVH in patients with ACLD. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence.

### Diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-associated liver diseases: 2019 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1146L51E]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Treatment of AH — abstinence is a proven benefit. Continued alcohol use in the setting of AH results in increased rates of variceal bleeding, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and risk of developing HCC and death. All patients with ALD should be advised to abstain completely from alcohol use, although harm reduction models, which favor alcohol reduction over total abstinence based on a patient's stated goals, may be appropriate in some contexts.

### Bleeding caused by portal hypertension [^115fkhB2]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Variceal bleeding is one of the dreaded complications of portal hypertension. Patients who have suspected or proven cirrhosis should undergo diagnostic upper endoscopy to detect medium and large gastro-esophageal varices. Patients with medium and large gastro-esophageal varices should be treated with non-selective beta-blockers (propranolol or nadolol), and these agents should be titrated to a heart rate of 55 beats per minute or adverse effects. If there are contraindications to or if patients are intolerant to beta-blockers, it is appropriate to consider prophylactic banding therapy for individuals with medium-to-large esophageal varices. When patients who have cirrhosis present with GI bleeding, they should be resuscitated and receive octreotide or other vasoactive agents. Endoscopy should be performed promptly to diagnose the source of bleeding and to provide endoscopic therapy (preferably banding). The currently available treatment for acute variceal bleeding provides hemostasis in most patients. These patients, however, are at significant risk for rebleeding unless secondary prophylaxis is provided. Although various pharmacological, endoscopic, radiological, and surgical options are available, combined pharmacological and endoscopic therapy is the most common form of secondary prophylaxis. TIPS is a radiologically placed portasystemic shunt, and if placed in suitable patients, it can provide effective treatment for patients with variceal bleeding that is refractory to medical and endoscopic therapy.

Discussion

Our findings validated that endoscopists in developed and developing countries have differences in their practices to manage GOV in patients with cirrhosis. Researches have shown that compared with no intervention, which typically presents with high risk of esophageal varices in individuals with cirrhosis and no previous history of bleeding, the use of beta-blockers, endoscopic ligation, or ligation combined with beta-blockers can reduce the mortality. However, the effect of the intervention on esophageal varices remains uncertain.

Our survey revealed that endoscopists in developing countries used a combination of endoscopy and medicine to prevent bleeding from medium or large non-hemorrhagic esophageal varices, whereas they prescribed oral β-blockers as the primary prophylaxis for the bleeding of esophageal varices.

Notably, gastric varices are rarer than the esophageal varices, and their bleeding is more severe than that of esophageal varices. To our knowledge, there is no guideline to recommend any prevention measures for gastric varices. In our survey, among the various measures for the primary prevention for non-hemorrhagic large gastric varices, most endoscopists in developed countries administered drug therapy, whereas some physicians in developing countries chose drug therapy, and some chose follow-up or endoscopic therapy. More high-quality clinical studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of primary prevention measures for gastric varices bleeding.

Some guidelines recommend that endoscopy should be performed within 12 h of hemodynamic resuscitation in patients with suspected AVB, and conversely, if the patient's vital signs are unstable, the patient should undergo endoscopic treatment safely as soon as possible. However, the recommendation level for undergoing endoscopic treatment for AVB is not high. Other studies have shown that performing endoscopy within 6 h of gastroenterology consultation for acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding was not associated with a lower incidence of mortality or rebleeding than performing it within 24 h. Our survey found that most endoscopists in developed countries performed endoscopy within 2–6 h of admission, whereas most endoscopists in developing countries performed endoscopy within 6–12 h of admission. More research evidence is needed on the timing and preferred measures of endoscopy to reduce mortality and rebleeding in patients with AVB.

2 CASE 1: ACUTE UPPER GI BLEEDING

A 56‐year‐old man with a history of non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease‐related cirrhosis presents to the emergency department with acute onset hematemesis and melena which began earlier in the day. He has never had bleeding before but routine upper endoscopy 3 months ago showed large esophageal varices (EV) which were electively band ligated endoscopically but the varices were not completely eradicated. There is no history of ascites or hepatic encephalopathy and the patient is not on anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents. On presentation, he is hypotensive but awake. Initial laboratory testing shows hemoglobin 6.2 g/dl, total bilirubin 2.8 mg/dl, albumin 3.0 g/dl, PT 28 s, international normalized ratio (INR) 2.4, creatinine 1.9 mg/dl, platelet count 39 000/µl, fibrinogen 100 mg/dl. The patient is Child Turcotte Pugh (CTP) class B and the model for end stage liver disease (MELD) score is 26.

This patient presents with a common complication of cirrhosis, acute large volume upper GI bleeding. The most likely source of the bleeding in this patient is from ruptured EV although peptic ulcer disease and other non‐portal hypertension related sources are not uncommon in this population. Acute esophageal variceal bleeding (EVB) occurs at a rate of 10%–15% per year in patients with portal hypertension and cirrhosisand is often the initial decompensating event in the course of progressive portal hypertension. Multiple factors are associated with increased risk for rupture of EV including measures of progressive liver disease, increasing size of the varices, and the appearance of wall thinning of the vessel when viewed endoscopically ("red wale marks") but fundamentally they all relate to the effects of increased pressure in the portal venous system. It is this increased pressure within the maximally distended varices that leads to rupture and hemorrhage, thus EVB is primarily a mechanical or pressure‐related hemorrhagic event and not directly based on hemostatic failure. Data showing that patients with cirrhosis actively taking anticoagulants at the time of EVB have similar adjusted rebleeding and survival outcomes compared to those not taking these medicationsand the lack of benefit of recombinant factor VIIa (rVIIa) infusion in EVB, both support the argument that hemostatic failure is not a major contributor to variceal bleeding or outcome. 'If an alternate source of bleeding is discovered, the contribution of hemostatic failure remains uncertain; the principles further discussed below remain relevant'.

### Emergency treatment of bleeding esophageal varices… [^114r6KP8]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

THE CRITICAL problem presented by the cirrhotic patient during massive hemorrhage from esophageal varices can be attacked actively by either the transthoracic or the peroral route. An entirely satisfactory way to stop variceal hemorrhage has not yet been found, and all must agree that at times it is impossible to control it by any means. Control is urgent, not only because of the blood loss itself but also for prevention of liver failure. If blood is readily available for transfusion, liver failure is more frequently a threat to life than exsanguination. Therefore it is most important that hemorrhage be checked quickly, even though blood replacement can be kept abreast of blood loss. The goal of emergency treatment of bleeding esophageal varices at Walter Reed Army Hospital is control of bleeding until portal decompression — preferably by portacaval shunt — can be accomplished. It is believed that at present no definitive procedure can safely be. PALMER ED.

Compensated cirrhosis — surveillance endoscopy intervals for no or small varices: Patients with compensated cirrhosis (CC) without varices on screening endoscopy should have endoscopy repeated every 2 years (with ongoing liver injury or associated conditions, such as obesity and alcohol use) or every 3 years (if liver injury is quiescent, e.g., after viral elimination, alcohol abstinence). Patients with CC with small varices on screening endoscopy should have endoscopy repeated every year (with ongoing liver injury) or every 2 years (if liver injury is quiescent, e.g., after viral elimination, alcohol abstinence). Because development of decompensation could indicate worsening of PH and liver dysfunction, patients with no or small varices on screening endoscopy should have a repeat endoscopy performed when and if decompensation develops. Although probably reasonable, there are no data to support discontinuing screening endoscopies if several of them are negative for varices.

### Treatment of bleeding esophageal varices… [^114KZjm8]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

When massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurs, esophageal varices must be considered as a possible cause. The Sengstaken tube, equipped with a balloon that can be inflated after it has reached the stomach, also permits aspiration of gastric contents. If used as here suggested it will generally stop hemorrhage due to esophageal varices or give diagnostic clues when the hemorrhage is from other sources. While it is in place the patient requires constant nursing care, and such tamponage if continued longer than 48 hours increases the risk of subsequent operation. The timing of the definitive surgery, location of the incision, and type of operation are decided by the patient's history, general condition, and loboratory tests. For patients who have bled repeatedly from proved esophageal varices, who are not jaundiced, and who show no signs of ammonia intoxication, the recommended operation is portacaval end-to-side anastomosis.

### Approach to the pharmacological management of chronic pain in patients with an alcohol use disorder [^113uHneS]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

Alcohol consumption can increase risk of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)-related gastrointestinal (GI) effects. Chronic alcohol ingestion together with administration of aspirin may compromise gastroduodenal integrity, and mucosal hemorrhages are often found on endoscopy. Although epidemiology studies examining the association between GI bleed and alcohol consumption have conflicting results, one large case-control study described an increased relative risk of bleeding up to sixfold in current heavy drinkers (≥ 35 drinks weekly). A small but significant increased risk was also seen in former drinkers.NSAID use and a history of alcohol abuse have resulted in an odds ratio of 10.2 for severe GI events.

In light of the increased risk of GI complications, use of NSAIDs in patients with CNCP and a history or current alcohol use disorder requires caution. If selected, the lowest effective dose is recommended, as NSAID-related GI toxicity is dose dependent. For patients who are at high risk of GI bleeding, the addition of a proton-pump inhibitor should be considered. A cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor may be an appropriate alternative in the absence of cardiovascular risk factors or disease.

### Noninvasive diagnosis of esophageal varices: is it feasible? [^115Eenfb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

The possibility of identifying cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices by noninvasive means is attractive, because it would allow for the restriction of the performance of screening endoscopy to patients at high risk of having varices. Over the years, several studies addressing this issue have been performed with little success. The recently proposed platelet count/spleen diameter ratio appears to be the best noninvasive predictor of esophageal varices developed so far. However, the available evidence is not yet sufficient to allow for the modification of the current policy of screening cirrhotic patients by endoscopy at the time of diagnosis to detect varices.

### Challenges in the management of esophagogastric varices and variceal hemorrhage in cirrhosis – A narrative review [^1146QsMr]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Over the past decade, significant advancements in pharmacological, endoscopic, and radiographic treatments have emerged in the management of patients with cirrhosis and esophagogastric varices or variceal hemorrhage. These advances have been in several areas, including the role of screening and primary prophylaxis (preventing an initial variceal bleed), evaluation and management of acute esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage, and in preventing variceal rebleeding. Therefore, we believe there is a need for an updated, evidence-based "narrative review" on this important clinical topic that will be relevant for internists, hospitalists, intensive care unit physicians, and those in training. We believe the guidance presented in this narrative review will enhance daily medical practice of health care professionals and has the potential to improve quality of care for these complex patients.

Purpose Of Review

Management of esophageal bleeding disorder remains a challenging problem. This review focuses on studies published in previous 12 months that provided further understanding on the appropriate treatment of various esophageal bleeding disorders. Other uncommon causes of esophageal bleeding will also be discussed in this review.

Recent Findings

With the advances in endoscopic and pharmacological treatments, mortality of variceal hemorrhage has been substantially reduced. Apart from its major role in initial treatment of variceal bleeding, mounting evidence shows that band ligation is a safe alternative to beta-blocker for primary prophylaxis and may even be used as an adjunct to the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt to obviate the need of long-term surveillance. While vasoactive agents remain the most important pharmacological treatment of esophageal variceal bleeding, antibiotic prophylaxis is also increasingly recognized to play a role in prevention of variceal rebleeding. The benefit of beta-blocker has now been extended to halt the progression of esophageal varices and combination of beta-blocker and band ligation remains the most cost-effective treatment strategy for secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. Other new treatments such as endoloop and recombination factor VII have produced promising results. The clinical courses of variceal bleeding in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and acute necrotizing esophagitis are now better defined.

Summary

There are significant advances in the treatment of esophageal variceal bleeding and further understanding on the management and clinical courses of various esophageal bleeding disorders.

Service delivery and development

Despite improvements in outcomes following variceal bleeding, the need to optimise the management of acute variceal bleeding is highlighted in recent publications and national reports. In a national audit, variceal bleeding accounted for just over 10% of all admissions with acute GI bleeding in the UK, with two-thirds having a previous history of variceal bleeding and over 50% presenting during normal working hours. Endoscopy within 24 h of presentation was achieved in only 66% of all patients and in 70% of patients with documented cirrhosis. Most procedures were performed in the endoscopy department, with just 14% performed under general anaesthetic despite high-risk stigmata and endoscopic therapy being required in two-thirds of cases. Notably, antibiotics were administered in only 27% of patients before endoscopy, and administration of vasoactive drugs before endoscopy was only slightly higher at 44%. Furthermore, only four patients (< 1%) were referred for TIPSS, which may reflect the lack of access to interventional radiology, and that the audit was conducted before the trial of early TIPSS. The National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD) report 'Measuring the units' assessed clinical management before death of 594 patients with alcoholic liver disease over a 6-month period in the UK. Gastrointestinal bleeding was noted in 35% of cases, with approximately 50% having variceal bleeding. Delays in endoscopy were noted in 10% of cases, and several aspects of clinical and/or organisational care were judged to be poor or unacceptable in 18% of patients presenting with GI bleeding. There were deficiencies noted in the out-of-hours rotas for GI bleeding, with 27% of hospitals not having a dedicated-out-of hours GI bleeding service. Studies from other countries have also reported deficiencies, with delays in admission to hospital and administration of antibiotics. Two observational studies showed that access to emergency endoscopy and use of prophylactic antibiotics and vasoactive drugs was better in tertiary centres, although this did not appear to affect survival.

### Portal vein thrombosis and esophageal-gastric variceal bleeding in cirrhosis: shared risk factors and causal relationship [^113EN7N7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cirrhosis, a severe liver disease marked by irreversible structural and functional changes from prolonged liver damage, is the primary risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), present in 85–95% of HCC cases. Major etiologies include chronic viral hepatitis (hepatitis B and C), excessive alcohol consumption, autoimmune liver disease, genetic disorders, and long-term exposure to toxins or drugs. Complications of cirrhosis, such as Esophageal-Gastric Variceal Bleeding (EGVB), portal vein thrombosis (PVT), hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatopulmonary syndrome, hepatorenal syndrome, and HCC, have a significant impact on patient survival and mortality. Current cirrhosis treatment focuses on controlling the underlying causes, relieving symptoms, and managing complications, but long-term management of patients remains challenging.

EGVB, a severe complication of cirrhosis with high mortality, is particularly lethal in Child-Pugh C patients. Portal hypertension is central to the development of EGVB. PVT, another complication involving thrombus formation in the portal vein, is associated with high mortality and morbidity in cirrhosis patients. Its pathogenesis, related to Virchow's triad, is significantly influenced by reduced blood flow due to portal hypertension. Although anticoagulation therapy is common for PVT treatment, its use in nonacute PVT in cirrhosis patients is approached with caution due to the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Recent studies suggest that anticoagulation may not increase the incidence of EGVB in cirrhosis patients. The coexistence of PVT and EGVB in cirrhosis creates management challenges due to their potential causal relationship and conflicting treatments.

This study retrospectively analyzes the common risk factors and correlation between PVT and EGVB in cirrhosis patients. By understanding these factors, it aims to guide personalized treatment strategies to balance bleeding and thrombosis risks. Its innovation lies in thoroughly evaluating the PVT and EGVB relationship, offering fresh insights into managing these complex complications.

### Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^112hTHZ8]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a common emergency presentation requiring prompt resuscitation and management. Peptic ulcers are the most common cause of the condition. Thorough initial management with a structured approach is vital with appropriate intravenous fluid resuscitation and use of a restrictive transfusion threshold of 7–8 g/dL. Pre-endoscopic scoring tools enable identification of patients at high risk and at very low risk who might benefit from specific management. Endoscopy should be carried out within 24 h of presentation for patients admitted to hospital, although optimal timing for patients at a higher risk within this period is less clear. Endoscopic treatment of high risk lesions and use of subsequent high dose proton pump inhibitors is a cornerstone of non-variceal bleeding management. Variceal haemorrhage results in higher mortality than non-variceal haemorrhage and, if suspected, antibiotics and vasopressors should be administered urgently, before endoscopy. Oesophageal variceal bleeding requires endoscopic band ligation, whereas bleeding from gastric varices requires thrombin or tissue glue injection. Recurrent bleeding is managed by repeat endoscopic treatment. If uncontrolled bleeding occurs, interventional radiological embolisation or surgery is required for non-variceal bleeding or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement for variceal bleeding.

AASLD portal hypertension — management of compensated cirrhosis with a contraindication to or intolerance of beta-blockers: Patients with compensated cirrhosis who have contraindication for beta-blockers or who do not tolerate beta-blockers have at present no further therapeutic options to avoid clinical decompensation other than control of the underlying disease. Although a possible benefit of statins to prevent decompensation in this setting is pathophysiologically plausible and retrospective studies suggest that statins reduce the incidence of decompensation, there are insufficient data to recommend its routine use. Patients with a standard indication for statin therapy should continue treatment, and statins should not be discouraged when indicated. In patient with cACLD with CSPH for whom beta-blockers cannot be safely administered, endoscopic surveillance should be initiated with an intent to prevent first variceal hemorrhage (primary prophylaxis) through prophylactic endoscopic band ligation of high-risk varices. Performance of an endoscopy every 2 years is recommended; however, if cause of the liver disease is under control (alcohol abstinence, weight control, viral suppression or elimination, etc.), endoscopic surveillance may be done every 3 years. In some cases, cessation of surveillance may be considered after negative serial endoscopic assessments.

Screening and surveillance of varices and primary prevention of variceal bleeding

In patients with cirrhosis, varices develop at a rate of 5% per year with a 10-year cumulative incidence of 44%. Variceal bleeding results in an inpatient mortality of 15% and 1-year mortality of up to 40%. Reducing the risk of the first variceal bleed (primary prevention) is an important clinical and economic goal.

Current UK guidelines recommend endoscopic screening in all patients with cirrhosis. Many units now use the Baveno VI criteria to circumvent the need for endoscopy in some patients with compensated disease. The Baveno VI criteria (liver stiffness measurement (LSM) < 20 kPa on TE and platelet count > 150 × 10⁹/L) were developed to identify patients with a low probability of high-risk varices, in whom endoscopy can be avoided. These criteria have been increasingly used during the COVID-19 pandemic to prioritise those at highest risk, but their ongoing use remains controversial, and dependent on the circumstances of individual units and patient preference. If the Baveno VI criteria are used, TE and platelet count should be repeated annually in the presence of active liver disease (ongoing alcohol consumption, untreated viral hepatitis, cofactors such as obesity) — if LSM increases to > 20 kPa or platelet count falls below 150 × 10⁹/L, screening endoscopy should be performed. Centres lacking the capacity to perform annual TE should continue to screen all patients endoscopically.

### Towards personalised management for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^113A8nA2]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Guidelines from national and international professional societies on upper gastrointestinal bleeding highlight the important clinical issues but do not always identify specific management strategies pertaining to individual patients. Optimal treatment should consider the personal needs of an individual patient and the pertinent resources and experience available at the point of care. This article integrates international guidelines and consensus into three stages of management: pre-endoscopic assessment and treatment, endoscopic evaluation and haemostasis and postendoscopic management. We emphasise the need for personalised management strategies based on patient characteristics, nature of bleeding lesions and the clinical setting including available resources.

### Severe bleeding from esophageal varices resistant to endoscopic treatment in a non cirrhotic patient with portal hypertension [^115G3CKf]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 58-year-old non alcoholic patient was admitted to hospital for investigation of hematemesis and melena. Twelve months earlier he had undergone elective open cholecystectomy for chronic calculous cholecystitis complicated by a biliary fistula that had resolved spontaneously. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy disclosed bloody esophageal varices and the bleeding was successfully controlled by endoscopic sclerotherapy. During repeated endoscopic sessions the varices were progressively eradicated by ligation. Laboratory serum screening and liver ultrasound excluded the presence of cirrhosis while the portal echo-color Doppler ultrasound examination detected portal vein thrombosis. Laboratory tests of blood coagulation yielded normal findings.

Three months after the latest endoscopic follow-up, the patient was readmitted to hospital with severe hemorrhage. A repeat endoscopy showed recurrent variceal hemorrhage that responded poorly to sclerotherapy leaving intermittent bleeding. Because endoscopic therapy failed to control the bleeding and portal thrombosis made TIPS unfeasible, an open surgical procedure was scheduled (nonselective side-to-side portacaval shunting). At operation, because severe fibrosis prevented access to the hepatic hilum thus making nonselective portacaval shunting unfeasible, the patient underwent an alternative surgical procedure, esophageal transection. After surgery the bleeding continued. A second portal echo-color Doppler ultrasound study and computed tomographic (CT) scan disclosed a thrombus completely occluding the right portal vein branch with an apparent re-channeling of the left branch. An emergency angioradiologic procedure was scheduled.

### Torrential upper gastrointestinal bleeding from' downhill'oesophageal varices complicating long term central venous access for total parenteral nutrition [^116WCTai]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Oesophageal varices usually develop in the setting of portal hypertension secondary to chronic liver disease. However, superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction can result in 'downhill' varices forming in the upper oesophagus. A case of torrential upper gastrointestinal bleeding from SVC obstruction due to chronic central venous access for home total parenteral nutrition is described. It is suggested that in patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of SVC obstruction, 'downhill' varices should be suspected. The current literature is discussed regarding management of such varices. It is recommended that endoscopic variceal surveillance be carried out in patients with known SVC obstruction.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of bleeding gastric varices: expert review [^111y1hVz]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Gastric varices (GV) classification — use and limitations of Sarin and risk features: In practice, most gastroenterologists use the Sarin classification with the main distinction being cardiofundal vs lesser curvature GV, but the vascular supply and corresponding therapy for GV and esophageal varices (EV) are often different so a merged classification, such as Sarin's, can be problematic for therapeutic planning purposes; an alternative nomenclature based on location within the stomach is clearer and facilitates correlation with vascular imaging. GV can also be classified by risk of bleeding, with risk factors including GV size and the presence of a red mark or discoloration, and based on this, we recommend adding an estimate of variceal size and high-risk stigmata (discolored marks, platelet plugs) to the Sarin classification when describing GV.

### British society of gastroenterology best practice guidance: outpatient management of cirrhosis-part 1: compensated cirrhosis [^113iWybM]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

There are two options for primary prevention of variceal bleeding: non-selective beta-blockers (NSBBs) and variceal band ligation (VBL). At present, we recommend NSBB or VBL in medium to large varices (> 5 mm in diameter), considering comorbidities, tolerances and patient choice. Patients on NSBB for primary prevention do not need further surveillance. Those who have VBL should have banding approximately every 4 weeks until the varices are eradicated; in those who continue to have active liver disease (eg, still drinking alcohol), we would recommend rescope at 1 year (or if they develop decompensation) and then 1–2 yearly until abstinence is achieved and there is evidence that their liver disease is stable or improving.

A recent meta-analysis, including results from the PREDESCI trial, suggests that NSBB such as carvedilol may reduce decompensation and mortality in patients with compensated cirrhosis, particularly in the presence of varices. Based on this evidence, carvedilol, where tolerated, could be preferred to VBL in patients with compensated cirrhosis and medium to large varices. In addition, carvedilol could be considered in patients with small varices (defined as varices < 5 mm in diameter or varices which completely disappear on moderate insufflation of the oesophagus) and compensated cirrhosis in the presence of active liver disease. However, concerns of poor tolerance and concordance with NSBB (particularly in ARLD with ongoing alcohol use) could limit NSBB use in small varices and make VBL a preferable option in some patients with medium/large varices. We are currently awaiting the results of CALIBREand BOPPP, two multicentre randomised controlled trials (RCTs) aimed at definitively addressing these issues.

Another area of active debate is the role of NSBB in preventing decompensation in clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH), defined by the Baveno group as hepatic venous pressure gradient ≥ 10 mm Hg or LSM > 25 kPa. The recently published updated Baveno VII document includes a recommendation to use NSBB in all patients with CSPHregardless of the presence of varices. However, we believe further studies are required, and we do not currently advocate prescribing NSBB based on non-invasive markers (such as TE) alone, without endoscopic evidence of varices.

Results

Patients

At first, there were a total of 415 cirrhotic patients with symptoms of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 265 eligible patients with cirrhosis admitted for EVB were included in this study (Fig. 1). Table 1 outlines the baseline characteristics of the patients enrolled. The median age was 55 years (IQR: 50–64), and 231 (87.2%) patients were male. Of the patients, 32.5% (86) reported a history of variceal bleeding before this study. Alcohol abuse was the predominant etiology of cirrhosis (53.2%), followed by chronic hepatitis B infection (18.9%). Liver cancer accounted for 15.5% (41) of the cases. The majority of patients (79.3%) were admitted with hematemesis as the primary symptom.

Upon admission, patients presented with an elevated heart rate with a median of 92 beats per minute, and a median systolic blood pressure was 110 mmHg. In terms of the severity of liver disease, more than 80% of cirrhotic patients had a Child-Pugh score of 7 or higher (Child B or C). In addition, the majority of admitted patients had MELD and MELD-Na scores exceeding 10, with prevalence rates of 73.6% and 94.7%, respectively. At the same time, their median Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS) was also ≥ 7, indicating a high risk of bleeding and the need for urgent endoscopy intervention.

In comparing the two groups, patients who underwent early endoscopy (< 12 h) had a significantly higher incidence of hematemesis and heart rate at admission compared to those who received delayed endoscopy (≥ 12 h) (p = 0.008 and p = < 0.001). However, no significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding other baseline characteristics with p > 0.05. After 1:1 PSM, 90 patients from each group were analysed, and no significant differences were found between the two groups regarding all baseline features.

Introduction

Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a serious and common medical emergency in daily clinical practice, which can lead to unpredictable consequences. In patients with cirrhosis, the most common cause of upper GI bleeding is the rupture of esophageal varices due to portal hypertension. This condition occurs when blood flow in the portal vein is obstructed by structural changes in the cirrhotic liver, resulting in elevated portal pressure and the dilation and rupture of esophageal varices. Nowadays despite advances in management, treatment, and prevention of complications in cirrhosis, the incidence of bleeding from ruptured esophageal varices remains high, ranging from 20 to 40%, with a six-week mortality of 10–20%. Hence, this is a serious complication, directly threatening the patient's life if not intervened promptly. Currently, overall management of esophageal variceal bleeding (EVB) mainly focuses on key measures such as initial resuscitation to stabilise hemodynamics, the use of vasoconstrictive drugs to reduce portal pressure (octreotide, somatostatin, terlipressin), prophylactic antibiotics, and urgent endoscopic intervention. These approaches not only control bleeding but also contribute significantly to improving long-term outcomes in cirrhotic patients.

It is undeniable that endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is the mainstay treatment for EVB, however, the optimal timing for endoscopy remains a topic of debate in present guidelines and research. Most existing guidelines, including the Baveno VII consensus, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guideline, the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline, and the Belgian guideline, suggest that endoscopy should be performed within 12 h of symptom onset in cirrhotic patients with EVB. In contrast, the UK guideline recommends that in case of severe variceal bleeding and hemodynamic instability, endoscopy should be performed immediately after resuscitation. For others, it should be conducted within 24 h after hospitalisation. Meanwhile, Chinese guideline proposes that endoscopy should be conducted within 12–24 h after the presentation of variceal bleeding. Moreover, these conflicting recommendations appear to rely more on expert consensus than on solid clinical evidence.

Chronic hepatitis C after sustained virologic response (SVR) — esophageal varices risk and proposed variceal bleeding management: A cohort of 444 patients with compensated HCV cirrhosis was divided into 218 with stage 1 and 226 with stage 2, with a median follow-up of 7.6 years (range, 1–12.6 years); in stage 1, SVR was associated with fewer new varices (hazard ratio, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.11–0.48; P < .001), whereas in stage 2, SVR was not associated with fewer further varices (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95% CI, 0.33–1.03). Based on the available literature, a proposed practical approach is: no varices — follow-up endoscopy after 2–3 years and no further screening if negative; small varices, no treatment — follow-up endoscopy after 2–3 years with further actions as stated; prior primary prophylaxis with β-blockers and/or band ligation — repeat after 6–12 months and repeat after 1–2 years once low risk; decompensated or prior bleeding — close surveillance and/or treatment as already instituted. Although updated Baveno VI guidance supports risk stratification using a TE cutoff of < 20 kPa and platelet count > 150,000/μL to identify patients at low risk who may not require screening endoscopy, in post-SVR populations such data are not yet available and application of these cutoffs should be approached with caution and on an individual-patient basis.

Assessing the quality of guidelines: the AGREE II instrument

The AGREE II instrument is an accepted method for appraising clinical guidelines. Six domains are listed:

Scope and purpose

The guidelines are intended for use by clinicians and other healthcare professionals managing patients with cirrhosis and gastro-oesophageal varices in light of recent guidance published by NICEand the Baveno V Consensus. Important subsequent developments are covered in depth due to the potential impact on clinical practice. The guidelines are primarily aimed at management of adult patients

Guideline development group membership and stakeholder involvement

Membership of the group includes gastroenterologists, hepatologists and interventional radiologists with nursing and patient representation.

Rigour of development

The published literature was searched using Pubmed, Medline, Web of Knowledge and the Cochrane database between October 2013 and February 2015. The GDG met through a series of teleconferences during that time. The guidelines rely considerably on consensus statements published by the Baveno V Consensus and NICE. The style of graded recommendations is determined by the level of supporting evidence (graded level 1 to 5) as described by the Oxford Centre For Evidence Based Medicine(table 1) and is as follows:
A: consistent level 1 studies;
B: consistent level 2 or 3 studies or extrapolations from level 1 studies;
C: level 4 studies or extrapolations from level 2 or 3 studies;
D: level 5 evidence or troublingly inconsistent or inconclusive studies of any level.

Table 1
Levels of evidence

Areas of disagreement about the recommendation grade were subjected to discussion and, if necessary, voting by members of the guidelines group. Where possible, the health benefits, side effects and risks of recommendations have been discussed. The guidelines were subject to peer review after submission for consideration of publication in Gut.

Clarity and presentation

Recommendations are intended to be specific to particular situations and patient groups; where necessary, different options are listed. Key recommendations are linked to discussion threads on a discussion forum hosted on the BSG website.

Applicability

Where necessary, we have discussed organisational changes that may be needed in order to apply recommendations. We have attempted to identify key criteria for monitoring and audit purposes.

Editorial independence and conflict of interest

Guideline group members have declared any conflicts of interest.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding — initial medical management and antithrombotic considerations: Target hemoglobin is generally 9 g/dL in patients with significant cardiovascular disease and 7 g/dL for all others, and the consensus recommendation was for blood transfusion for hemoglobin levels < 8 g/dL with a threshold for those with cardiovascular disease. Intravenous proton pump inhibitors should be administered to all patients with suspected NVUGIB and should not delay endoscopic intervention, and high-dose intravenous proton pump inhibitors should be continued post endoscopy because their use is associated with decreased risk of rebleeding. The need for reversal of antithrombotic medications requires careful consideration of the risks of thromboembolic events, these decisions should be made by the gastroenterologist in consultation with intensivists, cardiologists, neurologists, and hematologists, and when there is doubt, it is usually better to err on the side of not reversing AT medication because a cardiopulmonary or neurologic thromboembolic event is usually far more devastating than ongoing NVUGIB.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of bleeding gastric varices: expert review [^111X1ff8]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of bleeding gastric varices (GV) presents a unique challenge for patients with portal hypertension. Despite over thirty years of diagnostic and treatment advances standardized practices for bleeding GV are lacking and unsupported by adequate evidence. There are no definitive natural history studies to help with risk assessment or prospective clinical trials to guide clinical decision making. Available literature on the natural history and management of gastric varices consists of case series, restricted cohort studies, and a few small randomized trials, all of which have significant selection biases. This review summarizes the available data and recommendations based on expert opinion on how best to diagnose and manage bleeding from gastric varices. Table 1 summarizes our recommendations.

### An assessment of the management of acute bleeding varices: a multicenter prospective member-based study [^113fuoFH]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Bleeding from esophagogastric varices is a major complication of portal hypertension. Despite recent practice guidelines for the management of bleeding esophageal or gastric varices, the widespread application of these measures by gastroenterologists has not been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to continue the concept of membership-based research within diverse practice settings by expanding the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) GI Bleeding Registry to assess the management and outcome of acute variceal bleeding.

Methods

All ACG members (domestic and foreign) were invited to participate during the 1997 Annual Fall meeting and by mail. Data were collected over 12 months. Information obtained included physician training, practice demographics, patient demographics, disease etiology and severity, clinical presentation, medications, transfusion needs, therapy, complications, and rebleeding within 2 wk.

Results

A total of 93 physicians/centers (79.6% domestic, 26.9% university and affiliated, 3.2% Veterans Affairs) participated. Complete demographic data were available for 725 of the 741 patients enrolled with index bleeding. The median age of these 725 patients was 52 yr and 73.3% were male. The most common single etiology for portal hypertension was cirrhosis (94.3%). The most common causes of cirrhosis were alcohol (56.7%), hepatitis C virus (30.3%), and hepatitis B virus (10.0%). Hemodynamic instability was noted in 60.7% of the patients (22.3% tachycardic, 9.7% orthostatic, 28.7% hypotensive). Index interventions included banding (40.8%; median five bands), sclerotherapy (36.3%), combination banding/sclerotherapy (6.2%), octreotide (52.6%; median 3 days), balloon tamponade (5.5%), transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) (6.6%), liver transplantation (1.1%), surgical shunt (0.7%), and embolization (0.1%). Transfusion of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets was given in 83.4%, 44.7%, and 24.6% of the patients with index bleeding, respectively. Median transfusion was four units of packed red blood cells, three units of fresh frozen plasma, and 1.5 units of platelets. Rebleeding occurred in 92 of the 741 patients (12.6%) at a median of 7 days (mean 11 days) and was treated by banding (18.5%; median six bands), sclerotherapy (30.4%), octreotide (63%; median 2 days), balloon tamponade (17.4%), TIPS (15.2%), and surgical shunt (3.3%). Complications from the index bleeding and rebleeding within 2 wk included ulceration (2.6%, 2.2%), aspiration (2.4%, 3.3%), medication side effects (0.8%, 0%), dysphagia (2.3%, 0%), odynophagia (2.2%,0%), encephalopathy (13%,17.4%), and hepatorenal syndrome (2.4%, 2.2%), respectively. After the index bleeding, 46.2% of patients were treated with beta-blockers and 8.2% with nitrates. The majority of patients with index bleeding had Child's B cirrhosis (61.5%). Patients presenting with recurrent bleeding had mostly Child's B (46.7%) or Child's C cirrhosis (44.6%). The overall short-term mortality after index bleeding was 12.9%.

Conclusions

Acute variceal hemorrhage occurs more often in patients with Child's B and C cirrhosis. Endoscopic banding is the most common single endoscopic intervention. Adjunctive pharmacotherapy is prevalent acutely and after stabilization. Both morbidity and mortality may be lower than reported in previous studies.

### Mortality prediction of nonalcoholic patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding using data mining [^114RgdFV]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

Patients with acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding commonly present with hematemesis and/or melena. More studies are needed to confirm the ability to predict mortality, length of stay, and cost. Alcohol abuse may worsen variceal bleeding or portal hypertensive gastropathy in a patient with a history of liver disease. Coexisting alcoholism may influence patient management in the setting of peptic ulceration or existing malignancy. Consequently, the overall morbidities and mortalities may differ in alcoholic and nonalcoholic groups accordingly. Mortality prediction using data mining programs is helpful for detection of significant mortality-related factors.

Patients and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 152 files of patients presenting with upper GI bleeding, because of nonalcoholic causes, 100 males and 52 females aged 16–77 years old. Causes of upper GI bleeding were esophageal and/or gastric varices (51), portal hypertensive congestive gastropathy (6), gastric and/or duodenal ulcers (39), gastroesophageal reflux disease (20), gastritis and duodenitis (19), cancer (8), gastric polyps (3), blood diseases (2), Dieulafoy's lesion (2), and no aberrant cause of bleeding in two patients.

Results

The overall mortality was 29 patients (19.07%). The use of a descriptive model of the data mining program yielded the most significant mortality predictors. The overall accuracy was 92.08%.

Conclusion

Chronic hepatitis C virus infection and NSAID-associated splenomegaly because of portal hypertension are significant predictors of mortality in nonalcoholic patients presenting with upper GI bleeding.

### Management of variceal and nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis [^116fMs6f]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage remains the most common medical emergency managed by gastroenterologists. Causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in patients with liver cirrhosis can be grouped into two categories: the first includes lesions that arise by virtue of portal hypertension, namely gastroesophageal varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy; and the second includes lesions seen in the general population (peptic ulcer, erosive gastritis, reflux esophagitis, Mallory-Weiss syndrome, tumors, etc.). Emergency upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is the standard procedure recommended for both diagnosis and treatment of UGIB. The endoscopic treatment of choice for esophageal variceal bleeding is band ligation of varices. Bleeding from gastric varices is treated by injection with cyanoacrylate. Treatment with vasoactive drugs as well as antibiotic treatment is started before or at the same time as endoscopy. Bleeding from portal hypertensive gastropathy is less frequent, usually chronic and treatment options include β-blocker therapy, injection therapy and interventional radiology. The standard of care of UGIB in patients with cirrhosis includes careful resuscitation, preferably in an intensive care setting, medical and endoscopic therapy, early consideration for placement of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt and, sometimes, surgical therapy or hepatic transplant.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® radiologic management of gastric varices [^113mVzyf]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhage, resulting from gastric varies, can be challenging to treat, given the various precipitating etiologies. A wide variety of treatment options exist for managing the diverse range of the underlying disease processes. While cirrhosis is the most common cause for gastric variceal bleeding, occlusion of the portal or splenic vein in noncirrhotic states results in a markedly different treatment paradigm. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Patient evaluation

The majority of patients with a variceal bleed will be sufficiently stable to enable a full history and examination to take place. History of alcohol excess and or intravenous drug use should be sought and may become particularly relevant if the patient has withdrawal symptoms after admission. Comorbidity is important when estimating risk and deciding on use of vasopressors. The following risk factors doubled mortality after an acute variceal bleed in one US study: older age, comorbidities, male gender and not undergoing a gastroscopy within 24 h.

A full examination is helpful for the important negatives as much as the positives. Baseline observations should include the temperature, as infection is a serious complication with significant mortality. Confusion may be present because of encephalopathy, intoxication with alcohol or drugs or withdrawal from alcohol or drugs. The patient should be on continuous BP and pulse monitor and their haemodynamic status recorded. An oxygen saturation monitor is helpful. Stigmata of chronic liver disease and concurrent jaundice provide insight into the current status of a patient's liver, and also give warning of potential further decompensation if significant bleeding persists (see scoring systems above). Pneumonia must be actively excluded. Evidence of ascites requires a diagnostic tap to search for infection.

Investigations including full blood count, coagulation profile, liver and renal function and blood group and save and cross-match. Blood and urine should also be cultured. An ultrasound scan later in the admission is helpful to identify subclinical ascites, flow in portal vein and any obvious emergence of an hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Location of patient

A decision must be made as to where the patient is best managed. Variceal bleeding is unpredictable, generally occurs in patients with significant liver disease and is associated with significant mortality. Hence, a high-dependency unit is usually the most appropriate initial location, although a properly staffed 'gastrointestinal bleeding bed' may be appropriate. If a patient is vomiting blood, or there is a perceived risk of a haemodynamically unstable patient having blood in the stomach, then the patient must be intubated before endoscopy, and return to an intensive care or high-dependency unit will be necessary until extubation.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^113tS8WP]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for gastroesophageal varices, more specifically with respect to primary prevention of variceal hemorrhage, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to offer combination therapy of nonselective β-blockers and endoscopic band ligation since it reduces the risk of rebleeding compared with monotherapy.

Miscellaneous recommendations pertinent to clinical practice — screening and biopsy in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis are specified as follows: Patients with NASH cirrhosis should be screened for gastro-esophageal varices according to the AASLD/ACG practice guidelines (Strength − 1, Quality − B). Patients with NASH cirrhosis should be considered for HCC screening according to the AASLD/ACG practice guidelines (Strength − 1, Quality − B). Current evidence does not support routinely repeating a liver biopsy in patients with NAFL or NASH (Strength − 2, Quality − C).

### Fatal upper gastrointestinal bleed arising from duodenal varices secondary to undiagnosed portal hypertension [^113BDcTf]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Duodenal varices are an unexpected source of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage associated with high mortality. The prevalence of ectopic variceal bleeding accounts for 2–5% of all variceal bleeding; of this, only 17% occurs in the duodenum. Diagnosis is difficult, and insufficient evidence exists to demonstrate the best treatment option when haemorrhage occurs. We report the case of a 69-year-old man with a history of chronic alcoholism who presented to the emergency department (ED) with nausea, vomiting and several episodes of haematochezia. Diagnostic workup in the ED included CT with multiplanar reconstruction, which revealed a network of large tortuous blood vessels running near the second portion of the duodenum between the inferior vena cava and portal vein. The patient was emergently treated with endoscopic therapy and clipping of the vessel. This failed, and he was subsequently taken to the operating room for suture ligation of the bleeding duodenal varices.

### The role of medical therapy for variceal bleeding [^115PGWfV]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Acute variceal hemorrhage (AVH) is a lethal complication of portal hypertension and should be suspected in every patient with liver cirrhosis who presents with upper gastrointestinal bleed. AVH-related mortality has decreased in the last few decades from 40% to 15%-20% due to advances in the general and specific management of variceal hemorrhage. This review summarizes current management of AVH and prevention of recurrent hemorrhage with a focus on pharmacologic therapy.
