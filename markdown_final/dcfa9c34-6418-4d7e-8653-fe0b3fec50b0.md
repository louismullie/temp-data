## Question

Dronedarone for Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether dronedarone is appropriate in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, especially for pre-excited atrial fibrillation, and what the rationale is for avoiding or using it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of pre-excited AF and why AV nodal blockade can be dangerous. Then, I should verify contemporary guideline recommendations for acute and chronic management in WPW, including which drugs are contraindicated. Next, I will examine dronedarone's pharmacology and FDA labeling to see if WPW is addressed. After that, I need to check whether there is any evidentiary signal for dronedarone in WPW populations. Finally, I will synthesize a clinical recommendation and safer alternatives, ensuring consistency with guidelines and mechanistic reasoning [^114BTHDs] [^115YjCUR] [^112yziTy].

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology. In pre-excited AF, the accessory pathway often conducts more rapidly than the AV node, driving very fast, irregular, and wide QRS ventricular responses; the therapeutic goal is to limit or block accessory pathway conduction, not slow the AV node alone. Wait, let me verify the risk signal with AV nodal–blocking agents; yes, labels for digoxin and verapamil warn that preferential AV nodal slowing can paradoxically accelerate ventricular rates via the accessory pathway, increasing risk of ventricular fibrillation. This mechanistic hazard explains why AV nodal blockers are avoided in pre-excited AF and frames the drug-safety discussion here [^111qxFCc] [^1131mJeV] [^115CZpzF].

> Next, I should review guideline-directed acute management. For hemodynamically stable pre-excited AF, agents that act on the accessory pathway such as ibutilide, procainamide, flecainide, or propafenone are recommended; for hemodynamically unstable cases, synchronized direct-current cardioversion is indicated. Hmm, wait a minute — I initially thought synchronized cardioversion might be first line even in all stable patients, but I need to check the text; the ESC guidance supports pharmacologic therapy in stable cases and cardioversion when unstable or when drug therapy fails, and it specifically advises against intravenous amiodarone in pre-excited AF. The Canadian guidance similarly cautions to avoid AV nodal blockers and amiodarone when ventricular pre-excitation is present, reinforcing the mechanistic concern noted above [^114BTHDs] [^112xTZF5] [^112rmMsH] [^115YjCUR].

> I will now examine dronedarone's pharmacology and labeling. Dronedarone is a multichannel Class III antiarrhythmic with antiadrenergic properties that slows AV nodal conduction and is structurally related to amiodarone; however, its FDA labeling addresses use for atrial fibrillation rhythm maintenance and does not provide an indication or specific safety guidance for WPW or pre-excited AF. Hold on, I should verify whether dronedarone has any accessory pathway–modifying effects described in the label or primary pharmacology summaries; I do not see evidence that it prolongs antegrade accessory pathway refractoriness or that it has been evaluated in pre-excitation, which is clinically important here [^111hTztG] [^112yziTy].

> But wait, what if one argued by analogy to amiodarone's broad-spectrum effects. I need to ensure we do not conflate properties; amiodarone is explicitly discouraged intravenously in pre-excited AF because it preferentially slows the AV node and has been associated with dangerous acceleration of ventricular response via the accessory pathway, with case reports of degeneration to ventricular fibrillation. Given dronedarone's AV nodal–slowing and beta-blocking effects and the absence of evidence that it beneficially alters accessory pathway conduction, the same pathophysiologic caution applies. I should double-check whether any major guideline lists dronedarone for pre-excited AF; it is not recommended, and the general directive remains to avoid AV nodal–blocking strategies in the presence of manifest pre-excitation during AF [^112rmMsH] [^111qxFCc] [^114BTHDs] [^115YjCUR].

> Next, I should review the evidence base for dronedarone in WPW. Let me consider whether any trials or EP studies specifically enrolled WPW patients or reported accessory pathway metrics; I do not find studies of dronedarone in WPW populations, and comparative AF literature for dronedarone versus other AADs evaluates general AF cohorts without pre-excitation. Hold on, I should verify across systematic reviews and NMAs to ensure I am not missing subgroup data; the network meta-analyses compare dronedarone mainly to sotalol, amiodarone, and others in nonpermanent AF, with no WPW-specific data identified, which leaves a critical evidence gap for safety or efficacy in pre-excited AF [^115VXAJG] [^1151aHDw].

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm the clinical recommendation. Dronedarone should not be used in patients with WPW who present with pre-excited AF because it slows AV nodal conduction without proven accessory pathway benefit, is not guideline-recommended in this setting, and could theoretically worsen ventricular rates with risk of degeneration, analogous to the concerns established for intravenous amiodarone and other AV nodal–blocking drugs. Safer, guideline-concordant options for stable pre-excited AF include ibutilide, procainamide, flecainide, or propafenone, with immediate synchronized cardioversion if unstable or if pharmacotherapy fails; definitive prevention is by catheter ablation of the accessory pathway when appropriate. Let me verify alignment one more time; this approach is consistent with ESC and CCS/CHRS guidance and with the amiodarone warning specific to pre-excited AF, while dronedarone's label and literature do not support its use in WPW [^114BTHDs] [^112xTZF5] [^112rmMsH] [^115YjCUR] [^113Wdapq] [^112yziTy].

---

Dronedarone is **not recommended for Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome** because it does not reliably slow conduction over accessory pathways and may increase the risk of rapid ventricular rates or ventricular fibrillation in pre-excited atrial fibrillation. Current guidelines do not support its use in WPW, and **catheter ablation remains the preferred definitive therapy** [^114BTHDs] [^113Wdapq] [^115YjCUR].

---

## Pharmacological properties of dronedarone

Dronedarone is a **multichannel blocker** (Na+, K+, Ca2+) with antiadrenergic effects, structurally related to amiodarone but lacking iodine, reducing thyroid and pulmonary toxicity [^111hTztG]. It is approved to maintain sinus rhythm in paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation/flutter, but **not for WPW or pre-excited AF** [^112yziTy].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines regarding dronedarone in WPW

There is **no clinical evidence supporting dronedarone for WPW**, and major guidelines do not recommend it for WPW or pre-excited AF. The ESC 2020 guidelines explicitly recommend against intravenous amiodarone in pre-excited AF due to the risk of accelerating ventricular response or VF; thus, dronedarone is also avoided [^112rmMsH]. Additionally, the CCS/CHRS 2020 guidelines **advise against AV nodal blockers**, digitalis, and amiodarone in ventricular pre-excitation; dronedarone is not mentioned, underscoring its lack of a role in WPW [^115YjCUR].

---

## Risks and adverse effects of dronedarone in WPW

Dronedarone **does not reliably slow accessory pathway conduction** and may increase ventricular rates or precipitate VF in pre-excited AF. It can cause bradycardia, QT prolongation, and proarrhythmia, including torsades de pointes, and is **contraindicated in severe heart failure or permanent AF**.

---

## Comparison with other antiarrhythmic medications

Dronedarone is **less effective than amiodarone** for maintaining sinus rhythm [^116qU7nN] and is inferior to class IC (flecainide, propafenone) and class IA (procainamide) agents for acute management of pre-excited AF. These agents are recommended for acute pharmacologic management of stable pre-excited AF; dronedarone is not [^114BTHDs].

---

## Alternative treatments for WPW syndrome

Catheter ablation is the **definitive therapy** for WPW, with high success and low complication rates [^113Wdapq]. For acute management of stable pre-excited AF, procainamide, flecainide, propafenone, or ibutilide are recommended [^114BTHDs]; synchronized cardioversion is indicated [^113M1e1e] for instability or when drugs fail [^112xTZF5].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus **do not recommend dronedarone for WPW**. The ESC 2020 and CCS/CHRS 2020 guidelines emphasize avoiding AV nodal blockers and amiodarone in pre-excited AF, and do not include dronedarone in WPW management recommendations [^115YjCUR].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Dronedarone is **not recommended for WPW** because of the lack of evidence and the potential to accelerate ventricular response or precipitate VF in pre-excited AF. **Catheter ablation is the preferred definitive therapy** [^113Wdapq]; procainamide, flecainide, propafenone, or ibutilide are recommended for acute pharmacologic management of stable pre-excited AF [^114BTHDs].

### Dronedarone versus sotalol in patients with atrial fibrillation: A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^115VXAJG]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

There are limited comparative data on safety and efficacy within commonly used Vaughan-Williams (VW) class III antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) for maintenance of sinus rhythm in adults with atrial fibrillation (AF).

- **Hypothesis**: We hypothesized that dronedarone and sotalol, two commonly prescribed VW class III AADs with class II properties, have different safety and efficacy effects in patients with nonpermanent AF.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature review was conducted searching MEDLINE®, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to June 15, 2021 (NCT05279833). Clinical trials and observational studies that evaluated safety and efficacy of dronedarone or sotalol in adults with AF were included. Bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis (NMA) was used to quantify comparative safety and efficacy. Where feasible, sensitivity analyses were performed by including only randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

- **Results**: Of 3581 records identified through database searches, 37 unique studies (23 RCTs, 13 observational studies, and 1 nonrandomized trial) were included in the NMA. Dronedarone was associated with a statistically significantly lower risk of all-cause death versus sotalol (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.38 [95% credible interval, CrI: 0.19, 0.74]). The association was numerically similar in the sensitivity analysis (HR = 0.46 [95% CrI: 0.21, 1.02]). AF recurrence and cardiovascular death results were not significantly different between dronedarone and sotalol in all-studies and sensitivity analyses.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: electrophysiological and clinical findings [^111qxFCc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with Wolff‐Parkinson‐White syndrome and atrial fibrillation (AF), also known as preexcited AF, typically present with a rapid ventricular response rate and wide QRS complexes. The fast conduction of atrial high‐frequency impulses occurs preferentially via the accessory pathway (AP), which has a shorter refractory period than the atrioventricular node (AVN). Consequently, patients are at a higher risk of hemodynamic instability, spontaneous ventricular fibrillation (VF), and cardiac arrest.

- **Hemodynamic instability**: Patients with preexcited AF who present with hemodynamic instability typically undergo prompt electrical cardioversion. Those with stable hemodynamics are commonly treated with the infusion of an antiarrhythmic drug to decrease the preexcited ventricular rate and prevent hemodynamic instability.

- **Treatment recommendations**: The 2017 European Heart Rhythm Association Consensus recommends procainamide, propafenone, flecainide, or ibutilide, whereas the 2014 American Heart Association Guidelines recommend procainamide or ibutilide for intravenous use to acutely slow the ventricular rate of preexcited AF. However, the above four agents are not recommended for the treatment of patients with preexcited AF and impaired left ventricular function (ILVF).

- **Concerns with amiodarone**: Intravenous amiodarone, a multichannel blocker, was widely used in the treatment of patients with preexcited AF and ILVF. However, recent reports of accelerated preexcited ventricular responses and VF during amiodarone infusion have raised concerns about its utility. Therefore, intravenous amiodarone is no longer considered a safe option in these cases.

### Risk stratification in pediatric Wolff-Parkinson-White: Practice variation among pediatric cardiologists and electrophysiologists [^117Cpj9F]. Pediatric Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

Published guidelines provide recommendations for risk stratification in pediatric Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW). There are no data on provider concordance with these guidelines. We hypothesized that significant practice variation exists between pediatric cardiologists (PC) and electrophysiologists (EP).

The records of all patients, age 8 to 21 years, with a new ECG diagnosis of WPW between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2018, from a single center, were retrospectively reviewed. Subjects were categorized on the basis of symptoms and resting ECG findings as one of the following: asymptomatic intermittent WPW, asymptomatic persistent WPW, or symptomatic WPW. The performance and results of diagnostic testing, including Holter monitor, event monitor, exercise stress test (EST), and electrophysiology study (EPS), were recorded. The primary outcome was concordance with published guidelines. A secondary outcome was documentation of a discussion of sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk.

A total of 615 patient encounters were analyzed in 231 patients with newly diagnosed WPW pattern on ECG (56% male; mean age at diagnosis 13.9 ± 2.5 years). EP were observed to have a significantly higher rate of guideline concordance than PC (95% vs. 71%, p < 0.001). There was significant practice variation between PC and EP in the documentation of a discussion of SCD risk: 96% in EP vs. 39% in PC (p < 0.001).

Significant practice variation exists in the non-invasive and invasive risk stratification of pediatric WPW, with lower concordance to published guidelines amongst PC when compared to EP.

### Efficacy and safety of dronedarone in patients previously treated with other antiarrhythmic agents [^117XL4JD]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Currently, available antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) for the prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) suffer from incomplete efficacy and poor tolerability.

The hypothesis was that dronedarone could represent an effective and safe option in patients previously treated with AADs, especially class Ic AADs and sotalol.

- **Methods**: Retrospective analysis of two double-blind, parallel-group trials (EURIDIS [European Trial in Atrial Fibrillation or Flutter Patients Receiving Dronedarone for the Maintenance of Sinus Rhythm] and ADONIS [American-Australian-African Trial With Dronedarone in Atrial Fibrillation or Flutter Patients for the Maintenance of Sinus Rhythm]) comparing the efficacy and safety of dronedarone with a placebo over 12 months. The primary endpoint was AF/AFL recurrence in patients previously treated with another AAD that was discontinued for any reason prior to randomization.

- **Results**: In patients previously treated with any AADs, dronedarone decreased the risk of AF recurrence by 30.4% compared to placebo (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.59–0.82; P < 0.001). In patients previously treated with a class Ic agent, dronedarone decreased the risk of recurrence by 31.4% (HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.53–0.89; P = 0.004). Conversely, in patients previously treated with sotalol, dronedarone showed a trend toward a decrease in the risk of recurrence (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.67–1.11; P = 0.244). Dronedarone was equally effective regardless of whether class Ic or sotalol were stopped due to lack of efficacy or adverse events (AEs). Discontinuation rates were similar.

### Long term risk of Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern and syndrome [^112Tj9wj]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

For years, conventional wisdom has held that patients with asymptomatic ventricular pre-excitation (asymptomatic WPW or WPW pattern) were at low risk for adverse outcomes. This assumption has been challenged more recently in a number of observational/natural history studies as well as in prospective trials in which patients were more aggressively studied via invasive electrophysiology study (EPS) and, in some cases, more aggressively treated with pre-emptive catheter ablation despite the lack of symptoms. In sum, the data do not definitively support one approach (early, upstream EPS and/or ablation) vs. the other (watchful waiting with close monitoring). The most recent pediatric and adult guidelines reflect this ambiguity with a broad spectrum of approaches endorsed.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^115CJKrx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Electrophysiological evaluation of nifekalant in patients with PSVT: A total of 201 patients with PSVT (mean age 38 ± 13 years, 128 males) underwent EP studies. All presented with sinus rhythm; 87 of 201 patients (43%) had preexcitation on ECG, and 114 (57%) had no evidence of preexcitation on ECG (concealed AP or dual AVN pathways). One patient had Ebstein anomaly, but the remainder had no structural heart disease. No patients had electrolyte abnormalities or a long QT interval (corrected QT interval [QTc] ≥ 470 ms).

Nifekalant was infused as described above. EP studies were performed at the baseline before the drug infusion (baseline state) and periodically during the infusion time (7‐30 minutes) as described above. Seven-beat stimuli at a basic drive cycle length (S1) of 450 or 600 ms, delivered at −10-ms decrements, were applied.

- **Measured indices**: Antegrade AP ERP and block cycle length (BCL), antegrade AVN ERP, ERP of right atrium, ERP of right ventricle (RV); AH, HV, PR, QRS, and QT interval, as well as HR and blood pressure.

Antegrade AP and AVN ERP were defined as the longest A1‐A2 interval that failed to conduct over the AP or AVN. The antegrade BCL over the AP was defined as the shortest S1 cycle length that maintained 1:1 conduction at a decremental paced interval of 10 ms. The right atrium and RV ERPs were defined as the longest S1‐S2 interval at which A2 (or V2) failed to produce a response. The antegrade AP ERP and BCL were measured in patients with preexcitation. The antegrade AVN ERP was recorded mainly in patients with no antegrade conduction.

### Thyroid storm in a patient with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^115AateQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

A 44-year-old woman with no medical history presented to the emergency department with a 2-hour history of sudden onset chest pressure, palpitations, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath. She reported a 90-pound unintentional weight loss, increased appetite, irritability, night sweats, and palpitations for 2 months. Physical examination revealed a heart rate (HR) of 269 bpm and a blood pressure of 116/94 mm Hg. Her ECG revealed a wide-complex tachycardia with right bundle branch morphology and an HR of 265 bpm. Intravenous adenosine was administered, resulting in the resolution of the arrhythmia and symptoms. Her subsequent ECG revealed sinus tachycardia with δ waves, which was consistent with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Laboratory findings confirmed thyroid storm, and treatment began with intravenous hydrocortisone, methimazole, metoprolol, amiodarone, and iodine drops. Graves' disease was confirmed based on the presence of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody. The patient underwent successful WPW accessory tract ablation 6 weeks after the initial presentation.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^116ii4TK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Eighty-seven patients (mean age 53 ± 11 years, 52 males) with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) and no accessory pathway (AP) were studied. The participants did not have abnormal electrolytes, a prolonged QT interval (QTc ≥ 470 ms), atrioventricular (AV) conduction disorders, or left atrial thrombus. Twenty-three of the 87 patients (26%) had structural heart disease and a low left ventricular ejection fraction (39 ± 5%).

Nifekalant was infused, and the following parameters were assessed: ventricular rate of AF before, and at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes from onset of infusion; AF cardioversion; blood pressure (BP); Torsades de Pointes (TdP); and other arrhythmias.

- **Statistical analysis**: Continuous variables with normal distribution were presented as mean values ± SD. The Student paired t-test was used to determine the significance between baseline and drug infusion. The variable PP with skew distribution was presented as median (percentiles 25‐75), and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used. A two-sided P value of < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^115wfJJ7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

The entire process of electrophysiological (EP) studies in preexcited atrial fibrillation (AF) was recorded and analyzed. Consecutive R-R intervals for 1 minute were measured before and 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes from the onset of infusion. In addition, the R-R interval was recorded and analyzed 1 minute before the termination of AF.

- **EP parameters**: Included the shortest preexcited R-R interval (SPRR), average preexcited R-R interval (APRR), average R-R interval (ARR), and the ratio of preexcited QRS complexes to total ventricular complexes (percentage preexcitation, PP).
- **Clinical outcomes**: Included heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP).

The EP parameters and clinical outcomes were compared during AF at the baseline before the drug infusion (baseline state) and after nifekalant infusion (at infusion time of 7–10 minutes, or 1 minute before termination of AF whenever cardioversion occurred before 7 minutes). AF cardioversion, acceleration of preexcited ventricular responses, deterioration to syncope/cardiac arrest, and Torsades de Pointes (TdP) were also investigated.

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^114tFe24]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Several limitations of our study should be considered:

- **Sample size**: The small sample size may have introduced statistical bias. Further studies with larger numbers of patients are needed to evaluate the effects of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

- **Advanced interatrial block (IAB)**: It is not possible to identify advanced IAB before accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, as the delta wave overshadows the point at which the P-wave ends.

- **P-wave duration measurement**: P-wave duration was measured based on the ECG obtained immediately after the ablation procedure. Residual atrial injury from the ablation procedure may have affected the P-wave duration.

- **Generalizability**: The generalizability of our findings may be limited by the single-center, retrospective, observational approach.

### Natural history of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome diagnosed in childhood [^113LPCkd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome carries a risk for symptomatic arrhythmias and sudden death. The aim of this study was to examine the natural history of patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome diagnosed in childhood, followed longitudinally at a single institution. The study population consisted of 446 patients. The median age of diagnosis was 7 years, and 61% were male. Associated heart disease was present in 40 patients (9%).

- **Modes of presentation**: Included supraventricular tachycardia (38%), palpitations (22%), chest pain (5%), syncope (4%), atrial fibrillation (0.4%), sudden death (0.2%), and incidental findings (26%); data were unavailable in 4%.

- **Study outcomes**: During the study period, a total of 243 patients (54%) had supraventricular tachycardia, and 7 patients (1.6%) had atrial fibrillation. Of patients who presented at ≤ 3 months of age, 35% had resolution of manifest preexcitation compared with 5.8% who presented at > 3 months of age (p < 0.0001).

- **Sudden deaths**: There were 6 sudden deaths (1.3%), with an incidence of 2.8 per 1,000 patient-years. Two of these patients had structurally normal hearts (incidence 1.1 per 1,000 patient-years). Four of these patients had associated heart disease (incidence 27 per 1,000 patient-years) (p < 0.01).

In conclusion, in a large population of patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome diagnosed in childhood, 64% had symptoms at presentation, and an additional 20% developed symptoms during follow-up. There were 6 sudden deaths (1.3%), with an overall incidence of 1.1 per 1,000 patient-years in patients with structurally normal hearts and 27 per 1,000 patient-years in those with associated heart disease.

### Catheter ablation therapy for supraventricular arrhythmias [^117Tgkqk]. JAMA (2007). Low credibility.

The supraventricular arrhythmias include a wide spectrum of disorders including, in descending order of frequency, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrioventricular nodal reentry, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and atrial tachycardia. While not life-threatening in most cases, they may cause important symptoms, such as palpitations, chest discomfort, breathlessness, anxiety, and syncope, which significantly impair quality of life. Medical therapy has variable efficacy, and most patients are not rendered free of symptoms.

Research over the past several decades has revealed fundamental mechanisms involved in the initiation and maintenance of all of these arrhythmias. Knowledge of mechanisms has, in turn, led to highly effective surgical and catheter-based treatments. Atrial fibrillation remains a therapeutic challenge but is also yielding to investigation and therapeutic efforts. The supraventricular arrhythmias and their treatment are described in this report.

### A randomized study of prophylactic catheter ablation in asymptomatic patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^113Wdapq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). High credibility.

Young age and inducibility of atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia or atrial fibrillation during invasive electrophysiological testing identify asymptomatic patients with a Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern on the electrocardiogram as being at high risk for arrhythmic events. We tested the hypothesis that prophylactic catheter ablation of accessory pathways would provide meaningful and durable benefits compared to no treatment in such patients.

- **Methods**: From 1997 to 2002, among 224 eligible asymptomatic patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, patients at high risk for arrhythmias were randomly assigned to either radio-frequency catheter ablation of accessory pathways (37 patients) or no treatment (35 patients). The end point was the occurrence of arrhythmic events over a five-year follow-up period.

- **Results**: Patients assigned to ablation had baseline characteristics similar to those of the controls. Two patients in the ablation group (5 percent) and 21 in the control group (60 percent) had arrhythmic events. One control patient had ventricular fibrillation as the presenting arrhythmia. The five-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of the incidence of arrhythmic events were 7 percent among patients who underwent ablation and 77 percent among the controls. The risk reduction with ablation was 92 percent (relative risk, 0.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.33; P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Prophylactic accessory-pathway ablation markedly reduces the frequency of arrhythmic events in asymptomatic patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

### Dronedarone versus sotalol in patients with atrial fibrillation: A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^113Fx5xR]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

Recent AF guideline updates have led to clear differences in first-line treatment recommendations for these two medications in clinical guidelines for AF patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). ESC guidelines recommend that sotalol should not be used, and AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines recommend excluding or using it with caution in heart failure (except with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator). The recently published Antiarrhythmic Medication for Atrial Fibrillation (AIM-AF; 2022) survey highlighted that 12% of responding EU physicians and 25% of US physicians still selected sotalol as a first-line treatment in patients with HFrEF. ESC guidelines advise dronedarone to be used only in AF patients with mildly impaired but stable LVEF, including heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines advise excluding or using with caution in AF patients with heart failure. However, the AIM-AF survey found that 8% of EU and US physicians selected dronedarone as a first-line treatment in patients with AF and HFrEF. The AIM-AF physician survey highlighted quantifiable deviations between guideline recommendations and real-world practice in AF patients, and it is very likely that similar suboptimal adherence to guideline recommendations is reflected in the data set from observational studies included in this NMA.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: electrophysiological and clinical findings [^111uBaxx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

The authors declare that all supporting data are available within the article. We conducted 3‐part prospective noninvasive and invasive electrophysiology (EP) studies to determine the efficacy of nifekalant in preexcited atrial fibrillation (AF) and to assess its mechanisms of action [Figure 1]. All patients provided written informed consent, and the study protocol was approved by the Committee on Human Research at the Second Affiliated Hospital of NanChang University, NanChang of JiangXi Province. All antiarrhythmic medications were discontinued for at least 5 drug half‐lives before the study.

Figure 1 describes the protocol design, which includes atrial fibrillation, accessory pathway, blood pressure, electrophysiological evaluations, paroxysmal events, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.

Electrophysiological and clinical evaluation of nifekalant in patients with preexcited AF involved treating fifty‐one patients (mean age 53 ± 12 years, 33 males) with sustained preexcited AF and stable hemodynamics using nifekalant. Twenty patients (39%) had spontaneous sustained preexcited AF for at least 1 hour before admission. Twelve patients (24%) exhibited preexcitation and paroxysmal AF, displaying sinus rhythm and preexcitation on ECG upon admission. Nineteen patients (37%) presented with preexcitation and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) but without documented AF, also showing sinus rhythm and preexcitation on ECG upon admission. The latter two groups, comprising 31 patients, were induced to generate sustained AF during EP studies. Nifekalant was administered if induced AF was sustained for 10 minutes.

### Dronedarone versus sotalol in patients with atrial fibrillation: A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^1151aHDw]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice and remains one of the major causes of stroke, transient ischemic attack, and heart failure. Despite improvements in rhythm control interventions, there is still a considerable risk of mortality, AF-related stroke, frequent hospitalization, and complications due to hemodynamic abnormalities and thromboembolic events in patients with AF.

The main antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) for rhythm control and prevention of AF recurrence include Vaughan-Williams class III drugs: amiodarone, dofetilide, dronedarone, sotalol, and class Ic drugs: flecainide and propafenone. Reservations exist about the use of amiodarone as a long-term therapy option due to well-recognized extracardiac side effects. Similarly, dofetilide has extensive contraindications due to a relatively high risk of torsades de pointes. Dronedarone and sotalol are both class III agents (with antiadrenergic effects), which have demonstrated similar efficacy. Although guideline and label recommendations emphasizing safety considerations vary for the two agents according to clinical circumstances of recurrent AF (reAF) patient populations, United States (US) and European Union (EU) physician adherence to guideline recommendations for these and other AADs was shown in a recent study to be suboptimal. Direct comparisons between dronedarone and sotalol are limited; however, some evidence has shown that sotalol use is associated with a higher risk of ventricular proarrhythmia and increased overall mortality.

### Advanced interatrial block predicts recurrence of atrial fibrillation after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^1167RxQw]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients with overt or intermittent Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome who were hospitalized at Henan Provincial People's Hospital and Fuwai Central China Cardiovascular Hospital for radiofrequency ablation between January 2013 and September 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The inclusion criteria were: (a) at least one documented episode of atrial fibrillation (AF) before ablation; (b) performance of accessory pathway (AP) ablation alone, with no catheter ablation for AF; (c) successful catheter ablation, defined as the elimination of Kent bundle conduction by demonstration of atrial and ventricular pacing even after isoproterenol infusion; and (d) available records of a post-ablation, 12-lead ECG.

The exclusion criteria were: (a) repeated ablations; (b) previous cardiac surgery, congenital heart disease, or serious valvular heart disease; and (c) thyroid dysfunction on admission (abnormal free thyroxine or thyroid-stimulating hormone level). The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients were informed about the investigational nature of the catheter ablation procedure and provided written informed consent to undergo the procedure. The study protocol was approved by the local institutional review board. The requirement for informed consent has been waived because of the retrospective nature of the study.

- **Electrophysiological study and catheter ablation**: The patients underwent an electrophysiological study after all antiarrhythmic drugs had been discontinued for at least five half-lives and before radiofrequency catheter ablation was performed.

### Dronedarone versus sotalol in patients with atrial fibrillation: A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^111eTw8w]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

For all‐cause death, there were seven observational studies contributing to the analysis, published between 2009 and 2020. One study from this set, reporting outcomes from the Duke Databank for Cardiovascular Disease, found that death rates were lower in patients treated with sotalol versus amiodarone or no AAD. Four of these observational studies comprised large national database data sets from Sweden, Denmark, and South Korea. In the Danish study (2009), published at a time when sotalol, flecainide, and propafenone were guideline‐recommended first‐line treatments, no increased death rate was evident in patients treated with these AADs or amiodarone compared with no treatment.

The more recent Swedish study (2018) reported lower all‐cause death with dronedarone or flecainide versus sotalol; however, this study also showed a potential for hidden confounding, whereas the earlier Swedish study (2014) reported that overall death rates with AF patients on dronedarone were lower than the general population. In the Korean study, no difference in the risk of death from any cause was evident between dronedarone and sotalol. In this NMA, the risk of CV death was numerically lower with dronedarone by 75%; however, this result was based on only two studies, and failed to reach statistical significance. It should be noted that the inclusion of RWE in this analysis of dronedarone versus sotalol provides a naturalistic means of comparing perhaps broadly similar AF patient populations, based on the proportions of specific AF patient populations in the US and EU receiving dronedarone or sotalol.

### Dronedarone: An emerging agent with rhythm- and rate-controlling effects [^111hTztG]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2006). Low credibility.

Of antiarrhythmic agents, amiodarone is among the most effective, with the additional advantage of having little proarrhythmic potential. However, it can cause potentially serious extracardiac side effects, stimulating the search for safer derivatives. Dronedarone, a new antiarrhythmic drug that is structurally related to amiodarone, lacks an iodine moiety and, thus, amiodarone's iodine-related organ toxicity, while its methane sulfonyl group decreases lipophilicity, shortening the half-life and decreasing tissue accumulation.

Electrophysiological studies show that dronedarone shares amiodarone's multichannel blocking effects, inhibiting transmembrane Na(+), K(+), Ca(2+), and slow L-type calcium channels, as well as its antiadrenergic effects. Unlike amiodarone, it has little effect on thyroid receptors. Possessing both rate- and rhythm-control properties, dronedarone has proved safe and effective in preventing recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with persistent AF in the Dronedarone Atrial Fibrillation Study After Electrical Cardioversion (DAFNE) trial, the first prospective randomized trial to evaluate its efficacy and safety.

Dronedarone has since undergone further extensive evaluation in three pivotal phase III trials. In two sister studies, the European Trial in Atrial Fibrillation or Flutter Patients Receiving Dronedarone for the Maintenance of Sinus Rhythm (EURIDIS) and the American-Australian-African Trial with Dronedarone in Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Patients for the Maintenance of Sinus Rhythm (ADONIS), dronedarone 400 mg b.i.d. showed significant results.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^115gQTAx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

Nifekalant, initially named MS-551 in Japan, is a pure class III antiarrhythmic drug that is highly selective for blocking the rapid component of the delayed-rectifier potassium currents without affecting the inward sodium and calcium currents or β-adrenergic activity. Nifekalant prolongs the effective refractory period (ERP) of ventricular and atrial myocytes, exerts antiarrhythmic effects, and decreases the defibrillation threshold. Increasing clinical data indicate that nifekalant is an effective and safe drug in the treatment of refractory ventricular arrhythmias, especially in patients with idiopathic left ventricular fibrillation (ILVF). Nifekalant is also recommended by the European Resuscitation Council Guidelines and International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. More recently, nifekalant has been used in the treatment of atrial arrhythmia and cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter. However, the potential utility of nifekalant in the treatment of preexcited AF has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to assess the electrophysiological and clinical effects of nifekalant in patients with preexcited AF.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^115kLETs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

**Effects of nifekalant on antegrade (n = 78)**: The changes of antegrade conduction time in every patient at baseline and during nifekalant infusion were observed. Nifekalant was associated with the prolongation of antegrade conduction from 272 ± 52 to 309 ± 59 ms and the effective refractory period from 323 ± 51 to 381 ± 63 ms, respectively (all P < 0.001). Nifekalant significantly decreased the proportion of patients with conduction times < 260 ms and 260 ≤ x < 300 ms from 40% to 23% and from 32% to 22%, respectively. Conversely, the drug increased the proportion of patients with conduction times 300 ≤ x < 350 ms and ≥ 350 ms from 19% to 28% and 9% to 27%, respectively. The figure denotes conduction time, block cycle length, and effective refractory period.

### Malignant vasovagal syndrome in two patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^117Uv3Wk]. Heart (2004). Low credibility.

The presence of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome in patients presenting with syncope suggests that tachyarrhythmia may be the cause. However, the symptoms require careful evaluation. Two young patients presented with syncope and were found to have WPW syndrome on their ECG. In both patients, the symptoms were suggestive of vasovagal syncope. During tilt testing, both patients developed their typical symptoms, with a fall in blood pressure and heart rate, confirming the diagnosis of malignant vasovagal syndrome.

### Cardiac involvement in mitochondrial DNA disease: Clinical spectrum, diagnosis, and management [^1163S3sn]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

- **Ventricular pre-excitation and tachyarrhythmias**: Ventricular pre-excitation and Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome may be more common in patients with mtDNA disease than in the general population. First observed in association with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, ventricular pre-excitation has been reported in 10% of patients and 8% of maternal relatives compared with 1.6% of paternal relatives. Although supported by several studies, the failure of some groups to replicate this finding has stimulated debate as to whether these results represent chance findings or evidence of a direct aetiological link. Evidence in support of the latter is provided by reports of ventricular pre-excitation occurring in association with the m.8344A > G and m.3243A > G mutations, where manifest pre-excitation was observed in 3–27% of patients. Although ventricular pre-excitation has been reported in association with mtDNA-related cardiomyopathy, this combination does not appear as common as in other forms of inherited disease such as that caused by PRKAG2 gene mutations. Symptomatic patients with mtDNA disease and manifest ventricular pre-excitation have undergone successful radio-frequency ablation (RFA) of accessory pathways, but the natural history remains unclear and the invasive management of asymptomatic patients is controversial.

- **Supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias**: Supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias have both been reported in patients with mtDNA disease, particularly in children and in those with cardiomyopathy. Although prolongation of the QT interval has been identified in some patient groups, determination of the true incidence is challenging due to variability in studies.

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^1142hog1]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Additional pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) after successful accessory pathway (AP) ablation may not reduce atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence in nonselective Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) patients; however, the AF recurrence rate was reduced significantly in the subgroup of WPW patients with advanced interatrial block (IAB). Screening with a resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) immediately after AP ablation helps identify patients in whom additional PVI following AP ablation would be beneficial.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^116CamTC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The trend of ventricular response at different infusion times of nifekalant during preexcitation was examined.

- **Panel A**: The trend of the preexcited ventricular response in 42 patients showed no termination before 7 minutes of infusion.
- **Panel B**: The trend in 18 patients showed no termination before 30 minutes of infusion.

Both panels indicated that there was no acceleration of the ventricular response in patients with preexcitation during nifekalant infusion. The maximal therapeutic effects of nifekalant were observed at 7 to 10 minutes of infusion. The abbreviations are as follows: AF indicates atrial fibrillation; average preexcited R-R interval; average R-R interval; shortest preexcited R-R interval.

One patient developed torsades de pointes (TdP) after nifekalant infusion. This patient was a 58-year-old female who had spontaneous sustained preexcited AF. Twelve minutes after infusion, AF converted to sinus bradycardia (heart rate at 40 beats/min), and then TdP developed, which was immediately terminated by pacing the right ventricle at 90 beats/min and administering a bolus intravenous injection of 2.5 g magnesium sulfate. The patient had a low blood potassium level of 3.0 mmol/L. AF changed to atrial flutter (AFL) in 2 patients. No patients developed ventricular fibrillation (VF), cardiac arrest, or syncope during nifekalant infusion. There was no transient loss of the delta (δ) wave, defined as its complete disappearance on the ECG for at least 1 minute, in any of the patients during the infusion.

### Lanoxin [^1131mJeV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Ventricular fibrillation in patients with accessory AV pathway (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome)**: Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who develop atrial fibrillation are at high risk of ventricular fibrillation. Treatment of these patients with digoxin leads to greater slowing of conduction in the atrioventricular node than in accessory pathways, and the risks of rapid ventricular response leading to ventricular fibrillation are thereby increased.

- **Sinus bradycardia and sino-atrial block**: Lanoxin may cause severe sinus bradycardia or sinoatrial block, particularly in patients with pre-existing sinus node disease, and may cause advanced or complete heart block in patients with pre-existing incomplete AV block. Consider insertion of a pacemaker before treatment with digoxin.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^111m6W3b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The electrophysiological effects of nifekalant on AVN conduction in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but no accessory pathway (AP) were determined. Nifekalant infusion terminated AF in 33 of 87 (38%) patients, while fifty-four of 87 (62%) patients continued to have AF after 30 minutes of nifekalant treatment. The mean age of this group without AF termination was 58 ± 13 years (range 18–74 years), and 32 were male. Twenty of 54 patients (37%) had structural heart diseases and a low left ventricular ejection fraction (37 ± 5%).

- **Ventricular rate (beats/min)**: Nifekalant did not significantly decrease the mean ventricular rate of AF in the absence of an AP (97 ± 17 versus 95 ± 15 beats/min, n = 54, P = 0.22). A trend toward an increased ventricular rate was noted at infusion time 0 to 10 minutes, and a trend toward a decrease at 10 to 30 minutes of the infusion period.

	- **Baseline**: 97 ± 17
	- **After 1 minute**: 97 ± 16
	- **After 3 minutes**: 99 ± 18
	- **After 5 minutes**: 101 ± 20
	- **After 7 minutes**: 103 ± 22
	- **After 10 minutes**: 104 ± 24
	- **After 15 minutes**: 102 ± 21
	- **After 20 minutes**: 96 ± 19
	- **After 30 minutes**: 95 ± 15

- **Mean systolic blood pressure (mm Hg)**: The mean SBP in patients with AF but no AP did not change significantly with nifekalant infusion (106 ± 16 versus 109 ± 17 mm Hg, n = 54, P = 0.30). No torsades de pointes (TdP) occurred in these patients during nifekalant infusion.

	- **Baseline**: 106 ± 16
	- **After nifekalant infusion**: 109 ± 17

### Atrial fibrillation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: ECG recognition and treatment in the ED [^116DiEyD]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Estimated to occur in 0.1% to 0.3% of the population, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) is a condition where atrial impulses bypass the atrioventricular node and activate the ventricular myocardium directly via an accessory pathway. Clinical clues to the diagnosis include a young patient with previous episodes of palpitations, rapid heart rate, or syncope. Although several different rhythm presentations are possible, atrial fibrillation is a not infrequent dysrhythmia seen in the WPW patient.

Electrocardiographic features suggestive of WPW atrial fibrillation include irregularity of the rhythm, a very rapid ventricular response, presence of a delta wave, and a wide, bizarre QRS complex. Stable patients suspected of having this condition should not receive agents that predominantly block atrioventricular conduction, but they may be treated with procainamide or ibutilide. If instability is present, electrical cardioversion is required.

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^115YJHzp]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Although successful ablation of the accessory pathway (AP) eliminates atrial fibrillation (AF) in some patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and paroxysmal AF, it can recur in others. Whether adding pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) after successful AP ablation effectively prevents AF recurrence in patients with WPW syndrome is unknown.

We retrospectively studied 160 patients (102 men, 58 women; mean age, 46 ± 14 years) with WPW syndrome and paroxysmal AF who underwent AP ablation: 103 (64.4%) undergoing only AP ablation (AP group) and 57 (35.6%) undergoing AP ablation plus PVI (AP + PVI group). Advanced interatrial block (IAB) was defined as a P-wave duration of > 120 ms and biphasic (±) morphology in the inferior leads, using 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG).

During the mean follow-up period of 30.9 ± 9.2 months (range, 3–36 months), 22 patients (13.8%) developed AF recurrence. The recurrence rate did not differ between patients in the AP + PVI group and the AP group (15.5% vs. 10.5%, respectively; p = 0.373). Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses showed that PVI was not associated with the risk of AF recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.26–1.68; p = 0.380). In WPW patients with advanced IAB, the recurrence rate was lower in the AP + PVI group compared to the AP group (90% vs. 33.3%, respectively; p = 0.032).

Pulmonary vein isolation after successful AP ablation significantly reduced the AF recurrence rate in WPW patients with advanced IAB. Screening of a resting 12-lead ECG can provide valuable insights.

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^113upGPf]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Electrophysiological study and catheter ablation**: All patients in both the AP group and the AP + PVI group underwent successful AP ablation. A two-dimensional mapping system or the CARTO three-dimensional electroanatomical mapping system (Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, California) was used in the ablation procedures. Patients underwent an electrophysiological study after all antiarrhythmic drugs had been discontinued for at least five half-lives and before AP ablation was performed.

	- Three 6-French multipolar electrode catheters (Biosense Webster) were introduced percutaneously into the bilateral femoral veins for electrophysiological studies. The catheters were positioned in the high right atrium, across the tricuspid valve, to record the His-bundle ECG, and in the right ventricular apex. Another 6-French multipolar electrode catheter (Biosense Webster) was advanced from the right internal jugular vein and positioned in the coronary sinus. A retrograde aortic approach or the trans-septal approach was used for left-sided pathways. Right-sided pathways were approached via the femoral veins. The locations of the APs were determined from the position of the catheter at a successfully ablated site in the left oblique fluoroscopic view.

- **AF ablation**: Patients in the AP + PVI group underwent additional PVI immediately after AP ablation. Additional PVI was offered to patients with their consent and at the operator's discretion. The PVI procedure was performed in the post-absorptive state under conscious sedation.

### Surgical treatment of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: Resuscitation of a forgotten technique [^112x7AwZ]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Low credibility.

The patient is a 27-year-old man with a history of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and two prior unsuccessful catheter ablation attempts. He presented with cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation and was successfully resuscitated. After recovery, he was noted to have an ejection fraction of 20%, with an electrocardiogram showing a short PR interval and a delta wave (Figure 1A). Electrophysiology mapping indicated a posterior-septal accessory pathway. Multiple attempts to ablate the accessory pathway endocardially and via the middle cardiac vein were unsuccessful. One additional attempt at catheter ablation using both endocardial and epicardial mapping and ablation also failed. In view of his resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation due to rapid atrial fibrillation conducting rapidly over the accessory pathway, the patient was referred for surgical ablation.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^114YrSMx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The effects of procainamide, propafenone, flecainide, and ibutilide, recommended by the guideline or consensus, on preexcited atrial fibrillation (AF) have been reported by several investigators. Sellers et al. evaluated procainamide in 21 patients with preexcited AF. Boahene et al. evaluated procainamide in 30 patients and propafenone in 25 patients. Ludmer et al. evaluated propafenone in 10 patients. O'Nunain et al. evaluated propafenone and flecainide in 16 patients, and Glatter et al. evaluated ibutilide in 14 patients. All studies showed the effectiveness of the four agents in preexcited AF, although with varying magnitudes of efficacy. For example, Boahene et al. demonstrated that propafenone prolonged SPRR from 215 ± 40 to 415 ± 198 ms (ΔSPRR 200 ms), while Ludmer et al. showed a propafenone ΔSPRR of 75 ms, and O'Nunain et al. demonstrated a propafenone ΔSPRR of 37 ms. This indicates considerable heterogeneity among the studies. Factors contributing to this heterogeneity might include drug dose, infusion speed and time, intrinsic ERP of antegrade AP, hemodynamic status, and sympathetic and parasympathetic tone. The heterogeneity was more evident in the small-sample-size studies.

Therefore, it is difficult to directly compare the effectiveness of nifekalant with these agents in the treatment of preexcited AF. Randomized controlled studies with larger samples would be valuable to determine the comparative effectiveness of these agents. One notable difference is that propafenone, flecainide, and ibutilide could completely block the AP, whereas nifekalant did not completely block AP in the present study.

### Dronedarone versus sotalol in patients with atrial fibrillation: A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^113WGoZZ]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

This review highlights several strengths. Notably, this is the first systematic literature review to combine published randomized clinical trial (RCT) and non-randomized clinical trial data, along with real-world evidence from observational studies, to summarize the comparative safety and efficacy of dronedarone versus sotalol in atrial fibrillation (AF). The literature search was comprehensive, including three major electronic databases and several gray literature sources, ensuring a representative evidence base of published quantitative analyses on this topic.

Potential limitations of this review include the restriction of the inclusion criteria to articles published only in the English language. This, in addition to language bias, may introduce the risk of ignoring key data and missing cultural contexts. However, we consider this bias minimal since many studies in this review included patients from jurisdictions outside the US and EU. Other limitations related to the included studies are the varying methods of ascertainment of AF recurrence and heterogeneity in the length of follow-up. Additionally, most studies reported a treatment duration of only several months or did not report treatment duration at all. Further prospective multicenter RCTs with sufficient follow-up are needed to confirm these findings.

### Risk of sudden death after successful accessory atrioventricular pathway ablation in resuscitated patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^113gtiyZ]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2002). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome can be due to ventricular fibrillation mediated by fast conduction over the accessory pathway during atrial fibrillation. However, if primary ventricular fibrillation is the reason for resuscitation, placement of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) would be indicated. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that in resuscitated patients with WPW syndrome, recurrences can be prevented by sole ablation of their accessory pathways.

- **Methods and results**: We performed a long-term follow-up study of 48 resuscitated patients with WPW syndrome who underwent successful accessory pathway ablation as their sole primary treatment. Cardiac arrest had occurred either spontaneously in 32 patients (group A) or after intravenous administration of antiarrhythmic drugs in 16 patients (group B) and was never associated with an acute myocardial infarction or other concomitant factors. All patients had normal left ventricular function at echocardiography. A total of 56 accessory AV pathways were ablated successfully with radiofrequency current (n = 55) or during surgery (n = 1). These pathways were located at the left free wall (n = 35), right free wall (n = 8), or septal-paraseptal region (n = 13). Follow-up 5.0 ± 1.9 years after ablation (range 0.2 to 7.9) was obtained in all 48 patients. All of the patients were alive, and none had a life-threatening arrhythmia or syncope after successful ablation of their accessory pathways.

### Treatment of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with a thoracoscopic surgical procedure [^114pYg1F]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Thoracoscopic surgery for the treatment of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is rare. We report a case of thoracoscopic surgical ablation of the epicardial pathway in a 13-year-old female patient. Intraoperative electroanatomic mapping was performed to identify the exact location of accessory electrical conduction in the right atrioventricular groove. Stamping ablation using a bipolar radiofrequency pen device achieved irreversible disappearance of the delta wave. Eight months after the surgical procedure, there has been no recurrence of arrhythmia in this patient.

### Dronedarone versus sotalol in patients with atrial fibrillation: A systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^111NsYrc]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: This systematic literature review (SLR) was carried out according to standard methods as per the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. This review was registered with (NCT05279833).

- **Data sources and search strategies**: Searches were conducted in MEDLINE®, Embase, and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) via OvidSP to capture records published up to June 15, 2021 [supporting information: Tables A.1–A.3]. Additionally, conference abstracts published between 2019 and 2021 from the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), Heart Rhythm Society (HRS), and ESC congresses were searched, among others. Searches of US and EU clinical trial registry databases were also conducted to find articles that had reported results. Finally, "hand searches" of the reference lists of previously published literature reviews on the same topic were also conducted to capture additional eligible studies that were missed during the main database search.

- **Study selection**: Study eligibility criteria for the SLR were defined using the PICO framework (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome). Clinical trials and comparative observational studies that evaluated dronedarone and/or sotalol in adults with atrial fibrillation (AF) were included. Excluded were studies of patients with permanent AF. Two independent senior reviewers were responsible for reviewing all abstracts according to the PICO criteria. Abstracts considered eligible for inclusion proceeded to a full‐text screen.

There is a paucity of data about the long-term natural history of adult Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) patients regarding the risk of mortality and atrial fibrillation. We sought to describe the long-term outcomes of WPW patients and ascertain the impact of ablation on their natural history.

- **Methods and results**: Three groups of patients were studied: two WPW populations (ablation: 872, no ablation: 1461) and a 1:5 control population (n = 11,175). Long-term mortality and atrial fibrillation rates were determined. The average follow-up for the WPW group was 7.9 ± 5.9 years (median: 6.9) and was similar between the ablation and non-ablation groups. Death rates were similar between the WPW group and the control group (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.83–1.11; P = 0.56). Non-ablated WPW patients had a higher long-term death risk compared to ablated WPW patients (hazard ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval: 1.50–20.93; P < 0.0001). The risk of incident atrial fibrillation was higher in the WPW group compared to the control population (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.29–1.87; P < 0.0001). Non-ablated WPW patients had a lower risk than ablated patients (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.28–0.53; P < 0.0001).

- **Conclusions**: Long-term mortality rates in WPW patients are low and similar to an age-matched and gender-matched control population. WPW patients who underwent the multifactorial process of ablation had a lower mortality compared to non-ablated WPW patients. Atrial fibrillation rates remain high long-term, and ablation does not reduce this risk.

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^115CZpzF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Accessory bypass tract (Wolff-Parkinson-White or Lown-Ganong-Levine):

Some patients with paroxysmal and/or chronic atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter and a coexisting accessory AV pathway have developed increased antegrade conduction across the accessory pathway, bypassing the AV node. This can produce a very rapid ventricular response or ventricular fibrillation after receiving intravenous verapamil (or digitalis). Although a risk of this occurring with oral verapamil has not been established, such patients receiving oral verapamil may be at risk, and its use in these patients is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Treatment is usually DC-cardioversion. Cardioversion has been used safely and effectively after oral verapamil hydrochloride.

- **Atrioventricular block**: The effect of verapamil on AV conduction and the SA node may cause asymptomatic first-degree AV block and transient bradycardia, sometimes accompanied by nodal escape rhythms. PR-interval prolongation is correlated with verapamil plasma concentrations, especially during the early titration phase of therapy. Higher degrees of AV block, however, were infrequently (0.8%) observed. Marked first-degree block or progressive development to second- or third-degree AV block requires a reduction in dosage or, in rare instances, discontinuation of verapamil HCl and institution of appropriate therapy, depending on the clinical situation.

- **Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (IHSS)**: In 120 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (most of them refractory or intolerant to propranolol) who received therapy with verapamil at.

### Usefulness of dronedarone in patients with atrial arrhythmias [^113rB5Eo]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Dronedarone is a novel class III antiarrhythmic drug with moderate efficacy in preventing atrial arrhythmias. However, only limited real-world data with restricted electrocardiographic monitoring are available for dronedarone. The investigators report on the incidence, timing, and reasons for discontinuation of dronedarone; maintenance of sinus rhythm; and atrial arrhythmia recurrence patterns in 120 consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation (AF; n = 91) or non-isthmus-dependent atrial flutter (n = 29) treated with dronedarone (400 mg twice daily). Rhythm control was assessed with serial 7-day Holter electrocardiography after 4 weeks and again after 6 to 9 months.

After drug initiation, dronedarone was discontinued in 19 patients (16%) due to inefficacy (n = 7 [6%]) or adverse events (n = 12 [10%]). At 4 weeks, 44 patients (37%) had stopped taking dronedarone because of inefficacy (n = 27 [23%]) or adverse events (n = 17 [14%]). After 6 to 9 months, 25 patients (21%) had discontinued dronedarone due to clinical inefficacy (n = 16 [13%]) or adverse events (n = 9 [8%]).

Overall, dronedarone was still used after 6 to 9 months in 32 patients (27%). Maintenance of sinus rhythm was achieved in 40 patients (33%) after 4 weeks and in 24 patients (20%) after 6 to 9 months. A reversal from persistent to paroxysmal arrhythmias was observed in 23 patients (29%), while progression from paroxysmal to persistent arrhythmias occurred in 6 patients (15%). Conversion from AF to non-isthmus-dependent atrial flutter was noted in 10 patients (13%).

In conclusion, dronedarone is associated with moderate efficacy in managing atrial arrhythmias under the studied conditions.

### Cardiac memory in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: Noninvasive imaging of activation and repolarization before and after catheter ablation [^111p1ddr]. Circulation (2008). Low credibility.

Cardiac memory refers to a change in ventricular repolarization induced by and persisting for minutes to months after the cessation of a period of altered ventricular activation, such as that resulting from pacing or preexcitation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. ECG imaging (ECGI) is a novel imaging modality for noninvasive electroanatomic mapping of epicardial activation and repolarization.

- **Methods and results**: Fourteen pediatric patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and no other congenital disease were imaged with ECGI a day before and 45 minutes, 1 week, and 1 month after successful catheter ablation. ECGI determined that preexcitation sites were consistent with sites of successful ablation in all cases, within a 1-hour arc of each atrioventricular annulus. In the preexcited rhythm, the activation-recovery interval (ARI) was the longest (349 ± 6 ms) in the area of preexcitation, leading to a high average base-to-apex ARI dispersion of 95 ± 9 ms (normal is approximately 40 ms). The ARI dispersion remained the same 45 minutes after ablation, although the activation sequence was restored to normal. ARI dispersion was still high (79 ± 9 ms) 1 week later and returned to normal (45 ± 6 ms) 1 month after ablation.

- **Conclusions**: The study demonstrates that ECGI can noninvasively localize ventricular insertion sites of accessory pathways to guide ablation and evaluate its outcome in pediatric patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Wolff-Parkinson-White is associated with high ARI dispersion in the preexcited rhythm that persists after ablation and gradually normalizes over time.

### Cardiovascular disease in the young council's science and clinical education lifelong learning committee: Year in review [^113bovY4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

This year, three articles advanced our understanding of Wolf‐Parkinson‐White and Brugada syndromes, challenging existing knowledge and provoking new thoughts about paradigms for treatment and management of these diseases.

- **Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome**: Practice guidelines for management in children have largely been based on the assumption that the risk of sudden death is both predictable and ascertainable. A large retrospective multicenter international study of 912 children with Wolf‐Parkinson‐White provided evidence to suggest that, while the risk of sudden death in children remains low, the ability to identify those at highest risk remains difficult. These findings raise questions about future management recommendations and will likely affect the manner by which physicians counsel patients in the future.

- **Brugada syndrome**: This syndrome has classically been considered a primary ion channel disorder. Although small case studies had previously suggested ablation as a curative therapy, multiple studies this year provide further evidence that epicardial ablation may successfully treat ventricular arrhythmias associated with Brugada syndrome in symptomatic adults. While long‐term follow‐up following ablation is lacking and studies in children have not been performed, these preliminary results provide new insights into this disease. Regardless of whether ablation becomes a treatment option for children with symptomatic Brugada syndrome, our approach toward this disease and the way we counsel patients may evolve.

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^114t35rU]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs frequently in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, with a reported incidence of 9% to 38%. Although previous studies have reported a decreased incidence of AF after the successful elimination of the accessory pathway (AP), paroxysmal AF frequently recurs in some patients with WPW syndrome despite successful AP elimination.

Our recent study found that the presence of advanced interatrial block (IAB) and age over 50 years were associated with a higher risk of AF recurrence after AP ablation in WPW patients. For patients at high risk of AF recurrence, additional preventive interventions are required. Currently, pulmonary vein intervention (PVI) is a widely accepted treatment for symptomatic paroxysmal AF. However, it is unknown whether additional PVI after successful AP ablation effectively prevents AF recurrence in patients with WPW syndrome, especially in patients at high risk of AF recurrence. Thus, the purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the efficacy of additional PVI after AP ablation in preventing AF recurrence in all patients with WPW syndrome and paroxysmal AF, and in patients at high risk of AF recurrence, identified by advanced IAB or age over 50 years.

### Dronedarone for atrial fibrillation: The limited reliability of clinical practice guidelines [^116qU7nN]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Concerns have been expressed about the reliability of clinical practice guidelines. We analyzed three guidelines from medical specialty societies about dronedarone hydrochloride, an antiarrhythmic drug related to amiodarone hydrochloride, for the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation. We compared the recommendations in these guidelines with the conclusions about dronedarone that we reached by applying the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Method to the same evidence base.

In our analysis, as a rate control drug, dronedarone was better than placebo only for a surrogate outcome (heart rate). As a rhythm control drug, dronedarone was associated with 13 (95% CI, -15 to 61) excess deaths per 1000 patients treated, as compared with placebo. Compared with amiodarone, dronedarone was less effective, with 214 (95% CI, 130 to 294) more recurrences of atrial fibrillation per 1000 patients treated, and similarly tolerated, with -28 (95% CI, -69 to 33) more serious adverse events requiring drug suspension per 1000 patients treated.

Despite the limits of the evidence, all three guidelines recommended dronedarone for prevention of recurrences of atrial fibrillation; two of the guidelines recommended it as a rate control agent. Our findings raise questions about the reliability of these clinical practice guidelines, as well as the financial associations between many of the panel members and the manufacturer of dronedarone.

### Is Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome a genetic disease [^112ZREQi]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2005). Low credibility.

Family studies and more recent molecular genetic investigations indicate that Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and associated preexcitation disorders can have a substantial genetic component. Because preexcitation disorders are sometimes inherited as single-gene disorders, key mechanistic insights can be gained that are expected to be relevant to the more common multifactorial forms of these traits. Potentially, such insights will inform the future management of these conditions. Where WPW is inherited as a familial trait, with or without associated cardiac defects or a systemic syndrome, there are clinical genetic ramifications that are already of practical importance.

### Atrial electrophysiologic abnormalities in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome but without paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^116h1rSy]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) frequently occurs in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. The purpose of this study was to analyze the atrial electrophysiologic abnormalities and vulnerability to developing atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with WPW syndrome but with no previous history of PAF.

We investigated atrial electrophysiologic abnormalities and vulnerability to AF in patients with WPW syndrome but without PAF. An electrophysiologic study was performed in 28 patients with WPW syndrome, 23 with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), and 25 with other arrhythmias (control), all of whom had no history of PAF. The following atrial excitability parameters were assessed: effective refractory period (ERP), spontaneous or paced (A1) and extrastimulated (A2) atrial electrogram widths, percent maximum atrial fragmentation (%MAF; A2/A1 x 100), wavelength index (WLI; ERP/A2), and inducibility of AF.

The ERP tended to be shorter in patients with WPW syndrome and in those with AVNRT than in the control group. The %MAF increased (154 ± 33% vs. 137 ± 23%, p < 0.05) and WLI decreased (2.7 ± 0.8 vs. 3.4 ± 1.0, p < 0.05) significantly in patients with WPW syndrome compared with the control group; however, these parameters in patients with AVNRT showed intermediate values. Atrial fibrillation was more inducible in patients with WPW syndrome (4/28 [14.3%]) than in those with AVNRT (1/23 [4.3%]) and the control group (0/25 [0%]).

### Prolongation of activation-recovery interval over a preexcited region before and after catheter ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^11577YH5]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2001). Low credibility.

Preexisting changes in repolarization properties play an important role in T wave abnormalities (cardiac memory) after ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. However, no report has provided direct evidence for prolongation of action potential duration (APD) over a preexcited region before and after ablation.

- **Methods and results**: We studied 10 patients with ventricular preexcitation due to a left-sided accessory pathway (AP) (group M) and 12 patients with concealed left-sided AP (group C) to clarify prolongation of APD using activation-recovery intervals (ARIs) from epicardial and endocardial unipolar electrograms in patients with WPW syndrome. ARI was calculated from unipolar electrograms at the His bundle and the coronary sinus adjacent to the AP during atrial pacing (100 beats/min) before and 30 minutes after ablation. Before ablation, ARIs at the AP site were significantly longer in group M than in group C (255 ± 21 msec vs. 211 ± 24 msec; P < 0.01), whereas ARIs at the His bundle did not differ between the two groups (255 ± 20 msec vs. 245 ± 27 msec; P = NS). After ablation, group M showed no significant changes in ARIs at the AP and His bundle (256 ± 19 msec and 253 ± 15 msec) compared with before ablation.

- **Conclusion**: We found by direct analysis of ARIs from the epicardium that APD prolongation over the preexcited region was present before catheter ablation and persisted after catheter ablation. The gradual changes in repolarization properties, including APD prolongation after discontinuation of AP, may be one mechanism of cardiac.

### The 2020 Canadian Cardiovascular Society/Canadian Heart Rhythm Society comprehensive guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation [^112RemVt]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

The CCS/CHRS 2020 guidelines suggest initiating amiodarone for rate control only in highly selected patients. This includes critically ill patients or those who experience significant side effects from, or have contraindications to, first-line agents. The decision should be made following a thorough consideration of alternative agents and an assessment of the risks and benefits associated with amiodarone therapy.

### Electrophysiologic profile and results of invasive risk stratification in asymptomatic children and adolescents with the Wolff-Parkinson-White electrocardiographic pattern [^112rkvvL]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2014). Low credibility.

Data on the results and clinical effect of an invasive risk stratification strategy in asymptomatic young patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White electrocardiographic pattern are scarce.

- **Methods and results**: Eighty-five consecutive patients aged < 18 years with a Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern and persistent preexcitation at maximum exercise undergoing invasive risk stratification were retrospectively studied. Adverse accessory pathway (AP) properties were defined according to currently consented criteria as any of the following: shortest preexcited RR interval during atrial fibrillation/rapid atrial pacing ≤ 250 ms (or antegrade effective refractory period ≤ 250 ms if the shortest preexcited RR interval was not available) or inducible atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia.

	- Age at evaluation was a median of 14.9 years. Eighty-two patients had a structurally normal heart, and 3 had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A single manifest AP was present in 80; 1 manifest and 1 concealed AP in 4; and 2 manifest APs in 1 patient.

	- Adverse AP properties were present in 32 of 85 patients (37.6%) at baseline and in an additional 16 of 44 (36.4%) after isoproterenol. Ablation was performed in 41 of these 48 patients. Ablation was deferred in the remaining 7 due to the pathway's proximity to the atrioventricular node. In addition, 18 of the low-risk patients were ablated based on patient/parental decision.

- **Conclusions**: Adverse AP properties at baseline were exhibited by 37.6% of the evaluated patients with asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White preexcitation persisting at peak exercise. Isoproterenol challenge…

### Atrial fibrillation with broad QRS tachycardia and undiagnosed Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: Diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas in a pediatric patient [^111w8og3]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

A 10-year-old girl presented to the emergency department of a regional hospital with one episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Postictal monitoring followed by a 12-lead electrocardiogram showed fast atrial fibrillation with intermittent wide QRS regular tachycardia. Immediately following this, her rhythm changed to wide QRS irregular tachycardia without hemodynamic compromise. She was suspected to have ventricular tachycardia and was treated with intravenous amiodarone, which resulted in cardioversion to sinus rhythm. A subsequent electrocardiogram in sinus rhythm showed typical features of manifest Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) accessory pathway.

This case illustrates the diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas in patients with atrial fibrillation, wide QRS tachycardia, and undiagnosed WPW syndrome, with antidromic conduction of atrial arrhythmias through the accessory pathway. Furthermore, this case demonstrates that undiagnosed wide QRS tachycardias need to be treated with drugs acting on the accessory pathway. Keeping in mind underlying WPW syndrome is crucial to avoid potentially catastrophic events.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: electrophysiological and clinical findings [^113mUD4H]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The effects of nifekalant on antegrade AVN conduction were assessed in 102 patients with PSVT — 92 patients with concealed pathway or dual AVN pathway, and 10 patients with preexcitation. The ERP of the antegrade AVN was 315 ± 69 ms at the baseline and 321 ± 77 ms after nifekalant infusion (P = 0.06; see Figure 6). The presence of dual AVN pathways did not affect the effects on the AVN EP properties. There were no episodes of AV block during nifekalant infusion.

- **Effects of nifekalant on antegrade and other parameters**: Nifekalant significantly prolonged the AV conduction properties, such as the ERP, right atrial, and right ventricular conduction parameters, from 202 ± 25 to 235 ± 33 ms (n = 168), 218 ± 20 to 247 ± 23 ms (n = 152), and 413 ± 33 to 476 ± 33 ms (n = 114), respectively (all P < 0.001). It slightly decreased the sinus rate from 79 ± 14 to 74 ± 13 beats/min (n = 189, P = 0.04). The changes of other measured parameters with nifekalant were negligible: from 178 ± 19 to 180 ± 20 ms (n = 114, P = 0.41), 90 ± 9 to 90 ± 8 ms (n = 114, P = 0.53), 101 ± 18 to 103 ± 19 ms (n = 97, P = 0.26), 46 ± 5 to 46 ± 5 ms (n = 97, P = 0.75), and 119 ± 12 to 117 ± 11 mm Hg (n = 185, P = 0.30), respectively.

### Clinical profile and management of Wolf-Parkinson White syndrome and asymptomatic pre-excitation carriers in Africa: A multicenter pan African registry from 17 countries [^116ZxthC]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Low credibility.

Data are scarce regarding Wolf-Parkinson White syndrome (WPW) and asymptomatic pre-excitation in Africa. This study aimed to understand the approaches utilized in Africa for the diagnosis and management of both symptomatic and asymptomatic ventricular pre-excitation.

- **Methods**: The prospective study was conducted in 20 centers located in 17 countries spanning all areas of Africa. Participants included had ventricular pre-excitation patterns. The data collected included symptoms, locations of accessory pathways (AP) and tachyarrhythmia, risk stratification, as well as acute and long-term management. In addition, the study assessed the clinical effectiveness of the centers and the impact of socioeconomic and health metrics on these treatment approaches.

- **Results**: Among 541 participants, 93% were diagnosed with WPW syndrome, with orthodromic atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT) being the most prevalent arrhythmia, affecting 55% of the cases. Approximately 30% of patients in Africa, except for the southern region, received intravenous amiodarone as the first-choice drug for orthodromic AVRT, while adenosine was the drug of choice in the southern region. Electrical cardioversion was the first-line treatment for pre-excited atrial fibrillation and antidromic AVRT across all of Africa. Radiofrequency ablation (RF) was the first long-term therapy option for 88% of patients in all African regions, unlike western and central Africa where it was implemented for less than 30% of patients (p < 0.001). The rates of RF success and long-term recurrence were analyzed further.
