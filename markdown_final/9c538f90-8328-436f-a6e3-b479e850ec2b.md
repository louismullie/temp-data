## Question

53 yr female scheduled for left knee surgery: Hgb 15.4, MCHC 35.4, glucose 198, anion gap 19, carbon dioxide 19

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the acid-base assessment for a 53-year-old woman with hyperglycemia, elevated anion gap, and low total CO2 prior to elective left knee surgery, including which labs to obtain, likely etiologies, preoperative implications, and a perioperative plan with rationale. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the immediate interpretation of the provided labs and what the anion gap and low total CO2 imply. Then, I should verify the key missing data needed to confirm the acid-base disorder and quantify compensation. Next, I will construct a prioritized differential for the elevated anion gap, assess surgical risk, and outline perioperative management including fluids, insulin, and electrolyte correction. Finally, I should consider whether to delay surgery and summarize actionable next steps with appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the laboratory signal. An anion gap of 19 mEq/L is above the typical upper limit of normal, which immediately flags an anion gap metabolic acidosis when paired with a low total CO2 of 19 mEq/L, the latter serving as a surrogate for low serum bicarbonate. I initially thought a bicarbonate around 19 mEq/L would align with an anion gap near 19, but wait, let me verify that logic because that would imply a delta gap/delta bicarbonate ratio near 1.0, which is a simplification and may not hold in mixed disorders or when the baseline anion gap differs from the lab's reference mean, so I should not jump to conclusions about mechanism solely from those two numbers without the full picture [^1117qBur] [^113XiPyq] [^111MVjpb].

> I need to check the missing pieces before labeling the disorder. Hold on, I should verify serum pH and PaCO2 on an arterial blood gas to establish acuity and quantify respiratory compensation, and I should obtain lactate, serum ketones or beta-hydroxybutyrate, creatinine and eGFR, and albumin to assess for lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, renal failure, and to correct the anion gap for albumin. If the anion gap remains elevated after correction, I should calculate the osmolal gap to screen for toxic alcohols, and if I suspect mixed processes, I will compute the delta anion gap over delta bicarbonate, recognizing the wide variability of that ratio and interpreting it cautiously [^113XiPyq] [^115oS1GG] [^111QBddX] [^112ddQVR] [^112tEJd9].

> Now, considering etiologies for a high anion gap in a preoperative patient with hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis is high on the list. But wait, let me verify the glucose threshold, because euglycemic DKA and SGLT2 inhibitor–associated ketoacidosis can present with near-normal or only mildly elevated glucose, so I should not anchor on glucose alone and must check for ketonemia even when glucose is less than 250–300 mg/dL, especially if there is recent fasting, surgery, or SGLT2 use. If lactate is elevated, I should distinguish type A hypoperfusion-related lactic acidosis from type B drug- or toxin-related causes and integrate clinical perfusion and medication history. I should also remember uncommon causes like pyroglutamic acidosis with chronic acetaminophen use and the possibility of mixed disorders that blunt expected bicarbonate changes relative to the anion gap [^115oS1GG] [^113ErRxx] [^111nVNj6] [^1117qBur] [^113qVTBY].

> Let me consider surgical risk next. Uncorrected metabolic acidosis, particularly when the anion gap is elevated, correlates with worse outcomes in surgical and critically ill populations, and perioperative acidosis is associated with hemodynamic instability, coagulopathy, and organ dysfunction. Therefore, I should confirm whether this acidosis is acute and whether it is adequately compensated before proceeding to the operating room, and if the acidosis is severe or poorly compensated, delaying elective surgery to correct the underlying process is prudent [^114kLQHq] [^114Waxtf] [^113XiPyq].

> I will now examine the perioperative management if the patient proceeds urgently. I need to ensure euglycemia with a basal-bolus insulin regimen and close glucose monitoring to avoid both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, because both can worsen acid-base instability; for fluids, balanced crystalloids such as Lactated Ringer's are preferred over chloride-rich saline to mitigate hyperchloremic acidosis, with careful attention to potassium balance; electrolytes, including potassium, sodium, and bicarbonate, should be corrected based on serial measurements; and I should avoid routine sodium bicarbonate unless there is severe acidemia with concomitant AKI or other specific indications, given potential harms and lack of mortality benefit in most contexts [^114Waxtf] [^11251rz1] [^117Cxxn6] [^1137VtWp] [^111m1uBD].

> But wait, what if this is a mixed disorder. Mixed high anion gap plus non–anion gap acidosis, or high anion gap acidosis plus metabolic alkalosis, can mask the degree of acidemia and complicate interpretation. I should double-check the delta gap/delta bicarbonate ratio, keeping in mind its variability, and integrate the clinical context to avoid premature closure. For example, a delta gap/delta bicarbonate less than 1 suggests a concurrent non–anion gap acidosis, whereas a ratio greater than 1 suggests a superimposed metabolic alkalosis, but I need to corroborate this with albumin-corrected anion gap, urine anion gap, and the full ABG before acting on that inference [^112ddQVR] [^112agy4M] [^113XiPyq].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of sodium bicarbonate here. Current guidance suggests not using bicarbonate to improve hemodynamics in septic shock with lactic acidemia when pH is 7.15 or higher, and suggests considering bicarbonate only in severe metabolic acidemia, typically pH 7.20 or lower, and even then preferably when AKI is present; thus, unless criteria are met, I should prioritize treating the cause and optimizing perfusion rather than administering bicarbonate [^117Cxxn6] [^114V1MMK] [^1137VtWp].

> Let me reconsider whether surgery should proceed today. If the acidosis is new, unexplained, severe, or accompanied by organ dysfunction or significant electrolyte derangements, I should recommend postponing elective surgery to stabilize and correct the underlying disorder; conversely, if the acid-base disturbance is mild, chronic, well compensated, and the etiology is clear and controlled, surgery may proceed with enhanced monitoring, clear postoperative plans for glucose and electrolyte surveillance, and readiness to escalate care if deterioration occurs [^114Waxtf].

> Next, I should review concrete next steps. I need an ABG now to define pH, PaCO2, and HCO3−, lactate and serum ketones to distinguish lactic from ketoacidosis, creatinine and eGFR to assess renal contribution, and albumin to correct the anion gap. I should calculate the osmolal gap if the etiology remains unclear after initial testing, and I will reassess glucose trends and insulin needs. If mixed processes are suspected, I will calculate the delta gap/delta bicarbonate ratio and interpret it in light of clinical and laboratory context, not in isolation [^113XiPyq] [^115oS1GG] [^111QBddX] [^112ddQVR].

> In summary, the pattern of an elevated anion gap with low total CO2 indicates a high anion gap metabolic acidosis that warrants prompt etiologic clarification and correction before elective surgery. DKA or euglycemic ketoacidosis and lactic acidosis are leading considerations in this hyperglycemic, preoperative patient, and the presence of a mixed disorder would require deliberate interpretation of compensation and delta ratios. I need to ensure safe glycemic control, favor balanced crystalloids, correct electrolytes, and reserve bicarbonate for select severe cases, with a low threshold to delay surgery if the acidosis is significant or unstable [^115oS1GG] [^113ErRxx] [^1117qBur] [^117Cxxn6].

The patient has a **metabolic acidosis** with an elevated anion gap (AG = 19) and low bicarbonate (CO2 = 19), indicating a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) [^115oS1GG]. The most likely cause is **diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)** [^114Waxtf] given the hyperglycemia (glucose 198 mg/dL) and HAGMA, but other causes such as lactic acidosis, renal failure, or toxic ingestions should be considered [^113JDFth]. Immediate evaluation with **ABG, lactate, renal function, ketones, and osmolal gap** is essential [^113XiPyq]. Surgery should be delayed until the acid-base disorder is corrected and the cause is identified and treated to reduce perioperative risk [^114Waxtf].

## Interpretation of laboratory findings

| **Laboratory parameter** | **Patient value** | **Reference range** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Hemoglobin (Hgb) | 15.4 g/dL | 12.0–15.5 g/dL | Normal |
| Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) | 35.4 g/dL | 32.0–36.0 g/dL | Normal |
| Glucose | 198 mg/dL | 70–100 mg/dL | Elevated (hyperglycemia) |
| Anion gap (AG) | 19 mEq/L | 8–12 mEq/L | Elevated (HAGMA) |
| Total CO2 (bicarbonate) | 19 mEq/L | 22–28 mEq/L | Low (metabolic acidosis) |

---

The elevated anion gap and low bicarbonate indicate a **high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA)** [^115oS1GG], most consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) given the hyperglycemia [^113ErRxx]. Other causes — such as lactic acidosis, renal failure, or toxic ingestions — should also be considered [^113JDFth].

---

## Differential diagnosis of high anion gap metabolic acidosis

The mnemonic **MUDPILES** helps frame the differential [^notfound]:

- **Methanol**: Less likely without history of ingestion.
- **Uremia**: Assess renal function (BUN, creatinine).
- **Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)**: Likely given hyperglycemia and HAGMA [^notfound].
- **Propylene glycol**: Less likely without relevant exposure.
- **Iron/isoniazid**: Less likely without history.
- **Lactic acidosis**: Consider if hypoperfusion or sepsis [^113uTM3c].
- **Ethylene glycol**: Less likely without ingestion history.
- **Salicylates**: Less likely without ingestion history.

Given the clinical context, **DKA is the most likely diagnosis**, but lactic acidosis and renal failure should be excluded [^113uTM3c].

---

## Clinical implications for surgery

Metabolic acidosis, particularly HAGMA, **increases perioperative risk** by reducing cardiac output, impairing oxygen delivery, and predisposing to arrhythmias and coagulopathies [^1117qBur]. Surgery should be delayed until the acid-base disorder is corrected and the underlying cause is identified and treated [^notfound].

---

## Recommended preoperative evaluation and management

### Immediate evaluation

Order an **arterial blood gas (ABG)** to confirm acidosis and assess severity [^113XiPyq], and measure serum lactate to evaluate for lactic acidosis [^114iHNUk]. Obtain renal function tests (BUN, creatinine) to assess for renal failure, and check serum ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate) to confirm DKA [^notfound]. Calculate the serum osmolal gap to exclude toxic alcohol ingestion [^111QBddX].

---

### Management

Initiate **intravenous fluids** for hydration and correction of acidosis, and start an insulin infusion to control hyperglycemia and treat DKA [^notfound]. Monitor and correct electrolyte imbalances, especially potassium [^114PbRS8]. Delay surgery until acid-base status normalizes and the underlying cause is stabilized [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The patient has a **high anion gap metabolic acidosis**, most likely due to diabetic ketoacidosis [^115oS1GG]. Immediate evaluation and management are required, and elective surgery should be postponed until the acid-base disorder is corrected and the underlying cause is stabilized. This approach minimizes perioperative risk and ensures patient safety [^notfound].

Discussion

Acid-base disturbances are common in the ICU and can significantly impact patient outcomes. AKI is associated with acid-base disorder. Thereby, this study investigates the relationship between SBE and the risk of AKI in ICU patients. The study observed that both higher and lower SBE were associated with an increased risk of AKI. In the subgroup of patients under the age of 70 years, without cardiogenic shock, and with a qSOFA score of 2 or more, there was a significant association between both higher and lower SBE and the risk of AKI. Among female patients, without sepsis, and patients with a CCI of 2 or higher, elevated SBE was linked to a higher risk of AKI. Conversely, in the male subgroup, lower SBE was associated with an increased risk of AKI.

### Renal tubular acidosis is highly prevalent in critically ill patients [^1162rrKv]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis is a frequent entity in critically ill patients. Therefore, we aimed to identify the underlying acid-base imbalances with a particular focus on RTA. As the occurrence of more than one acid-base disturbance at the same time is common in critically ill patients our analysis was based on calculating the base excess subsets according to the physical-chemical approach by Gilfix et al.

Forty-three percent of the patients presented at least on one day with hyperchloremic acidosis during the first week of ICU stay. This is more frequent compared to Gunnerson et al. who found hyperchloremic acidosis in only 26% of critically ill patients. However, they did not determine base excess subsets. Therefore, they could not detect hyperchloremic acidosis in the state of normal arterial pH values, which therefore was probably underrepresented.

### Secondary responses to altered acid-base status: the rules of engagement [^114KJ8K4]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Each of the four canonical acid-base disorders expresses as a primary change in carbon dioxide tension or plasma bicarbonate concentration followed by a secondary response in the countervailing variable. Quantified empirically, these secondary responses are directional and proportional to the primary changes, run a variable time course, and tend to minimize the impact on body acidity engendered by the primary changes. Absence of an appropriate secondary response denotes the coexistence of an additional acid-base disorder. Here we address the expected magnitude of the secondary response to each cardinal acid-base disorder in humans and offer caveats for judging the appropriateness of each secondary response.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^1147SnGX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Metabolic acidosis in CKD — practice points, treatment thresholds, and dietary guidance are as follows: Practice Point 3.10.1 states to consider use of pharmacological treatment with or without dietary intervention to prevent development of acidosis with potential clinical implications (e.g., bicarbonate < 18 mmol/l in adults). Practice Point 3.10.2 advises monitoring to ensure therapy does not result in serum bicarbonate concentrations exceeding the upper limit of normal and does not adversely affect BP control, serum potassium, or fluid status. The KDOQI Work Group agrees that acidosis in adults should only be treated with pharmacologic agents when bicarbonate < 18 mmol/l or if there is a clear indication to do so, and notes a large clinical trial of veverimer did not demonstrate a decline in a composite CKD progression outcome. Pediatric clinicians may choose to treat milder acidosis more aggressively to help optimize growth and bone health. Nutrition guidance supports prevention and treatment via increased dietary intake of fruits and vegetables, including the statement: In adults with CKD 1–4, we suggest reducing net endogenous acid production through increased dietary intake of fruits and vegetables (2C) to reduce the rate of decline of residual kidney function.

### Acid-base disorders in the critically ill patient [^113uTM3c]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are common in the intensive care unit. By utilizing a systematic approach to their diagnosis, it is easy to identify both simple and mixed disturbances. These disorders are divided into four major categories: metabolic acidosis, metabolic alkalosis, respiratory acidosis, and respiratory alkalosis. Metabolic acidosis is subdivided into anion gap and non-gap acidosis. Distinguishing between these is helpful in establishing the cause of the acidosis. Anion gap acidosis, caused by the accumulation of organic anions from sepsis, diabetes, alcohol use, and numerous drugs and toxins, is usually present on admission to the intensive care unit. Lactic acidosis from decreased delivery or utilization of oxygen is associated with increased mortality. This is likely secondary to the disease process, as opposed to the degree of acidemia. Treatment of an anion gap acidosis is aimed at the underlying disease or removal of the toxin. The use of therapy to normalize the pH is controversial. Non-gap acidoses result from disorders of renal tubular H + transport, decreased renal ammonia secretion, gastrointestinal and kidney losses of bicarbonate, dilution of serum bicarbonate from excessive intravenous fluid administration, or addition of hydrochloric acid. Metabolic alkalosis is the most common acid-base disorder found in patients who are critically ill, and most often occurs after admission to the intensive care unit. Its etiology is most often secondary to the aggressive therapeutic interventions used to treat shock, acidemia, volume overload, severe coagulopathy, respiratory failure, and AKI. Treatment consists of volume resuscitation and repletion of potassium deficits. Aggressive lowering of the pH is usually not necessary. Respiratory disorders are caused by either decreased or increased minute ventilation. The use of permissive hypercapnia to prevent barotrauma has become the standard of care. The use of bicarbonate to correct the acidemia is not recommended. In patients at the extreme, the use of extracorporeal therapies to remove CO 2 can be considered.

### Approach to patients with high anion gap metabolic acidosis: core curriculum 2021 [^115oS1GG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The anion gap (AG) is a mathematical construct that compares the blood sodium concentration with the sum of the chloride and bicarbonate concentrations. It is a helpful calculation that divides the metabolic acidoses into 2 categories: high AG metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis-and thereby delimits the potential etiologies of the disorder. When the [AG] is compared with changes in the bicarbonate concentration, other occult acid-base disorders can be identified. Furthermore, finding that the AG is very small or negative can suggest several occult clinical disorders or raise the possibility of electrolyte measurement artifacts. In this installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we discuss cases that represent several very common and several rare causes of HAGMA. These case scenarios highlight how the AG can provide vital clues that direct the clinician toward the correct diagnosis. We also show how to calculate and, if necessary, correct the AG for hypoalbuminemia and severe hyperglycemia. Plasma osmolality and osmolal gap calculations are described and when used together with the AG guide appropriate clinical decision making.

### The end of the bicarbonate era? A therapeutic application of the stewart approach [^115MGmg2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Critically ill patients frequently present with disorders of acid–base homeostasis, making arterial blood gas interpretation a cornerstone activity in the clinical assessment of patients by intensivists. Many of us are unaware that we've been taught to interpret acid–base homeostasis in the "bicarbonate era", where a focus on the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for dissociation of carbon dioxide has led us to believe that bicarbonate is a major determinant of acid–base status. However, when we try to understand some of the commonly encountered acid–base abnormalities in critical illness, such as hyperchloremia, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation leaves us yearning for a better explanation.

Forty years ago, the Canadian physiologist Peter Stewart provided a better explanation. He described an approach to understanding acid–base in which bicarbonate is not the major determinant of acid–base status. Although it is referred to as the "modern" approach, Stewart's explanation incorporated time-tested concepts of physical chemistry, such as conservation of mass, dissociation of electrolytes, and electroneutrality, some of which date back to the 18th century. Therefore, it is perhaps more accurate to refer to Stewart's work as the physicochemical approach. Stewart applied these physicochemical principles by using simple algebra to demonstrate that plasma pH (and bicarbonate concentration) is determined by the P 2, the strong ion difference, and the concentration of weak acids (primarily albumin and phosphate).

The strong ion difference in plasma is determined by the relatively higher concentration of sodium compared with chloride, and the difference is typically about 40 mEq/L. The electroneutrality of plasma is maintained because the charge gap between these two strong ions is made up by the dissociation of weak acids into their respective anions, including the dissociation of dissolved carbon dioxide into bicarbonate. By showing that plasma proteins (weak acids) and dissolved strong ions also participate in acid–base homeostasis, the physicochemical approach provides an explanation for acid–base disorders commonly encountered in critical illness, such as hypoalbuminemia and hyperchloremia. However, although this approach is mathematically accurate, it oversimplifies some of the mechanistic insights, which is perhaps why reception has been mixed, ranging from full embracement at the bedside to outright hostility.

### Anion-gap metabolic acidemia: case-based analyses [^112agy4M]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Not all metabolic acidosis is associated with an elevated chloride replacing the low bicarbonate concentration. When other acids, usually non-Cl organic acids are introduced into the blood an "Anion Gap" metabolic acidosis exists. The serum anion gap is calculated as [Na⁺] − ([Cl⁻] + [HCO₃⁻]) = Unmeasured anions − Unmeasured cations. The normal gap is mostly due to negatively charged albumin: (Normal range: 8–12meq/l) as the unmeasured anions, since albumin is usually reported in grams per liter (not meq/l). For diagnostic purposes, calculating the serum anion gap allows determination of coexisting acid-base processes in a patient. Assuming a 1:1 fall in bicarbonate compared with rise in anion gap in a usual gap acidosis, one can compare the Δ anion gap/ΔHCO₃⁻: Δgap = observed anion gap − normal anion gap and ΔHCO₃⁻ = normal HCO₃⁻ − observed HCO₃⁻. A ratio of 1 suggests a simple anion gap acidosis; if < 1 a superimposed non-gap acidosis is lowering HCO 3 - and if > 1 a superimposed metabolic alkalosis is raising HCO 3 -. Comparing the anion gap and osmolar gap can narrow the differential diagnosis to include toxic alcohol ingestions with acidic metabolites such as ethylene glycol and methanol. Not all metabolic acidosis is associated with an elevated chloride replacing the low bicarbonate concentration. When other acids, usually non-Cl organic acids are introduced into the blood an "Anion Gap" metabolic acidosis exists. This review will consider the generation of anion-gap acidoses through case discussions.

### Negative anion gap metabolic acidosis in salicylate overdose – a zebra! [^111FjRKB]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Salicylate poisoning classically results in an increased anion gap metabolic acidosis. We discuss a case of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis despite elevated serum salicylate concentration. This diagnostic dilemma stemmed from aberrant reading of salicylate ions by analyzer electrodes as chloride ions leading to falsely negative anion gap. On review, this phenomenon is found to be possible with a number of commonly used analyzers. In emergency department settings, high level of clinical suspicion for salicylate poisoning should be maintained, and metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap should not be used to rule out salicylate overdose. This can prevent significant avoidable morbidity and mortality.

### Clinical efficacy of sodium bicarbonate in treating pediatric metabolic acidosis with varying level of acid-base balance parameters: a real-world study [^117RZY5V]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The use of sodium bicarbonate for treating metabolic acidosis has been found to increase mortality in children with low chloride levels but decrease mortality in those with high chloride levels in this study. Further prospective multi-center clinical studies and basic research are needed to validate these findings.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^1133dUP1]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Is there any proven benefit of systemic alkalinization in severe metabolic (including lactic) acidosis?

Literature regarding the potential beneficial effect of alkalinization in correcting metabolic acidosis is controversial. As reported above, severe lactic acidosis with pH ≤ 7.15 appears to be experimentally detrimental for organ functions. Consequently, even if not formally demonstrated in clinical trials, it would appear reasonable to quickly correct the pH in order to restore cellular functions. In the absence of conclusive clinical studies, however, most of the following treatment options are consequently based on experimental data.

Sodium bicarbonate

Sodium bicarbonate has been removed from the treatment algorithm in advanced cardiac life support. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign also recommends against the use of sodium bicarbonate therapy for the purpose of improving hemodynamics or reducing vasopressor requirements in patients with severe lactic acidosis with pH > 7.15. Despite these strong guidelines, in the most recent survey on this topic, 67% of intensivists recommend administration of base to patients with metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis. The blood pH at which base therapy should be initiated remains nonetheless controversial. Thirty-seven percent of these intensivists continue to begin symptomatic treatment of metabolic acidosis for a pH ≥ 7.1. Such discrepancy between the literature and bedside practice warrants further explanation.

Clinical studies investigating sodium bicarbonate therapy in situations of severe lactic acidosis have always reported an increase in extracellular pH whereas experimental data are more divergent. By contrast, intracellular pH always decreases after sodium bicarbonate administration (Table 1). The main explanation for this so-called paradoxical intracellular acidosis is based on the reaction of sodium bicarbonate with a proton to form water and carbon dioxide:

### Electrolyte and acid-base disorders in inflammatory bowel disease [^116XPpJ3]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

IBD-associated mucosal inflammation and the consequent impaired secretion and absorption of electrolytes often result in electrolytic and acid-base imbalance in IBD patients. Reduced sodium and chloride absorption and increased potassium secretion comprise the most common and critical abnormalities. In addition, hypocalcemia may be observed, due to both limited calcium intestinal absorption and disturbed metabolism of vitamin D. Of note, due to the fact that the electrolyte transport takes place mainly in colon, UC is typically associated with electrolyte disorders in contrast to CD that might spare the colon. Moreover, IBD-treatment and remission limit electrolyte disturbances.

In contrast to other secretory diarrheas, IBD has been associated with mild or severe metabolic alkalosis depending on the severity of the inflammation and the part of the GI tract being affected. The alkalosis is attributed to the decreased bicarbonate secretion of the colon when it is affected. Hence, active UC may increase patient pH in comparison with CD that might not affect the colon. Large-scale epidemiological studies are required for a better insight into electrolyte and acid-base disorders in IBD patients.

### Metabolic acidosis [^115VvaKe]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is a common disorder that occurs in a variety of clinical settings. The kidney maintains acid-base homeostasis through the elimination of protons and reabsorption/generation of bicarbonate. Metabolic acidosis develops when these mechanisms are overwhelmed or impaired, in situations such as rapid production of nonvolatile acids, abnormally high bicarbonate losses, and impaired acid excretion by the kidney. Determining the presence or absence of an anion gap is the first step in ascertaining the etiology of metabolic acidosis. The presence or absence of an osmolal gap, urine pH, and serum potassium levels may be useful in certain settings. We discuss a comprehensive approach to metabolic acidosis and present important clinical scenarios.

### Bench-to-bedside review: fundamental principles of acid-base physiology [^111cjfEi]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Complex acid-base disorders arise frequently in critically ill patients, especially in those with multiorgan failure. In order to diagnose and treat these disorders better, some intensivists have abandoned traditional theories in favor of revisionist models of acid-base balance. With claimed superiority over the traditional approach, the new methods have rekindled debate over the fundamental principles of acid-base physiology. In order to shed light on this controversy, we review the derivation and application of new models of acid-base balance.

### 2017 ISHNE-HRS expert consensus statement on ambulatory ECG and external cardiac monitoring / telemetry [^116dPR9u]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Medium credibility.

Standardized cardiac telemetry — patient selection and yield considerations identify low-yield monitoring in low-risk cohorts and gaps in indications. "Patient selection may be important. Monitoring low-risk patients who are unlikely to experience cardiac arrhythmias may yield a disproportionate ratio of false alarms including noise artifact and ECG lead failures". For low-risk hospitalized chest-pain patients, "arrhythmia yield was only 1.5% in one study". Prior guidance gaps are noted: "The AHA practice guidelines in 2004… omitted many commonly applied telemetry indications including stroke evaluation, hypoxemia respiratory disorders, proarrhythmic acid/base disorders, and exposures to pro-arrhythmic drugs (dofetilide, sotalol) or illicit substances (cocaine, amphetamines, alcohol intoxication)". Concerningly, "In one discouraging report of nearly 9,000 patients evaluated longitudinally, 20% of non-ICU cardiac arrests occurred in unmonitored patients".

### Differential diagnosis of nongap metabolic acidosis: value of a systematic approach [^113qrZvM]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Nongap metabolic acidosis is a common form of both acute and chronic metabolic acidosis. Because derangements in renal acid-base regulation are a common cause of nongap metabolic acidosis, studies to evaluate renal acidification often serve as the mainstay of differential diagnosis. However, in many cases, information obtained from the history and physical examination, evaluation of the electrolyte pattern (to determine if a nongap acidosis alone or a combined nongap and high anion gap metabolic acidosis is present), and examination of the serum potassium concentration (to characterize the disorder as hyperkalemic or hypokalemic in nature) is sufficient to make a presumptive diagnosis without more sophisticated studies. If this information proves insufficient, indirect estimates or direct measurement of urinary NH(4)(+) concentration, measurement of urine pH, and assessment of urinary HCO(3)(-) excretion can help in establishing the diagnosis. This review summarizes current information concerning the pathophysiology of this electrolyte pattern and the value and limitations of all of the diagnostic studies available. It also provides a systematic and cost-effective approach to the differential diagnosis of nongap metabolic acidosis.

Home and alternate site nutrition support — patient selection and monitoring: Laboratory data may be required to promote efficacy and prevent complications when nutrition support is initiated in the home, and laboratory data may need to be modified for pediatric patients. High-risk patients who may not be candidates for initiating enteral nutrition (EN) or parenteral nutrition (PN) at home include patients at risk for refeeding syndrome, infants, patients with diabetes mellitus, fluid and electrolyte/acid-base disorders, or major organ dysfunction, and such patients may need more frequent monitoring and clinical assessment than can be managed at home.

### Beyond bicarbonate: complete acid-base assessment in patients receiving intermittent hemodialysis [^113YFs9b]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acid-base assessments in hemodialysis patients have been limited almost entirely to measurements of total CO 2 concentration, and assumptions have been made about the presence of acid-base disorders. To gain a fuller understanding of the acid-base status of stable hemodialysis patients, we analyzed measurements of pCO 2, pH and HCO 3 - obtained in a cohort of chronic stable hemodialysis patients over a 5-year period.

Methods

We reviewed acid-base measurements taken pre-dialysis from fistula blood in 53 outpatients receiving hemodialysis thrice weekly between 2008 and 2012. In these patients, pH and pCO 2 were measured using an onsite blood gas analyzer, and HCO 3 - was computed. Relevant clinical and laboratory data were obtained from medical records. Factors affecting serum HCO 3 - were identified. Simple and mixed acid-base disorders were diagnosed using accepted rules.

Results

Serum HCO 3 - was affected by age, normalized protein catabolic rate, interdialytic weight gain and length of interval between treatments. As expected, metabolic acidosis was the most common acid-base disorder, but respiratory acid-base disturbances, as simple or complex disorders, were found in 41% of the measurements. Respiratory alkalosis was seen more frequently than respiratory acidosis, but the latter disorder was more commonly associated with serious comorbidities.

Conclusions

Respiratory acid-base disorders are an important component of the acid-base abnormalities seen in hemodialysis patients and are not identified by measuring total CO 2 concentration; hence, complete acid-base measurements are needed to determine the components of hemodialysis patients' acid-base status that are contributing to mortality risk.

### Metabolic acidosis or respiratory alkalosis? Evaluation of a low plasma bicarbonate using the urine anion gap [^1116ZUbJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Hypobicarbonatemia, or a reduced bicarbonate concentration in plasma, is a finding seen in 3 acid-base disorders: metabolic acidosis, chronic respiratory alkalosis and mixed metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. Hypobicarbonatemia due to chronic respiratory alkalosis is often misdiagnosed as a metabolic acidosis and mistreated with the administration of alkali therapy. Proper diagnosis of the cause of hypobicarbonatemia requires integration of the laboratory values, arterial blood gas, and clinical history. The information derived from the urinary response to the prevailing acid-base disorder is useful to arrive at the correct diagnosis. We discuss the use of urine anion gap, as a surrogate marker of urine ammonium excretion, in the evaluation of a patient with low plasma bicarbonate concentration to differentiate between metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. The interpretation and limitations of urine acid-base indexes at bedside (urine pH, urine bicarbonate, and urine anion gap) to evaluate urine acidification are discussed.

Proximal tubular dysfunction — serum and nonspecific indicators include electrolyte and acid–base patterns and limited-specificity urinary findings. Hypokalemia is defined as serum potassium concentration below laboratory reference range and trends are of more clinical relevance than single abnormal value, but it is neither sensitive nor specific. Low serum bicarbonate is defined as serum bicarbonate concentration below laboratory reference range and is nonspecific in the setting of reduced glomerular filtration rate. Hypophosphatemia is defined as serum phosphorous concentration below laboratory reference range, and normal value does not exclude urinary phosphorous wasting; however, hypophosphatemia combined with urinary wasting is diagnostic of renal tubular injury. Other laboratory indicators listed as nonspecific include proteinuria/albuminuria and hematuria.

### Spurious electrolyte and acid-base disorders in the patient with cancer: a review [^111CnkDx]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte and acid-base disorders are frequently encountered in patients with malignancy, either due to cancer itself or as a complication of its therapy. However, spurious electrolyte disorders can complicate the interpretation and management of these patients. Several electrolytes can be artifactually increased or decreased such that the serum electrolyte values do not correspond to their actual systemic levels, potentially resulting in extensive diagnostic investigations and therapeutic interventions. Examples of spurious derangements include pseudohyponatremia, pseudohypokalemia, pseudohyperkalemia, pseudohypophosphatemia, pseudohyperphosphatemia, and artifactual acid-base abnormalities. Correctly interpreting these artifactual laboratory abnormalities is imperative for avoiding unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions in cancer patients. The factors influencing these spurious results also must be recognized, along with the steps to minimize them. We present a narrative review of commonly reported pseudo electrolyte disorders and describe strategies to exclude erroneous interpretations of these laboratory values and avoid pitfalls. Awareness and recognition of spurious electrolyte and acid-base disorders can prevent unnecessary and harmful treatments.

### Severe metabolic or mixed acidemia on intensive care unit admission: incidence, prognosis and administration of buffer therapy. A prospective, multiple-center study [^111xKRrH]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study reports for the first time that severe metabolic or mixed acidemia, defined by plasma pH lower than 7.20, occurs within the first 24 hours in the ICU in 6% of critically ill patients. In our study, severe acidemia was associated with a high mortality rate, and, rather than the initial pH value, the rapidity of acidemia correction appeared to be a determinant of outcome. Sodium bicarbonate therapy administration was very heterogeneous between participating ICUs. Further studies are necessary to better assess the role of buffers in this subgroup of critically ill patients.

### Mixed acid-base disturbances: core curriculum 2025 [^112AErMb]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Mixed acid-base disorders are frequently encountered in clinical practice and due to their complexity, diagnoses and treatment are challenging. The opposing effects of multiple disturbances can lead to blood pH levels that are near normal or separate acid-base disturbances can have an additive effect leading to more significant changes in blood and intracellular pH. A systematic evaluation of patient history, physical examination, and laboratory results (including acid-base balance, anion gap, electrolytes, and urine parameters) enables the rapid diagnosis of mixed acid-base disorders by analyzing the appropriateness of compensatory mechanisms, assessing changes in serum and urine electrolytes, and estimating urinary acid excretion. Eight cases are provided to illustrate the approach to mixed acid-base disturbances. Examples include mixed metabolic and respiratory acid-base disorders, mixed respiratory acid-base disorders, and mixed metabolic acid-base disorders.

### Metabolic alkalosis: a new red flag in status epilepticus [^116FQ4mK]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurological emergency with ongoing epileptic seizures. This condition is highly heterogeneous, and it is often described as a complication of other acute or chronic insults rather than a disease itself.

Prognosis in SE is highly variable, ranging from severe neurological disability to death. The outcome of SE is determined by the underlying disease but is also heavily influenced by the pathophysiological context in which it develops, including both factors independent from SE (such as age, comorbidities, concomitant therapy) and/or triggered by SE (such as organ, metabolic, and electrolytic dysfunctions). This bidirectional relationship makes prognostication particularly challenging.

It has been demonstrated that low brain and blood pH levels strongly suppress epileptic activity, while emerging evidence suggests that alkalosis may trigger febrile and hypoxic-related seizures. However, few studies have systematically examined acid–base disorders and their association with outcome in SE patients.

Notably, pH alterations are common in critically ill patients and can substantially impact patients' outcome. SE may cause multiple acid–base disturbances, including respiratory acidosis due to impaired respiratory function and metabolic acidosis from anaerobic muscle metabolism.

Our study aims to investigate acid–base disturbances in a large and heterogeneous SE population, examining the relationship between acid–base disorders, functional outcomes, and mortality.

### Metabolic acid-base disorders [^114xe442]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acid-base disturbances are frequently encountered in the emergency department, and many of these patients are critically ill. In the evaluation of patients with these maladies, it is important for the emergency clinician to determine the cause, which can usually be elicited from a thorough history and physical examination. There are several mnemonics that can be used to form an appropriate list of potential causes. Most of the time, the management of these patients requires no specific treatment of the acid-base status but, rather, requires treatment of the underlying disorder that is causing the acid-base disturbance.

### Empagliflozin-associated postoperative mixed metabolic acidosis. case report and review of pathogenesis [^111Yn5eY]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

SGLT2i block the SGLT2 co-transporter of sodium and glucose in the proximal tubule of the kidney, thereby reducing glucose reabsorption. This seemingly simple mechanism of action results in a new, somewhat unstable metabolic equilibrium with increased ketone bodies formation and their renal elimination. Precipitating factors such as surgery, acute illness, starvation or insulin deficiency can trigger highly complex metabolic and renal processes that can result in life-threatening metabolic acidosis (Fig. 1). Among the most important are increased ketogenesis, decreased renal ammoniogenesis and H + excretion, and decreased renal reabsorption of filtered ketones. As documented by our case, the term euglycemic ketoacidosis is somewhat misleading, as the major component of the acidosis may be hyperchloremic.

Increased ketogenesis

SGLT2i lowers blood glucose, leading to decreased insulin secretion and increased glucagon secretion. Similar to starvation, a low insulin-to-glucagon ratio stimulates lipolysis in adipocytes and ketone bodies formation and gluconeogenesis in the liver. However, concomitant stress related precipitants, some form of insulin deficiency or reduced caloric intake are required to promote ketogenesis. The two-hit hypothesis proposes that elevated stress-related hormones glucagon, cortisol and catecholamines stimulate ketogenesis in the setting of relative insulin deficiency due to low plasma glucose induced by SGLT2i.

Metabolic renal dysfunction

In the classic DKA, most of the acidosis can typically be explained by pure ketoacidosis with high anion gap. However, hyperchloremia may develop and even predominate in some patients later in the course of DKA, due to urinary loss of ketones and the treatment with normal saline. In contrast, patients with equally severe SGLT2i-associated acidosis had a markedly lower anion gap. Beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration varied substantially in several published cases. In our case, the anion gap was only 18 and the beta-hydroxybutyrate 3.2 mmol/l, despite pH of 6.85 and base excess − 29. Sampani reported a similar case with only a slightly elevated anion gap despite very low pH (Table 1). Compared with DKA, a concomitant metabolic renal dysfunction and slower development of ketosis modify the development of acidosis and enhance the hyperchloremic component. The main renal abnormalities associated with SGLT2i are impaired H + secretion in the proximal tubule, impaired ammoniogenesis and loss of ketoacid salts in the urine.

### Re-evaluation of the normal range of serum total COConcentration [^1173dXgA]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

A reliable determination of blood pH, PCO 2, and [HCO 3 -] is necessary for assessing the acid-base status of a patient. However, most acid-base disorders are first recognized through abnormalities in serum total CO 2 concentration ([TCO 2]) in venous blood, a surrogate for [HCO 3 -]. In screening patients on the basis of serum [TCO 2], we have been concerned about the wide limits of normal for serum [TCO 2], 10–13 mEq/L, reported by many clinical laboratories. Indeed, we have encountered patients with serum [TCO 2] values within the lower or upper end of the normal range of the reporting laboratory, who subsequently were shown to have a cardinal acid-base disorder. Here, we present a patient who had a serum [TCO 2] within the lower end of the normal range of the clinical laboratory, which resulted in delayed diagnosis of a clinically important "hidden" acid-base disorder. To better define the appropriate limits of normal for serum [TCO 2], we derived the expected normal range in peripheral venous blood in adults at sea level from carefully conducted acid-base studies. We then compared this range, 23 to 30 mEq/L, to that reported by 64 clinical laboratories, 2 large commercial clinical laboratories, and the major textbook of clinical chemistry. For the most part, the range in the laboratories we queried was substantially different than that we derived and that published in the textbook, with some laboratories reporting values as low as 18–20 mEq/L and as high as 33–35 mEq/L. We conclude that the limits of values of serum [TCO 2] reported by clinical laboratories are very often inordinately wide and not consistent with the range of normal expected in healthy individuals at sea level. We suggest that the limits of normal of serum [TCO 2] at sea level be tightened to 23–30 mEq/L. Such correction will ensure recognition of the majority of "hidden" acid-base disorders.

### Rising serum sodium levels are associated with a concurrent development of metabolic alkalosis in critically ill patients [^112FqqnL]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Changes in electrolyte homeostasis are important causes of acid-base disorders. While the effects of chloride are well studied, only little is known of the potential contributions of sodium to metabolic acid-base state. Thus, we investigated the effects of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired hypernatremia on acid-base state.

Methods

We included critically ill patients who developed hypernatremia, defined as a serum sodium concentration exceeding 149 mmol/L, after ICU admission in this retrospective study. Data on electrolyte and acid-base state in all included patients were gathered in order to analyze the effects of hypernatremia on metabolic acid-base state by use of the physical-chemical approach.

Results

A total of 51 patients were included in the study. The time of rising serum sodium and hypernatremia was accompanied by metabolic alkalosis. A transient increase in total base excess (standard base excess from 0.1 to 5.5 mmol/L) paralleled by a transient increase in the base excess due to sodium (base excess sodium from 0.7 to 4.1 mmol/L) could be observed. The other determinants of metabolic acid-base state remained stable. The increase in base excess was accompanied by a slight increase in overall pH (from 7.392 to 7.429, standard base excess from 0.1 to 5.5 mmol/L).

Conclusions

Hypernatremia is accompanied by metabolic alkalosis and an increase in pH. Given the high prevalence of hypernatremia, especially in critically ill patients, hypernatremic alkalosis should be part of the differential diagnosis of metabolic acid-base disorders.

### A patient with alcoholic ketoacidosis and profound lactemia [^115ZZEPS]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) is a complex syndrome that results from disrupted metabolism in the setting of excessive alcohol use and poor oral intake. Dehydration, glycogen depletion, high redox state, and release of stress hormones are the primary factors producing the characteristic anion gap metabolic acidosis with an elevated β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OH) and lactate.

Case Report

We present the case of a 47-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with metabolic acidosis and profoundly elevated lactate levels who had AKA. He recovered completely with intravenous fluids and parenteral glucose administration. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians should always consider the immediately life-threatening causes of a severe anion gap metabolic acidosis and treat aggressively based on the situation. This case highlights the fact that AKA can present with an impressively elevated lactate levels. Emergency physicians should keep AKA in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with a similar clinical picture.

### Severe metabolic or mixed acidemia on intensive care unit admission: incidence, prognosis and administration of buffer therapy. A prospective, multiple-center study [^113Zir6e]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Although acidosis is a common concern in critically ill patients, studies specifically assessing epidemiology and outcomes of severe acidemia are lacking. Indeed, to our knowledge, the current study is the first prospective, multiple-center investigation focused specifically on severe acidemia occurring in the ICU. Previous studies reported an incidence of acidemia ranging from 14% to 42%, but most of the patients in these studies experienced moderate acidemia with a mean base excess of -3. In a large, single-center study of 851 patients for whom arterial lactate levels were evaluated, the incidence of metabolic acidosis (defined by a standard base excess below -2 mmol/L) was 64%. In the present study, the incidence of metabolic or mixed severe acidemia was 6% (Figure 1).

The patients included in our study had a mean plasma pH of 7.09 ± 0.11 upon ICU admission. Those patients were defined as critically ill on the basis of their SAPS II and SOFA severity scores and the high rate of vasopressor prescription and mechanical ventilation (Table 1). Renal replacement therapy was initiated in 20% of these patients within the first 24 hours of their ICU stay. More than 50% of the patients died in the ICU (Tables 1 and 2). Upon ICU admission, only lactatemia and corrected anion gap could predict mortality (Figure 2). At day 1, plasma pH, bicarbonate and base excess were lower in nonsurvivors than in survivors (Figure 2). Our results are similar to those reported in a study describing acid-base disorders in 60 septic shock patients, among whom the survivors recovered from metabolic acidemia with correction of unmeasured anions and lactate, whereas nonsurvivors failed to do so. However, the authors in that study screened the patients according to the presence of septic shock rather than the presence and the severity of acid-base disorders and thus could not specifically assess the prognosis of acidotic patients. Another trial included unselected patients and showed that a base excess below -4 mmol/L upon ICU admission was associated with mortality. The association between base excess and mortality was magnified after 24 hours of intensive resuscitation, thus showing the importance of acid-base disorder correction clearance in the critically ill.

### Management of acute metabolic acidosis in the ICU: sodium bicarbonate and renal replacement therapy [^116Ks1ZT]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

How we manage metabolic acidosis in the ICU

Metabolic acidosis in critically ill patients is not a single disease but a syndrome driven by various underlying conditions. As such, the basic principle is to treat the underlying cause of metabolic acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate may be administered if there is a concern for the suppressed cardiac function that metabolic acidosis may cause. The rationale for using sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis is that the intravenous administration of a high SID solution would increase the pH, resulting in improved cardiac function.

The evidence on the biochemical effects of intravenous sodium bicarbonate in acute metabolic acidosis has been systematically reviewed. The summary of 12 relevant studies showed that pH, serum bicarbonate, base excess, serum sodium, and PaCO2 increased during and after the intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate. By contrast, serum anion gap and potassium decreased. Some concern was raised about intracellular acidosis due to the back-diffusion of CO2 and decreased ionized calcium that might impair cardiac contraction. However, there was no consistent evidence from the literature review that sodium bicarbonate administration was associated with decreased ionized calcium or decreased cardiac output.

### Severe metabolic or mixed acidemia on intensive care unit admission: incidence, prognosis and administration of buffer therapy. A prospective, multiple-center study [^114LpaWz]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

"Acidemia" can be defined as the accumulation of protons in the plasma which results in a lower blood pH if secondary responses are overwhelmed. In critically ill patients, acidosis is often the result of a combination of single disorders occurring simultaneously that are commonly known collectively as "mixed acid-base disorders".

Although "severe acidemia" is not a universally accepted term, it usually indicates that plasma pH is lower than 7.20. Severe acidemia can be critical, especially when an extremely low pH develops quickly. Clinical manifestations of severe acidemia include cerebral edema, seizures, diaphragm dysfunction, decreased myocardial contractility, pulmonary vasoconstriction and systemic vasodilatation. Acidemia is a potentially life-threatening condition, and previous studies have described the incidence and mechanisms of acidosis occurring in the ICU. Surprisingly, however, these studies failed to focus specifically on severe acidemia. Furthermore, despite the fact that severe acidemia reflects a serious underlying disease that should be treated as soon as possible, the treatment of acidemia by itself with the administration of intravenous buffers remains controversial. Indeed, notwithstanding experts' opinions arguing against treatment with intravenous buffers except in dedicated situations (for example, massive digestive fluid loss during diarrhea or tubular acidosis), 86% of polled US nephrologists indicated that they would prescribe buffers to treat lactic acidosis in patients with a targeted pH above 7.20. Moreover, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggests not treating lactic acidosis when the plasma pH level is above 7.15, but does not give any recommendations for cases where the plasma pH level is below this threshold. To date there have been only two small, prospective, randomized crossover studies assessing the impact of sodium bicarbonate treatment for lactic acidosis on hemodynamic, acid-base and electrolyte changes. Both studies included 24 patients and could not address any difference in terms of morbidity and mortality with regard to whether the patients had first been treated with sodium bicarbonate.

Therefore, we had two aims in our study. First, we sought to describe the incidence of severely metabolic or mixed acidemia patients admitted to the ICU. Second, we wanted to describe the outcomes of patients who had been treated at the onset of acidemia (within the first 24 hours of ICU admission) with intravenous sodium bicarbonate compared with those who had not. We hypothesized that severe acidosis within the 24 first hours after ICU admission is an infrequent phenomenon but that its correction rather than its initial severity is associated with prognosis.

### Severe metabolic alkalosis and recurrent acute on chronic kidney injury in a patient with Crohn's disease [^112WzTiY]. BMC Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Diarrhea is common in patients with Crohn's disease and may be accompanied by acid base disorders, most commonly metabolic acidosis due to intestinal loss of bicarbonate.

Case Presentation

Here, we present a case of severe metabolic alkalosis in a young patient suffering from M. Crohn. The patient had undergone multiple resections of the intestine and suffered from chronic kidney disease. He was now referred to our clinic for recurrent acute kidney injury, the nature of which was pre-renal due to profound volume depletion. Renal failure was associated with marked hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis which only responded to high volume repletion and high dose blockade of gastric hypersecretion. Intestinal failure with stomal fluid losses of up to 5.7 litres per day required port implantation to commence parenteral nutrition. Fluid and electrolyte replacement rapidly improved renal function and acid base homeostasis.

Conclusions

This case highlights the important role of gastrointestinal function to maintain acid base status in patients with Crohn's disease.

### Use of the deltaAG / deltaHCO3-ratio in the diagnosis of mixed acid-base disorders [^112ddQVR]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

When a strong acid is added to plasma, one expects a quantitative relationship between excess anion gap (ΔAG) and bicarbonate deficit (ΔHCO₃⁻) with the ΔAG/ΔHCO₃⁻ ratio close to unity. If true, then this ratio could be used to diagnose mixed acid-base disorders in patients with metabolic acidosis. Although the mean ratio in selected patients is close to unity, this ratio also has a wide range, making its use in individual patients problematic. The ratio should therefore be used cautiously in making a diagnosis of mixed acid-base disorders.

### Metabolic acidosis: pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^1117qBur]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a primary reduction in serum bicarbonate (HCO(3)(-)) concentration, a secondary decrease in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) of approximately 1 mmHg for every 1 mmol/l fall in serum HCO(3)(-) concentration, and a reduction in blood pH. Acute forms (lasting minutes to several days) and chronic forms (lasting weeks to years) of the disorder can occur, for which the underlying cause/s and resulting adverse effects may differ. Acute forms of metabolic acidosis most frequently result from the overproduction of organic acids such as ketoacids or lactic acid; by contrast, chronic metabolic acidosis often reflects bicarbonate wasting and/or impaired renal acidification. The calculation of the serum anion gap, calculated as [Na⁺] − ([HCO₃⁻] + [Cl⁻]), aids diagnosis by classifying the disorders into categories of normal (hyperchloremic) anion gap or elevated anion gap. These categories can overlap, however. Adverse effects of acute metabolic acidosis primarily include decreased cardiac output, arterial dilatation with hypotension, altered oxygen delivery, decreased ATP production, predisposition to arrhythmias, and impairment of the immune response. The main adverse effects of chronic metabolic acidosis are increased muscle degradation and abnormal bone metabolism. Using base to treat acute metabolic acidosis is controversial because of a lack of definitive benefit and because of potential complications. By contrast, the administration of base for the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis is associated with improved cellular function and few complications.

### Metabolic alkalosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment: core curriculum 2022 [^1138uDrj]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A gain of base or a loss of acid from extracellular fluid is fundamental to the pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis. The loss of acid may be via the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or by the kidney. Excess base may accumulate from oral or parenteral bicarbonate (HCO 3 −) administration or by lactate, acetate, or citrate supplementation. The loss of acid from the GI tract or the kidney is directly coupled to the generation of intracellular HCO 3 −, which is then transported to the blood, thus increasing the blood HCO 3 − concentration and pH.

The kidney is well equipped to eliminate excess HCO 3 − in order to maintain systemic acid-base status within a narrow physiological range. Any increase in blood HCO 3 − concentration (generation phase) will elicit a series of adaptive mechanisms that enhance HCO 3 − excretion by the kidney. Thus, significant metabolic alkalosis will not persist so long as the kidney's ability to enhance HCO 3 − excretion remains intact irrespective of the source of new HCO 3 −.

The pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis encompasses 2 distinct phases, generation and maintenance, first conceptualized by Seldin in 1972 although there may be some overlap in certain disease states. The generation phase is defined as the period that is manifested by the initial loss of H + (acid) and chloride (Cl −) either through the GI tract (eg, via vomiting) or via the kidney (eg, from chloruretic diuretics). The maintenance phase refers to the period when the active loss of acid has subsided or is subsiding (ie, the vomiting or diuretic usage has stopped), but metabolic alkalosis persists due to impairment of kidney HCO 3 − excretion. The correction (recovery) phase follows the maintenance phase and is achieved when the existing volume and electrolyte deficits (hypokalemia and hypochloremia) are corrected and the inciting event (GI or kidney acid loss) is treated. This installment of the AJKD Core Curriculum in Nephrology will try to incorporate the knowledge gained on this topic over the last 6 decades into a comprehensive description of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of metabolic alkalosis.

To better understand the underlying mechanisms facilitating the generation, maintenance, or recovery from metabolic alkalosis, a detailed understanding of pathways and molecules regulating acid secretion and HCO 3 − reabsorption in kidney tubules is essential. This issue will be discussed in the following section.

### Acid-base interpretation: a practical approach [^113XiPyq]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acid-base disorders are prevalent in critically ill patients, and a systematic approach is essential for evaluation. The first step is to determine the primary process based on a patient's pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and bicarbonate measurements. After this is complete, the next step is to evaluate for respiratory or metabolic compensation. Deviations from expected compensation may indicate additional acid-base processes. For metabolic acidosis, anion gap calculation distinguishes between anion gap metabolic acidosis and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. The evaluation for anion gap metabolic acidosis includes calculating the osmolal gap and conducting a gap-gap analysis. Evaluating non-anion gap metabolic acidosis involves urine anion gap calculation. These analyses identify potential etiologies and additional acid-base disturbances. Metabolic alkalosis assessment begins with measuring urine chloride levels to determine whether the process is a result of chloride depletion. Respiratory acidosis, caused by hypoventilation, often results from chronic lung disease or neuromuscular dysfunction. Respiratory alkalosis, due to hyperventilation, is common in sepsis, chronic liver disease, and acute pulmonary embolism.

### Severe hyperlactatemia with normal base excess: a quantitative analysis using conventional and stewart approaches [^112HcoT4]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Twenty percent of critically ill patients have severe hyperlactatemia with normal pH, [HCO 3 -], and [BE] levels because of a concomitant presence of hypochloremic alkalosis.

- As previously shown, both the conventional and Stewart approaches allow the correct identification of mixed metabolic acidosis and alkalosis.

- The evaluation of plasma chloride and the difference between the changes in the anion gap and bicarbonate should always be considered for a correct diagnosis of acid–base disorders.

### Profound metabolic acidosis and oxoprolinuria in an adult [^113qVTBY]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Profound metabolic acidosis in critically ill adults sometimes remains unexplained despite extensive evaluation.

Case Report

A 58-year-old female presented in a confused state to the emergency department; she had been confused for several days. Laboratory evaluation revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis and modestly elevated acetaminophen level. Lactic acid was only modestly elevated. There was no evidence of ketoacids, salicylate, methanol, or ethylene glycol. A urine sample submitted on day 1 of hospitalization revealed a markedly elevated level of 5-oxoproline.

Discussion

Originally described in children with an inherited defect of glutathione synthetase, 5-oxoproline is an unusual cause of metabolic acidosis. More recently this disturbance has been recognized in critically ill adults without a recognized inherited metabolic disorder. In most of these cases there has been the concomitant use of acetaminophen. Any causal relationship between acetaminophen and this disturbance is speculative.

Conclusion

In critically ill adults with unexplained metabolic acidosis, 5-Oxoproline should be considered in the differential.

Bicarbonate therapy — randomized trial evidence in severe metabolic acidemia: In a multicenter RCT, 400 patients with severe metabolic acidemia (pH ≤ 7.20) were randomized to IV 4.2% sodium bicarbonate targeting arterial pH 7.3 or control, with no between-group difference in the composite of 28-day mortality and organ failure at day 7; hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, and metabolic alkalosis were more frequent with bicarbonate. In the AKI subgroup (AKIN stage 2 or 3 at randomization; 182/389 [47%]), mortality was lower with bicarbonate versus control (42/92 [46%] vs 57/90 [63%]; absolute risk reduction −17% [−33.0 to −2.3]; p = 0.016), with significant heterogeneity versus AKIN 0–1 (p = 0.023). Sepsis was present in 61% (238/389) and no differential effect was observed by sepsis status.

### Approach to patients with acid-base disorders [^115qZBqk]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Disorders of acid-base balance are commonly encountered in clinical practice and can have a substantial impact on the prognosis of the patient. Moreover, identification of a particular acid-base disturbance can provide a clue to an underlying disorder. Proper evaluation and treatment of acid-base disorders requires a systematic and analytic approach including: (1) assess the accuracy of the acid-base values using the Henderson equation or Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, (2) obtain a complete history and physical examination, (3) calculate the serum anion gap, (4) identify the primary acid-base disturbance and determine whether a simple or mixed disturbance is present, (5) examine serum electrolytes and additional laboratory data, and (6) measure urine pH and urine electrolytes and calculate the urine anion and osmolal gaps. Strict adherence to these principles will enable the clinician to diagnose the acid-base disturbance in the majority of cases. To illustrate these principles, 5 cases of patients with acid-base disturbances are analyzed.

### Association between delta anion gap / delta bicarbonate and outcome of surgical patients admitted to intensive care unit [^114Waxtf]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The maintenance of the acid-base balance during the perioperative period is vital to maintain homeostasis of diverse physiological conditions which have direct implication on surgical outcome. Metabolic acidosis (MA) developed both intraoperatively and postoperatively has been associated with worse clinical outcomes with significantly increased mortality and morbidity. The rapid transition to an acidic milieu engenders disruptions in coagulation, oxygen delivery, vasopressor-receptor coupling, and intracellular signaling, thus culminating in the onset of organ dysfunction among surgical patients.

Surgical and critically ill patients are at higher risk to develop MA with increased anion gap (AG) or with normal AG (hyperchloremic). A common cause of high AG MA in the perioperative period is increased lactate due to tissue malperfusion. Conversely, in these populations, hyperchloremic acidosis arises as a prevalent consequence of chloride-rich solutions employed for volume replacement, a measure to avert tissue damage. Both forms are associated with increased 30-day mortality and organ dysfunction. Nevertheless, MA may be accompanied by other acid-base disorders. One way to assess such disorders is to calculate the delta anion gap ratio (delta-delta), which is ratio between AG increase above expected AG to the decrease in bicarbonate ion (Bic) below the baseline (delta-AG/delta-Bic = ΔAG / ΔHCO3 –). The relationship between the increase in AG and the change in bicarbonate is effective in identifying mixed disorders in metabolic acidosis, however, it should be used in conjunction with other clinical and laboratory parameters to correctly diagnose underlining disorders in metabolic acidosis, further exploration is required to investigate the utility of delta-AG/delta-Bic in identifying acid-base disorders among surgical patients experiencing metabolic acidosis and its potential implications on prognostic outcomes.

This prospective multicentre study focuses on patients undergoing high-risk surgical interventions and aims to characterize MA using the delta-AG/delta-Bic classification to evaluate the possible presence of subgroups of patients with elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis and mixed disorders. The study examines outcomes within the first 24 h after surgery and analyses how these findings correlate with 30-day mortality and other clinically significant outcomes.

### Disorders of acid-base balance [^117Ssqmy]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Intensivists spend much of their time managing problems related to fluids, electrolytes, and blood pH. Recent advances in the understanding of acid-base physiology have resulted from the application of basic physical-chemical principles of aqueous solutions to blood plasma. All changes in blood pH, in health and in disease, occur through changes in three variables: carbon dioxide, relative electrolyte concentrations, and total weak acid concentrations. However, while this quantitative approach has enjoyed widespread use among researchers, clinicians are reluctant to employ it. Recent advances have brought a measure of parity between the newer and the older, descriptive approach to acid-base physiology.

Data Synthesis

Case-based review of the literature.

Conclusion

Both quantitative and traditional approaches can be easily combined to result in a powerful tool for bedside acid-base analysis.

### Circulating anions usually associated with the krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis [^111CMi7g]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

We have shown that the concentration of anions normally associated with the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle are elevated in appreciable quantities in patients with a metabolic acidosis. We propose that they may play a significant role in generating the anion gap. Further work in this laboratory is currently underway to explore the clinical implications of these findings.

### Acid-base patterns in acute severe asthma [^117G4Bhy]. The Journal of Asthma (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Acid-base status in acute severe asthma (ASA) remains undefined; some studies report complete absence of metabolic acidosis, whereas others describe it as present in one fourth of patients or more. Conclusion discrepancies would therefore appear to derive from differences in assessment methodology. Only a systematic approach centering on patient clinical findings can correctly establish true acid-base disorder prevalence levels.

Methods

This study examines acid-base patterns in ASA (314 patients), taking into account both natural history of disease and treatment, in patients free of other diseases altering acid-base status. Data were collected from patients admitted for ASA without prior history of chronic bronchitis, emphysema, kidney or liver disease, heart failure, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or gastrointestinal illness. Informed consent was obtained for all patients, after study protocol approval by the Institutional Review Board.

Results

Arterial blood gases, plasma electrolytes, lactate levels, and FEV(1) were measured on arrival. Severe airway obstruction was found with FEV(1) values of 25.6 ± 10.0%, substantial hypoxemia (PaO(2) 66.1 ± 11.9mmHg) and increased A-a O(2) gradient (39.3 ± 12.3mmHg) breathing room air. While respiratory alkalosis occurred in patients with better preservation of FEV1, respiratory acidosis was observed with more severe airway obstruction, as was increased lactate in the majority of patients, independent of PaO(2) and PaCO(2) levels.

Conclusions

Predominant acid-base patterns observed in ASA in this patient population included primary hypocapnia, or less frequently, primary hypercapnia. Lactic acidosis occurred in 11% of patients and presented consistently as a mixed acid-base disorder. These findings suggest lactic acidosis results from the combined effects of both ASA and medication-related sympathetic effects.

Bicarbonate therapy — recommendations in adults with septic shock: For hypoperfusion-induced lactic acidemia, we suggest against using sodium bicarbonate therapy to improve hemodynamics or to reduce vasopressor requirements (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence), and the narrative specifies this applies to pH ≥ 7.15. For severe metabolic acidemia (pH ≤ 7.2) with acute kidney injury (AKI) defined by AKI Network (AKIN) score 2 or 3, we suggest using sodium bicarbonate therapy (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### Bench-to-bedside review: treating acid-base abnormalities in the intensive care unit – the role of renal replacement therapy [^115rU9ad]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Acid-base disorders are common in critically ill patients. Metabolic acid-base disorders are particularly common in patients who require acute renal replacement therapy. In these patients, metabolic acidosis is common and multifactorial in origin. Analysis of acid-base status using the Stewart-Figge methodology shows that these patients have greater acidemia despite the presence of hypoalbuminemic alkalosis. This acidemia is mostly secondary to hyperphosphatemia, hyperlactatemia, and the accumulation of unmeasured anions. Once continuous hemofiltration is started, profound changes in acid-base status are rapidly achieved. They result in the progressive resolution of acidemia and acidosis, with a lowering of concentrations of phosphate and unmeasured anions. However, if lactate-based dialysate or replacement fluid are used, then in some patients hyperlactatemia results, which decreases the strong ion difference and induces an iatrogenic metabolic acidosis. Such hyperlactatemic acidosis is particularly marked in lactate-intolerant patients (shock with lactic acidosis and/or liver disease) and is particularly strong if high-volume hemofiltration is performed with the associated high lactate load, which overcomes the patient's metabolic capacity for lactate. In such patients, bicarbonate dialysis seems desirable. In all patients, once hemofiltration is established, it becomes the dominant force in controlling metabolic acid-base status and, in stable patients, it typically results in a degree of metabolic alkalosis. The nature and extent of these acid-base changes is governed by the intensity of plasma water exchange/dialysis and by the 'buffer' content of the replacement fluid/dialysate, with different effects depending on whether lactate, acetate, citrate, or bicarbonate is used. These effects can be achieved in any patient irrespective of whether they have acute renal failure, because of the overwhelming effect of plasma water exchange on nonvolatile acid balance. Critical care physicians must understand the nature, origin, and magnitude of alterations in acid-base status seen with acute renal failure and during continuous hemofiltration if they wish to provide their patients with safe and effective care.

Guideline 6: Electrolytes — monitoring and evaluation for acid-base interventions in CKD reports that trials show expected acid-base changes with serum bicarbonate monitoring, beneficial biomarker effects from fruits and vegetables at doses that reduce dietary acid by 50%, and generally favorable effects of oral bicarbonate on biomarkers; hyperkalemia was not observed in one fruit-and-vegetable intervention series. The guideline states, "Clinical trials have demonstrated adherence with expected changes in acid-base status as evaluated by measurement of serum bicarbonate". It notes, "Consuming fruits and vegetables in the amount that could reduce dietary acid by 50% generally had positive effects on acid-base biomarkers", with fruits and vegetables that "increased plasma total CO2 (though not significant in 1 study) and decreased potential renal acid load and 8-hour net acid excretion". It further indicates, "Except for Goraya et al214* (0.5 mEq/kg per day), oral bicarbonate supplements also had positive effects on acid-base biomarkers by increasing plasma total CO2 or bicarbonate levels and decreasing potential renal acid load and 8-hour net acid excretion". Finally, it reports, "No hyperkalemia events were noted in the studies of Goraya et al,212, who provided a diet rich in fruits and vegetables to patients with advanced CKD".

### Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: a clinical approach to Evaluation [^114PbRS8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Acid-base disturbances can result from kidney or nonkidney disorders. We present a case of high-volume ileostomy output causing large bicarbonate losses and resulting in a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis can present as a form of either acute or chronic metabolic acidosis. A complete clinical history and physical examination are critical initial steps to begin the evaluation process, followed by measuring serum electrolytes with a focus on potassium level, blood gas, urine pH, and either direct or indirect urine ammonium concentration. The present case was selected to highlight the differential diagnosis of a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis and illustrate a systematic approach to this problem.

### Metabolic acidosis in the critically ill: part 2. causes and treatment [^114iHNUk]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

The correct identification of the cause, and ideally the individual acid, responsible for metabolic acidosis in the critically ill ensures rational management. In Part 2 of this review, we examine the elevated (corrected) anion gap acidoses (lactic, ketones, uraemic and toxin ingestion) and contrast them with nonelevated conditions (bicarbonate wasting, renal tubular acidoses and iatrogenic hyperchloraemia) using readily available base excess and anion gap techniques. The potentially erroneous interpretation of elevated lactate signifying cell ischaemia is highlighted. We provide diagnostic and therapeutic guidance when faced with a high anion gap acidosis, for example pyroglutamate, in the common clinical scenario 'I can't identify the acid — but I know it's there'. The evidence that metabolic acidosis affects outcomes and thus warrants correction is considered and we provide management guidance including extracorporeal removal and fomepizole therapy.

### Clinical review: the meaning of acid-base abnormalities in the intensive care unit part I-epidemiology [^116P9Tog]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Acid-base abnormalities are common in critically ill patients. Our ability to describe acid-base disorders must be precise. Small differences in corrections for anion gap, different types of analytical processes, and the basic approach used to diagnose acid-base aberrations can lead to markedly different interpretations and treatment strategies for the same disorder. By applying a quantitive acid-base approach, clinicians are able to account for small changes in ion distribution that may have gone unrecognized with traditional techniques of acid-base analysis. Outcome prediction based on the quantitative approach remains controversial. This is in part due to use of various technologies to measure acid-base variables, administration of fluid or medication that can alter acid-base results, and lack of standardized nomenclature. Without controlling for these factors it is difficult to appreciate the full effect that acid-base disorders have on patient outcomes, ultimately making results of outcome studies hard to compare.

### Clinical efficacy of sodium bicarbonate in treating pediatric metabolic acidosis with varying level of acid-base balance parameters: a real-world study [^115v6kRS]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In this study, a high proportion of patients with mild metabolic acidosis and a high proportion of patients with mild metabolic acidosis were given SB treatment. However, the clinical efficacy of SB treatment was found to potentially be associated with the patient's Cl − level, whether it was mild or moderate to severe. In patients with moderate to severe metabolic acidosis at lower Cl − level, the mortality was increased in SB treatment patients. It should be noted that the increased risk of death was not statistically significant, possibly due to the small sample size of this subgroup. A high proportion of patients with mild metabolic acidosis were given SB treatment, and we infer that this is because (1) in China, the guidelines for SB treatment are vague for patients with mild metabolic acidosis, and the concept that SB treatment is only appropriate for moderate to severe patients is not widely recognized; (2) when a patient experiences mild metabolic acidosis, but the condition may continue to deteriorate due to continuous loss of extracellular fluid, doctors may administer small doses of SB treatment as a preventative measure; and (3) the patient's base excess level is also a factor considered by doctors, as guided by SB China's medication package insert. For example, in cases of lactic acidemia, mild metabolic acidosis may occur, but if the patient's base excess is lower than the normal value, then the doctor may choose to give SB treatment.

In the overall sample analysis, our study did not find a significant correlation between SB treatment and the risk of death in patients with metabolic acidosis, which is consistent with the findings of other studies. This suggests that the patient samples used in this study are similar to those used in prior studies. Additionally, it supports the rationality of the results observed in this study; namely, the bidirectional effect offsets the increased and reduced risk of death brought about by SB treatment in the overall sample. Among the studies we reviewed, only Fujii et al. reported Cl − values in patients with metabolic acidosis and suggested that SB treatment had no association with mortality. The median value of Cl − in their study falls within the non-correlated interval identified in our study. In another retrospective study of SB treatment in patients with lactic acidosis, the results showed that the administration of sodium bicarbonate was associated with higher mortality rates. Interestingly, we found that the average AG value of patients included in that study was 19.76, which supports our finding that SB treatment increase mortality risk in patients with higher AG levels (corresponding to lower Cl − levels).

### Use of anion gap in the evaluation of a patient with metabolic acidosis [^113JDFth]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

High anion gap (AG) metabolic acidosis, a common laboratory abnormality encountered in clinical practice, frequently is due to accumulation of organic acids such as lactic acid, keto acids, alcohol metabolites, and reduced kidney function. The cause of high AG metabolic acidosis often is established easily using historical and simple laboratory data. Despite this, several challenges in the diagnosis and management of high AG metabolic acidosis remain, including quantifying the increase in AG, understanding the relationship between changes in AG and serum bicarbonate level, and identifying the cause of high AG metabolic acidosis when common causes are ruled out. The present case was selected to highlight the importance of the correction of AG for serum albumin level, the use of actual baseline AG rather than mean normal AG, the relationship between changes in serum bicarbonate level and AG, and a systematic diagnostic approach to uncommon causes of high AG metabolic acidosis, such as 5-oxoproline acidosis (pyroglutamic acidosis).

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^115bjeSL]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) guideline states that the KDIGO definition and staging criteria are "appropriate for defining the epidemiology of AKI and in the design of clinical trials", but concludes "there is insufficient evidence to support their widespread application to clinical care in the United States". The panel "generally concurred with the remainder of the KDIGO guidelines that are focused on the prevention and pharmacologic and dialytic management of AKI", while emphasizing "the dearth of clinical trial evidence to provide strong evidence-based recommendations" and "the continued absence of effective therapies beyond hemodynamic optimization and avoidance of nephrotoxins for the prevention and treatment of AKI". For clinical context, AKI "represents the sudden loss of kidney function, generally occurring over the course of hours to days and resulting in the retention of metabolic waste products and the development of volume overload and electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities".

### Severe hyperlactatemia with normal base excess: a quantitative analysis using conventional and stewart approaches [^1174moyF]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

In a study of patients admitted to the ICU after cardiac arrest, lactic acidosis was the most frequent disorder. Its effects on the pH, however, were attenuated by the presence of a metabolic alkalosis caused by hypochloremia and hypoalbuminemia. The authors explained these findings by extravascular passage of albumin, and pre-existing disease.

The presence of metabolic acidosis in critical patients has prognostic implications. Gunnerson and colleagues recently demonstrated that patients with metabolic acidosis ([BE] < -2 mmol/l) had a higher mortality rate than those without this disorder (45% versus 25%). Similarly, patients with lactic acidosis had higher mortality than those with hyperchloremic acidosis (56% versus 29%). Nevertheless, it is not clear whether differences in outcome are dependent on the process that produces metabolic acidosis or on the acidosis itself.

Although our two groups of patients had quite different pH values, their mortality was not different. A possible explanation for this observation might be that the severity of critical illness, as evaluated by the Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation II and Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment scores, was similar in both groups. Recent data showed that metabolic acid–base variables had a poor discriminating ability for predicting mortality in a general ICU population. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves for acid–base parameters were significantly lower than that of the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score. Nevertheless, a higher number of patients are required to confirm that the presence of acidemia itself does not worsen the outcome.

The present study has some limitations. The study is observational, aimed at describing the incidence of severe hyperlactatemia with normal [BE] and quantifying its underlying acid–base alterations. Nevertheless, patients were only evaluated on ICU admission. Serial measurements might have allowed a more comprehensive understanding of the acid–base disorders and allowed better insights into the mechanisms of acid–base disorders.

### Topiramate (eprontia) [^117DDyR5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

EPRONTIA can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by EPRONTIA. EPRONTIA induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of EPRONTIA.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with topiramate in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to ≤ 2% for placebo.

### Metabolic acidosis and the progression of chronic kidney disease [^113HJS1L]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology leading to acidosis in CKD

Under normal conditions, the extracellular H + concentration is tightly regulated and varies little from the normal value of approximately 40 nanomol/L. Regulation of acid–base homeostasis involves three basic steps: chemical buffering by extracellular and intracellular buffers, alteration of alveolar ventilation, and changes in renal H + excretion. The kidneys regulate H + excretion by reabsorbing filtered HCO 3 − and generating new HCO 3 − in response to various stimuli. Secreted H + combine with urinary buffers such as HPO 4 2− and ammonia. In CKD the reduction in functioning nephrons causes defects in renal excretion of acid, mainly in the form of ammonium. A fraction of patients may have inappropriate bicarbonate wasting in the urine.

The acidosis in CKD usually remains relatively stable. In uncomplicated acidosis, the serum bicarbonate levels typically are > 12 mEq/L and blood pH is > 7.2. There are two general possibilities for this stabilization of serum bicarbonate levels. One is that after an initial period of acid retention, the excretion and production of acid equalize. The other possibility is that acidosis evokes extrarenal mechanisms that dispose of the endogenous acid not excreted in the urine. The major source of such buffering would be base derived from bone. Carefully conducted balance studies in CKD patients with acidosis found a positive acid balance of approximately 10–20 mEq per day and negative calcium balance that improved with correction of acidosis. However, the degree of acid retention has been debated, with the suggestion that these findings resulted from systematic measurement error. While the magnitude of acid retention may be less than reported, it seems likely that acid production does exceed excretion in the setting of chronic renal acidosis.

The acidosis in mild to moderate CKD is predominantly hyperchloremic, with an increased anion gap observed variably and generally only with advanced CKD. However, accounting for changes in serum albumin and other electrolytes in the anion gap calculation reveals a slightly more nuanced view. This maneuver reveals minor elevations in the anion gap, which are associated with decrements in serum bicarbonate, even in the CKD stage 2 eGFR range. Although small, these differences in anion gap are independently associated with mortality. Thus, there may be low-level accumulation of organic solutes even when the GFR is relatively preserved that partially accounts for changes in the serum bicarbonate level.

### Zonisamide [^115vKWcS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic Acidosis:

Zonisamide causes hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis) (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests subsection). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to the inhibitory effect of zonisamide on carbonic anhydrase. Generally, zonisamide-induced metabolic acidosis occurs early in treatment, but it can develop at any time during treatment. Metabolic acidosis generally appears to be dose-dependent and can occur at doses as low as 25 mg daily.

Conditions or therapies that predispose to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of zonisamide.

Some manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae including cardiac arrhythmias or stupor. Chronic, untreated, metabolic acidosis may increase the risk for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. Nephrolithiasis has been observed in the clinical development program in 4% of adults treated with zonisamide, has also been detected by renal ultrasound in 8% of pediatric treated patients who had at least one ultrasound prospectively collected, and was reported as an adverse event in 3% (4/133) of pediatric patients (see PRECAUTIONS, Kidney Stones subsection). Metabolic acidosis can also increase the risk for hyperammonemia, particularly in the presence of drugs which can cause hyperammonemia.

In this situation, chloride concentration is decreased by 5 mmol/L and pH is 7.47. Other electrolytes and PCO 2 have normal values. HCO 3 − concentration is increased to 29 mmol/L and BE is + 5 mmol/L. This is an example of isolated metabolic alkalosis, which can frequently be observed in case of persistent vomiting or after administration of loop diuretics.

In this situation, lactate concentration is increased by 10 mmol/L and sodium concentration is increased by 10 mmol/L due to the administration of NaHCO 3. Other electrolytes and PCO 2 have normal values. As the increase in cations is equal to the increase in anions, no other change in electrolytes is required to fulfill the electroneutrality principle, i.e. HCO 3 − concentration is unaffected (24 mmol/L) and pH is 7.40. Therefore, two acid–base disorders co-exist and cancel each other out. Consequently, the calculated SBE is 0 mmol/L. Of note, the columns are higher than normal, underlining the fact that sodium-bicarbonate administration causes an increase in osmolarity. E Hyponatremia, hypochloremia and ketoacids. In this situation, sodium and chloride concentrations are reduced by 20 and 30 mmol/L, respectively. At the same time, 10 mmol/L of ketoacids are present. Also in this case, variations in strong cations and anions cancel out each other and, assuming a normal PCO 2 of 40 mmHg, normal values of pH and HCO 3 − are expected, leading to a normal SBE of 0 mmol/L. This acid–base derangement can be observed in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, where electrolyte losses due to persistent vomiting can coexist with hypovolemia and starvation ketoacidosis.

### Cerebrospinal fluid and arterial acid-base equilibrium of spontaneously breathing patients with aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^113QyNGy]. Neurocritical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, we used the physicochemical approach to acid–base to describe the acid–base characteristics of both arterial blood and CSF of spontaneously breathing patients with SAH and compared these results with those of a control population, i.e. healthy, spontaneously breathing patients undergoing elective surgery under spinal anesthesia. The main finding of our study was that patients with SAH had lower CSF SID, mainly due to an increased concentration of lactate. Arterial SID did not differ between the two populations. Therefore, when blood SID was subtracted from CSF SID (ΔSID), significantly different values were observed in patients with SAH and controls (Fig. 1). This finding clearly points toward a primary metabolic acid–base disorder caused by intracranial bleeding and compartmentalized in the cerebral/CSF environment. Despite the acidifying effect of a reduced CSF SID, CSF pH was similar in the two populations, as CSF PCO 2 was significantly reduced in patients with SAH. The respiratory compensation of this local metabolic acidosis led to blood HA in 40% of the SAH population.

Isolated CSF acidosis has been induced in several animal models by directly injecting acids into the ventricular system. In these studies, local CSF acidification triggered the respiratory chemoreceptors and caused an increase in minute ventilation to restore CSF pH through a reduction in CSF PCO 2. Given the anatomical and functional separation between blood and CSF, the acids injected locally did not reach the bloodstream, which was therefore unaffected by the acid–base disorder. Consequently, the compensatory hyperventilation corrected CSF pH and led to a systemic HA of the blood.

Although the presence of HA frequently characterizes patients with cerebrovascular conditions, only a few reports investigated the underlying mechanisms. We hypothesized that a local CSF metabolic acidosis, i.e. a reduction in CSF SID, could partially explain the finding. We therefore studied the blood/CSF electrolytes and acid–base of healthy patients undergoing spinal anesthesia and considered these data, for the present study, as baseline values, i.e. normal reference values before the SAH.

### The serum anion gap in the evaluation of acid-base disorders: what are its limitations and can its effectiveness be improved? [^111MVjpb]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The serum anion gap has been utilized to identify errors in the measurement of electrolytes, to detect paraproteins, and, most relevant to the nephrologist, to evaluate patients with suspected acid-base disorders. In regard to the latter purpose, traditionally an increased anion gap is identified when it exceeds the upper limit of normal for a particular clinical laboratory measurement. However, because there is a wide range of normal values (often 8–10 mEq/L), an increase in anion concentration can be present in the absence of an increased anion gap. In addition, the type of retained anion can affect the magnitude of the increase in anion gap relative to change in serum [HCO3(-)] being greater with lactic acidosis compared with ketoacidosis. This review examines the methods of calculation of the serum anion gap in textbooks and published literature, the effect of perturbations other than changes in acid-base balance, and its effectiveness in identifying mild and more severe disturbances in acid-base balance. Limitations of the present methods of determining the normal anion gap and change in the anion gap are highlighted. The possibility of identifying the baseline value for individuals to optimize the use of the calculation in the detection of metabolic acidosis is suggested.

### Acid-base disorders in liver disease [^113ETRKi]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Alongside the kidneys and lungs, the liver has been recognised as an important regulator of acid-base homeostasis. While respiratory alkalosis is the most common acid-base disorder in chronic liver disease, various complex metabolic acid-base disorders may occur with liver dysfunction. While the standard variables of acid-base equilibrium, such as pH and overall base excess, often fail to unmask the underlying cause of acid-base disorders, the physical-chemical acid-base model provides a more in-depth pathophysiological assessment for clinical judgement of acid-base disorders, in patients with liver diseases. Patients with stable chronic liver disease have several offsetting acidifying and alkalinising metabolic acid-base disorders. Hypoalbuminaemic alkalosis is counteracted by hyperchloraemic and dilutional acidosis, resulting in a normal overall base excess. When patients with liver cirrhosis become critically ill (e.g., because of sepsis or bleeding), this fragile equilibrium often tilts towards metabolic acidosis, which is attributed to lactic acidosis and acidosis due to a rise in unmeasured anions. Interestingly, even though patients with acute liver failure show significantly elevated lactate levels, often, no overt acid-base disorder can be found because of the offsetting hypoalbuminaemic alkalosis. In conclusion, patients with liver diseases may have multiple co-existing metabolic acid-base abnormalities. Thus, knowledge of the pathophysiological and diagnostic concepts of acid-base disturbances in patients with liver disease is critical for therapeutic decision making.

### Association between delta anion gap / delta bicarbonate and outcome of surgical patients admitted to intensive care unit [^114kLQHq]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective multicentre observational study, during the postoperative period, the presence of metabolic acidosis demonstrated an inverse relationship with survival in high-risk surgical patients, particularly in cases where metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap. When examining patients with metabolic acidosis and concurrent mixed disorders, the application of the Delta-AG/delta-Bic calculation revealed distinct outcomes. Specifically, patients experiencing metabolic acidosis without accompanying mixed disorders displayed high risk to ICU mortality and an increased occurrence of postoperative complications, as opposed to those presenting with a combination of hyperchloremia or alkalosis.

Our findings are consistent with those observed in our prior study and other investigations conducted on high-risk surgical and critically ill patients. Over half of the patients experienced postoperative acidosis, with the most prevalent type being MA characterized by an elevated anion gap. Metabolic acidosis has been identified as a contributing risk factor for unfavourable outcomes in major surgical procedures, particularly those involving the gastrointestinal tract, which was the predominant occurrence of metabolic acidosis in our analysis. The presence of high AG, in our study, most discriminates the correlation with survival of patients. In our study, the elevated anion gap emerges as the primary discriminator in relation to patient survival. It is noteworthy that specific factors associated with gastrointestinal tract surgeries, including the administration of substantial volumes of saline solution, accumulation of lactate, and depletion of bicarbonate through surgical drainage, are likely contributors to the heightened occurrence of metabolic acidosis observed within this distinct patient subgroup.

### Bench-to-bedside review: treating acid-base abnormalities in the intensive care unit-the role of buffers [^114oWjkC]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

The recognition and management of acid-base disorders is a commonplace activity for intensivists. Despite the frequency with which non-bicarbonate-losing forms of metabolic acidosis such as lactic acidosis occurs in critically ill patients, treatment is controversial. This article describes the properties of several buffering agents and reviews the evidence for their clinical efficacy. The evidence supporting and refuting attempts to correct arterial pH through the administration of currently available buffers is presented.

### Approach to the evaluation of a patient with an increased serum osmolal gap and high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis [^111QBddX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

An increase in serum osmolality and serum osmolal gap with or without high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis is an important clue to exposure to one of the toxic alcohols, which include methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or isopropanol. However, the increase in serum osmolal gap and metabolic acidosis can occur either together or alone depending on several factors, including baseline serum osmolal gap, molecular weight of the alcohol, and stage of metabolism of the alcohol. In addition, other disorders, including diabetic or alcoholic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and lactic acidosis, can cause high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis associated with an increased serum osmolal gap and therefore should be explored in the differential diagnosis. It is essential for clinicians to understand the value and limitations of osmolal gap to assist in reaching the correct diagnosis and initiating appropriate treatment. In this teaching case, we present a systematic approach to diagnosing high serum osmolality and increased serum osmolal gap with or without high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis.

Metabolic acidosis is defined as an acidemia created by one of three mechanisms: increased production of acids, decreased excretion of acids, or loss of alkali. This article addresses the identification and correct diagnosis of metabolic acidosis by reviewing important historical factors, pathophysiological principles, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings accompanying common high and normal anion gap metabolic acidoses in emergency department patients.

### Emergency management of intoxication-type inherited metabolic disorders [^113jF6vs]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Initial Assessment and Investigation

Management of acutely ill patients starts with the assessment of the airway, breathing and circulation. Ventilation may be needed, particularly in neonates, and these patients often require intravenous fluids to correct dehydration. Initial investigations in patients who may have an intoxication disorder should include the measurement of the blood glucose and ammonia concentrations and acid–base status. Hypoglycaemia should be corrected with an intravenous bolus of glucose followed by an infusion (preferably after taking samples if the diagnosis is unknown). An infusion of sodium bicarbonate (suitably diluted) should be considered if severe metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.1 and base deficit > 10 mmol/L) persists after initial resuscitation, for example, in organic acidaemias and glutathione synthetase deficiency. In intoxication‐type disorders, acidosis is less likely to be corrected by other measures than in other conditions (such as shock, diabetic ketoacidosis or defects of gluconeogenesis).

In some patients presenting acutely, the diagnosis is already known. This allows prompt management to minimize problems. The expansion of newborn screening over recent decades has improved the outcomes for many diseases.

Urgent investigations are needed if the diagnosis is unknown. As intoxication‐type metabolic disorders are caused by the accumulation of small molecules, they can usually be diagnosed by biochemical tests, such as plasma amino acids, total homocysteine, acylcarnitines, urine organic acids and erythrocyte galactose‐1‐phosphate uridyl transferase, with results within a few hours. Genetic testing is generally slower, but advances mean that some centers can obtain whole genome sequencing results within 3 days. This is most valuable for disorders where no biochemical test is available, but it may occasionally identify an unsuspected intoxication disorder. Genetic tests must not, however, displace metabolic investigations, which are better for disorders requiring acute treatment.

### Serum anion gap: its uses and limitations in clinical medicine [^112tEJd9]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

The serum anion gap, calculated from the electrolytes measured in the chemical laboratory, is defined as the sum of serum chloride and bicarbonate concentrations subtracted from the serum sodium concentration. This entity is used in the detection and analysis of acid-base disorders, assessment of quality control in the chemical laboratory, and detection of such disorders as multiple myeloma, bromide intoxication, and lithium intoxication. The normal value can vary widely, reflecting both differences in the methods that are used to measure its constituents and substantial interindividual variability. Low values most commonly indicate laboratory error or hypoalbuminemia but can denote the presence of a paraproteinemia or intoxication with lithium, bromide, or iodide. Elevated values most commonly indicate metabolic acidosis but can reflect laboratory error, metabolic alkalosis, hyperphosphatemia, or paraproteinemia. Metabolic acidosis can be divided into high anion and normal anion gap varieties, which can be present alone or concurrently. A presumed 1:1 stoichiometry between change in the serum anion gap (DeltaAG) and change in the serum bicarbonate concentration (DeltaHCO(3)(-)) has been used to uncover the concurrence of mixed metabolic acid-base disorders in patients with high anion gap acidosis. However, recent studies indicate variability in the DeltaAG/DeltaHCO(3)(-) in this disorder. This observation undercuts the ability to use this ratio alone to detect complex acid-base disorders, thus emphasizing the need to consider additional information to obtain the appropriate diagnosis. Despite these caveats, calculation of the serum anion gap remains an inexpensive and effective tool that aids detection of various acid-base disorders, hematologic malignancies, and intoxications.

### Unmeasured anions in metabolic acidosis: unravelling the mystery [^116uJP48]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

In the critically ill, metabolic acidosis is a common observation and, in clinical practice, the cause of this derangement is often multi-factorial. Various measures are often employed to try and characterise the aetiology of metabolic acidosis, the most popular of which is the anion gap. The purpose of the anion gap can be perceived as a means by which the physician is alerted to the presence of unmeasured anions in plasma that contribute to the observed acidosis. In many cases, the causative ion may be easily identified, such as lactate, but often the causative ion(s) remain unidentified, even after exclusion of the 'classic' causes. We describe here the various attempts in the literature that have been made to address this observation and highlight recent studies that reveal potential sources of such hitherto unmeasured anions.

### Circulating anions usually associated with the krebs cycle in patients with metabolic acidosis [^114qeCd4]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

The consequences of metabolic acidosis can be catastrophic and a considerable body of literature highlights the poor outlook in patients where lactic acid is the principal component of the acidaemia. This increase in blood lactate concentration reflects either increased lactate production, reduced lactate metabolism or, more commonly, a combination of the two. In patients with DKA, 3-hydroxybutyric acid and, to a lesser extent, acetoacetic acid play the major role in the generation of the anion gap. As outlined, however, in a third patient group, neither lactate nor 3-hydroxybutyrate is responsible for the elevated anion gap and the relevant anions responsible remain unknown. In the fourth patient group, acidosis is generated as a result of uncontrolled electrolyte loss either from the kidney (renal tubular acidosis) or the gut.

We have shown that the plasma concentrations of acids usually associated with the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle are significantly increased in patients with lactic acidosis as well as those with 'unexplained acidosis' with normal or near normal blood lactate concentrations. In DKA, although the concentrations of these acids are less strikingly elevated, they are still abnormal in the majority of patients when compared to controls. They are not, however, significantly elevated in patients with normal anion gap acidosis secondary to excess base loss. The accumulation of such acids may contribute significantly to the production of the anion gap and account, in part, for the 'missing' anions in patients with certain forms of acidosis. Recent studies, in keeping with previous work, have demonstrated the predictive value of acid-base variables on outcome in the critically ill. Furthermore, the calculation of unmeasured anions appears to be a better discriminator of outcome than lactate or base deficit.

### Serum lactate level and mortality in metformin-associated lactic acidosis requiring renal replacement therapy: a systematic review of case reports and case series [^115a3J6M]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The traditional target of metformin is inhibition of mitochondrial complex-1, which subsequently impair the efficiency of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. Mechanistic studies have linked metformin to activation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or inhibition of cyclic AMP formation following the drop of cellular energy charge. A recent study demonstrated that metformin inhibits mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (mGPD) causing an increased cytosolic redox state (increased cytosolic NADH/NAD + ratio) that hinder the conversion of lactate to pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase. When serum metformin level increases abnormally due to either ingestion of a large amount of metformin and/or to decreased kidney clearance of metformin, excessive production of lactate and proton will ensue.

Cumulating intracellular lactate is then transported into extracellular fluid (ECF) concomitantly with hydrogen 1:1 by proton-coupled monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). To maintain acid-base homeostasis in ECF, proton reacts with bicarbonate to form water and carbon dioxide whereas lactate is metabolized by gluconeogenesis or oxidation after converting to pyruvate. Bicarbonate is then replenished by kidney via tubular reabsorption or net acid secretion. This homeostasis is energy dependent and driven by decreased NADH/NAD + ratio at cytosol, which is highly vulnerable in the context of MALA featuring with energy failure and increased intracellular redox status. As a result, the rapidly accumulating extracellular lactate and proton will consume equivalent amounts of bicarbonate in ECF until the maximum tolerable lactate threshold, around 20 mmol/L (Fig. 4b), is reached. Beyond this intrinsic threshold, the export of intracellular lactate/proton is then severely limited, followed by irreversible cellular damage. However, among patients suffering from severe volume contraction and pre-existing metabolic alkalosis, the endogenous bicarbonate in ECF prior to the development MALA may raise this lactate threshold beyond 20 mmol/L. To reverse the severe uncompensated acidosis, exogenous sodium bicarbonate infusion not only raises serum bicarbonate to neutralize proton acidity but also causes iatrogenic hypernatremia to create an extra "anion space" for excessive lactate in the price of systemic hyperosmolality (Fig. 4c). In this scenario, timely renal replacement therapy is the therapy of choice to remove excessive metformin and to correct intracellular acidosis while maintaining osmolar homeostasis as exemplified in a patient with MALA and an extremely high serum lactate level of 55 mmol/L successfully treated at our hospital (Additional file 1: Figure S4). This case highlighted the dynamics of how prescription of RRT was tailored to meet incredibly high metabolic demand.

### Severe euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis of multifactorial etiology in a type 2 diabetic patient treated with empagliflozin: case report and literature review [^113ErRxx]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiologic mechanism that leads to this serious metabolic disorder has been previously described. Accumulation of ketoacids in DKA, typically results in high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis complicating diabetic ketoacidosis during the recovery phase has been well documented; however, its contribution at presentation of euglycemic DKA has been only recently recognized. Furthermore, typical DKA commonly occurs in the presence of additional conditions (i.e. trauma, surgery or infection) that per se may lead to other coexisting types of metabolic acidosis (e.g. lactic, hyperchloremic). Herein, we describe a patient with T2DM under SGLT-2 treatment who 5 days post-surgery presented with severe acidosis and only mildly elevated anion gap, mild hyperglycemia and ketonuria. A traditional diagnostic approach based on serum glucose levels and the anion gap in this patient could have seriously misled us from the correct diagnosis.

### Management of acute metabolic acidosis in the ICU: sodium bicarbonate and renal replacement therapy [^111m1uBD]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic acidosis is a process caused by an increase in weak acids or a decrease in strong ion difference (SID). Serum proteins, albumin, and inorganic phosphate are considered as weak acids. Strong ions, such as Na +, K +, Ca 2+, Mg 2+, and Cl −, exist at a fully ionized status in body fluids. SID is the presence of an excess of strong cations over strong anions, and the normal value in plasma is 42 mEq/l. The method to quantify metabolic acidosis using SID and weak acids was introduced by Stewart in the 1980s and still creates debate in its clinical application. Plasma base excess is widely used to identify a metabolic component of acidosis in clinical practice. The base excess approach was shown to be equivalent to Stewart's SID approach in quantifying acid–base status in critically ill patients.

Metabolic acidosis is classified into acute and chronic. Although it is not clearly defined, acute metabolic acidosis occurs within a few days. Chronic acidosis is a condition that lasts for weeks or even years. In this chapter, we focus on acute metabolic acidosis in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and provide an update from recently published clinical studies.

### Topiramate (Topamax) [^1159T4KR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

TOPAMAX can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by TOPAMAX. TOPAMAX-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of TOPAMAX.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with TOPAMAX in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for TOPAMAX (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to ≤ 2% for placebo.

### Severe metabolic or mixed acidemia on intensive care unit admission: incidence, prognosis and administration of buffer therapy. A prospective, multiple-center study [^113kQuf5]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main results of this study can be summarized as follows. First, severe metabolic or mixed acidemia defined by a plasma pH level lower than 7.20 within the first 24 hours of ICU admission was observed in 6% of critically ill patients. Second, severe metabolic or mixed acidemia was associated with an ICU mortality rate of 57%. Third, as opposed to pH value, the rapidity of acidemia correction was associated with mortality. Fourth, sodium bicarbonate prescription within the first 24 hours of acidemia was heterogeneous, depending on the participating ICU, and was not associated with the patient's prognosis.

Several limitations of this study must be identified. First, we defined and classified severe acidemia on the basis of a pH value below 7.20, bicarbonate and base excess, and instead used the physiochemical classification developed by Stewart. We chose this strategy because of its widespread use and because it was the easiest way to screen patients. Moreover, our study could not demonstrate that acidemia per se rather than the underlying disease was the main independent predictive factor in patient outcome. Indeed, our study was an observational, multiple-center study which included all consecutive, heterogeneous patients according to their acid-base status and was not designed to specifically address the impact of sodium bicarbonate on outcome or to address the reasons for sodium bicarbonate prescription. We also could not assess whether very early sodium bicarbonate administration (within the first six hours of acidemia), a different load of buffer (high vs low dose) or administration modalities (slow vs rapid infusion and/or concentrated vs diluted bicarbonate) had any different effects on outcome. However, the present cohort may be used as a tool with which to design a future interventional, randomized study to examine the effects of buffers in severely acidotic critically ill patients.

### A systematic approach to understanding acid-base disorders in the critically ill [^116Gmz7F]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this review is to discuss acid-base physiology, describe the essential steps for interpreting an arterial blood gas and relevant laboratory tests, and review the 4 distinct types of acid-base disorders.

Data Sources

A comprehensive literature search and resultant bibliography review of PubMed from inception through March 7, 2023.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Relevant English-language articles were extracted and evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Critically ill patients are prone to significant acid-base disorders that can adversely affect clinical outcomes. Assessing these acid-base abnormalities can be complex because of dynamic aberrations in plasma proteins, electrolytes, extracellular volume, concomitant therapies, and use of mechanical ventilation. This article provides a systematic approach to acid-base abnormalities which is necessary to facilitate prompt identification of acid-base disturbances and prevent untoward morbidity and mortality.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Many acid-base disorders result from medication therapy or are treated with medications. Pharmacists are uniquely poised as the medication experts on the multidisciplinary team to assist with acid-base assessments in the context of pharmacotherapy.

Conclusion

The use of a systematic approach to address acid-base disorders can be performed by all pharmacists to improve pharmacotherapy and optimize patient outcomes.

### Empagliflozin-associated postoperative mixed metabolic acidosis. case report and review of pathogenesis [^111nVNj6]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

On admission to the ICU one hour after CPR, a severe mixed metabolic acidosis was present with pH of 6.85 and base excess of -29 mmol/l (Table 1). Lactate was only moderately elevated (5.8 mmol/l). An elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration of 3.2 mmol/l. Corresponded to a mild ketoacidosis. Together with lactate and acetoacetate, whose concentration is about three times lower than that of beta-hydroxybutyrate, the total organic acid concentration was about 10 mmol/l. The anion gap was 18.1 mmol/l, i.e. 9.6 mmol/l higher than expected. Thus, the increase in the anion gap can be explained entirely by organic acids, with no other component. Subtracting this increase in anion gap still leaves a base excess of almost − 20 mmol/l, which must be explained by a non-anion gap hyperchloremic acidosis (admission Cl − was 117 mmol/l, see Table 1). Overall, we found a mixed metabolic acidosis - lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis and hyperchloremic acidosis. We consider the lactic acidosis to be a consequence of cardiac arrest, but the other components of the acidosis, with base excess of -23 mmol/L after subtraction of the lactate, must have been present before CPR. We found no etiological explanation for the acidosis other than the SGLT2i-associated ketoacidosis. We hypothesize that SGLT2i gradually induced severe acidosis within 5 days of surgery, which triggered a malignant arrhythmia in the context of previously undiagnosed coronary artery disease. Here, we briefly review the pathogenesis of SGLT2i-associated acidosis and discuss some specific points of the presented case.

### Association between delta anion gap / delta bicarbonate and outcome of surgical patients admitted to intensive care unit [^1119UgdQ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Study strength and limitations

The study's outcomes require consideration within the context of inherent limitations. First, the study's observational nature lacked a predetermined intraoperative treatment protocol. Second, our definition of metabolic acidosis may not be as sensitive to detect patients in the early stages of acid-base disturbance. Further, the limited postoperative observation duration hindered comprehensive assessment of certain organ dysfunctions, as acute renal failure. Additionally, the study did not explore acidosis's potential impact on adjunct therapeutic modalities, including vasopressors. Finally, the application of the delta-AG/delta-Bic ratio is considered a feasible tool in assessing acid-base disorders; however, it is crucial to exercise caution as acid-base metabolism is complex, and the use of delta-AG/delta-Bic should be approached judiciously, recognizing its limitations in the accurate diagnosis of mixed acid-base disorders within the realm of scientific understanding. It is advised that the delta-AG/delta-Bic ratio not be utilized in isolation but rather in conjunction with additional clinical and laboratory data for the diagnosis of conditions entailing mixed metabolic acidosis. Further research is warranted to ascertain the efficacy of this formula when applied singularly in the context of surgical patients. These limitations underscore the need for cautious interpretation and underscore prospects for future research.

### Clinical efficacy of sodium bicarbonate in treating pediatric metabolic acidosis with varying level of acid-base balance parameters: a real-world study [^113oJ4WL]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Currently, there is no indicator parameter to decide when SB should be administered to patients with metabolic acidosis. Acid–base balance parameters significantly influence pH levels and clinical outcomes, including lactic acid accumulation, reduced chloride (Cl −) levels, and disorders in calcium (Ca 2+) and sodium (Na +), which can eventually increase mortality. These parameters may potentially impact the effectiveness of SB in increasing extracellular pH, thereby affecting its clinical efficacy. In this study, we analyze real-world data collected from Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) to investigate the influence of acid–base balance parameters on the clinical outcomes of SB treatment in children with metabolic acidosis.

### Clinical evidence that treatment of metabolic acidosis slows the progression of chronic kidney disease [^112naoeF]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Metabolic acidosis arises from a fundamental disturbance of acid–base balance and is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Optimal cell, tissue and organ function requires the maintenance of hydrogen ion (H +) concentration within a physiologic range, which for serum is 35–45 nM (pH 7.46–7.35). The dynamic process leading to a net gain of H + in body fluids is called acidosis. When acidosis is due to a gain of 'fixed acid' H + (as opposed to the gain of 'volatile' H + because of accumulation of carbon dioxide gas, causing respiratory acidosis) and this H + gain decreases the metabolic component of the acid–base equilibrium, bicarbonate (HCO 3), it is called metabolic acidosis. If the amount or rate of added H + exceeds normal excretory capacity or if H + excretory capacity is reduced as in CKD with reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), metabolic acidosis becomes chronic. Epidemiological studies show that the prevalence of metabolic acidosis is approximately 15–19% in CKD stage 3–5 patients, with metabolic acidosis affecting approximately 3 million patients with CKD in the United States.

### Conventional or physicochemical approach in intensive care unit patients with metabolic acidosis [^116QYLdx]. Critical Care (2003). Low credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic acidosis is the most frequent acid-base disorder in the intensive care unit. The optimal analysis of the underlying mechanisms is unknown.

Aim

To compare the conventional approach with the physicochemical approach in quantifying complicated metabolic acidosis in patients in the intensive care unit.

Patients and Methods

We included 50 consecutive patients with a metabolic acidosis (standard base excess ≤ -5). We measured sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, lactate, creatinine, urea, phosphate, albumin, pH, and arterial carbon dioxide and oxygen tensions in every patient. We then calculated HCO3-, the base excess, the anion gap, the albumin-corrected anion gap, the apparent strong ion difference, the effective strong ion difference and the strong ion gap.

Results

Most patients had multiple underlying mechanisms explaining the metabolic acidosis. Unmeasured strong anions were present in 98%, hyperchloremia was present in 80% and elevated lactate levels were present in 62% of patients. Calculation of the anion gap was not useful for the detection of hyperlactatemia. There was an excellent relation between the strong ion gap and the albumin-corrected and lactate-corrected anion gap (r2 = 0.934), with a bias of 1.86 and a precision of 0.96.

Conclusion

Multiple underlying mechanisms are present in most intensive care unit patients with a metabolic acidosis. These mechanisms are reliably determined by measuring the lactate-corrected and albumin-corrected anion gap. Calculation of the more time-consuming strong ion gap according to Stewart is therefore unnecessary.

### Acute electrolyte and acid-base disorders in patients with ileostomies: a case series [^114dwRZU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with ileostomies are well known to be susceptible to extracellular fluid volume depletion as a result of fluid and solute losses that are greater than intake. However, electrolyte and acid-base disorders accompanying these episodes of volume depletion are not well delineated.

Study Design

Case series.

Setting & Participants

7 patients with hospitalization because of acute acid-base disturbances at an academic medical center.

Outcomes

In all patients, serum and urine creatinine and electrolytes were measured. In 2 patients, arterial blood pH and Pco(2) and ileal drainage electrolytes also were measured.

Results

2 patients presented with severe metabolic alkalosis, and the remaining 5 patients had low serum total carbon dioxide values in association with hyperkalemia. All 7 had acute renal failure. Pathophysiological characteristics, diagnosis, and management of these disorders are discussed, along with considerations for long-term management of fluid and electrolyte balance.

Limitations

This report illustrates electrolyte and acid-base disorders encountered in patients with ileostomies from our clinical experience. We have no data about the incidence of these disorders.

Conclusion

Patients with ileostomies can develop diverse and potentially life-threatening acute electrolyte and acid-base disorders when ileostomy drainage increases. Either metabolic acidosis or metabolic alkalosis can occur, depending on the nature and duration of the losses. These cases emphasize the need to be aware of the variety of acute electrolyte and acid-base disorders that can occur in this group of patients and to intervene rapidly when they develop.
