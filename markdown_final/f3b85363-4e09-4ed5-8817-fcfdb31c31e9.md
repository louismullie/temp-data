## Question

How often should afb sputums be cultured to rule out active tb

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often AFB sputum specimens should be collected and cultured to rule out active pulmonary tuberculosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic gold standard and why culture matters. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend regarding the number of sputum specimens. Next, I will examine the incremental diagnostic yield of each additional specimen. After that, I need to consider special populations and specimen quality. Finally, I will integrate NAAT and smear results and translate this into practical clinical actions, including when to stop isolation and when to escalate to induced sputum or bronchoscopy.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic anchor: culture remains the gold standard for diagnosing active TB, and it is the only method that both confirms Mycobacterium tuberculosis and enables drug susceptibility testing, so I need to ensure we are not substituting smear or NAAT for culture when ruling out disease definitively [^116uj3dn] [^111oW7FB].

> Next, I should review guideline recommendations on specimen number; the ATS/IDSA/CDC guideline explicitly states that testing of three respiratory specimens is the normative practice in the United States and is strongly recommended by CDC and the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association, and this is echoed by CDC panel physician technical instructions requiring at least three sputum specimens for AFB smear and culture, so three is the standard target to meet for ruling out active TB microbiologically [^114axZm3] [^111ezySG] [^116j32Kw].

> Wait, let me verify the incremental yield so I don't overstate the value of additional samples; the guideline notes that the first specimen detects about 53.8% of culture-confirmed TB, adding a second specimen increases sensitivity by roughly 11%, and a third adds only about 2–5%, which means the third specimen has diminishing returns but still meaningfully reduces false negatives in programmatic practice [^114axZm3].

> I will now examine whether two specimens might suffice in some contexts; observational data suggest that two sputum cultures can identify many cases and that the third adds little in some cohorts, and studies of smear strategies show that two negative smears can sometimes support de-isolation in low-prevalence settings, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — smear performance is not equivalent to culture, and guidelines still endorse three cultures to minimize missed diagnoses, so two may be acceptable for isolation decisions in select low-risk patients but should not be generalized to definitive rule-out of TB [^1146uddW] [^1155cqxc] [^114axZm3].

> Let me consider special populations; in people with HIV, disease is more often paucibacillary, so sensitivity of smear and culture may be lower and the negative predictive value of fewer specimens is reduced, reinforcing the need for three high-quality specimens and cautious interpretation of negative results in this group [^114Nh3GL] [^113phMhf].

> I should double-check specimen quality and timing because they materially affect yield; first-morning specimens increase smear sensitivity by about 12% compared with spot specimens, and concentrating sputum and using fluorescence microscopy improve detection, so requesting at least 3–5 mL and prioritizing an early-morning sample in the set helps optimize culture yield even when the absolute number of specimens is fixed at three [^114axZm3] [^111Rv5jB].

> Next, I should review how NAAT fits into this; WHO recommends Xpert MTB/RIF as the initial diagnostic test in adults with signs and symptoms of TB, and U.S. guidelines suggest NAAT on the initial specimen, but I need to ensure I don't overinterpret a negative NAAT — NAAT sensitivity drops in smear-negative disease and a negative NAAT does not exclude TB, so NAAT complements but does not replace the need for three cultures when ruling out active TB [^115mG3qM] [^11333dCT] [^115XoJug].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot produce sputum; I should confirm escalation pathways; guidelines recommend sputum induction as the initial approach when expectorated sputum is not feasible, and if induction fails, flexible bronchoscopy with post-bronchoscopy sputum can be used, with post-bronchoscopy sputum cultures showing meaningful incremental yield in some series, so maintaining a three-specimen target remains the principle even if the sampling method changes [^116PkpfM] [^113TVpMy] [^1131wyZW].

> I need to ensure I address the practical "rule-out" threshold; in U.S. practice, three negative respiratory specimens — particularly when at least one is an early-morning, good-quality specimen and when NAAT is negative — substantially reduce the likelihood of active TB, but because culture sensitivity is imperfect and early paucibacillary disease exists, a negative three-specimen set does not absolutely exclude TB; therefore, if clinical suspicion remains high, I should continue evaluation, consider repeat sampling, or pursue alternative diagnostics rather than prematurely closing the case [^114axZm3] [^115sysUH] [^1148GSBw].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line: obtain three sputum specimens for AFB smear and mycobacterial culture, spaced over 8–24 hours and including at least one first-morning sample, with attention to adequate volume and concentration; this strategy balances diagnostic yield, timeliness, and resource use and aligns with U.S. and international guidance for ruling out active pulmonary TB [^114axZm3] [^111ezySG] [^116j32Kw].

---

Obtain **three sputum specimens** for AFB smear and culture [^114GtqpE] to rule out active TB, collected 8–24 hours apart, including at least one early-morning sample [^116j32Kw]. This approach balances diagnostic yield, cost, and patient burden, as a third specimen adds only modest sensitivity [^111V2xtB] and is not routinely needed beyond three unless clinical suspicion remains high or prior samples are inadequate [^115sysUH]. If the patient cannot produce sputum, use induced sputum [^114aPMXD] or bronchoscopy [^116PkpfM]; if all three are negative but suspicion persists, consider additional testing or repeat sampling [^115sysUH].

---

## Recommended number of sputum specimens

The **standard recommendation** is to obtain three sputum specimens for AFB smear and culture [^114axZm3] in patients with suspected pulmonary TB [^114axZm3]. The **rationale** is that three specimens optimize diagnostic yield while minimizing patient burden and cost; the first two capture most cases, and the third adds only modest sensitivity [^111V2xtB].

---

## Timing and collection methods

- **Timing**: Collect specimens 8–24 hours apart, including at least one early-morning sample [^116j32Kw] to maximize yield [^114axZm3].
- **Collection methods**: Use expectorated sputum when possible; if the patient cannot produce sputum, use induced sputum [^114aPMXD] or bronchoscopy [^116PkpfM].

---

## Diagnostic yield of serial sputum specimens

| **Specimen number** | **Incremental diagnostic yield** |
|-|-|
| First specimen | Detects ~53.8% of cases [^114axZm3] |
| Second specimen | Adds ~11.1% sensitivity [^114axZm3] |
| Third specimen | Adds ~2–5% sensitivity [^114axZm3] |

---

The **cumulative sensitivity** is approximately 67–72% after three specimens, with the third adding limited value in most settings [^111V2xtB].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring additional specimens

Additional specimens may be warranted when:

- **High clinical suspicion**: Despite three negative specimens, if suspicion remains high, consider further testing or repeat sampling [^114axZm3].
- **Inadequate samples**: Poor-quality or contaminated samples may necessitate repeat collection [^111ezySG].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: HIV-positive or other immunocompromised patients may require more aggressive diagnostic strategies [^113phMhf].

---

## Role of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs)

NAATs (e.g. Xpert MTB/RIF) provide rapid results and higher sensitivity than smear [^111YdQj9], especially in smear-negative cases [^11333dCT]. However, **NAATs do not replace culture**, which remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis and drug susceptibility testing [^116uj3dn].

---

## Clinical implications of negative sputum cultures

Negative sputum cultures reduce the likelihood of active TB but **do not exclude it**, particularly in paucibacillary or extrapulmonary disease [^112ujTbo]. Clinicians should integrate clinical, radiographic, and epidemiologic data when interpreting negative results [^115sysUH].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard practice**: Obtain three sputum specimens for AFB smear and culture [^114GtqpE], collected 8–24 hours apart, including at least one early-morning sample [^116j32Kw].
- **Additional testing**: If clinical suspicion remains high despite three negative specimens, consider further testing or repeat sampling [^116PkpfM].
- **NAATs**: Use NAATs to complement, not replace, culture-based diagnosis [^116uj3dn].

---

Obtaining **three sputum specimens** for AFB smear and culture is the standard approach to rule out active TB, balancing diagnostic yield, cost, and patient burden [^114axZm3].

### How many sputum specimens are necessary to diagnose pulmonary tuberculosis? [^111V2xtB]. American Journal of Infection Control (2005). Low credibility.

The definitive diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) relies on identifying or culturing Mycobacterium tuberculosis from respiratory specimens. National guidelines have recommended obtaining 3 sputum specimens from patients with suspected tuberculosis, but there has been little data on the number of specimens actually needed to support a diagnosis. We retrospectively reviewed all patients diagnosed with PTB at a public inner-city hospital and assessed the sensitivity of the acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and the number of smears needed to establish the diagnosis. Between January 1, 1997 and October 1, 2000, 425 patients were diagnosed with culture-proven PTB. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smears and cultures were performed on 951 respiratory specimens from 425 patients. The overall sensitivity of a positive AFB smear increased from 67% with 1 sputum collected to 71% and 72%, respectively, with the second and third specimens. The sensitivity of smears from 239 HIV-negative patients was 75%, 79%, and 80% with 1, 2, and 3 smears, respectively, collected compared with 57%, 61%, and 62%, respectively, for 142 HIV-positive patients. In summary, 2 respiratory specimens proved adequate in establishing a diagnosis of tuberculosis, and the third specimen added little additional diagnostic value.

### Are three sputum acid-fast Bacillus smears necessary for discontinuing tuberculosis isolation? [^1146uddW]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2002). Low credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy of three sputum acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smears to rule out pulmonary tuberculosis, sputum AFB smear and culture results were analyzed at two university-affiliated teaching hospitals. The negative predictive value of the smear increased by only 0.2% on days 2 and 3 each, indicating that in low-prevalence populations, there is limited value in requiring three negative sputum AFB smears before discontinuing tuberculosis isolation.

Testing for TB disease — AFB smear microscopy, culture, and NAAT: We recommend that acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear microscopy be performed, rather than no AFB smear microscopy, in all patients suspected of having pulmonary TB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). False-negative results are sufficiently common that a negative AFB smear result does not exclude pulmonary TB. Similarly, false-positive results are sufficiently common that a positive AFB smear result does not confirm pulmonary TB. Providers should request a sputum volume of at least 3 mL, but the optimal volume is 5–10 mL. Concentrated respiratory specimens and fluorescence microscopy are preferred. We suggest that both liquid and solid mycobacterial cultures be performed, rather than either culture method alone, for every specimen obtained from an individual with suspected TB disease (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). At least liquid culture should be done on all specimens as culture is the gold standard microbiologic test for the diagnosis of TB disease. The isolate recovered should be identified according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines and the American Society for Microbiology Manual of Clinical Microbiology. We suggest performing a diagnostic nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), rather than not performing a NAAT, on the initial respiratory specimen from patients suspected of having pulmonary TB (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).

Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis — We recommend that AFB smear microscopy be performed, rather than no AFB smear microscopy, in all patients suspected of having pulmonary TB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). AFB smear microscopy has a sensitivity of approximately 70% when culture-confirmed TB is the reference standard; the first specimen is 53.8%, adding a second increases sensitivity by a mean of 11.1%, and a third adds only 2%–5%. The sensitivity of a first morning specimen is 12% greater than a single spot specimen, concentrated specimens have a mean increase in sensitivity of 18% compared with nonconcentrated specimens, and fluorescence microscopy is on average 10% more sensitive than conventional microscopy. The specificity of microscopy is relatively high (≥ 90%), but the positive predictive value varies (70%–90%). Remarks state that a negative AFB smear result does not exclude pulmonary TB and a positive AFB smear result does not confirm pulmonary TB; testing of 3 specimens is the normative practice in the United States and is strongly recommended by the CDC and the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association; providers should request at least 3 mL sputum with an optimal volume of 5–10 mL; concentrated respiratory specimens and fluorescence microscopy are preferred. The committee predetermined use if false-negative results occur < 30% of the time (ie, sensitivity is ≥ 70%) and false-positive results occur < 10% of the time (ie, specificity is ≥ 90%).

Baseline data collection and screening algorithm

ICs were interviewed to collect demographic information, medical history and anthropometric examination. Xpert MTB/RIF test results were obtained from the health facility where the test was undertaken. Sputum samples were sent to the research laboratory for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) examination and M. tb culture.

All consenting contacts were interviewed to collect sociodemographic information, TB and medical history, and screened for TB symptoms using a standardised questionnaire. They were referred for chest X-ray (CXR), which was read by a radiologist independent of the study and classified as (1) normal, (2) suggestive active TB, (3) suggestive inactive TB or (4) abnormal not TB. From anyone with a cough or CXR suggestive of active TB (online supplemental figure S2), two sputum samples were tested at the CHC using Xpert MTB/RIF, while two other samples were sent to our research laboratory for AFB and M. tb culture.

All test results were reviewed alongside screening results by the study doctor, and participants were classified into five TB case categories: (1) 'all TB': M. tb culture or Xpert MTB/RIF positive or on anti-TB medication; (2) bacteriologically confirmed TB: M. tb culture or Xpert MTB/RIF positive; (3) probable TB: TB symptoms or CXR suggestive of TB and AFB smear positive but culture negative/not done; (4) possible TB: TB symptoms or CXR suggestive of TB and AFB smear negative and culture negative/not done; or (5) no TB: no evidence of TB on investigation (online supplemental table S1). All participants with likely TB were referred to the local CHC for further evaluation and commencement of treatment.

Pulmonary tuberculosis diagnostics — acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear, nucleic acid amplification assay (NAA), and culture — are described as follows: for suspected pulmonary TB, sputum smears for AFB provide a reliable indication of potential infectiousness, and in AFB smear–positive pulmonary cases, NAA provides rapid confirmation of M. tuberculosis complex; these two tests, available with rapid turnaround, facilitate treatment initiation, reporting, and contact investigation; culture-based growth detection and identification are essential for confirmation and for drug susceptibility testing recommended for all initial isolates; cultures remain the cornerstone for smear-negative disease and for monitoring treatment, release from isolation, and diagnosing failure or relapse; liquid media systems can provide results, in certain cases, in 2 weeks.

Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) diagnostic approach when induced sputum cannot be obtained (Recommendation 11) states: We suggest flexible bronchoscopic sampling, rather than no bronchoscopic sampling, in adults with suspected pulmonary TB from whom a respiratory sample cannot be obtained via induced sputum (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Reported bronchoscopic yields include a diagnostic yield of 50%–100% when based on culture; early presumptive diagnosis in 34%–48% of HIV-infected patients; same culture yield for bronchial washings and BAL (95%) with positive AFB smear frequency 26% vs. 4%; AFB smear–positive bronchoscopic brushings 9%–56%; transbronchial biopsy histopathologic findings in 42%–63% of smear-negative HIV-uninfected specimens; HIV-infected patients less likely (9%–19%) to demonstrate granulomatous inflammation; and in 2 studies TBB as the initial step suggesting TB disease in 10%–23% of patients. Remarks: In clinical practice, BAL plus brushings alone are performed for most patients; however, for patients in whom a rapid diagnosis is essential, transbronchial biopsy is also performed.

Nucleic-acid amplification (NAA) testing — pulmonary tuberculosis evaluation in people with HIV: NAA tests are more sensitive than Acid-Fast Bacillus (AFB) smears, being positive in 50% to 80% of smear-negative, culture-positive sputum specimens and up to 90% when three NAA tests are performed; therefore, it is recommended that for all patients with suspected pulmonary TB, an NAA test be performed on at least one sputum specimen. NAA tests also can be used on extrapulmonary specimens with the caveat that the sensitivity is often lower than with sputum specimens, and importantly, a smear-negative specimen with a negative NAA test result does not rule out active TB disease.

Laboratory algorithms using Acid-Fast Bacilli staining and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are often used to remove isolation precautions. A retrospective case review of 52 patients with culture-confirmed pulmonary Mtb revealed 4 subjects with negative sputum Acid-Fast Bacilli smears and negative Mtb PCRs. All had significant risk factors for Mtb and had a positive interferon-gamma release assay. A negative PCR test result does not exclude an Mtb diagnosis.

Diagnostic tests for tuberculosis in the United States — The guideline notes that "In the United States, up to 80% of all initial TB-related laboratory work… is performed in hospitals, clinics, and independent laboratories outside the public health system, whereas > 50% of species identification and drug susceptibility testing (DST) is performed in public health laboratories". It specifies that "Seven types of tests for the diagnosis of TB disease and detection of drug resistance are performed within the tuberculosis laboratory system and recommended for optimal TB control services (Table 2)". For rapid case confirmation, "Both sputum smears for AFB and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) should be available with rapid turnaround times from specimen collection".

### Factors associated with sputum culture-negative vs culture-positive diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis [^115sysUH]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

An early TB diagnosis has considerable advantages for patients and their communities. In addition to reducing transmission by treating a disease before it becomes infectious, treating noncavitary TB disease may result in higher treatment success rates because cavitation on radiology is associated with treatment failure and relapse. Furthermore, 16% to 49% of patients fail to complete antituberculous treatment because of factors such as adverse reactions, cost, and stigma. Culture-negative PTB can be treated for a shorter duration. Thus, treatment- and adherence-associated problems might be reduced by the recognition and treatment of early TB.

The viewpoints on how to define culture-negative TB have historically been, and still are, diverse. In settings where it is feasible, the definition of culture-negative pulmonary TB should, if CXR findings are not already consistent with TB, require a chest CT with radiographic abnormalities compatible with TB. In addition, a thorough workup to exclude diagnoses other than TB should be required prior to establishing the diagnosis of culture-negative TB. Given the published data on the lack of diagnostic yield of culture results beyond 3 sputum samples and the ATS and CDC recommendation to obtain 3 sputum samples, we do not feel it would be justified to propose more than 3 sputum cultures (or NAA assays) or more invasive diagnostic tests such as bronchoalveolar lavage to establish a diagnosis of culture-negative TB, provided that all 3 sputum samples were induced in patients with nonproductive cough and at least 1 sample was obtained in the morning. Nevertheless, we agree with the ATS and CDC recommendations that these approaches should be considered depending on the resources and extent of radiographic abnormalities.

Pulmonary tuberculosis — nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) on the initial respiratory specimen: We suggest performing a diagnostic NAAT, rather than not performing a NAAT, on the initial respiratory specimen from patients suspected of having pulmonary TB (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). In meta-analyses, when acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear microscopy was positive, the sensitivity and specificity of NAAT were 96% and 85%, respectively, and when AFB smear microscopy was negative, the sensitivity decreased to 66% and the specificity increased to 98%; specificity in untreated patients was 97%, and a second meta-analysis reported an overall sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 97%. A third meta-analysis found that in AFB smear microscopy–negative individuals, a positive NAAT result is beneficial when the clinical suspicion of tuberculosis was intermediate or high (> 30%) and a negative NAAT result is of little use in excluding the presence of Mtb. Remarks specify that in AFB smear–positive patients, a negative NAAT makes TB disease unlikely, and in AFB smear–negative patients with an intermediate to high level of suspicion, a positive NAAT can be used as presumptive evidence of TB disease but a negative NAAT cannot be used to exclude TB. Rationale notes that mycobacterial culture results require at least 1–2 weeks and that in AFB smear–positive patients, NAAT yields false-negative results only 4% of the time.

Symptoms of Patients With Active PTB With Missing Data Coded as Not Present

Abbreviation: PTB, pulmonary tuberculosis.

Symptom duration was recorded by the health department only for cough, productive cough, and hemoptysis. Of these, cough (including the duration of cough) had the least missing data, with information available for 583 of 796 patients (73%). Our analysis with these data shows that patients with sputum culture-negative PTB reported a median (interquartile range) of 30 (12.5–65) days of cough compared with 34 (17–78) days among those with sputum culture-positive PTB (P = 0.22). However, because only 57 of 116 patients with culture-negative PTB (49%) were reported as having cough in contrast to 543 of 680 patients with culture-positive PTB (80%) when missing symptom information was coded as not present (Table 3), the comparison for the duration of cough has to be interpreted with caution.

We suggest that postbronchoscopy sputum specimens be collected from all adults with suspected pulmonary TB who undergo bronchoscopy (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence), and remarks specify that postbronchoscopy sputum specimens are used to perform AFB smear microscopy and mycobacterial cultures.

Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) evaluation in adults — five clinical scenarios are outlined with specific recommended evaluations as follows: For any patient with a cough of > 2–3 wk duration with at least one additional symptom (fever, night sweats, weight loss, or hemoptysis), the recommended evaluation is chest radiograph; if suggestive of TB (or if patient has HIV infection), collect three sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy and culture. For any patient at high risk for TB with an unexplained illness, including respiratory symptoms, of > 2–3 wk duration, the recommended evaluation is chest radiograph; if suggestive of TB, collect three sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy and culture. For any patient with HIV infection and with cough and fever, the recommended evaluation is chest radiograph, then sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy and culture. For any patient at high risk for TB with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia who has not improved after 7 d of treatment, the recommended evaluation is chest radiograph, then sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy and culture. For any patient at high risk for TB with an abnormal chest radiograph suggestive of TB even if symptoms are minimal or absent, the recommended evaluation is review of previous chest radiographs if available, three sputum specimens for AFB smear microscopy and culture.

ATS/IDSA/CDC tuberculosis diagnosis — extrapulmonary specimen testing recommendations: We suggest that AFB smear microscopy be performed, rather than not performed, on specimens collected from sites of suspected extrapulmonary TB (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence), and remarks state that a positive result can be used as evidence of extrapulmonary TB and guide decision making because false-positive results are unlikely; however, a negative result may not be used to exclude TB because false-negative results are exceedingly common. We recommend that mycobacterial cultures be performed, rather than not performed, on specimens collected from sites of suspected extrapulmonary TB (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence), with remarks that a positive result can be used as evidence of extrapulmonary TB and guide decision making because false-positive results are unlikely; however, a negative result may not be used to exclude TB because false-negative results are exceedingly common. We suggest that NAAT be performed, rather than not performed, on specimens collected from sites of suspected extrapulmonary TB (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence), noting in remarks that a positive NAAT result can be used as evidence of extrapulmonary TB and guide decision making because false-positive results are unlikely; however, a negative NAAT result may not be used to exclude TB because false-negative results are exceedingly common and the test is an off-label use of the test. We suggest that histological examination be performed, rather than not performed, on specimens collected from sites of suspected extrapulmonary TB (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence), with remarks that both positive and negative results should be interpreted in the context of the clinical scenario because neither false-positive nor false-negative results are rare. We recommend one culture isolate from each mycobacterial culture-positive patient be submitted to a regional genotyping laboratory for genotyping (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

Extrapulmonary tuberculosis — acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear microscopy (Question 16) states: We suggest that AFB smear microscopy be performed, rather than not performed, on specimens collected from sites of suspected extrapulmonary TB (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Reported accuracy shows sensitivity of 0–10%, 14%–39%, 10%–30%, < 5%, and 0–42% across extrapulmonary specimens, and the specificity of AFB smear microscopy tends to be quite high as described for pulmonary TB (≥ 90%). AFB smear microscopy provides the opportunity for early diagnosis and treatment, and the estimated specificity of ≥ 90% for AFB smear in the diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB indicates that false-positive results occur only ≤ 10% of the time; thus, if a positive AFB smear result is obtained, it is reasonable to assume that infection is present and to act accordingly, whereas the estimated sensitivity of < 50% for all specimen types indicates that a negative AFB smear result should not be used to exclude extrapulmonary TB; additional diagnostic testing is indicated.

Exclusion of active tuberculosis on a cancer patient

After a positive IGRA or TST and prior to LTBC treatment, all patients must be evaluated to rule out active tuberculosis and to minimize the risk of drug resistance associated with anti-tuberculosis monotherapy. The evaluation includes clinical history, physical examination, and chest radiograph and respiratory sampling. The exclusion of active MTB infection remains a diagnostic challenge in an oncologic patient, since many symptoms (such as cough > 2 weeks' duration, fevers, night sweats, weight loss and new interstitial infiltrates) can be due to either cancer progression or infection. Patients with relevant clinical manifestations and/or abnormal chest radiograph should submit 3 sputum specimens (obtained via cough or induction at least 8 h apart and including at least one early-morning specimen) for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear, mycobacterial culture, and nucleic acid amplification testing. All unexpected suspicious lung lesions depicted by imaging should be investigated or biopsied, if possible. As outlined by two older studies, active tuberculosis occurred, concurrently or soon after the tumor diagnosis, in more than half of patients with HNSCC or lung cancer. This active incidence of MTB remains elevated for the first year after cancer diagnosis and treatment initiation, and after that, declines over time; for example in hematological malignancies, from 12.01% (95%CI:10.81–13.30) in the first 6 months, reduces to 2.70% (95%CI:2.12–3.39) after 24 months. Although the initially closer follow-up might result in an overestimation, it is clear that the presentation of cancer is a significant factor in the risk for developing active tuberculosis.

### Discontinuation of respiratory isolation for possible tuberculosis: do two negative sputum smear results suffice? [^111MGSbK]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2006). Low credibility.

Analysis of acid-fast bacillus smear results at a hospital with a moderate incidence of tuberculosis confirms recent recommendations that 2 negative smear results suffice for discontinuation of respiratory isolation. Use of polymerase chain reaction analysis further increases the confidence with which the diagnosis of active tuberculosis likely to be transmitted to others can be excluded.

Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in adults — initial respiratory sampling is addressed as follows: We suggest sputum induction rather than flexible bronchoscopic sampling as the initial respiratory sampling method for adults with suspected pulmonary TB who are either unable to expectorate sputum or whose expectorated sputum is AFB smear microscopy negative (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest flexible bronchoscopic sampling, rather than no bronchoscopic sampling, in adults with suspected pulmonary TB from whom a respiratory sample cannot be obtained via induced sputum (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). We suggest that postbronchoscopy sputum specimens be collected from all adults with suspected pulmonary TB who undergo bronchoscopy (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). Postbronchoscopy sputum specimens are used to perform AFB smear microscopy and mycobacterial cultures.

Although the overall incidence of tuberculosis has been declining in the United States, it remains an important public health concern, particularly among immigrants, homeless persons, and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus. Patients who present with symptoms of active tuberculosis (e.g., cough, weight loss, or malaise with known exposure to the disease) should be evaluated. Three induced sputum samples for acid-fast bacillus smear and culture should be obtained from patients with findings of tuberculosis or suspicion for active disease. If the patient has manifestations of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, smears and cultures should be obtained from these sites. Most patients with active tuberculosis should be treated initially with isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for eight weeks, followed by 18 weeks of treatment with isoniazid and rifampin if needed. Repeat cultures should be performed after the initial eight-week treatment.

### Factors associated with sputum culture-negative vs culture-positive diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis [^115qzsia]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Recognition of active tuberculosis (TB) in its earliest stages could reduce morbidity and prevent advancement to transmissible disease. Little is published about the occurrence and presentation of sputum culture-negative pulmonary TB (PTB), an early paucibacillary but often underrecognized disease state.

Objective

To assess differences between culture-negative and culture-positive PTB regarding occurrence, clinical presentation, radiographic findings, demographics, and comorbidities.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cross-sectional study in which surveillance data of adult patients with PTB reported to the New York City Department of Health in New York, New York, from 2011 through 2013, ie, years for which demographic, clinical, and radiographic data were collected. Patients were aged 18 years or older, had signs of pulmonary disease, and had mycobacterial sputum culture results; those with HIV coinfection or a TB diagnosis within 2 years prior to presentation were excluded. Culture-negative PTB was defined as clinical and radiographic presentation consistent with TB, 3 negative results on sputum culture, and improvement with antituberculous treatment. The analyses were performed between 2015 and 2016; notably, the proportion of reported patients with culture-negative PTB has remained consistent during the past 2 decades.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The occurrence of culture-negative PTB among all patients with PTB was calculated, and demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, and radiographic findings were compared between culture-negative and culture-positive PTB.

Results

Of the 796 patients with PTB (median [interquartile range] age, 41 [29–54] years; 499 [63%] men) who met criteria for analysis, 116 (15%) had negative results on sputum culture. Patients with culture-negative PTB compared with culture-positive PTB were less frequently male (53% vs 64%; p = 0.03) and presented with a significantly lower frequency of cough (68% vs 89%; P < .001), weight loss (39% vs 51%; p = 0.03), and cavitation on both chest radiograph (7% vs 28%; P < .001) and chest computed tomographic scan (26% vs 59%; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Given the lack of criterion-standard test confirmation and the relative paucity of symptoms and radiological abnormalities, culture-negative PTB is likely underdiagnosed and its occurrence underestimated globally. Awareness of these findings, enhanced diagnostic approaches, and, ideally, better biomarkers could improve detection and treatment of this early disease and reduce the development of transmissible TB.

### Guidance for studies evaluating the accuracy of sputum-based tests to diagnose tuberculosis [^112UgKo8]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Tests that can replace sputum smear microscopy have been identified as a top priority diagnostic need for tuberculosis by the World Health Organization. High-quality evidence on diagnostic accuracy for tests that may meet this need is an essential requirement to inform decisions about policy and scale-up. However, test accuracy studies are often of low and inconsistent quality and poorly reported, leading to uncertainty about true test performance. Here we provide guidance for the design of diagnostic test accuracy studies of sputum smear-replacement tests. Such studies should have a cross-sectional or cohort design, enrolling either a consecutive series or a random sample of patients who require evaluation for tuberculosis. Adults with respiratory symptoms are the target population. The reference standard should at a minimum be a single, automated, liquid culture, but additional cultures, follow-up, clinical case definition, and specific measures to understand discordant results should also be included. Inclusion of smear microscopy and Xpert MTB/RIF (or MTB/RIF Ultra) as comparators is critical to allow broader comparability and generalizability of results, because disease spectrum can vary between studies and affects relative test performance. Given the complex nature of sputum (the primary specimen type used for pulmonary TB), careful design and reporting of the specimen flow is essential. Test characteristics other than accuracy (such as feasibility, implementation considerations, and data on impact on patient, population and health systems outcomes) are also important aspects.

Tuberculosis diagnosis — culture methods: We suggest that both liquid and solid mycobacterial cultures be performed, rather than either culture method alone, for every specimen obtained from an individual with suspected TB disease (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence), with the conditional qualifier applying to all specimens and at least liquid culture should be done on all specimens as culture is the gold standard microbiologic test for the diagnosis of TB disease; the isolate recovered should be identified according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines and the American Society for Microbiology Manual of Clinical Microbiology, and performing both liquid and solid cultures likely improves the sensitivity while liquid cultures provide a more rapid answer and solid cultures serve as a safeguard against contamination.

### Official American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America / centers for disease control and prevention clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis of tuberculosis in adults and children [^111ppbEP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis — rapid diagnostic testing performance and pediatric diagnosis gaps are highlighted as follows: Rapid tests for TB diagnosis have a sensitivity of 70%–90%, may fail to detect paucibacillary pulmonary TB, and remain relatively expensive to implement in high-burden, low-resource settings; an ideal approach would be a simple, inexpensive, rapid test that is highly accurate (> 95% sensitivity and specificity). Rapid tests for detection of drug resistance are approaching the desired level of accuracy, at least for rifampin, but are relatively expensive and need expansion to detect resistance to other TB medications. In children, the yield of AFB smear and culture is low compared to adults, which can lead to delayed and missed diagnoses, and in jurisdictions that use 4 drugs for 6 months in patients lacking susceptibility data, this may result in prolonged treatment with extra TB drugs.

### Preventing nosocomial transmission of pulmonary tuberculosis: when may isolation be discontinued for patients with suspected tuberculosis? [^1155cqxc]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Thoracic Society recommend obtaining cultures of at least three sputum specimens for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) from patients in whom tuberculosis (TB) is suspected. On the basis of this, most hospitals isolate patients with suspected TB for 3 days or more until three smear (not culture) results are negative. Our objective was to evaluate the predictive value and sensitivity of these smears.

Design

Observational study.

Setting

Four urban medical centers.

Methods

The posttest probability of TB given sequential negative AFB smears from 274 patients isolated for suspected TB and the sensitivity of sequential AFB smears from 209 patients with positive results on culture for pulmonary TB were measured.

Results

The posttest probabilities of having TB given one, two, and three negative AFB smears were low: 1.1% (3 of 265; 95% confidence interval [CI95], 0.23% to 3.27%), 0.4% (1 of 262; CI95 0% to 2.1%), and 0% (0 of 260; CI95, 0% to 1.4%), respectively. Among the 209 patients with positive results on culture for pulmonary TB, 169 (81%) had an expectorated sputum specimen sent, of which 91 (54%) were positive for AFB. Forty (24%) of the 169 patients had a second expectorated sputum specimen sent after the results of the first specimen were negative; only 6 (15%) of these had positive AFB smears. None of the 10 patients in whom the first two expectorated sputum samples yielded an AFB smear without an organism had a third AFB smear that was positive.

Conclusion

Unless there is high clinical suspicion of pulmonary TB in a specific patient, the use of three AFB smears on expectorated sputa is a rational approach to discontinuing isolation for patients with suspected TB.

Community health centers — role in TB control and required capabilities — serve high-risk populations, and persons with TB symptoms may first seek evaluation there; newly arriving refugee families are frequently directed to these centers for federally supported health screening that might include targeted testing and treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI); for these reasons, community health centers are a critical part of efforts to control and prevent TB; community health centers should provide their medical staff with the skills and knowledge to conduct TB risk assessments, diagnose and initiate treatment for TB disease, and diagnose and treat LTBI, develop close working relationships with consultant physicians, hospitals, clinical laboratories, and the public health agency, and arrange for reporting suspected TB while ensuring availability of diagnostic services such as sputum smears for AFB, cultures for M. tuberculosis, and chest radiographs, with consultation and referral for diagnosis, treatment, and hospitalization as indicated.

Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) initial respiratory sampling in adults unable to expectorate sputum or whose expectorated sputum is AFB smear microscopy negative (Recommendation 10) is as follows: We suggest sputum induction rather than flexible bronchoscopic sampling as the initial respiratory sampling method for adults with suspected pulmonary TB who are either unable to expectorate sputum or whose expectorated sputum is AFB smear microscopy negative (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). Supporting evidence identified 6 studies comparing induced sputum with flexible bronchoscopy, with five of the 6 demonstrating higher yield for induced sputum and one similar; detection rates with induced sputum when 3 or more specimens are obtained include AFB smear microscopy 91%–98% and mycobacterial culture 99%–100%; cost analyses showed direct costs of $187.60 vs $22.22 and that induced sputum was about one-third the cost of flexible bronchoscopy, with the most cost-effective strategy being 3 induced sputum without bronchoscopy.

ATS/IDSA/CDC tuberculosis diagnosis — children suspected of pulmonary TB: We suggest mycobacterial culture of respiratory specimens for all children suspected of having pulmonary TB (conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Sputum collected from children by nasopharyngeal aspiration or sputum induction with a bronchodilator has a yield of 20%–30%, whereas BAL in children with pulmonary TB has a yield of 10%–22%. Prior case series indicate that 2%–10% of children have susceptibility patterns that differ from the presumed source case, and more recent US studies have found up to 15% discordance of molecular fingerprinting between the isolates collected from children with culture-proven TB compared to their presumed source case. The highest yields for gastric aspirates are in the youngest infants, in children with extensive or symptomatic disease, and for the first gastric aspirate collected, and the studies comparing the yield of gastric aspirates to sputum induction suggest similar yields. Most investigators have not found increased yield for bronchoalveolar lavage compared to gastric aspirates, and bronchoscopy should be reserved for situations where an alternative diagnosis is being considered or when the anatomy is unclear. Gastric aspirates are rarely AFB smear positive and the yield of cultures is suboptimal in children with pulmonary TB; thus, gastric aspirate culture results are helpful only if they are positive. Negative results should not dissuade the provider from empirically treating tuberculosis in children in the appropriate clinical setting. The procedures have modest risk (bleeding from the nose, bronchospasm, airway intubation), and under some circumstances, microbiological confirmation may not be necessary for children with uncomplicated pulmonary TB identified through a recent contact investigation if the source case has drug-susceptible TB.

NTCA TB isolation guidelines — sputum AFB smear microscopy and transmission risk: Positive sputum AFB smear microscopy may be associated with TB transmission prior to treatment initiation; a positive sputum smear requires the presence of 5000–10 000 AFB/mL, in contrast to culture, which requires 10–100 AFB/mL. In a prospective cohort in the United Kingdom, TB infection in contacts under 14 years old was 65% for contacts exposed to a smear-positive index patient, 27% for smear-negative, culture-positive index patient, and 18% when index patients were smear and culture negative, and adult and child contacts were more likely to develop TB disease when exposed to a smear-positive index patient (11% and 14%) compared with smear-negative, culture-positive patients (0.07% and 3%). Additional cohorts found TST conversion occurred in 6% of household contacts of smear-negative PWTB compared with 50% of household contacts of smear-positive PWTB, while molecular fingerprinting studies show PWTB with sputum smear negativity only account for between 13% and 17% of TB transmission, with a relative transmission rate of 0.19–0.24, and genomic epidemiology analyses suggest this proportion may be even lower (8%).

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

TB disease — microbiologic detection and specimen collection specifies that direct methods for detection of M. tuberculosis include AFB microscopy, nucleic-acid amplification tests (NAATs), and isolation in culture. Sputum smears are positive on AFB microscopy in 50% to 70% of adults with pulmonary TB, but children — especially those infected with HIV — often have paucibacillary disease with lower yields. Obtaining a total of 3 sputum specimens for mycobacterial evaluation on mycobacterial culture is advisable, and performing NAAT on at least 1 respiratory specimen is advisable in adults and also has added value in children. For children unable to produce sputum spontaneously, specimens should be collected via early-morning gastric aspirates or sputum induction; the first gastric aspirate collected gives the very highest yield, bronchoscopy can be considered for patients unable to produce sputum, and overall yield is increased by collecting multiple specimens. The sensitivity and specificity of AFB microscopy of gastric aspirate specimens is poor.

### Evaluation of xpert MTB / RIF versus AFB smear and culture to identify pulmonary tuberculosis in patients with suspected tuberculosis from low and higher prevalence settings [^113ueTPD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) assay is a rapid nucleic acid amplification test widely used in settings of high tuberculosis prevalence to detect tuberculosis as well asrpoBmutations associated with rifampin resistance. Data are needed on the diagnostic performance of Xpert in lower-prevalence settings to inform appropriate use for both tuberculosis detection and the need for respiratory isolation.

Methods

Xpert was compared to 2 sputum samples, each evaluated with acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and mycobacterial culture using liquid and solid culture media, from participants with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis from the United States, Brazil, and South Africa.

Results

Of 992 participants enrolled with evaluable results, 22% had culture-confirmed tuberculosis. In 638 (64%) US participants, 1 Xpert result demonstrated sensitivity of 85.2% (96.7% in participants with AFB smear-positive [AFB(+)] sputum, 59.3% with AFB smear-negative [AFB(-)] sputum), specificity of 99.2%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 97.6%, and positive predictive value of 94.9%. Results did not differ between higher- and low-prevalence settings. A second Xpert assay increased overall sensitivity to 91.1% (100% if AFB(+), 71.4% if AFB(-)), with specificity of 98.9%. In US participants, a single negative Xpert result predicted the absence of AFB(+)/culture-positive tuberculosis with an NPV of 99.7%; NPV of 2 Xpert assays was 100%, suggesting a role in removing patients from airborne infection isolation. Xpert detected tuberculosis DNA and mutations associated with rifampin resistance in 5 of 7 participants with rifampin-resistant, culture-positive tuberculosis. Specificity for rifampin resistance was 99.5% and NPV was 98.9%.

Conclusions

In the United States, Xpert testing performed comparably to 2 higher-tuberculosis-prevalence settings. These data support the use of Xpert in the initial evaluation of tuberculosis suspects and in algorithms assessing need for respiratory isolation.

### TB or not TB? Development and validation of a clinical decision support system to inform airborne isolation requirements in the evaluation of suspected tuberculosis [^113nHWYv]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nosocomial transmission of tuberculosis (TB) gained national attention in the United States during the 1980s in the context of rising incidence, fueled by the surging HIV/AIDS epidemic and weakened public health infrastructure. Incidence of TB declined from 10.4 per 100,000 in 1992 to a nadir of 2.2 per 100,000 in 2020 and nosocomial transmission has been rare in the US in recent years. However, incidence has increased to 2.9 cases per 100,000 in the US and 3.2 per 100,000 in Massachusetts in 2023. At the same time, many hospitals face staffing and capacity challenges, making resource-efficient decision-making for patients with suspected TB more urgent.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for the evaluation of persons with suspected pulmonary TB, recommend collecting three sputum samples for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and mycobacterial culture 8–24 hours apart, while implementing airborne infection isolation (AII). Approximately half of persons with pulmonary TB have negative sputum smears, and cultures usually take at least two weeks to turn positive. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for TB have higher sensitivity than AFB smears and have been incorporated into national guidelines for the diagnosis of TB. However, the sensitivity of NAAT remains significantly lower than that of culture, particularly when the specimen is AFB smear-negative. Therefore, reflexive discontinuation of AII, based on AFB smear and NAAT results alone, may be premature and risk transmission to other patients and to healthcare personnel.

Given the risk of premature discontinuation of AII, healthcare facilities often require additional review of patient records by infection prevention and control (IPC) staff, including infection preventionists (IPs) and physicians, before discontinuation of AII. In addition to reviewing the medical record, IPC staff may discuss the patient's case with the primary team and/or relevant consultants (eg, infectious diseases, pulmonary medicine) to determine whether TB is sufficiently unlikely to warrant discontinuation of AII. These case-by-case determinations are labor- and time intensive.

Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have been used to improve patient care through supporting clinicians in the implementation of best practices and clinical guidelines. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a CDSS that could be embedded in the electronic health record (EHR) to support discontinuation of AII when appropriate and, for patients determined to be at higher risk of TB, collect and summarize relevant data to support individual evaluation by IPC staff, thereby enabling efficient case review.

HIV-related tuberculosis — initial diagnostic approach emphasizes site-directed evaluation and imaging: initial diagnostic testing for TB disease should be directed at the anatomic site of symptoms or signs, pulmonary involvement is common at all CD4 counts, and the initial evaluation of suspected HIV-related TB should always include chest imaging even without pulmonary symptoms or signs. Because chest radiography is an imperfect screen and culture-positive sputum can occur with normal radiographs in advanced immunodeficiency, sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear, nucleic acid amplification (NAA) testing, and AFB culture should be performed in people with HIV with symptoms of TB disease who have a normal chest radiograph, as well as in those with no pulmonary symptoms but evidence of TB disease elsewhere in the body.

### Post-bronchoscopy sputum: improving the diagnostic yield in smear negative pulmonary TB [^1131wyZW]. Respiratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients with suspected active Pulmonary Tuberculosis (PTB) who are Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB) smear negative or non-productive of sputum may undergo bronchoalveolar lavage. However, post-bronchoscopy sputum (PBS) sampling is not routine. The aim of this study was to establish the potential diagnostic value of PBS sampling.

Methods

A retrospective study of patients attending a London University hospital with microbiologically confirmed PTB between January 2004 and December 2010. Patients who were AFB smear negative or non-productive of sputum were eligible if sputum sampling was performed within 7 days of bronchoscopy.

Results

Over the study period, 236 patients had microbiologically confirmed smear negative PTB of which 57 patients were eligible for the study. 15 patients (26.3%) were infected with HIV. 19 patients (33.3%) converted to AFB sputum smear positivity post-bronchoscopy and 5 patients (8.8%) were exclusively AFB sputum smear positive on PBS microscopy. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from the PBS of 43 patients (75.4%) and of these, 4 (7.0%) were exclusively PBS culture positive.

Conclusion

PBS analysis can provide a simple method of rapidly diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis. In this cohort, M. tuberculosis culture yield was increased by 7% through PBS sampling. This study has important infection control implications with nearly one third of patients becoming more infectious after bronchoscopy.

### Symptom-and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^111YdQj9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT)

The Xpert® MTB/RIF assay is recommended by WHO as an initial diagnostic test for tuberculosis detection in sputum in adults with signs and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis (WHO 2020a). Xpert Ultra and Truenat MTB or MTB Plus may also be used (WHO 2020a). Xpert MTB/RIF is longest available and has, compared to culture, summary sensitivity of 85% (95% credible interval (CrI) 82% to 88%) and specificity 98% (95% CrI 97% to 98%) in a systematic review of 70 studies with high‐certainty evidence (Horne 2019).

Sputum smear microscopy

Sputum smear microscopy is still a commonly available tuberculosis diagnostic test, although no longer recommended by WHO as the primary diagnostic method (WHO 2020a). Sputum smear microscopy detects the presence of acid fast bacilli (AFB), which is considered indicative of M tuberculosis in high tuberculosis‐incidence settings. Compared to culture, the sensitivity of the Ziehl‐Neelsen method (ZN) of sputum smear microscopy shows wide variation, and is between 50% and 70% in many studies (Steingart 2006a; Steingart 2006b). Direct ZN microscopy specificity is 98% (95% confidence interval (CI) 97% to 99%) (Cattamanchi 2010; Steingart 2006a; Steingart 2006b). Sputum smears may also be positive due to the presence of AFB that are not M tuberculosis, or to artefacts. Auramine‐stained fluorescence microscopy (FM) sensitivity has on average a 10% higher sensitivity than ZN, but with slightly reduced specificity (Steingart 2006a). Processing sputum by centrifugation and various chemicals, including bleach and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), shows varying levels of increase in the sensitivity of sputum smear microscopy compared with the direct smear method, and similar or slightly lower specificity (Cattamanchi 2010; Steingart 2006b).

Tuberculosis contact investigation — prioritization and infectious period criteria specify that contacts of patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) should be evaluated if the patient has concurrent pulmonary or laryngeal disease, if contacts are at increased risk such as children aged < 5 years and HIV-infected persons, or if the patient has pleural TB; children younger than 5 years with TB should have a contact investigation to identify the source case. The usual assumption is that a patient becomes infectious approximately 3 months before the date of diagnosis, and the end of the infectious period is when contact with the index case is broken or when all criteria during therapy for becoming noninfectious are met; patients with multidrug-resistant TB who have persistently positive sputum AFB smear or culture results might remain infectious > 3 months after starting effective therapy. For prioritization, patients with pulmonary TB, positive sputum AFB smear results, and cavitation on chest radiograph are more infectious and therefore have highest priority for a contact investigation, whereas persons with pulmonary TB who have negative sputum AFB smear results tend to be less infectious and should be investigated with lower priority.

### Clinical diagnosis of smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis in low-income countries: the current evidence [^1116WdLf]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2003). Medium credibility.

Sputum smear examination for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) can diagnose up to 50–60% of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis in well-equipped laboratories. In low-income countries, poor access to high-quality microscopy services contributes to even lower rates of AFB detection. Furthermore, in countries with high prevalence of both pulmonary tuberculosis and HIV infection, the detection rate is even lower owing to the paucibacillary nature of pulmonary tuberculosis in patients with HIV infection. In the absence of positive sputum smears for AFB, at primary care level, most cases of pulmonary tuberculosis are diagnosed on the basis of clinical and radiological indicators. This review aims to evaluate various criteria, algorithms, scoring systems, and clinical indicators used in low-income countries in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in people with suspected tuberculosis but repeated negative sputum smears. Several algorithms and clinical scoring systems based on local epidemiology have been developed to predict smear-negative tuberculosis. Few of these have been validated within the local context. However, in areas where smear-negative tuberculosis poses a major public-health problem, these algorithms may be useful to national tuberculosis programmes by providing a starting point for development their own context-specific diagnostic guidelines.

### The role of routine culture for tuberculosis during bronchoscopy in a nonendemic area: analysis of 300 cases and review of the literature [^115W6xFK]. American Journal of Infection Control (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Many centers routinely culture bronchoscopy samples for mycobacteria, even when tuberculosis (TB) is not strongly suspected. The value of this practice is poorly defined in areas with a low prevalence of TB.

Methods

A retrospective observational study was conducted in tertiary care, university-affiliated medical center and included 300 consecutive patients who underwent a bronchoscopy examination. The findings for acid-fast bacillus (AFB) staining and culture were reviewed, and data on demographic characteristics, presenting symptoms, old TB, autoimmune status, and chest x-ray results were collected from the files.

Results

The study included 175 men (58%) and 125 women, with a mean age of 62 ± 25 years. Eight cultures (2.67%) grew mycobacteria: 4 (1.33%) Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 4 (1.33%) nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Thus, the incidence of TB was 4 of 300 (1.33%) patients. There were no cases of positive AFB smear or culture in patients with atelectasis, pulmonary mass, or hemoptysis with normal chest x-ray. One of the 22 patients (5%) with diffuse pulmonary nodules had active TB as did 3 of the 134 patients (2.24%) with pulmonary infiltrates. All 4 patients with NTM had pulmonary infiltrates. The use of a cost-effective diagnostic strategy in our series, wherein testing would have been ruled out for patients without a clinical suspicion of TB and radiologic findings of a pulmonary mass (n = 107, 35.6%), would have saved the system US $5350.

Conclusion

The findings highlight the importance of an effective strategy for routine TB cultures during bronchoscopy in patients from nonendemic areas in whom TB is not suspected, especially those with pulmonary mass.

Figure 1
A suggested algorithm for the investigation of individuals with clinical suspicion of NTM-PD. AFB, acid-fast bacilli; HRCT, high-resolution CT; NTM-PD, non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease.

Respiratory tract cultures

Recommendations

A minimum of two sputum samples collected on separate days should be sent for mycobacterial culture when investigating an individual suspected of having NTM-PD (grade D) (see figure 1).
Individuals suspected of having NTM-PD whose sputum samples are consistently culture negative for mycobacteria should have CT-directed bronchial washings sent for mycobacterial culture (grade D).
Individuals suspected of having NTM-PD who are unable to expectorate sputum should have CT-directed bronchial washings sent for mycobacterial culture (grade D).
Transbronchial biopsies should not be performed routinely in individuals suspected of having NTM-PD (grade D).

Good practice points

Sputum induction resulting in a positive culture may avoid the need for CT-directed bronchial washings in individuals who are unable to spontaneously expectorate sputum.
Sputum induction should be considered in individuals suspected of having NTM-PD who are unable to spontaneously expectorate sputum and in whom CT-directed bronchial washings are considered inappropriate

Radiology

Recommendations

A chest X-ray should be performed in individuals suspected of having NTM-PD (grade D).
A CT scan should be performed in individuals suspected of having NTM-PD (grade D).

### Sputum monitoring during tuberculosis treatment for predicting outcome: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112YWYCd]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

WHO has previously recommended sputum-smear examination at the end of the second month of treatment in patients with recently diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis, and, if positive, extension of the intensive therapy phase. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the accuracy of a positive sputum smear or culture during treatment for predicting failure or relapse in pulmonary tuberculosis. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies published in English through December, 2009. We included randomised controlled trials, cohort, and case-control studies of previously untreated pulmonary tuberculosis patients who had received a standardised regimen with rifampicin in the initial phase. Accuracy results were summarised in forest plots and pooled by use of a hierarchical regression approach. 15 papers (28 studies) met the inclusion criteria. The pooled sensitivities for both 2-month smear (24% [95% CI 12–42%], six studies) and culture (40% [95% CI 25–56%], four studies) to predict relapse were low. Corresponding specificities (85% [95% CI 72–90%] and 85% [95% CI 77–91%]) were higher, but modest. For failure, 2-month smear (seven studies) had low sensitivity (57% [95% CI 41–73%]) and higher, although modest, specificity (81% [95% CI 72–87%]). Both sputum-smear microscopy and mycobacterial culture during tuberculosis treatment have low sensitivity and modest specificity for predicting failure and relapse. Although we pooled a diverse group of patients, the individual studies had similar performance characteristics. Better predictive markers are needed.

Pulmonary TB screening in resource-limited settings — diagnostic tools and implementation recommendations emphasize that sputum smear testing has significant diagnostic performance limitations and suboptimal sensitivity, while diagnostic imaging and microbiologic culture testing are usually more sensitive and specific than symptoms; despite availability challenges, these tests should be used routinely for patients suspected of having smear-negative pulmonary TB with cough where resources are available, the addition of chest radiographs to sputum analysis will increase the number of cases diagnosed, earlier diagnosis does not guarantee that treatment will be started earlier or that treatment completion rates will be increased, and screening initiatives for early TB diagnosis should be implemented as part of a comprehensive TB control program.

### Serial acid fast bacilli smear and culture conversion rates over 26 weeks in a cohort of 93 sputum culture-positive tuberculosis (TB) [^114xS6rq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

TE — In the 15 August 2010 issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases, Fitzwater et al report on serial acid fast bacilli smear and culture conversion rates over 26 weeks in a cohort of 93 sputum culture–positive tuberculosis (TB) patients started on standardized first-line treatment in a Lima, Peru, directly observed therapy short-course (DOTS) program. The authors note that median conversion times for smears and cultures, respectively, were 17.5 days and 38.5 days, and that at 60 days (a time point at which treatment failure is commonly suspected in individuals remaining smear or culture positive), approximately 25% of multidrug resistant (MDR) and 10% of non-MDR patients remained culture positive. Although Fitzwater et al question the view "that patients with TB who are culture positive at baseline are noninfectious after 2 weeks of treatment or a negative smear" and claim persistent culture positivity for months as a reason to believe many patients remained infectious, we do not believe their data justify these conclusions.

Rapid molecular drug susceptibility testing (DST) — indications and accuracy: Rapid molecular DST is recommended only for subgroups in which drug resistance is more likely; examples include NAAT or AFB smear positive patients who have been treated for tuberculosis, were born in or have lived for at least 1 year in a foreign country with at least a moderate tuberculosis incidence (≥ 20 per 100 000) or a high primary MDR-TB prevalence (≥ 2%), are contacts of patients with MDR-TB, or are HIV infected. For rifampin resistance, the sensitivity and specificity are both > 97%, with false-positive and false-negative results < 3% of the time; for isoniazid resistance, sensitivity and specificity are estimated to be 90% and 99%, with false-positive and false-negative results roughly 1% and 10% of the time, respectively, and rapid molecular DST can be used to confirm isoniazid resistance in respiratory specimens, but not exclude it. The recommendation is strong because the moderate-quality evidence supported that benefits of rapid molecular DST outweighed costs in patients at increased risk for drug resistance.

Fig. 2 illustrates potential routes from suspicion of NTM-PD at clinical presentation to diagnosis, as outlined by the guidelines described above.

Fig. 2
Flowchart of recommended screening process for patients with suspected non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease.

European Respiratory Society (ERS) and BTS guidelines both recommend mycobacterial culture in patients with bronchiectasis where NTM are suspected as an aetiological cause of the disease, or where patients have radiological or clinical features of NTM infection. The guidelines also recommend consideration of routine annual surveillance for NTM in patients with bronchiectasis.

Guidelines on diagnosis and management of other respiratory conditions also exist that consider screening for NTM infection. Cystic fibrosis guidelines developed by NICE (National Institute of Clinical Excellence) recommend formal annual reviews that include sputum cultures for NTM. NICE guidelines on the management of COPD are less specific, only advising sputum culture prior to initiation of antibiotics, without additional recommendations on screening for NTM, specifically.

In the UK, initial laboratory sputum reports usually return 'Mycobacterium culture positive' results, pending differentiation of TB and NTM by the reference laboratory. Local tests are often available in-house and primary care physicians should consider the relative suspicion of TB versus NTM. Rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for TB can be requested if a sputum sample has a high bacterial load and is positive by acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear microscopy, (i.e. 'smear-positive'), or if clinical suspicion of TB is high. Some services routinely test all smear-positive samples for TB. TB PCR tests offer a high positive predictive value, thus positive PCR makes TB very likely and NTM-PD very unlikely. A negative TB PCR is not strongly predictive of a lack of TB infection, especially if the initial sputum smear is negative. Sputum samples with lower mycobacterial loads will be smear-negative but remain under culture in the local microbiology labs for up to 8 weeks before a final report is issued. Where the culture becomes positive, the lab report will issue a 'positive culture' interim report, pending final species identification results.

### Factors associated with sputum culture-negative vs culture-positive diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis [^1148GSBw]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Owing to the documented continuum between asymptomatic M tuberculosis infection and early TB disease, it is not possible for us to suggest an acceptable threshold for the proportion of culture-negative TB detection. However, we do feel that the lack of microbiological confirmation in more than 40% of patients diagnosed with PTB globally, as reported for 2017 by the World Health Organization, is unacceptable and warrants improvement. Based on our priorand current study results, combined with US and British TB control data, we postulate that among patients without HIV who have PTB, the proportion of culture-negative disease is approximately 15% to 20%. Such early disease, we propose, could remain culture negative even with more aggressive diagnostic approaches because the mycobacteria are more contained in the granulomatous tissue without erosion into the small airways. In fact, detection of 15% to 20% and not a lower proportion could mean improved diagnosis of early TB disease, provided, through thorough workup, that other respiratory diseases are ruled out and the ATS and CDC diagnostic guidelines are followed.

Biomarkers that help identify culture-negative TB are urgently needed. Prior studies assessed the predictive value of interferon γ release assays, but the level of response has not been sufficiently accurate for predicting TB development. A recent prospective study identified blood RNA signatures to predict the risk of TB development and holds promise to be valuable in the detection of very early TB disease. Such new tools, ideally in the form of simple non-sputum-based biomarker assays that do not require detection of M tuberculosis itself, would be extremely valuable as adjunct diagnostics to facilitate the recognition of paucibacillary disease states not detected by current criterion-standard methods.

The observed smaller proportion of men having culture-negative disease in NYC is in accordance with other studies performed in Africa showing that among patients with PTB, men had a higher frequency of radiographic abnormalities, positive results on smear microscopy, and culture positivity compared with women. Of note, the recent 2017 increase in NYC TB incidence was associated with an increase in culture-positive cases in males. Data from both other infections in humans and TB animal models suggest that sex-related immunological differences could, in addition to behavioral reasons, contribute to this observation. However, whether there could be a possible immunological vs behavioral basis for the association between female sex and culture negativity in TB remains to be explored in prospective studies.

### Comparison of sputum collection methods for tuberculosis diagnosis: a systematic review and pairwise and network meta-analysis [^111Rv5jB]. The Lancet: Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that, compared with standard spot sputum collection, providing instructions or collecting a pooled sputum sample increased the odds of tuberculosis diagnosis in microscopy and culture by 1.6–1.8 times. It is unsurprising that diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis depends on the quality of the sputum sample tested. The effect of these simple, inexpensive strategies on diagnostic performance was similar to that of the relatively expensive GeneXpert MTB/RIF test, which, in the largest published studies, increased the odds of diagnosing tuberculosis by 1.3–1.5 times,(appendix p 14). Although molecular tests are useful in detecting drug resistance and in reducing the variability of interpretation by laboratory technicians, there seems to be more interest in developing and implementing new commercial tests than in strengthening existing methods. For example, a search of the PubMed database for studies published in the past 5 years suggests that, for tuberculosis diagnosis, 79 studies have focused on the effect of the GeneXpert MTB/RIF test, whereas only seven have focused on non-invasive sputum collection techniques (appendix p 15). Although these techniques relate to different aspects of the diagnostic pathway, and PubMed-indexed publications do not represent all tuberculosis-related publications, these comparisons suggest that increased attention and resources should be invested into studying how sputum is collected, alongside the development of new diagnostic products.

In 2007, the case definition of smear positivity changed to include cases with the presence of at least one acid-fast bacillus in at least one sputum sample. Although most studies did not define the threshold of positivity used in smear microscopy, we assumed that six studies done after 2007 would be affected by this change. The studies varied in the number of samples collected from each participant, so positivity in this analysis was, where possible, defined for each sample and not for individual cases, and ORs were calculated instead of sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, our meta-regression analyses showed that this change in the definition of smear positivity did not contribute to the heterogeneity within the study effect sizes, or the variability in the likelihood of a positive test demonstrated between the reference groups. A positive smear does not equate to a diagnosis of tuberculosis, as false-positive results arise because acid-fastness is not unique to M tuberculosis. Therefore, culture, which is unaffected by this change in definition for smear-positive microscopy, is the gold standard for confirming tuberculosis and showed similar results to microscopy in our meta-analyses.

TB diagnosis and treatment definition

We used the National TB control guideline of Ethiopia for diagnosis and treatment, case definition, and treatment outcomes.

Smear-positive pulmonary TB (PTB) is diagnosed with at least two positive initial sputum smears for Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) by direct microscopy, or one positive smear for AFB by direct microscopy and culture positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis or one positive smear for AFB by direct microscopy and radiographic abnormalities consistent with active TB as determined by a clinician. The laboratory keeps all positive and negative slides for external quality assurance. Quality assurance is performed regularly at the regional laboratory, and feedback is given to a reporting health facility. Previous studies reported a high specificity and good agreement of sputum-smear microscopy for AFB between peripheral and reference laboratories.

Smear-negative pulmonary TB (PTB) is diagnosed when the patient presents with symptoms suggestive of TB, has at least three initial smear examinations negative for AFB, no response to antibiotics, repeat smear-negative and radiological abnormalities consistent with pulmonary TB, as well as a clinician's decision.

Extra pulmonary TB (EPTB) is diagnosed by one culture-positive specimen from an extra pulmonary site or histopathological evidence from a biopsy, which is based on strong clinical evidence consistent with active EPTB by a clinician's decision. However, most health facilities diagnose the disease based on a clinician's decision because there are inadequate laboratory facilities for sputum culture or histopathology. The body sites for EPTB are lymph nodes, intestine, bone, kidney, central nervous system, and other organs.

A short-course treatment regimen is given in two phases with fixed-dose combination first-line anti-TB drugs. The intensive phase treatment lasts for two months with ethambutol (E), isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R) and pyrazinamide (Z) followed by a continuation phase of six-month with ethambutol and isoniazid. Since 2011, the continuation phase has lasted for four months, and uses isoniazid and rifampicin.

"Cured" is smear-positive TB patient who is sputum smear-negative at, or one 'month' prior to the completion of treatment and on at least one previous occasion.

"Treatment completed" is a TB patient who completed treatment but for whom smear results are not available one month prior to the completion of treatment.

"Treatment success" is patients who was declared "cured" or "treatment completed"

### Recurrent subclinical tuberculosis among antiretroviral therapy-accessing participants: incidence, clinical course, and outcomes [^115XnHNA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Smear-negative culture-positive TB accounted for 82.3% of all subclinical TB cases. These participants remained persistently AFB smear-negative and would go undetected in a programmatic setting given the absence of symptoms and bacteriologic TB culture results. Compared with clinical TB, sputum AFB smear positivity in only 17.6% of subclinical TB cases correlated with minimal radiologic findings and lower bacillary loads. However, time to sputum culture positivity among subclinical and clinical TB participants was similar, potentially reflecting similar bacterial burden and risk for onward transmission despite different TB disease phases. Thus, subclinical TB participants who harbor viable TB bacilli may represent an important source of community TB transmission.

While it is known that AFB smear positivity correlates with lung bacillary burden with important implications for onward transmission, the implication of persistent culture positivity and possible undetected intermittent sputum M.tb shedding on transmission risk remains poorly understood. The likelihood of onward transmission from paucibacillary asymptomatic TB is low. Despite this, the risk of transmission from subclinical TB is associated with the degree and duration of infectiousness and availability of susceptible contacts. This transmission risk is further augmented by duration of the subclinical TB phase. Frontline clinicians in TB-endemic settings often do not initiate TB treatment among stable asymptomatic bacteriologically confirmed TB patients. These healthcare professionals experience difficulty in deciding whether bacteriologic evidence of TB in largely asymptomatic patients warrants treatment and whether these patients require the full TB treatment regimen or TPT. Sputum positivity often arises from laboratory contamination or, as documented in children, may represent transient M.tb shedding rather than an incident M.tb infection. Contamination that led to an erroneous false-positive TB diagnosis was possible in only 1 subclinical TB participant. While our finding of TB drug resistance in approximately 18.8% of the recurrent TB cohort is not unexpected, we also identified 3 cases of drug-resistant subclinical TB, among whom 2 were multidrug-resistant. This underscores the importance of diagnosing and treating subclinical TB and suggests opportunities for TB drug-resistance acquisition in the subclinical TB state.

### Comparison of two methods for acquisition of sputum samples for diagnosis of suspected tuberculosis in smear-negative or sputum-scarce people: a randomised controlled trial [^1128GY7B]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Sputum obtained either under instruction from a health-care worker or through induction can improve case detection of active tuberculosis. However, the best initial sputum sampling strategy for adults with suspected smear-negative or sputum-scarce tuberculosis in primary care is unclear. We compared these two methods of sample acquisition in such patients.

Methods

In this randomised controlled trial, we enrolled adults (age ≥ 18 years) with sputum-scarce or smear-negative suspected tuberculosis from three primary care clinics in Cape Town, South Africa. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either health-care worker instruction or induction to obtain sputum samples. Neither patients nor investigators were masked to allocation. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who had started treatment after 8 weeks in a modified intention-to-treat population. Secondary outcomes were proportions starting treatment within different time periods, proportion of patients producing sputum for diagnosis, adverse effects, sputum samples' quality, and case detection by diagnostic method. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01545661.

Findings

We enrolled 481 patients, of whom 213 were assigned to health-care worker instruction versus 268 assigned to induction. The proportion of patients who started treatment in the 8 weeks after enrolment did not differ significantly between groups (53/213 [25%] vs 73/268 [27%]; OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.57–1.36; p = 0.56). A higher proportion of instructed versus induced patients initiated empiric treatment based on clinical and radiography findings (32/53 [60%] vs 28/73 [38%]; p = 0.015). An adequate sputum sample ≥ 1 mL was acquired in a lower proportion of instructed versus induced patients (164/213 [77%] vs 238/268 [89%]; p < 0.0001), and culture-based diagnostic yield was lower in instructed versus induced patients (24/213 [11%] vs 51/268 [19%]; p = 0.020). However, same-day tuberculosis case detection was similar in both groups using either smear microscopy (13/213 [6%] vs 22/268 [8%]; p = 0.38) or Xpert-MTB/RIF assay (13/89 [15%] vs 20/138 [14%]; p = 0.98). No serious adverse events occurred in either group; side-effects related to sample acquisition were reported in 32 of 268 (12%) patients who had sputum induction and none who had instruction. Cost per procedure was lower for instructed than for induced patients (US$2.14 vs US$7.88).

Interpretation

Although induction provides an adequate sample and a bacteriological diagnosis more frequently than instruction by a health-care worker, it is more costly, does not result in a higher proportion of same-day diagnoses, and-because of widespread empiric treatment-may not result in more patients starting treatment. Thus, health-care worker instruction might be the preferred strategy for initial collection of sputum samples in adults with suspected sputum-scarce or smear-negative tuberculosis in a high burden primary care setting.

### The acid-fast bacilli smear: hail and farewell [^115RA1bw]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Sputum samples were collected from each of nearly 3,000 consecutive patients being evaluated for possible tuberculosis. One aliquot was analyzed using semiquantitative nucleic acid amplification with GeneXpert MTB/RIF, and one was analyzed by conventional AFB smear microscopy and culture. Culture results were considered the gold standard for a diagnosis of tuberculosis.

The results were clear and convincing. Overall, 8.9% of patients provided samples that were culture positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Of those, 102 had AFB smear-positive sputum and 161 were smear negative. In addition, another 9% (265) of patients were culture positive for nontuberculous mycobacteria, and 82 of those patients were AFB smear positive. Overall, then, the sensitivity of AFB smear was 38.8%, and the specificity was 96.7%. This compares with a sensitivity of 74.1% and a specificity of 97.5% for Xpert. Notably, AFB smear sensitivity varied by time of collection (morning samples had greater yield than spot samples), but this was not true for Xpert. Results from Xpert were reported back to clinicians on average about 16 hours faster than results from AFB smears. Thus, Xpert results overall were more accurate, available more quickly, and less affected by several operational issues than were AFB smears.

This article amplifies results of many earlier, smaller, or laboratory-based studies that showed the promise of nucleic acid amplification-based tuberculosis diagnostics. Indeed, uptake of Xpert has been advancing around the world in both resource-rich and resource-limited settings and in countries with both high and low burdens of tuberculosis. Technological advances that will make it easier to use this test at the point of care will likely accelerate this trend. Still, there has been reluctance and even opposition to making this test the standard initial means of diagnosis for suspected pulmonary tuberculosis. Objections have been raised that the test is too costly, requires too much maintenance, does not provide information regarding infectiousness, and does not allow a clinician to assess response to therapy in the way that a decreasing AFB smear grade does. In addition, an early paper noted that introduction of Xpert in South Africa had not resulted in a decrease in TB mortality in the communities in which it was being used, although there was realization that this was mostly a systems issue.

### TB or not TB? Development and validation of a clinical decision support system to inform airborne isolation requirements in the evaluation of suspected tuberculosis [^114hiHFv]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The study objective was to develop and validate a clinical decision support system (CDSS) to guide clinicians through the diagnostic evaluation of hospitalized individuals with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in low-prevalence settings.

Methods

The "TBorNotTB" CDSS was developed using a modified Delphi method. The CDSS assigns points based on epidemiologic risk factors, TB history, symptoms, chest imaging, and sputum/bronchoscopy results. Below a set point threshold, airborne isolation precautions are automatically discontinued; otherwise, additional evaluation, including infection control review, is recommended. The model was validated through retrospective application of the CDSS to all individuals hospitalized in the Mass General Brigham system from July 2016 to December 2022 with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB (cases) and equal numbers of age and date of testing-matched controls with three negative respiratory mycobacterial cultures.

Results

104 individuals with TB (cases) and 104 controls were identified. Prior residence in a highly endemic country, positive interferon release assay, weight loss, absence of symptom resolution with treatment for alternative diagnoses, and findings concerning for TB on chest imaging were significant predictors of TB (all P < 0.05). CDSS contents and scoring were refined based on the case-control analysis. The final CDSS demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 27% specificity for TB with an AUC of 0.87.

Conclusions

The TBorNotTB CDSS demonstrated modest specificity and high sensitivity to detect TB even when AFB smears were negative. This CDSS, embedded into the electronic medical record system, could help reduce risks of nosocomial TB transmission, patient-time in airborne isolation, and person-time spent reviewing individuals with suspected TB.

### Defining the role of cellular immune signatures in diagnostic evaluation of suspected tuberculosis [^116VVA7a]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

In high-income, low-incidence regions, including Europe and North America, the proportion of active tuberculosis (TB) cases that are paucibacillary and/or extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) is large and rising. These clinical presentations usually necessitate invasive sampling, typically bronchoalveolar lavage (for paucibacillary pulmonary TB and biopsies for EPTB). Moreover, clinical samples are commonly Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) culture-negative and acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear-negative, which makes diagnosis clinically challenging, prolongs duration of hospital admission, and delays treatment initiation. Hence, there is an important unmet clinical need for a rapid, noninvasive blood test with sufficient specificity to rule-in paucibacillary and EPTB.

A rational approach to detect TB infection in paucibacillary cases is to use tests measuring the Mtb-specific adaptive immune response, which provides an amplified signal of a low bacillary burden infection. Measuring such responses is possible from blood samples, obviating the need for invasive sampling. Available immune tests for TB include the interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), which are commonly used in the diagnostic work-up of active TB; indeed, the sensitivity of currently available and next-generation IGRAs far exceeds that of culture. However, IGRAs lack specificity for diagnosing active TB because they also score positive in patients with non-TB illness who have incidental, concomitant latent TB infection (LTBI). More sophisticated tests measuring additional aspects of cell-mediated immune responses to Mtb may provide improved specificity. Indeed, certain cellular immune signatures, based on detection of Mtb-specific T cells by flow cytometry, are sufficiently different between active TB and LTBI to discriminate between the two. This provides important proof-of-principle that such signatures might be used as follow-on tests after a positive IGRA result during diagnostic work-up to determine whether the Mtb infection is active or not. Although 2 of the signatures have been corroborated in independent study populations, all studies to date have utilized preselected individuals and case-control study designs in which healthy LTBI individuals served as controls. None of these promising signatures have been evaluated in routine clinical practice where patients present with suspected (but not yet confirmed) active TB and therefore include individuals with non-TB illnesses that clinically mimic TB. Furthermore, the patient group that would benefit from these new tests has not been identified. Therefore, we determined to rigorously evaluate the ability of cellular immune signatures to distinguish patients with active TB from those with non-TB illnesses and concomitant LTBI in a clinically relevant population in real-life clinical practice. Our study population therefore comprised patients who tested IGRA-positive within a large, prospective, multicenter cohort of patients presenting with suspected active TB representing the full, natural clinical spectrum of TB (including a large proportion with EPTB) and non-TB illnesses that clinically mimic TB.

### Impact of geneXpert MTB / RIF assay on triage of respiratory isolation rooms for inpatients with presumed tuberculosis: a hypothetical trial [^1118sLak]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Placing inpatients with presumed active pulmonary tuberculosis in respiratory isolation pending results of serial sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear microscopy is standard practice in high-income countries. However, this diagnostic strategy is slow and yields few tuberculosis diagnoses. We sought to determine if replacing microscopy with the GeneXpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) nucleic acid amplification assay could reduce testing time and usage of isolation rooms.

Methods

We prospectively followed inpatients at San Francisco General Hospital undergoing tuberculosis evaluation. We performed smear microscopy and Xpert testing on concentrated sputum, and calculated diagnostic accuracy for both strategies in reference to serial sputum mycobacterial culture. We measured turnaround time for microscopy and estimated hypothetical turnaround times for Xpert on concentrated and unconcentrated sputum. We compared median and total isolation times for microscopy to those estimated for the 2 Xpert strategies.

Results

Among 139 patients with 142 admissions, median age was 54 years (interquartile range [IQR], 43–60 years); 32 (23%) patients were female, and 42 (30%) were HIV seropositive. Serial sputum smear microscopy and a single concentrated sputum Xpert had identical sensitivity (89%; 95% confidence interval, 52%-100%) and similar specificity (99% [95% CI, 96%-100%] vs 100% [95% CI, 97%-100%]). A single concentrated sputum Xpert could have saved a median of 35 hours (IQR, 24–36 hours) in unnecessary isolation compared with microscopy, and a single unconcentrated sputum Xpert, 45 hours (IQR, 35–46 hours).

Conclusions

Replacing serial sputum smear microscopy with a single sputum Xpert could eliminate most unnecessary isolation for inpatients with presumed tuberculosis, greatly benefiting patients and hospitals.

### Reply to parker: implications of tuberculosis sputum culture test sensitivity on accuracy of other diagnostic modalities [^114qqnAp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

From the Authors:

We welcome the interest shown by Dr. Parker in our recent publication that described the yield and efficiency of novel intensified tuberculosis (TB) case-finding algorithms for people living with HIV. We agree that sputum mycobacterial culture has imperfect sensitivity for active pulmonary TB. Nonetheless, culture is the best available microbiological reference standard for evaluation of novel TB diagnostics. The addition of clinical follow-up can be helpful but also has limitations. For example, in the context of our study, initiation of antiretroviral therapy complicates assessment of whether clinical and radiological improvements are a result of TB treatment. Furthermore, in most TB-endemic areas, culture is not routinely available for TB diagnosis, and Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) is used as the confirmatory TB test. In such settings, all patients with a positive Xpert result are in fact regarded as a TB case and initiated on TB treatment.

If we consider all Xpert-positive patients to be true positives, as suggested by Dr. Parker and as occurs in routine clinical practice, our study conclusions would remain unchanged: 1) CRP (C-reactive protein)-based TB screening followed by Xpert confirmatory testing would identify a similar proportion of TB cases as the current intensified case-finding (ICF) algorithm (54% [95% confidence interval (CI), 45–63] vs. 58% [95% CI, 49–66]; difference in yield 4% [95% CI, −9% to +16%]; P = 0.57); 2) CRP-based ICF would use less than half as many Xpert assays (9 vs. 4); and 3) the addition of a single culture would substantially increase ICF yield, detecting ≥ 77% of all TB cases, regardless of the screening strategy used. Thus, we believe HIV programs should first consider implementation of CRP-based TB screening, which may then enable the routine use of more sensitive confirmatory tests, such as culture, to improve ICF yield.

### TB or not TB? Development and validation of a clinical decision support system to inform airborne isolation requirements in the evaluation of suspected tuberculosis [^113UY5jA]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Achieving Delphi consensus for the initial model

We drafted a clinical scoring system incorporating epidemiological characteristics, medical conditions known to increase the risk of TB, symptoms, and the results of diagnostic testing, including tuberculin skin tests (TSTs), interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), lower respiratory tract specimens (AFB smear and NAAT), and chest imaging (Figure 1, Table 1). Each component of the scoring system (ie, chest imaging, epidemiology, history of active or latent TB, past medical history, symptoms, and sputum/bronchoscopy results) was given a minimum and maximum score; scores were summed across components to produce a total score.

Components of the final (Revised) TBorNotTB CDSS scoring system

TB: TB; IGRA: interferon gamma release assay; AFB: acid fast bacilli; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; CT: computed tomography; CXR: chest radiograph.

During the Delphi process, infectious disease physicians provided insights on the consistency of the CDSS with clinical judgment. IPC staff provided guidance regarding elements of the patient's history often lacking in the medical record at the time of individualized assessment to ensure collection of these details by the tool. MGB Digital Health information technology specialists contributed expertise around structured data collection and technical constraints.

Improving usability of the initial model

Usability of the tool, focused on minimizing redundancy and maximizing clarity, was prioritized. Questions in the tool were reordered such that if the user indicated that there was no available chest radiology result at the time of CDSS activation, it would advise obtaining such imaging and returning to the tool without requiring the user to respond to the other questions. Branching logic was employed to display only questions that followed logically from previous responses; help text was added for clarity. For example, when asking about whether an individual's symptoms have resolved or markedly improved with treatment for an alternative diagnosis and without any medications active against TB, a list of specific medications active against TB was added. Finally, the group reviewed the tool to ensure person-first language, formatting of epidemiologic questions to minimize stigma, and consideration of equity in the application of the tool to individuals from diverse backgrounds.

### TB or not TB? Development and validation of a clinical decision support system to inform airborne isolation requirements in the evaluation of suspected tuberculosis [^116hEUmy]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We developed and validated a novel real-time CDSS (TBorNotTB) to guide clinicians through the diagnostic evaluation of hospitalized individuals with suspected pulmonary TB in low-prevalence settings. We found that prior residence in a TB endemic country, positive IGRA, weight loss, continuation of symptoms despite treatment for alternative diagnoses, and findings concerning for TB on chest imaging were significant predictors of TB. CDSS contents and scoring were iteratively refined based on Delphi consensus and the case–control analysis. The revised CDSS demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 27% specificity to detect TB among hospitalized patients in a low-prevalence setting.

TB incidence in the US is on the rise. Concurrently, many hospitals across the US are experiencing capacity crises, making the expeditious evaluation of persons with possible infectious pulmonary TB even more urgent to preserve limited AII rooms. To provide guideline-recommended evaluation, optimize facility resources, and mitigate risk of nosocomial transmission, it is essential to determine when TB has been excluded with a high degree of confidence. AFB smears of respiratory specimens have limited sensitivity, even when multiple samples are submitted. NAATs improve sensitivity, but some individuals with culture-positive TB still have negative NAATs. Discontinuation of AII for TB often requires review by IPC personnel, but many facilities do not have adequate IPC personnel. Individualized review of patients with suspected TB, as well as contact tracing in the setting of nosocomial exposures, are very time- and resource-intensive endeavors for an already overstretched IP workforce. –

CDSS like TBorNotTB can support infection control activities by serving a range of functions, including packaging data for public health reporting, swiftly isolating and efficiently deisolating patients, triaging patients for testing and/or prophylactic treatment, and reducing cognitive and documentation burden for frontline clinicians. CDSS for infection control can also optimize hospital bed use and other resources. CDSS tools have been developed and deployed to support timely and appropriate deisolation for COVID-19 and suspected COVID-19, to support test-based clearance for MRSA and VRE, to screen patients for Ebola virus disease based on travel history and public health advisory, and to evaluate and recommend isolation, testing, and prophylactic treatment for patients with suspected mpox. Unlike paper-based tools, digital EHR-based tools to facilitate guideline-based infection control practice can be updated in real time to align with evolving science and policy, including in the context of emerging infectious diseases.

### Tuberculous pleuritis: clinical presentations and diagnostic challenges [^111r7jG5]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

DIAGNOSTIC INVESTIGATION TO CONFIRM TUBERCULOUS PLEURITIS

An ideal test to confirm TBP should be able to detect TB bacteria or its specific subunits directly in pleural specimens and identify the drug sensitivity pattern with a short turnaround time. However, due to the paucibacillary nature of TBP, conventional microbiological tests (AFB smear and TB culture) of pleural fluid have low sensitivity.

Therefore, the diagnosis of TBP in real-life practice is often classified as definite or probable TBP based on the level of certainty of diagnosis. Definite TBP is defined by the microbiological confirmation of MTB in the pleural fluid or tissue, compatible histopathological findings from the pleural tissue, or positive sputum TB culture with improvement of the pleural effusion after TB treatment. Probable TBP refers to a composite of clinical or laboratory parameters after excluding alternative diagnoses, and appropriate clinical improvement with empirical TB treatment.

Microbiological and histological examination of pleural fluid and tissue

Diagnostic yield of pleural fluid AFB smear is low: less than 5% in HIV-negative, less than 18% in HIV-positive patients with TBP. Mycobacterial culture is positive in only 30–50% of pleural fluid, although the yield can be optimized by inoculating the fluid into a liquid medium. Culture of pleural tissue, for example from pleuroscopy, has a higher yield. However, the long turnaround time for mycobacterial culture of 6–8 weeks often delays treatment. Direct visual inspection of the pleura for common changes of TBP (such as sago-like nodules) has been used to guide empirical treatment in TB-endemic areas, although the gain in time is small as the detection of caseating granuloma on histology usually only takes one or two days. Combining histological interpretation and TB culture from pleural tissue can further improve the diagnostic yield.

### New recommendations for duration of respiratory isolation based on time to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis in liquid culture [^117HETYF]. The European Respiratory Journal (2007). Low credibility.

It was hypothesised that the time to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis in liquid culture of sputum from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis may be a better indicator for the duration of respiratory isolation than sputum smear status. Pre-treatment and during-treatment sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture results were reviewed in 284 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. The time to detect M. tuberculosis in liquid culture (TTD-TB) was the number of days from inoculation of the Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube to culture detection and visualisation of AFB. The median (interquartile range) TTD-TB for smear group 0 (no bacilli seen) was 14 (12–20) days. This value was used as the standard at which release from isolation could be permitted. In smear group 4 (> 9 AFB per high-power field (hpf) in sputum specimens before treatment) patients, the TTD-TB exceeded 14 days after a median of 25 days of treatment. The current authors recommend that patients in smear groups 1 and 2 (1–9 AFB per 100 hpf and 1–9 AFB per 10 hpf in sputum specimens before treatment, respectively) receive treatment in respiratory isolation for 7 days, provided the risk of drug resistance is low. Smear group 3 (1–9 AFB per hpf) and 4 patients should receive treatment in respiratory isolation for 14 and 25 days, respectively. These criteria would have reduced the duration of respiratory isolation by 1,516 days in the 143 study participants with sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. Provided clinical and radiographical criteria are satisfactory, use of the time to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis in liquid culture could enable the duration of respiratory isolation to be predicted from the pre-treatment sputum smear grade. The recommendations enable isolation to end well before sputum becomes smear negative, with considerable benefits to patients and healthcare providers.

### Nontuberculous mycobacteria, Zambia [^113d9inR]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a problem of enormous dimensions in Africa, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the most important causative agent. However, in industrialized countries, nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) also play a key role in etiology of TB-like syndromes. In Africa, the contribution of NTM to such disease has been examined on a small scale only.

Zambia is a country with historically high prevalence rates of TB. Patients with acid-fast bacilli (AFB)–positive sputum, or those with chest radiographic findings suggestive of active TB, who do not respond to general antimicrobial drugs, are generally presumed to have pulmonary TB. In general, these patients are treated empirically for 6 months with a combination of drugs recommended by the World Health Organization. However, several TB-like syndromes in Africa could be caused by NTM. Thus, inconclusive diagnosis of pulmonary TB would lead to overdiagnosis of TB and in some cases, to inappropriate treatment for NTM infections.

When NTM are isolated from a usually sterile site (e.g. blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes, synovial fluid), diagnosis of true disease is generally straightforward. However, when NTM are isolated from nonsterile sources, such as sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage samples, the diagnosis is less definitive, especially when the colony numbers are low or NTM are isolated from only 1 cultured specimen. Therefore, it is a challenge to differentiate true NTM lung disease from contamination and colonization. Thus, finding AFB by microscopy of respiratory specimens or by culture may pose a diagnostic problem for the clinician. In 1997, the American Thoracic Society (ATS), published useful criteria for determining the clinical relevance of NTM isolates. In 2007, the ATS guidelines were revised to include more lenient diagnostic criteria. Clinical criteria include a symptomatic patient with pulmonary symptoms, nodular or cavitary opacities on chest radiographs, or a high-resolution computed tomography scan that shows multifocal bronchiectasis with multiple small nodules. In addition, the microbiologic criteria comprise positive culture results from > 2 separate sputum samples, or positive culture results from > 1 bronchial wash or lavage, or a lung biopsy specimen with mycobacterial histopathologic features (granulomatous inflammation or AFB) and positive culture for NTM, or lung biopsy specimen showing mycobacterial histopathologic features and > 1 sputum or bronchial washing culture positive for NTM.

### BCG vaccination status may predict sputum conversion in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis: a new consideration for an old vaccine? [^113Rw4zU]. Thorax (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Failure to convert (persistent sputum and/or culture positivity) while on antituberculosis (anti-TB) treatment at the end of the second month of anti-TB therapy has been reported to be a predictor of treatment failure. Factors that could be associated with persistent bacillary positivity at the end of the second month after initiation of anti-TB treatment were assessed.

Methods

A prospective cohort study was conducted in 754 patients with sputum culture positive pulmonary TB in Mwanza, Tanzania. Information on social demographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements, BCG scar status, HIV status, CD4+ count, white blood cell count, haemoglobin and sputum culture status was obtained.

Results

Factors associated with sputum culture non-conversion at the end of the second month of anti-TB treatment were initial acid-fast bacilli (AFB) culture grading of 3+ (OR 5.70, 95% CI 1.34 to 24.31, p = 0.02) and absence of a BCG scar (OR 3.35, 95% CI 1.48 to 7.58, p = 0.004).

Conclusion

Patients with pulmonary TB with no BCG scar and high initial AFB sputum intensity are at risk of remaining sputum culture positive at the end of the second month of anti-TB treatment. These findings reflect a beneficial role for BCG vaccination on sputum conversion which should also be examined in large studies in other areas. The finding of a beneficial role for BCG vaccination on the treatment of pulmonary TB is important for TB control and vaccination programmes.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 1600 Clifton Rd. Atlanta, GA 30329, USA 800-INFO TTY: 232–6348 After collection, specimens are sent to a laboratory for examination. Using a microscope, laboratory personnel look for AFB. If AFB are found on a sputum smear, it often indicates TB disease. However, a positive smear does not confirm a diagnosis of TB because some stained mycobacteria are not M. tuberculosis. Additionally, smear negative results do not exclude TB disease. This is because it is possible to have AFB in the smear that were not seen. All specimens should be cultured, regardless of whether the smear is positive or negative. Culturing the specimen is necessary to determine if it contains M. tuberculosis.

### Tuberculosis technical instructions for panel physicians… [^111ezySG]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Sputum Testing Sputum Collection and Transport
- Laboratory examination for infectious tuberculosis disease must consist of at least three sputum specimens. Each specimen must undergo microscopy for AFB as well as culture for mycobacteria, confirmation of the Mycobacteriumspecies at least to the M. tuberculosiscomplex level, and DST for cultures positive for M. tuberculosiscomplex. A molecular test must be performed on the first sputum specimen for all applicants from whom sputum is collected. Sputum Smears Sputum specimens must undergo centrifugation before smears are performed. Applicants who have sputum smears that are positive for AFB by microscopy should be started on treatment for infectious tuberculosis disease. If molecular testing on smear-positive specimens is negative, panel physicians may wait to start treatment until culture results are reported if, in their clinical judgment, the applicant might not have infectious tuberculosis disease.

Culture and Drug Susceptibility Testing All sputum specimens must be cultured for mycobacteria and confirmation of the Mycobacterium species, at least to the M. tuberculosis complex level. All positive cultures must undergo DST for isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide and a fluoroquinolone. All sputum specimens must be cultured for mycobacteria and confirmation of the Mycobacterium species, at least to the. Specimens must be incubated for a minimum of 6 weeks for liquid cultures and 8 weeks for solid cultures, before a final negative report can be issued. Positive cultures must be reported as soon as the results are known.
- Positive M. tuberculosiscultures must undergo DST for isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide and a fluoroquinolone. Panel physicians must have access to DST results within 10 weeks of sputum collection.
- Applicants who have negative sputum smears and cultures but have one of the cultures reported as "contaminated" may still be cleared for travel. When applicants have 2 or more contaminated cultures, panel sites and their designated laboratories should review their procedures and collect three additional sputum specimens from the applicant for AFB smear and culture.

Sputum Testing Sputum Collection and Transport
- Laboratory examination for infectious tuberculosis disease must consist of at least three sputum specimens. Each specimen must undergo microscopy for AFB as well as culture for mycobacteria, confirmation of the Mycobacteriumspecies at least to the M. tuberculosiscomplex level, and DST for cultures positive for M. tuberculosiscomplex. A molecular test must be performed on the first sputum specimen for all applicants from whom sputum is collected. Sputum Smears Centrifuge sputum specimens before smears are performed. Applicants who have sputum smears that are positive for AFB by microscopy should be started on treatment for infectious tuberculosis disease. If molecular testing on smear-positive specimens is negative, panel physicians may wait to start treatment until culture results are reported if, in their clinical judgment, the applicant might not have infectious tuberculosis disease.

Culture and Drug Susceptibility Testing All sputum specimens must be cultured for mycobacteria and confirmation of the Mycobacterium species, at least to the. M. tuberculosis complex level. A total of 3 cultures must be performed for each of the three sputum samples, which must include two solid cultures and one liquid culture. Löwenstein–Jensen media must be used for solid cultures and mycobacterial growth indicator tube media must be used for the liquid cultures. Specimens must be incubated for a minimum of 6 weeks for liquid cultures and 8 weeks for solid cultures, before a final negative report can be issued. Positive cultures must be reported as soon as the results are known.
- Positive M. tuberculosiscultures must undergo culture-based DST for isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide and a fluoroquinolone.

Panel physicians must have access to DST results within 10 weeks of sputum collection.
- Applicants who have negative sputum smears and cultures but have one of the cultures reported as "contaminated" may still be cleared for travel. When applicants have 2 or more contaminated cultures, panel sites and their designated laboratories should review their procedures and collect three additional sputum specimens from the applicant for AFB smear and culture.
