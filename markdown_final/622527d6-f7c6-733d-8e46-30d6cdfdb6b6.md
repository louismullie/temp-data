## Question

2. A.P. is a 35-year-old woman admitted to the ICU for an acute asthma exacerbation. She was intubated and required mechanical ventilation. She is prescribed morphine for pain control. Which best describes the effect of mechanical ventilation on morphine unbound concentrations?

A. Increases oxygenation delivery to the liver and increases the unbound concentration.

B. Decreases hepatic blood flow and increases the unbound concentration.

C. Increases cytokine production and decreases the unbound concentration.

D. Cannot affect the unbound concentration.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how mechanical ventilation affects morphine unbound (free) concentrations in a critically ill, mechanically ventilated patient. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetic determinants of unbound drug, especially hepatic clearance and protein binding. Then, I should verify how mechanical ventilation alters hepatic perfusion and whether that impacts high-extraction drugs like morphine. Next, I will examine the clinical evidence in ICU patients, including any direct or indirect data on unbound fractions. Finally, I will synthesize the mechanism and choose the best answer among the options, while double-checking for confounders like renal function and protein binding changes in critical illness.

> Let me first confirm the core pharmacokinetic principle: for a high hepatic extraction drug like morphine, total clearance is primarily flow-limited, so a reduction in hepatic blood flow decreases clearance and increases exposure, which in turn can raise unbound concentrations if protein binding is unchanged or altered unfavorably in critical illness [^111CkRKX] [^111CkRKX].

> Wait, let me verify the hemodynamic effect of mechanical ventilation. Positive pressure ventilation reduces venous return and cardiac output, thereby decreasing hepatic perfusion; this is a consistent physiological effect in ventilated patients and is particularly relevant for high-extraction drugs cleared by the liver, including morphine [^111CkRKX].

> I should confirm the clinical relevance in ICU cohorts. In critically ill adults, morphine clearance is substantially reduced compared with healthy volunteers, and this reduction tracks with illness severity and organ dysfunction; while most studies quantify total exposure, the flow-limited nature of morphine implies that reduced hepatic perfusion from positive pressure ventilation contributes to higher unbound concentrations when dosing and protein binding are otherwise similar [^112jpioV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about protein binding. I initially thought mechanical ventilation might directly increase the unbound fraction by altering albumin or alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, but I need to check whether the provided sources substantiate that. I don't see direct evidence here that ventilation itself changes protein binding; the dominant, reference-supported mechanism is reduced hepatic blood flow impairing clearance of a high-extraction opioid, which would increase unbound concentrations at a given dose, especially as illness progresses [^111CkRKX] [^112jpioV].

> Let me consider the options carefully. Option A claims increased oxygen delivery to the liver increases unbound concentration; that conflates oxygenation with perfusion and is not supported here. Option C proposes increased cytokines decrease unbound concentration, which contradicts the expected direction of effect and lacks supporting evidence in this context. Option D asserts no effect, which ignores the well-described hemodynamic impact of ventilation on hepatic blood flow and high-extraction clearance. Option B correctly identifies decreased hepatic blood flow from mechanical ventilation as the mechanism that increases unbound morphine concentrations in this setting [^111CkRKX].

> I should double-check for confounders that could modify this interpretation. Renal impairment and critical illness independently reduce morphine and metabolite clearance, and protein binding can be altered in sepsis and low albumin states, but the question is specifically about the effect of mechanical ventilation itself; the most direct, reference-supported effect of ventilation here is reduced hepatic perfusion leading to increased unbound concentrations via impaired clearance of a high-extraction drug [^112jpioV] [^111CkRKX].

> Final answer: B. Decreases hepatic blood flow and increases the unbound concentration. Positive pressure ventilation reduces cardiac output and hepatic perfusion, and because morphine is a high hepatic extraction drug, decreased hepatic blood flow lowers clearance and increases unbound concentrations at a given dose [^111CkRKX].

---

The correct answer is **B. Decreases hepatic blood flow and increases the unbound concentration**. Mechanical ventilation reduces hepatic perfusion, which impairs morphine clearance and increases unbound (active) morphine concentrations, raising the risk of respiratory depression and sedation. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because ventilation does not increase hepatic oxygen delivery, cytokines do not reduce unbound morphine, and ventilation can indeed alter unbound concentrations via hepatic blood flow effects.

---

## Pharmacokinetics of morphine

Morphine is a **high hepatic extraction drug** cleared primarily by hepatic metabolism via glucuronidation to morphine-3-glucuronide (inactive) and morphine-6-glucuronide (active) [^112jpioV]. Hepatic clearance is highly dependent on hepatic blood flow; reduced flow increases unbound morphine and prolongs its effects [^notfound].

---

## Effects of mechanical ventilation on hepatic blood flow

Mechanical ventilation, especially with positive pressure, reduces venous return and cardiac output, thereby **decreasing hepatic blood flow**. This impairs clearance of high-extraction drugs like morphine, increasing unbound concentrations and drug effects [^111CkRKX].

---

## Impact on morphine unbound concentrations

Reduced hepatic blood flow from mechanical ventilation **increases unbound morphine** by decreasing hepatic clearance, which elevates active drug levels and the risk of respiratory depression and sedation [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications

Increased unbound morphine in ventilated patients heightens the risk of:

- **Respiratory depression**: Particularly dangerous in asthma exacerbations [^115y3PWb].
- **Sedation**: Prolonged sedation delays extubation and recovery [^notfound].
- **Accumulation of active metabolites**: Morphine-6-glucuronide can accumulate, especially with renal impairment, increasing toxicity [^112jpioV].

---

## Clinical management considerations

Given these risks, clinicians should:

- **Use the lowest effective morphine dose** and titrate carefully.
- **Monitor for respiratory depression and sedation** closely.
- **Consider alternative opioids** (e.g. fentanyl) with less hepatic metabolism or different pharmacokinetics in high-risk patients [^111jtzVh].

---

## Conclusion

Mechanical ventilation **reduces hepatic blood flow**, impairs morphine clearance, and increases unbound morphine concentrations, which amplifies respiratory depression and sedation risks. Clinicians should adjust dosing and monitor patients closely to mitigate these effects.

### New insights into the comparative effectiveness of fentanyl and morphine infusions in ICU patients [^111jtzVh]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Invasively mechanically ventilated ICU patients often receive opioids to alleviate pain and discomfort. Fentanyl and morphine are the opioids used most commonly for this purpose. These medicines are often given by infusion in combination with sedatives. The comparative effectiveness of these drugs on ventilator-free days in invasively mechanically ventilated adults has not been evaluated previously.

In this issue of the Journal, Casamento and colleagues (pp.) report the findings of an open-label, two-center, cluster crossover randomized clinical trial comparing the effect of using morphine infusions versus fentanyl infusions on alive ventilator-free days to Day 28. A total of 681 patients from two Australian ICUs were included in the primary analysis, with 344 assigned to fentanyl and 337 assigned to morphine. At Day 28 after ICU admission, median ventilator-free days were 26.1 (20.7–27.3) and 25.3 (19.1–27.2) for fentanyl and morphine patients, respectively (median difference, 0.79 [95% confidence interval, 0.31–1.28]; P = 0.001). This effect appeared to be driven by a greater number days spent alive and ventilator-free among older patients and those with renal impairment who were allocated to fentanyl. Despite heterogeneity of treatment effect, there were no patient subgroups in which point estimates of the effect on ventilator-free days favored morphine. In-hospital mortality to Day 28 was lower in patients assigned to fentanyl, although not statistically significantly so.

For trials that compare the effectiveness of standard therapies, subtle shifts in the probability that one treatment is superior to another may be sufficient to favor one treatment over another. Accordingly, as no patient groups seemed to do better with morphine, the data from this trial provide a reasonable basis for using fentanyl infusions in preference to morphine in invasively mechanically ventilated adults in ICU who require such drugs by infusion. However, the choice of the two drugs studied can be debated. Morphine is conjugated in the liver to biologically active metabolites, which are cleared by the kidney. Fentanyl is distributed to lipid-rich tissues and can accumulate prolonging its elimination. Although differences in pharmacokinetic profiles of morphine and fentanyl might explain the observed differences in the current trial, both morphine and fentanyl have relatively long elimination half-lives when administered by infusion for prolonged periods. Shorter-acting opioids such as sufentanil or remifentanil may provide more rapid recovery after prolonged intravenous infusion because of their shorter elimination half-life.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that sedatives, alone or together with opioids, do not decrease asynchronies beyond what can be achieved with opioids alone, independently of MV mode. Optimal titration of opioids might improve patient-ventilator interaction while avoiding the deleterious effects of sedatives.

### Could remifentanil reduce duration of mechanical ventilation in comparison with other opioids for mechanically ventilated patients? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113SJRqC]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pain and anxiety are among the worst experiences for the critically ill, especially those on mechanical ventilation. Mechanically ventilated patients generally require a combination of analgesia and sedation to improve compliance with mechanical ventilation, adaption to endotracheal tubes, and pain relief. Propofol and midazolam have been identified as the hypnotic drugs most commonly used for sedation in the intensive care unit (ICU), and among sedatives, shorter elimination half-lives are associated with shorter awakening times, resulting in reductions in time to weaning and time to extubation. Opioids are commonly used in the ICU for analgesia, and the accumulation of opioid agents may cause respiratory depression, thus leading to prolongation of time to weaning and extubation.

Studies have found the most frequently used opioids to be fentanyl (30–35%), morphine (15–33%), and sufentanil (25–40%), the specific proportions of which differ in the results of different surveys, with remifentanil being less commonly used (10%). However, the use of opioids may not be ideal in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients. The renal metabolism of morphine results in accumulation of morphine-6-glucuronide in patients with renal impairment. In addition, common adverse effects of morphine include histamine release, pruritus, and constipation. Fentanyl, alfentanil and sufentanil undergo hepatic metabolism, and continuous infusion results in accumulation and prolongation of effect. Those pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles have disadvantages in terms of rapid weaning and extubation.

Results

Out of the 30 patients primary screened for the study, 5 declined participation, and 8 died before entering the trial. Due to the observed, bigger than expected, differences in VAS scores between the two study arms, the trial needed to be stopped, ethically, after 10 of 11 admitted patients completed study protocol Table 1 i.e. after reaching calculated sample size. One patient developed infective COPD exacerbation on the second day of trial during 0.9% NaCl nebulization phase and was excluded from the analysis. Two patients were included into the study in spite of higher values of FEV1% (35,5% and 31% – as assessed, consecutively, 3 and 5 months before the study). At the time of screening they were unable to perform dynamic spirometry due to the steady progress of the disease. Standard COPD treatment remained unchanged during the study and each patient received maximum COPD treatment.

### A phase II cluster-crossover randomized trial of fentanyl versus morphine for analgosedation in mechanically ventilated patients [^114pCU1m]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale: The continuous infusion of fentanyl or morphine is often prescribed to assist with analgesia and sedation (analgosedation) during mechanical ventilation. Objectives: To compare the effect of fentanyl versus morphine on patient-centered outcomes in ventilated patients. Methods: We conducted a cluster-randomized, cluster-crossover trial between July 2019 and August 2020 in two adult ICUs. We compared two continuous infusion regimens (fentanyl versus morphine). One ICU was randomized to the fentanyl-morphine sequence and the other to the morphine-fentanyl sequence. The primary outcome was the number of ventilator-free days at Day 28. Secondary outcomes included, among others, duration of mechanical ventilation in survivors and ICU-free days at Day 28. Measurements and Main Results: Via cluster allocation, we randomized 737 patients. Of these, 56 were excluded because of the opt-out consent process, leaving 681 (344 to fentanyl and 337 to morphine) for primary analysis (median [interquartile range] age, 59 [44–69] years). Median ventilator-free days at Day 28 were 26.1 (20.7–27.3) in the fentanyl versus 25.3 (19.1–27.2) in the morphine group (median difference, 0.79 [95% confidence interval, 0.31 to 1.28], P = 0.001). ICU-free days were greater (P < 0.001) and length of stay in the ICU for survivors shorter (P < 0.001) in the fentanyl group. All other secondary outcomes were not statistically different by treatment group. Conclusions: Among adult patients requiring mechanical ventilation, compared with morphine, fentanyl infusion significantly increased the median number of ventilator-free days at Day 28. The choice of opioid infusion agent may affect clinical outcomes and requires further investigation.

### Intravenous opioid administration during mechanical ventilation and use after hospital discharge [^1165Q8fJ]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are the administration of intravenous opioids during mechanical ventilation and the dose given associated with opioid use following hospitalization in medical (nonsurgical) patients?

Findings

In this cohort study of 6746 critically ill patients who received mechanical ventilation across 21 hospitals, patients receiving higher doses of intravenous opioids during mechanical ventilation had significantly increased risks of posthospitalization opioid use.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that intravenous opioids administered during critical illness may be associated with opioid use after hospital discharge and that additional studies of intensive care unit opioid stewardship are needed.

5.6	Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia

Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence (9.3)].

Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior.

Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.14)].

5.7	Risk of Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients

The use of MS CONTIN in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.

Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: MS CONTIN-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of MS CONTIN [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients as they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Regularly evaluate patients, particularly when initiating and titrating MS CONTIN and when MS CONTIN is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Interactions (7)]. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.

### Low dose of morphine to relieve dyspnea in acute respiratory failure: the opiDys double-blind randomized controlled trial [^113ZKiA4]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Trial design

This is a single-center phase 2 double-blind randomized controlled trial conducted in a 22-bed medical ICU within La Pitié-Salpêtrière University Hospital in Paris, France. The trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board (South Mediterranean III Comité de Protection des Personnes on December 5, 2019, no. 19.10.24.60836). All patients or relatives provided written informed consent. The protocol was declared on the ClinicalTrial.gov database (no. NCT04358133) and was published in September 2022.

Participants

Eligibility criteria were patients on standard oxygen, high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation who fulfilled all the following criteria, 1) admitted to the ICU for an ARF defined as a respiratory rate > 24/min or signs of respiratory distress such as labored breathing or paradoxical inspiration, or SpO2 < 90% in ambient air; 2) with dyspnea ≥ 40 mm on a VAS for dyspnea (dyspnea-VAS) from zero (no dyspnea) to 100 mm (worst imaginable dyspnea) despite the department's usual measures: analgesic and anxiolytic treatment, reassurance, etiological treatment of ARF, and non-invasive respiratory support; 3) with age between 18 and 75 years; 4) Richmond agitation and sedation scale (RASS) between 0 and +2; 5) who presented no confusion, as defined by the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU (CAM-ICU); 6) who provided informed consent or for whom consent could be obtained from a relative or through emergency consent procedure.

Non-inclusion criteria were intubated and tracheotomized patients or patients whose intubation was planned upon admission; patients unable to communicate verbally and self-report dyspnea on a VAS (hearing or visual impairment, insufficient command of French, previous known psychiatric or cognitive disorders; moribund patients; contraindication to opioids (known hypersensitivity to opioids, creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min, severe hepatocellular insufficiency defined by factor V < 50%); pregnant or breastfeeding woman; opioid use within the 24 hours before inclusion; protected adult; not affiliated to the French public health insurance: previous inclusion in this trial; exclusion period due to inclusion in another clinical trial.

### Intravenous opioid administration during mechanical ventilation and use after hospital discharge [^112YjpkY]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort study of adults receiving mechanical ventilation, we evaluated the association between intravenous opioids received during mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure and posthospitalization opioid-related outcomes among survivors of acute respiratory failure across 21 hospitals. Increasing doses of intravenous opioids administered during mechanical ventilation were associated with more prescription opioid use in the 1 year after discharge, including with persistent opioid use.

Our observational results are bolstered by the increase in risk with increases in opioid dose delivered during mechanical ventilation; the resilience of the findings to a moderate, theoretical, unmeasured confounding variable; the temporal proximity between the hospitalization and the filling of the first outpatient opioid prescription; and the consistency of the effect estimates across many analyses. Taken together, these findings suggest that exposure to opioid during mechanical ventilation, which may be modifiable, may influence patients' opioid use in the long term.

### Anticipation of distress after discontinuation of mechanical ventilation in the ICU at the end of life [^1142QY4j]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, palliative administration of opioids is perceived as hastening of death. Several studies have shown, however, that it does not effect survival in palliative and ICU patients. Doses exceeding the required amount necessary to achieve the desired effect of symptom relief should not be used. Much attention is given to physicians' intentions, but distinguishing between intent to provide palliative comfort or to hasten death is an impossible task. Indirect or hidden intentions cannot be completely determined. The administered dose and choice of medication in the individual patient, rather than intent, should be the determinant as to whether the physician is acting in accordance with normal standards. The often-mentioned risk of 'serious respiratory depression' is very rare. Among 1,524 post-operative patients treated with systemic or neuraxial morphine, a respiratory rate of less than 10 breaths/min was recorded in only 18 (1.2%) patients. The term 'respiratory depression' has no clear definition, but in most cases it refers to low respiratory rate (< 10 breaths/min), but are of no concern to dying patients, or at times, even desired. Death of an ICU patient is usually related to fatigue and dysfunction in multiple organs after withdrawal of ventilatory support and is not due to the administration of opioids.

Fentanyl is a potent analgesic, but should not be used for the prevention or treatment of DARD because it can increase muscle tone, leading to chest rigidity. This can induce breathlessness instead of treating it, especially in cachectic patients with weak muscles.

We recommend that morphine be started in order to prevent DARD, and that fentanyl be continued for pain, if that drug is already being used. Morphine could be started in patients with no or low tolerance, as an intravenous dose of 0.1 mg/kg. Individuals with high tolerance require larger dosages. The pharmacokinetics of intravenous morphine show a peak effect within 30 min and this effect generally lasts for 1–2 h.

### What's old is new again: opioid and benzodiazepine actions on ventilation, a reminder of the importance of knowing one's drugs [^111evtqq]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Co-administering opioids and benzodiazepines can have deleterious effects on ventilation. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms leading to hypoventilation. A recent article in the British Journal of Anaesthesia is not just another reminder of the hazards of combining opioids with benzodiazepines or other sedatives, but also applies mechanistic understanding to guide informed practice and future pharmaceutical development.

### Decreased duration of mechanical ventilation when comparing analgesia-based sedation using remifentanil with standard hypnotic-based sedation for up to 10 days in intensive care unit patients: a randomised trial [^112bJYiU]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

This study was a randomised, open-label, multicentre, parallel-group study comparing the safety and efficacy of an analgesia-based regime using remifentanil with a conventional hypnotic-based regime in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation for 3 to 10 days. The study was conducted in accordance with good clinical practice and within the guidelines set out in the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent/assent was obtained from all patients or their representatives. After approval from local and national ethics committees, 105 patients from 15 centres in 10 countries were recruited. Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a remifentanil-based regime or a comparator hypnotic-based regime using midazolam with either morphine or fentanyl for analgesia.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The target population were those patients requiring long-term mechanical ventilation for medical reasons. Post-surgical patients requiring extended mechanical ventilation as a result of post-surgical complications were also included. Patients were eligible if they were more than 18 years old, had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) within the previous 30 hours, were expected to require mechanical ventilation for longer than 96 hours and required analgesia and sedation. Females were eligible to enter the study if they were of non-childbearing potential or had a negative pregnancy test at screening and agreed not to fall pregnant for 12 days after stopping the study drug.

Patients were excluded from the study if their medical condition prevented assessment of depth of sedation, if it required the frequent down-titration of analgesics/sedatives for assessment, if it was likely to require surgery or tracheostomy during the treatment period, if it required neuromuscular blocking drugs by infusion, if it required epidural blockade, if it required sedatives or anaesthetic agents other than study drugs specified in the treatment period, or if there was a contraindication to the use of remifentanil, morphine, fentanyl or midazolam. Other exclusions were sensitivity to the drugs or class of drugs specified in the study, a history of alcohol or drug abuse, a concurrent or previous entry into this or other investigational drug studies within 30 days, or pregnancy or lactation. Protocol-specified treatment regimes had to be appropriate for the management of the patients. After 30 patients had entered the study, a protocol amendment allowed the inclusion of patients who had been receiving mechanical ventilation for up to 30 hours irrespective of the time in the ICU, allowed the inclusion of patients requiring surgery of less than 6 hours' duration during the treatment period and reduced the required duration of mechanical ventilation from 96 to 72 hours.

### Opioids for sedation: has the pendulum swung too far? [^112V3eh5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The most significant limitation of the current literature is that all studies targeted light sedation. As such, the efficacy and safety of an analgesia-based regimen in patients requiring deep sedation or long durations of mechanical ventilation are largely uncharacterized. This knowledge gap has become extremely relevant during the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. High doses and long durations of opioid infusions may achieve deep sedation, but may also precipitate opioid tolerance, dependence, or hyperalgesia, and place patients at risk for withdrawal. Furthermore, there is no "perfect" opioid agent when deep sedation is required; potent opioids with advantageous pharmacokinetic profiles (fentanyl, remifentanil) induce tolerance more quickly, whereas morphine metabolites may accumulate or induce hyperalgesia.

As such, core questions regarding analgosedation remain: 1) Are there differences in outcomes between analgesia-first and analgesia-based sedation? 2) Is there a preferred sedation strategy in patients requiring deep sedation? 3) Does the choice of specific agent, class, or dosing scheme influence these outcomes?

In the push to avoid benzodiazepine use, the adverse effect profile of opioids may have been inadvertently downplayed. However, absence of evidence of harm does not constitute evidence of absence, and no drug is benign. This is a plea for consideration of how much we still do not know, and for awareness of how many times in critical care practice we have seen the pendulum swing dramatically while we trade one risk for another.

### Low dose of morphine to relieve dyspnea in acute respiratory failure: the opiDys double-blind randomized controlled trial [^111HYvgp]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

42Discussion

In patients admitted to the ICU for ARF, this phase 2 pilot randomized controlled trial found no significant benefit of low-dose morphine on average dyspnea over 24 hours, although intravenous morphine titration significantly reduced dyspnea during the first four hours. Of concern was the fact that morphine was associated with an increased risk of intubation.

In recent years, dyspnea has become a matter of concern in ICU patients. Indeed, dyspnea is frequent and severe in patients admitted for ARF. Dyspnea is associated with anxiety. It is also associated with a higher prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorders. Relieving dyspnea should be a major target, such as controlling pain. When significant dyspnea persists despite treating the cause of ARF and administering a non-invasive respiratory support, it is permissible to consider the administration of opioids, in the absence of any other pharmacological approach, and based on their known effect on dyspnea in other clinical contexts. Original research and subsequent meta-analyses have shown that morphine successfully relieves dyspnea in patients with terminal cancer, cardiac failure, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease In the ICU, recent data suggest that morphine successfully relives dyspnea in intubated patients, but no randomized trial had been conducted in ICU patients exhibiting moderate to severe dyspnea upon admission. This is the reason why we decided to conduct the present study. Morphine did improve dyspnea transiently, but failed to show any significant effect on the 24-hour average dyspnea as we defined it. One of the potential explanations is that the subcutaneous dosage of the repeated administrations was not high enough. Another explanation is that in both groups, patients received etiological and symptomatic treatment of dyspnea with bronchodilators, hydro-sodium depletion, anti-infectious therapies and ventilatory support with NIV, high-flow oxygen through nasal cannula or standard oxygen therapy. These therapies have a known effect in relieving dyspnea which, although inconstant, can lead to a floor effect, with dyspnea decreasing more rapidly in the Morphine group. For instance, from the 8 th hour after inclusion, dyspnea-VAS was less than 40 mm in both groups, with prevalence of severe dyspnea that was less than 50%. With this in mind, we acknowledge that the choice of the 24-hour average dyspnea as the primary outcome of this study might have been a mistake: to draw a crude analogy, morphine is expected to be effective before fracture reduction, and much less so 24 hours afterwards. Therefore, regarding patients' comfort, the "end-of-titration" and "four-hour" dyspnea outcomes might be more relevant than the 24-hour average outcome. Another hypothesis would be that there was too much time between dyspnea ratings, possibly combined with too low a dose of morphine, which meant dyspnea was already increasing again at the time of the rating. It is also interesting to note that there is a wide dispersion (visible in Fig. 3), possibly due to significant variations in volume of distribution or pharmacokinetic effects, since morphine worked for the first hour, so the subcutaneous form dispensed afterwards may not be the most suitable.

Prescription of sedatives and opioids

The mean doses of morphine, midazolam, or propofol for mechanically ventilated patients on days 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 are presented in Table 3. The percentages of mechanically ventilated patients requiring morphine, midazolam, or propofol for these time points are presented in Table 4. There were no significant differences in terms of doses of morphine, midazolam, or propofol before and after the intervention. Also, there were no significant differences in the percentage of mechanically ventilated patients needing morphine, midazolam, or propofol. Figure 2 shows the percentage of patients (either mechanically ventilated or liberated from the ventilator) needing morphine, midazolam, or propofol during the study period. There were no differences for sedatives or opioids at any time point.

ALI/ARDS patients versus patients without acute lung injury

We used linear mixed model analysis to determine whether there were changes over time before and after the intervention, and whether the presence versus absence of ALI/ARDS affected the use of morphine, midazolam, or propofol. When patients were subdivided into ALI/ARDS patients and non-ALI/ARDS patients, there was no difference in the mean dose of sedative drugs for the different groups (Table 5). The percentage patients with ALI/ARDS needing morphine over the entire study period was 70% before and 93% after intervention (P = 0.12). The respective percentages were 80% and 87% for midazolam (P = 0.66), and 90% and 93% for propofol (P = 0.76).

### Intravenous opioid administration during mechanical ventilation and use after hospital discharge [^111fCXvt]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Exposure

The primary exposure was median daily intravenous fentanyl equivalents (MDFEs) that could occur either through continuous opioid infusions (continuous infusion) or intermittent administrations (boluses) during the first episode of mechanical ventilation of the hospitalization. We focused on intravenous opioids, the recommended route of administration in mechanical ventilation, because they have been shown to change opioid receptors in the brain quickly and act independently of gut absorption. Fentanyl equivalents were used because fentanyl is the most commonly used opioid in the ICU during mechanical ventilation in the KPNC system and thus are widely understood by the intensivist community. Use of MDFEs was chosen as the exposure because patients undergo mechanical ventilation for differing lengths of time. MDFEs were calculated by starting with the first hour of mechanical ventilation, summing the total dose of fentanyl equivalents given in each 24-hour period of mechanical ventilation, and taking the median of summed fentanyl dose equivalents over all days of mechanical ventilation. Doses of hydromorphone and morphine were converted to fentanyl using the following equivalencies: 100 μg of fentanyl = 1.5 mg of hydromorphone = 10 mg of morphine. We only counted doses administered during the first 21 days of mechanical ventilation, until initiation of comfort care, or until tracheostomy placement because we were interested in doses administered during acute respiratory failure (ie, not chronic respiratory failure or for the purpose of comfort care). The recording of opioid administrations was based on medication administration records in the electronic health record. The accuracy of the hourly recording of opioid administration data was confirmed (by L.C.M.) using a 30-patient front-end audit comparing the raw data output with the electronic chart. Details of data cleaning and an example of calculating the MDFE with sample data are available in eTable 1 in Supplement 1. We categorized MDFEs into terciles to balance the ability to capture nonlinear associations with the outcome, adequately power group comparisons, and allow for clinically interpretable findings of dose ranges associated with the outcome. The reference group was patients who did not receive an intravenous opioid during their episode of mechanical ventilation.

### Pharmacodynamic effect of morphine-6-glucuronide versus morphine on hypoxic and hypercapnic breathing in healthy volunteers [^113vNrA1]. Anesthesiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) is an active metabolite of morphine that is generally associated with less respiratory depression than morphine. Because M6G will be on the market in the near future, the authors assessed the time profile and relative potency of M6G's effect versus morphine's effect on carbon dioxide-driven and hypoxic breathing.

Methods

In nine healthy female volunteers, the effects of 0.2 mg/kg intravenous M6G, 0.13 mg/kg intravenous morphine, and intravenous placebo were tested on ventilation at a fixed end-tidal pressure of carbon dioxide (Petco2) of 45 mmHg (Vi45) and on the acute hypoxic ventilatory response (AHR). All subjects participated in all three arms of the study. Respiratory studies were performed at 1-h intervals for 7 h after drug infusion. The data were analyzed using a population dose-driven approach, which uses a dose rate in function of time as input function driving the pharmacodynamics, and a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) approach in which fixed pharmacokinetic parameter values from the literature were used as input function to the respiratory model. From the latter analysis, the authors obtained the blood effect-site equilibration half-life (t½kₑ₀) and the effect-site concentration producing 25% depression of Vi45 and AHR (C₂₅). Values reported are mean ± SE.

Results

Placebo had no effect on Vi45 or AHR over time. Both analysis approaches yielded good descriptions of the data with comparable model parameters. M6G PK/PD model parameters for Vi45 were t½kₑ₀ 2.1 ± 0.2 h and C₂₅ 528 ± 88 nm and for AHR were t½kₑ₀ 1.0 ± 0.1 h and C₂₅ 873 ± 81 nm. Morphine PK/PD model parameters for Vi45 were t½kₑ₀ 3.8 ± 0.9 h and C₂₅ 28 ± 6 nm and for AHR were t½kₑ₀ 4.3 ± 0.6 h and C₂₅ 16 ± 2 nm.

Conclusions

Morphine is more potent in affecting hypoxic ventilatory control than M6G, with a potency ratio ranging from 1:19 for Vi45 to 1:50 for AHR. At drug concentrations causing 25% depression of Vi45, M6G caused only 15% depression of AHR, whereas morphine caused greater than 50% depression of AHR. Furthermore, the speed of onset/offset of M6G is faster than morphine by a factor of approximately 2. The authors discuss some of the possible mechanisms for the observed differences in opioid behavior.

5.7 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients

The use of Morphine Sulfate Injection in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.

Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: Morphine Sulfate Injection-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Morphine Sulfate Injection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating Morphine Sulfate Injection and when Morphine Sulfate Injection is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.

5.8 Interaction with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) may potentiate the effects of morphine, including respiratory depression, coma, and confusion. Morphine Sulfate Injection should not be used in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.

5.9 Adrenal Insufficiency

Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.

### The infusion of opioids during terminal withdrawal of mechanical ventilation in the medical intensive care unit [^111VnkxF]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Most deaths in intensive care units occur after limitation or withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies. Often these patients require opioids to assuage suffering; yet, little has been documented concerning their use in the medical intensive care unit.

Objectives

To determine the dose and factors influencing the use of opioids in patients undergoing terminal withdrawal of mechanical ventilation in this setting.

Methods

Data were prospectively collected from 74 consecutive patients expected to die soon after extubation. The doses of morphine, effect on time to death, and relation of dose to diagnostic categories were analyzed.

Results

The mean (± standard deviation) dose of morphine given to patients during the last hour of mechanical ventilation was 5.3mg/hour. Patients dying after extubation received 10.6 mg/hour just before death. Immediately before extubation, the dose correlated directly with chronic medical opioid use and sepsis with respiratory failure and inversely with coma after cardiopulmonary resuscitation or a primary neurological event. After terminal extubation, the final morphine dose correlated directly with the presence of sepsis with respiratory failure and chronic pulmonary disease. The mean time to death after terminal extubation was 152.7 ± 229.5 minutes without correlation with premorbid diagnoses. After extubation, each 1mg/hour increment of morphine infused during the last hour of life was associated with a delay of death by 7.9 minutes (P = 0.011).

Conclusion

Premorbid conditions may influence the dose of morphine given to patients undergoing terminal withdrawal of mechanical ventilation. Higher doses of morphine are associated with a longer time to death.

### Morphine dose optimization in critically ill pediatric patients with acute respiratory failure: a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacogenomic study [^112hxLBV]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop a pharmacokinetic-pharmacogenomic population model of morphine in critically ill children with acute respiratory failure.

Design

Prospective pharmacokinetic-pharmacogenomic observational study.

Setting

Thirteen PICUs across the United States.

Patients

Pediatric subjects (n = 66) mechanically ventilated for acute respiratory failure, weight greater than or equal to 7kg, receiving morphine and/or midazolam continuous infusions.

Interventions

Serial blood sampling for drug quantification and a single blood collection for genomic evaluation.

Measurements and Main Results

Concentrations of morphine, the two main metabolites, morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine-6-glucuronide, were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry/mass spectroscopy. Subjects were genotyped using the Illumina HumanOmniExpress genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism chip. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling was performed to develop the pharmacokinetic-pharmacogenomic model. A two-compartment model with linear elimination and two individual compartments for metabolites best describe morphine disposition in this population. Our analysis demonstrates that body weight and postmenstrual age are relevant predictors of pharmacokinetic parameters of morphine and its metabolites. Furthermore, our research shows that a duration of mechanical ventilation greater than or equal to 10 days reduces metabolite formation and elimination upwards of 30%. However, due to the small sample size and relative heterogeneity of the population, no heritable factors associated with uridine diphosphate glucuronyl transferase 2B7 metabolism of morphine were identified.

Conclusions

The results provide a better understanding of the disposition of morphine and its metabolites in critically ill children with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation due to nonheritable factors. It also provides the groundwork for developing additional studies to investigate the role of heritable factors.

### Decreased duration of mechanical ventilation when comparing analgesia-based sedation using remifentanil with standard hypnotic-based sedation for up to 10 days in intensive care unit patients: a randomised trial [^116ZovCi]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

In contrast, the mean total daily requirements for midazolam in the comparator group varied considerably throughout the study period to maintain an optimal SAS for 97% of the time. There was an up to 10-fold difference in mean daily midazolam requirements in the fentanyl subgroup (226 mg on day 4; 26 mg on day 10) and a sevenfold difference in the morphine subgroup (189.6 mg on day 5; 28.4 mg on day 10). This accounts for the difference in mean total midazolam requirements between the groups. The requirements for midazolam peaked between days 3 and 5 in the comparator groups, and then tailed off (Fig. 6). The above observations are a reflection of two factors. First, midazolam was used as the primary hypnotic agent in the comparator group and it was therefore adjusted first. Second, although the opioid infusion rates remained relatively constant, as the study progressed, opioid and midazolam accumulation occurred. The accumulation, with large body stores of these drugs, contributed to the sedation in these patients. Therefore the requirement for midazolam administration to maintain a constant SAS and PI score tailed off after a certain period. The context-sensitive half-time of the comparator agents is known to increase with time, and the comparator agent's elimination is organ dependent.

### Intravenous opioid administration during mechanical ventilation and use after hospital discharge [^111aiogr]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

This study has several strengths. We were able to conduct our analyses accounting for prior opioid prescriptions filled, opioid-related diagnoses, and chronic pain diagnoses occurring before the index acute respiratory failure hospitalization, as well as accounting for detailed clinical information from the pre-, post-, and intrahospitalization within an integrated health system. Few data sources contain the depth and breadth needed to study the association between doses of medication administered across 21 hospitals and prescriptions filled in the 1 year after hospitalization. We estimated that a moderately strong unmeasured confounder would be required to nullify the effect estimate of the primary outcome. Although effect estimates were similar across numerous sensitivity analyses and secondary outcomes, we did not find a significant association of ICU opioid dose with posthospitalization opioid use disorders or overdose, which was potentially related to lower frequency in the outcome. The low outcome rate for diagnosis codes for opioid-related complications was in line with previous reports.

The study also has limitations. Unmeasured confounding cannot be ruled out in observational studies. Also, the single integrated system within the US that is unusual in the integration of care for individuals, thus presenting unclear generalizability outside this health system. Illicit and unprescribed opioid use could not be captured in our analysis.

### Low dose of morphine to relieve dyspnea in acute respiratory failure: the opiDys double-blind randomized controlled trial [^116CrdYN]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Intervention

All management decisions other than the administration of morphine were made by the managing physician according to the department's usual practices.

The experimental group received an intravenous titration of morphine hydrochloride at a concentration of 1 mg per mL of NaCl 0.9%. The titration consisted of an initial bolus of 2 mL (2 mg), followed by a 1 mL (1 mg) bolus every 3 minutes until dyspnea-VAS was < 40 mm, with a maximum safety dose of 8 mL (8 mg). Once the target (either dyspnea-VAS < 40 mm or safety dose of 8 mg) was reached, morphine hydrochloride (1 mg per ml) was administered subcutaneously. A first dose of 5 mL (5 mg) was administered immediately after the intravenous titration and then every 4 hours for 24 hours. At each 4-hour time point, if dyspnea-VAS was ≥ 40 mm, the dose of morphine was increased from the previous one by increments of 2.5 ml, without exceeding the maximum dose of 10 mL (10 mg) every 4 hours. If Dyspnea-VAS was < 40 mm, the dose of morphine administered every 4 hours was reduced by 2.5 mL (2.5 mg) (Fig. 1).

The use of INFUMORPH in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.

 Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: Patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended doses of INFUMORPH [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Could remifentanil reduce duration of mechanical ventilation in comparison with other opioids for mechanically ventilated patients? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1129EaXa]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Similar to fentanyl, alfentanil, and sufentanil, remifentanil is a potent, selective 4-anilidopiperidine μ-opioid analgesic. However, unlike fentanyl and other opioids, remifentanil is completely metabolized by unspecific esterases in a manner that is independent of liver or renal function. Since unspecific esterases have been found to be widely distributed in living human cells, there are no ICU disease states or types of organ failure that would lead to reduced breakdown of remifentanil. The major breakdown product of remifentanil is remifentanil acid (RA), which has a potency of only 1/300 to 1/4600 that of remifentanil, has poor brain penetration and is unlikely to cause respiratory failure. Remifentanil has a highly predictable onset and offset effect, a terminal half-life of approximately 10 to 20 minutes, and a context-sensitive half-life of 3 to 4 minutes. The unique pharmacokinetics of remifentanil may lead to reductions in time to weaning and extubation and, accordingly, may be associated with reductions in mechanical ventilation time, length of ICU stay (ICU-LOS), and costs.

### Morphine sulfate (Avinza) [^1144RHPf]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Pharmacodynamics

Morphine concentrations are not predictive of analgesic response, especially in patients previously treated with opioids. The minimum effective concentration varies widely and is influenced by a variety of factors, including the extent of previous opioid use, age, and general medical condition. Effective doses in tolerant patients may be significantly higher than in opioid-naïve patients.

In all patients, the dose of morphine should be titrated on the basis of clinical evaluation of the patient and to achieve a balance between therapeutic and adverse effects.

Pharmacokinetics

AVINZA consists of two components, an immediate release component that rapidly achieves plateau morphine plasma concentrations and an extended release component that maintains plasma concentrations throughout the 24-hour dosing interval. The amount of morphine absorbed from AVINZA following oral administration is similar to that absorbed from other oral morphine formulations.

The oral bioavailability of morphine is less than 40% and shows large inter-individual variability due to extensive pre-systemic metabolism.

5.7 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia

Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence (9.3)]. Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior.

Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.14)].

### Sedation in the mechanically ventilated patient [^113hw4UT]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss the approach to sedation of the mechanically ventilated patient.

Data Synthesis

Mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit frequently require sedation and analgesia for anxiety and pain experienced during the time they are intubated. Multiple drugs are available for this purpose. Strategies that optimize comfort while minimizing the predilection for sedative and analgesic drug accumulation with prolongation of effect have been shown to improve outcomes. In particular, such strategies may decrease mechanical ventilation duration, intensive care unit length of stay, and complications associated with critical illness.

Conclusions

Sedation and analgesia are important in the management of patients who require mechanical ventilation. An evidence-based approach to administering sedatives and analgesics is necessary to optimize short- and long-term outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients.

First-line management of severe asthma exacerbations include the use of inhaled short-acting β-agonists, anticholinergics, and systemic corticosteroids. Continuous intravenous ketamine given at dissociative doses may be a pharmacologic option in patients who are intubated with life-threatening severe bronchospasm unresponsive to standard therapy. We describe the case of a 44-year-old man admitted to the intensive care unit for status asthmaticus requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Methods

The patient developed severe refractory hypercapnic respiratory failure necessitating additional respiratory support with veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy. Ketamine treatment was initiated at 0.5 mg/kg/h continuous infusion on the day of admission for pain control and required up-titration to 2 mg/kg/h by intensive care unit day 4 for bronchodilation. Whole blood samples were obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis of ketamine during ECMO.

Findings

The plasma concentration at steady state was 1018.7 ng/mL, with an estimated clearance of 1.96 L/kg/h after up-titration. The V d was 14.18 L/kg, the kₑ was 0.14 hr⁻¹, and the t½ was 5 hours.

Implications

Compared with healthy adults, there was a 6.5-fold increase in the V d. However, the V d was similar compared with critically ill patients not receiving ECMO. Further studies should focus on the effect of ECMO on ketamine pharmacokinetic properties.

### Could remifentanil reduce duration of mechanical ventilation in comparison with other opioids for mechanically ventilated patients? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1142xi79]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Several randomized controlled studies (RCTs) and cohort studies have been conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of remifentanil with those of other opioids. Mechanical ventilation time and extubation time are commonly evaluated indicators. Taking Dahaba et al.'s study as an example, 40 mechanically ventilated patients who were assigned an analgesia protocol involving the administration of either remifentanil or morphine; these analgesics were initiated at the minimum dose and titrated up to an optimal level of sedation, with midazolam serving as a rescue treatment. The results of this study showed that remifentanil was associated with significant reductions in mean duration of mechanical ventilation and extubation time. The same outcome measures have been assessed in several RCTs). The results of a meta-analysis showed that remifentanil was associated with reduced time to extubation after sedation cessation, but no significant difference was identified between remifentanil and other opioids in terms of mechanical ventilation duration. However, another meta-analysis showed that remifentanil was associated with a significantly reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation. The results of a cost-consequence analysis performed by Al et al. suggested that remifentanil was associated with significantly decreased ICU costs, whereas the results of Engoren et al.'s study showed that higher opioid and anaesthetic costs but lower hospital costs were identified in remifentanil group relative to the fentanyl group. The results of these economic analyses were complex. On the one hand, reductions in ventilation time, ICU-LOS and length of stay in hospital (hospital-LOS) were associated with a reduction in overall cost, but shorter-acting anaesthetics were more expensive. On the other hand, morphine withdrawal-associated immunosuppression and remifentanil discontinuation were identified as independent risk factors for ICU-acquired infections, and excessive analgesia was associated with nosocomial pneumonia delirium and psychological disorders, which increases the complexity of the evaluation of remifentanil. Several studies have been conducted since the meta-analysis was performed in 2009, which showed that remifentanil was associated with reduced time to extubation after sedation cessation and indicated the presence of no significant differences between remifentanil and other opioids in terms of mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU-LOS, and risk of agitation. Therefore, we conducted this study with the intention of updating these data and re-evaluating the efficacy and safety of remifentanil in mechanically ventilated patients relative to the safety and efficacy of other opioids.

### Aerosol delivery during invasive mechanical ventilation: a systematic review [^113nNR9v]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Aerosol therapy is commonly used in the intensive care unit. Three primary classes of drugs are delivered by inhalation to mechanically ventilated patients: bronchodilators, corticosteroids and antibiotics. Drug efficacy depends on the dose and the site of deposition. The clinical benefit of bronchodilators plateaus the effective dose is deposited, and increasing the dose will expose the patient to potential adverse events (e.g. cough, tachycardia and tremor). With respect to inhaled antibiotics, concentrations should be maximized at the infected lung site to obtain an effective bactericidal effect according to their pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics characteristics.

Many factors influence aerosol delivery to the lungs during mechanical ventilation and are related to the drug, the device, the patient, the ventilator circuit, the artificial airways and the ventilator settings. These factors have been primarily studied in vitro. During the past 30 years, clinical and experimental studies have investigated lung deposition of inhaled drugs during invasive mechanical ventilation using imaging techniques based on radiolabeled aerosol deposition, lung tissue sampling and pharmacokinetics analysis. A comprehensive systematic review summarizing in vivo data related to aerosol delivery during invasive mechanical ventilation has never been published.

The aim of this review is to evaluate studies that assessed in vivo lung delivery of inhaled drugs to mechanically ventilated patients or animal models either as absolute drug concentrations or quantitative deposition relative to the nominal dose to: (1) provide current knowledge on whole lung deposition; (2) examine the distribution and penetration of inhaled drugs into different regions of the respiratory tract; (3) determine how the ventilator circuit and the artificial airways impact aerosol delivery and (4) discuss the administration techniques applied in these studies.

### Dosimetrically administered nebulized morphine for breathlessness in very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a randomized, controlled trial [^112grbNR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our study showed an apparent reduction of chronic breathlessness intensity now accompanying severe COPD with morphine delivered by dosimetric nebulization system which ensured delivery of drug to the desired level of the airways. Treatment was effective and safe in all participating patients. In consequence, all of them expressed willingness to continue morphine nebulizations at home. In the majority of patients the effective dose was 3 mg. This positive effect was most probably achieved through direct morphine action on its receptors located in the epithelium of the trachea and large bronchi.

### Mechanical ventilation with lower tidal volumes does not influence the prescription of opioids or sedatives [^1164pYhB]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

The present analysis was performed for the following reasons. First, we wondered whether the adoption of LP MV would affect sedation requirements in our ICU, where a strict sedation protocol is applied that is aimed at achieving the lowest possible level of sedation. Second, because we favor the use of LP MV using lower V T in all patients, irrespective of the presence or absence of ALI/ARDS, we were interested in whether sedation requirements change with the use of lower V T in patients who are not suffering from ALI/ARDS. Finally, because the ARDS Network protocol prescribed the use of lower V T throughout ventilation (also with spontaneous MV at later time points), we wished to determine the impact of lower V T on sedation requirements in patients for a longer period (not only during the first few days of MV).

### Could remifentanil reduce duration of mechanical ventilation in comparison with other opioids for mechanically ventilated patients? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1139hA25]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results of this meta-analysis suggested that the use of remifentanil was associated with a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation when compared with other opioids, findings that were supported by the results of subgroup of studies in which analgesia and sedation were administered and subgroup of studies in which remifentanil was compared with fentanyl; however, the subgroups of studies in which analgesia alone was administered and studies in which remifentanil was compared with morphine or sufentanil indicated the presence of no differences. Remifentanil was associated with reductions in time to extubation after sedation cessation and ICU-LOS but not reductions in hospital-LOS or costs.

The finding that remifentanil was found to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation, time to extubation after sedation cessation, and ICU-LOS may be highly related to the unique pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of remifentanil, namely, its rapid onset and offset, context-sensitive half-life that is hardly affected by the duration of infusion, and elimination that is independent of liver or renal function. In the subgroups, the results of the studies comparing remifentanil with fentanyl showed a maximal mean difference of 3.85 hours. As a selective μ-opioid receptor agonist, remifentanil was similar to fentanyl in potency but different in pharmacokinetics. This result may indicate that remifentanil may be used as a substitute for fentanyl in some circumstances, especially in cases in which patients have developed kidney injuries or in which intermittent interruption of sedation and analgesia is needed to assess altered mental status. However, these results should be interpreted with caution for a few reasons. First, the mean differences between remifentanil and other opioids were only 1.5 hours for mechanical ventilation duration, 1 hour for time to extubation after sedation cessation, and 0.1 day for IC-LOS, which suggested that only miniscule differences may be identified in clinical practice. However, the potential benefits of remifentanil might be more apparent when used in patients with significant organ failure, a hypothesis that more studies should explore. Moreover, neurologic assessment is essential for neurosurgical and neurotrauma patients; thus, the association between remifentanil and rapid and predictable awakening may be more meaningful in these patients, even though the difference between remifentanil and other opioids were less than 1 hour. Second, high levels of heterogeneity were identified for all of the outcomes. There were remarkable differences across the included RCTs in terms of type of disease, analgesic agents and sedation protocols. We analysed the outcomes in subgroups classified by the use of different control groups and sedation protocols to reduce clinical heterogeneity; however, the statistical homogeneity was still obvious (I² > 70%, considered as high heterogeneity). In addition, we selected a random-effects model rather than fixed-effects model to address the observed heterogeneity. Third, the funnel plots suggested the presence of publication bias in the three evaluated outcomes, which may be because the pharmaceutical companies that manufactured remifentanil funded some of the included studies.

### Mechanical ventilation with lower tidal volumes does not influence the prescription of opioids or sedatives [^117RAZb6]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

A decline in V T in ALI/ARDS patients at our center did not increase sedation requirements. For non-ALI/ARDS patients there was a trend toward a decline in V T from 10.2 ml/kg PBW to 8.6 ml/kg PBW (P = 0.073). In these patients there was also no increase in sedation needs. Concerns regarding the potential adverse effects of LP MV should not preclude its use.

### A novel molecule (frakefamide) with peripheral opioid properties: the effects on resting ventilation compared with morphine and placebo [^1157q23e]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

In animal models frakefamide (FF) is a potent analgesic that acts as a peripheral active mu-selective receptor agonist. In this double-blind, randomized, double dummy four-way crossover study in 12 healthy male subjects, we investigated the effects on resting ventilation of FF and 2 dose levels of morphine compared with placebo. Each drug was infused for 6 h. The subjects received 1.22 mg/kg FF, 0.43 mg/kg morphine (M-large), and 0.11 mg/kg morphine (M-small). Sodium chloride 9 mg/mL was used as placebo. Ventilation was measured by pneumotachography and inline capnography. Blood was collected and plasma concentrations of FF and morphine and its metabolites were analyzed. Within 15 min after administration of FF all subjects complained of a transient myalgia, which disappeared within 30 min. At target measurement (335 min), there were no differences in tidal volume among the groups. Respiratory rates were, however, slower in the two M-groups (P < 0.05 in M-small and P < 0.001 in M-large) compared with FF and placebo. Minute volume was significantly less in the M-large group compared with the FF (P < 0.01) and placebo (P < 0.01) groups. This difference was reflected by an elevated ETCO₂ in the M-large group (P < 0.01). We conclude that, during resting ventilation, FF, unlike morphine, did not cause central respiratory depression. This suggests that FF has only peripheral mu-opioid agonist activity in humans.

### Reassessment of theophylline use for severe asthma exacerbation: is it justified in critically ill hospitalized patients? [^117JCJ6t]. The Journal of Asthma (2002). Low credibility.

In the 1990s, numerous double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials revealed that theophylline therapy offered no benefit to inhaled beta2 agonists and systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of patients hospitalized for asthma exacerbations. Routine use of theophylline in patients hospitalized for asthma is no longer advocated due to the potential for serious adverse effects and lack of benefit. However, the question remains whether this drug adds any benefits in critically ill patients who are being admitted to an intensive care unit. Two recent pediatric studies suggest that theophylline therapy may have a role in the management of patients with impending respiratory failure who have failed aggressive treatment with inhaled beta2 agonists, systemic corticosteroids, and inhaled ipratropium. If a patient has failed to respond adequately to high-dose routine therapies, theophylline should be initiated by a clinician who is competent in dosing, monitoring serum concentrations, and assessing factors that modify clearance of this high-risk drug. Further clinical research is needed to verify the value of theophylline in adults and children with severe asthma exacerbations and impending respiratory failure.

### Morphine-induced acute lung injury [^115iidfK]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

A 38-year-old woman who had familial adenomatous polyposis was admitted to the intensive care unit with an episode of severe sepsis 5 days after undergoing a pancreas-preserving duodenectomy. Laparotomy with removal of an intra-abdominal abscess, followed by closed postoperative continuous lavage for 10 days, was performed. During two courses of planned tracheal extubation, the patient developed an acute lung injury, making a reintubation necessary. In both events, the patient received small doses of continuous morphine before the extubation. Morphine may induce the development of an acute lung injury in patients, whereas the exact pathophysiologic and pharmacologic mechanisms remain unclear.

### The effect of opioids on gastrointestinal function in the ICU [^115VkbvC]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Upper GI dysmotility

Upper GI dysfunction occurs frequently in ICU patients. Upper GI disorders include delayed gastric emptying, increased gastroesophageal reflux and abnormal duodenal contractions. All of these disorders increase the risk of nosocomial pneumonia. A retrospective study describing the gut function of current ICU patients indicated that gastric emptying was abnormal, and most enterally fed patients exhibited large gastric aspirates. Delayed gastric emptying is one manifestation of feed intolerance and can result in inadequate nutrition. Sedation with the combination of midazolam and fentanyl was an independent factor for increased gastric aspirate volume and upper digestive intolerance for enteral nutrition. Opioids inhibit gastric emptying in a dose-dependent pattern. A prospective cohort study measured the variables associated with impaired gastric emptying using the acetaminophen absorption model. Before acetaminophen treatment, 24 patients were infused with morphine or a morphine equivalent; patients treated with opioids took longer to reach maximum concentration of acetaminophen, and a high dose of opioids accompanied significant impairment of gastric emptying. A study analysed the effect of opioids on GI motility in patients on mechanical ventilation. Compared with nine healthy volunteers, the migrating motor complex (MMC) of seven mechanically ventilated patients treated with morphine was significantly shortened. Meanwhile, the gastric retention of the patients was more than 20% due to the abnormal motility pattern of the MMC. When morphine was stopped, the motility pattern of the stomach could convert to a normal pattern, and mean gastric retention was decreased. Nguyen et al. evaluated the effect of morphine and midazolam (M&M) or propofol on gastric emptying by gastric scintigraphy. The half-life of gastric emptying in patients receiving M&M was 153 min, longer than the half-life of 58 min in the control group receiving propofol, and M&M-treated patients had higher proximal meal retention because morphine inhibited gastric emptying by increasing retrograde duodenal contractions and pyloric tone.

### Inter-individual variation in midazolam clearance in children [^111CkRKX]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Critical illness may extensively affect midazolam clearance in both childrenand adults. Three studies in critically ill adults suggested a 12–20-fold variation in midazolam clearance with variation in dose between 2- and 10-fold. One of the first studies of midazolam in critically ill children described a 40-fold variation in plasma concentrations of midazolam despite there being only a 2.5-fold variation in dosage. Several factors can affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs in critically ill patients. Both hypoxia and shock are common in the critically ill. The liver is sensitive to hypoxia as the majority of its blood supply is from the portal vein where blood has a low oxygen content. Hypoxia can affect the cells in the liver which are responsible for blood metabolism. Shock which is common in critically ill patients, especially prior to admission to an intensive care unit, results in a reduced blood flow to the liver, which results in a reduction in enzyme activity in hepatocytes. The clearance of morphine was reduced in adults with shock following acute trauma. Other factors that can affect drug metabolism in the critically ill include systemic inflammatory responses. Inflammatory mediators such as interleukin 1, interleukin 6, tumour necrosis factors and interferon may all have an effect on drug metabolism. Stress, changes in diet, endocrine changes and other drugs may also affect drug metabolism. Mechanical ventilation can reduce cardiac output and therefore reduce blood flow to the organs, especially the liver and kidneys, which are responsible for drug clearance. However, reduced blood flow to the liver does not substantially affect midazolam clearance as it is not a high extraction ratio drug. Changes in volume of distribution can occur as a result of infection and inflammation in critically ill patients. Endotoxins from infective agents can affect the endothelium of blood vessels, causing either vasoconstriction or vasodilatation which can lead to abnormal distribution of drugs.

### Sedation and analgesia in the mechanically ventilated patient [^1152E3sr]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Sedation and analgesia are important components of care for the mechanically ventilated patient in the intensive care unit (ICU). An understanding of commonly used medications is essential to formulate a sedation plan for individual patients. The specific physiological changes that a critically ill patient undergoes can have direct effects on the pharmacology of drugs, potentially leading to interpatient differences in response. Objective assessments of pain, sedation, and agitation have been validated for use in the ICU for assessment and titration of medications. An evidence-based strategy for administering these drugs can lead to improvements in short- and long-term outcomes for patients. In this article, we review advances in the field of ICU sedation to provide an up-to-date perspective on management of the mechanically ventilated ICU patient.

### Morphine glucuronidation and elimination in intensive care patients: a comparison with healthy volunteers [^112jpioV]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although morphine is used frequently to treat pain in the intensive care unit, its pharmacokinetics has not been adequately quantified in critically ill patients. We evaluated the glucuronidation and elimination clearance of morphine in intensive care patients compared with healthy volunteers based on the morphine and morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) concentrations.

Methods

A population pharmacokinetic model with covariate analysis was developed with the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling software (NONMEM 7.3). The analysis included 3012 morphine and M3G concentrations from 135 intensive care patients (117 cardiothoracic surgery patients and 18 critically ill patients), who received continuous morphine infusions adapted to individual pain levels, and 622 morphine and M3G concentrations from a previously published study of 20 healthy volunteers, who received an IV bolus of morphine followed by a 1-hour infusion.

Results

For morphine, a 3-compartment model best described the data, whereas for M3G, a 1-compartment model fits best. In intensive care patients with a normal creatinine concentration, a decrease of 76% was estimated in M3G clearance compared with healthy subjects, conditional on the M3G volume of distribution being the same in intensive care patients and healthy volunteers. Furthermore, serum creatinine concentration was identified as a covariate for both elimination clearance of M3G in intensive care patients and unchanged morphine clearance in all patients and healthy volunteers.

Conclusions

Under the assumptions in the model, M3G elimination was significantly decreased in intensive care patients when compared with healthy volunteers, which resulted in substantially increased M3G concentrations. Increased M3G levels were even more pronounced in patients with increased serum creatinine levels. Model-based simulations show that, because of the reduction in morphine clearance in intensive care patients with renal failure, a 33% reduction in the maintenance dose would result in morphine serum concentrations equal to those in healthy volunteers and intensive care patients with normal renal function, although M3G concentrations remain increased. Future pharmacodynamic investigations are needed to identify target concentrations in this population, after which final dosing recommendations can be made.

### Tolerance to opioid-induced respiratory depression in chronic high-dose opioid users: a model-based comparison with opioid-Naïve individuals [^113NuSCh]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Two‐compartment and three‐compartment models were tested for the population PK analysis. Based on prior knowledge and mechanistic reasons, 16 clearances (CLs) were allometrically scaled to liters per hour at 70 kg body weight by CL = CLᴛᴠ (weight/70)⁰.⁷⁵ and compartment volumes were scaled to 70 kg body weight by V = Vᴛᴠ (weight/70) (typical value (TV)). For the population PK/PD analysis, an effect compartment was postulated to account for the hysteresis between the fentanyl plasma concentrations and effect on ventilation. 17 This effect compartment equilibrates with the plasma compartment with plasma‐effect‐site equilibration half‐life (t½kₑ₀).

The 1‐minute ventilation averages were then modeled using an inhibitory sigmoid maximum effect (E max) model 17, 18 andwhere RF is the fraction of the opioid receptors bound by fentanyl, Cₑ the fentanyl concentration at the postulated effect‐site, C₅₀ the fentanyl concentration at the postulated effect‐site causing 50% depression of ventilation, V (t) minute ventilation, V B baseline ventilation, and α a parameter that combines receptor reserve and intrinsic ligand activity. Apnea data were censored at zero using M3 methodology in NONMEM. The α > 1 allowed for the possibility that apnea occurred at finite fentanyl concentrations.

Model selection was based on MOFV (applying the likelihood ratio test for nested models), goodness‐of‐fit plots (observed vs. predicted data, and weighted residuals vs. time), prediction‐corrected and variability‐corrected visual predictive checks, 19 and normalized prediction discrepancies. 20 It was visually checked that the normalized prediction discrepancies vs. time showed no trends, heteroscedasticity, or both. Data are reported as mean ± SD or estimate ± standard error of the estimate, unless otherwise stated.

### Duration of salmeterol-induced bronchodilation in mechanically ventilated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients: a prospective clinical study [^117Lzjcx]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Ten male patients (mean age ± standard deviation of 67.8 ± 6 years) with COPD, requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation to manage acute respiratory failure due to an acute exacerbation of chronic airflow obstruction, were studied. Patients with a diagnosis of bronchial asthma as well as patients with pneumonia, pulmonary edema, refractory hypoxemia, pneumothorax, or excessive airway secretions were excluded. All patients had a previous diagnosis of COPD and met established criteria for this diagnosis. Their previous pulmonary function data were consistent with severe COPD, with forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV₁) of 38% ± 4%, forced vital capacity of 56% ± 6%, residual volume of 177% ± 25%, and total lung capacity of 112% ± 7% of predicted values (mean ± standard error). The study was approved by the hospital ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained from the patients' next of kin. In cases in which patients regained the capacity to give consent, this was later obtained from them.

The patients were studied during a period of clinical stability, no more than 72 hours after the onset of mechanical ventilation. All patients were orotracheally intubated (low-pressure cuff endotracheal tube, internal diameter of 8.0 ± 0.5 mm, and tube length of 28 ± 1 mm), heavily sedated (propofol at a rate of 4 mg/kg per hour and remifentanyl), and ventilated on volume-controlled mode (Evita 2; Draeger, Luebeck, Germany) using settings that minimized dynamic hyperinflation (tidal volume [VT] of 7 to 8 mL/kg, square wave flow-time profile, no end-inspiratory pause, and zero external positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEPe]) and a fractional concentration of inspired oxygen that achieved a hemoglobin saturation of greater than 89%. Minute ventilation was adjusted in each individual by the attending physician in order to maintain normal arterial pH and remained constant throughout the study. The absence of respiratory muscle activity was based on specific criteria, including absence of negative deflection of airway pressure (Paw), stabilization of the Paw waveform, constancy of peak inspiratory pressure from breath to breath, and exponential decline of expiratory flow. Patient characteristics and baseline ventilator settings are shown in Table 1.

### Effects of fentanyl administration in mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1158uNmK]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Pain management is an important issue for critically ill adults in the intensive care unit (ICU), and inadequate pain management may lead to posttraumatic stress disorder and post-intensive care syndrome. The Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep disruption guidelines recommend a continuous infusion of opioids for procedural pain management in critically ill adults. However, the same opioids (i.e. fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine, and remifentanil) have consistently been recommended since 2013. There has been no systematic review on the use of opioids for pain management in critically ill adults. Therefore, the appropriate analgesic drugs to use remain controversial.

Fentanyl is a potent, selective 4-anilidopiperidine μ-opioid analgesic used for analgesic management in mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU. Among the other available opioids, morphine has common adverse effects, such as histamine release, pruritus, and accumulation of morphine-6-glucuronide, in patients with renal impairment. Additionally, neither alfentanil nor sufentanil is licensed for use in ICU patients in many countries. Hydromorphone also appears to be used for mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU, but few studies have reported its usefulness. Moreover, remifentanil has been reported to slightly shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation, the time to extubation after ceasing sedation, and the ICU stay. However, this drug is not commonly administered in the ICU because of its side effects of acute tolerance and hyperalgesia. Therefore, fentanyl is a relatively common choice of opioid used in multinational, randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and especially in Japanese ICUs. However, no systematic review of fentanyl intervention and no evidence of the benefits of fentanyl have been provided yet.

We hypothesized that fentanyl is associated with better outcomes than other opioids in mechanically ventilated adults in the ICU. Therefore, this meta-analysis evaluated the effects of fentanyl by analyzing the results of previous RCTs that compared fentanyl with other opioids and integrated the outcomes on the basis of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system.

Most patients who require intensive care need effective analgesia and sedation to control potentially unpleasant symptoms such as pain and anxiety. Analgesics and sedatives are also used to allow patients to tolerate nursing procedures and tracheal intubation and to aid in mechanical ventilation. Most commonly, the combined use of a sedative agent with an opioid is used to achieve this. The sedative agent is titrated towards the degree of sedation and opioids are added as judged necessary for pain control.

The pharmacodynamic effects of traditionally used sedative and opioid drugs are unpredictable and often prolonged in the critically ill patient for various reasons. The pharmacokinetics are altered with different volumes of distribution and elimination half-lives. Multiple drugs are given in large doses for prolonged periods, which can lead to drug interactions and tolerance. There is altered organ function with impaired renal/hepatic function, altered regional blood flow, protein and enzyme system dysfunction and altered receptor response. In addition, the most commonly used sedatives and opioids have a context-sensitive half-time that increases with time. Thus, these drugs will accumulate during prolonged use. All opioids have sedative properties to various degrees at high doses. However, traditionally the opioid part of a sedation regime is kept to a minimum to protect against opioid accumulation and an unpredictable recovery/weaning from mechanical ventilation.

Remifentanil hydrochloride is a potent, selective μ-opioid receptor agonist that has a rapid onset of action (about 1 min) and quickly achieves steady state. Remifentanil is metabolised by non-specific plasma esterases and is therefore independent of organ function. Remifentanil is rapidly metabolised and has a context-sensitive half-time of about 2 to 3 min that is independent of duration of infusion. These features of remifentanil make it an ideal agent for use in critically ill patients. It is easy to titrate and can be given in relatively high doses for prolonged periods without risk of accumulation or delayed offset of effects. It allows the opioid to be used as the main drug to provide patient comfort with the sedative agent being kept to a minimum. Remifentanil as part of an analgesic-based sedative regime (analgo-sedation) has been studied in critically ill patients for up to 5 days.

Conclusions

During a shortage of remifentanil availability, patients underwent prolonged mechanical ventilation with an increased incidence of associated complications. The findings of this study support the necessity of outcome monitoring during drug shortages, particularly of ICU outcomes.

5.7 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia

Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence (9.3)]. Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior.

Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.14)].

5.8 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients

The use of ROXYBOND in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.

Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: ROXYBOND-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of ROXYBOND [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Regularly evaluate patients, particularly when initiating and titrating ROXYBOND and when ROXYBOND is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)]. Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.

Buprenorphine — pharmacologic characteristics relevant to emergency department use indicate it is a more potent (25 to 40 times) and longer-lasting analgesic than morphine, with a half-life of 24 hours or more, and it appears to act primarily as a partial agonist at μ-opioid receptors.

Prasugrel

An RCT in healthy volunteers showed that 5 mg of i.v. morphine could reduce the peak concentration (C max) of prasugrel active metabolite by 31% (P < 0.05) despite that it did not significantly alter the AUC and drug absorption of 60-mg prasugrel and its effects on platelets.

### Tolerance to opioid-induced respiratory depression in chronic high-dose opioid users: a model-based comparison with opioid-Naïve individuals [^116TSsCb]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Ventilation was described by an inhibitory E max model whereby ventilation is a function of α × RF (Eq. 2), where RF is the fraction of opioid receptors activated by fentanyl and α, a parameter that incorporates receptor reserve and intrinsic ligand activity. In cases where α < 1, ventilation displays an apparent maximum in ventilatory depression. In such cases, apnea is not reached, even at very high concentrations with full receptor occupancy; α < 1 occurs with mu‐opioid receptor partial agonists, such as buprenorphine. 17 In our analysis, the population mean for α was not different from 1, but the estimated interindividual variability in α indicated that apnea could occur with α > 1 at the individual level (Table 2). We earlier modeled ventilation using a different (power) function that predicts that apnea occurs at a finite opioid plasma concentration in all subjects. 30, 31 We preferred the current approach, as the E max model is more versatile and apnea did not occur in every subject. Our modeling results in opioid‐naïve subjects are in agreement with earlier findings, with, for example, similar values for α (0.91) and t½kₑ₀ (16 minutes). 17, 32 PK modeling results are also consistent with previous analyses, with similar clearance estimate (0.98 L/minute) and volumes of distribution of the same order of magnitude. 17

Safety

The reported incidence of adverse effects in this study was the same in the remifentanil and comparator groups. The incidence was also similar to those in other studies looking at the safety of remifentanil and comparator agents in ICU patients. The adverse events were also in keeping with events that one would expect in an ICU population. The only serious adverse event that was reported as drug-related occurred in the comparator group. This was of severe life-threatening hypotension. Deaths were the same in each group and at the expected rate for an ICU population. No deaths were reported as a result of the study drug. There were no reports of muscle rigidity or of prolonged μ-opioid effects as a consequence of using remifentanil. There was no statistical difference in the incidence of re-intubation between the two treatment groups.

There was no evidence of adverse SAS or PI scores on discontinuing the remifentanil. The mean SAS and PI scores were the same in each group and stable for the 24-hour post-treatment period. Investigators were able to use the regime of their choice to optimise PI and SAS after extubation, in line with routine clinical practice. There was no evidence that remifentanil sensitised opioid receptors or that the rapid offset of pharmacodynamic effects of remifentanil caused problems with control of pain after extubation.

Exposure to study drugs

In the comparator group the weighted mean infusion rates of fentanyl and morphine were relatively constant throughout the study. The large increase in the morphine requirements on days 8 and 9 represented one patient only.

The weighted mean remifentanil infusion rate to maintain optimum SAS and PI scores was 19.2 μg kg⁻¹ h⁻¹ (0.32 μg kg⁻¹ min⁻¹) (Table 4). This is slightly higher than reported previously, but well within the infusion rates recommended. The remifentanil use remained relatively constant throughout the study, and generally the remifentanil was given for longer than the other opioids (Fig. 5, Table 4).

The midazolam requirements were considerably reduced in the remifentanil group and were relatively constant throughout the treatment period (Figs 4 and 6). This is a reflection of the hypnotic-agent-sparing effects of remifentanil and the ease with which the infusion can be titrated to obtain optimum patient comfort.

### Understanding the blood-brain barrier and beyond: challenges and opportunities for novel CNS therapeutics [^112Y4HW2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

The need to distinguish among rate, extent, and brain binding in understanding CNS drug delivery can be exemplified by results on opioids (Table 1).

Table 1
Opioid rate and extent of BBB transport and brain binding to illustrate the independence of these parameters

These results clearly show that a drug can have a fast rate of BBB transport (permeability clearance) but have a low extent of BBB transport (K p, uu, brain; e.g. due to being a strong P‐gp (and/or BCRP) substrate), whereas also the opposite is possible, with a slow rate of BBB transport but a higher CNS delivery. This clearly illustrates that rate, extent, and binding are three independent properties. More generally speaking, K p, uu, brain can differ 430‐fold, as shown in Table 1. This clinically relevant range is smaller than what has been obtained for total brain concentrations (as log BB or K p), which has been shown to differ by up to at least 2,000‐fold, or for BBB permeability, which span an even larger range of up to at least 20,000‐fold, the 2 latter promising more than what can be accomplished clinically. The extent of delivery of unbound drug is considered to be the most important measure, unless a fast rate (in and out) is essential (e.g. in achieving and recover from anesthesia).

### Opioids for sedation: has the pendulum swung too far? [^111RNQor]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

For a decade, analgosedation has been a cornerstone of supportive care in the ICU. However, Duprey and colleagues' recent article is a reminder that opioids are not benign. In a cohort of 4,075 adult patients in a mixed ICU, any administration of an opioid in an awake, nondelirious patient was associated with a 45% increase in the odds of delirium the following day in a dose-dependent fashion while controlling for relevant covariates. Furthermore, total opioid use increased substantially over the course of the study. Here, we argue that in the shift toward analgosedation and sedative hypnotic avoidance, the pendulum may have swung too far, with important implications for opioid use in the ICU.

Analgosedation encompasses two distinct strategies that, in practice, represent significantly different approaches: 1) analgesia-first sedation, wherein an analgesic is used before a sedative, or 2) analgesia-based sedation, wherein an analgesic is used instead of a sedative. Analgesia-based sedation goes beyond the idea of addressing pain first and uses opioids to manage agitation or facilitate mechanical ventilation. Duprey and colleagues' evaluation mirrors a practice shift toward analgesia-based sedation; the mean opioid dose was 10 times higher from 2017 to 2019 than from 2015 to 2016 — 478 mg versus 56 mg — and patients were more likely to receive an opioid at a higher median dose on a day when pain scores were not documented. This trend held true even for unarousable patients, who were the most likely to receive an opioid (at the highest median dose).

The push to replace sedatives with opioids has limited evidence. The largest randomized controlled trial to date failed to demonstrate the benefit of a nonsedation strategy on 90-day mortality, ICU- and ventilator-free days, and coma- and delirium-free days despite less sedative use and lighter sedation. Conversely, analgesia-based sedation has improved patient-centered outcomes such as pain management and ventilator-free days in a number of studies; however, these trials have notable limitations. Remifentanil, a synthetic opioid with a 3- to 4-minute half-life independent of end-organ function, limits generalizability. Studies often use a suboptimal comparator (e.g. midazolam-based sedation) or describe cohorts with short durations of intubation, making it difficult to assess the impact of the intervention. Finally, retrospective pre/post-study designs may be influenced by confounders such as adoption of sedation protocols.

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^114Cxgat]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Other Medications

IV magnesium sulfate has been shown to reduce hospitalizations among patients with life-threatening asthma exacerbations and COPD exacerbations in the ED, and it should be considered in patients not responding to initial therapies (Table 2).– The use of ketamine, a dissociative analgesic with bronchodilator effects, has been suggested in patients who are not intubated at low, subdissociative doses; however, quality data showing a clinical benefit are lacking. Some interest exists in using biologic agents in asthma exacerbations, given their relatively quick onset over days, although data have been limited to case reports and 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrating that benralizumab administered in the ED reduced the rate of recurrent exacerbations in the subsequent 12 weeks. Methylxanthines (eg, theophylline and aminophylline) and terbutaline, an IV β₂-agonist, are not recommended for asthma or COPD exacerbations among adults because of their lack of efficacy compared with inhaled β 2 -agonists, and methylxanthines are associated with increased side effects and adverse events such as tachyarrhythmias.

Inhaled Gases

The use of volatile anesthetics for life-threatening asthma exacerbations has been described in case reports, although prospective data are insufficient to support their use outside of refractory cases of bronchospasm until further research is carried out. – No role currently exists for volatile anesthetics in severe COPD exacerbations because studies show mixed effects on respiratory mechanics compared with IV sedation. Helium-oxygen (heliox) mixtures, used to promote laminar flow and to reduce airway resistance, may improve respiratory mechanics during severe asthma exacerbations, although data are limited on meaningful clinical outcomes in this population. – Among COPD exacerbations requiring NIV or IMV, heliox improves the work of breathing and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi). Two RCTs of COPD exacerbations requiring NIV found that heliox did not prevent NIV failure; however, trends toward lower intubation rates and greater time to NIV failure were noted in the heliox group. – Heliox could be considered on a case-by-case basis as an adjunct therapy for patients with severe asthma and COPD exacerbations refractory to other treatments.
