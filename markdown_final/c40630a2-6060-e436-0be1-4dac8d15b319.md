## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Treatment of intra-abdominal infections in adults (caused by klebsiella species + serious)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage for treating serious intra-abdominal infections in adults caused by Klebsiella species. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity stratification. Then, I should verify which agents have explicit FDA-labeled dosing for Klebsiella IAI. Next, I will review guideline-based empiric therapy choices and dosing principles. After that, I need to consider special populations and PK/PD optimizations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with durations and monitoring needs, making sure I double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: serious intra-abdominal infections are typically complicated, polymicrobial, and often involve ESBL-producing Enterobacterales such as Klebsiella, so empiric therapy must balance timely, adequate coverage with stewardship and de-escalation once cultures return. I should confirm that contemporary guidelines endorse risk stratification and early source control as foundational, which they do, including the 2024 SIS update and IDSA risk-assessment guidance [^41ae0612] [^bafa2d6b].

> Wait, let me verify which agents have explicit FDA labeling for Klebsiella IAI dosing. Tobramycin has labeled dosing for serious intra-abdominal infections caused by Klebsiella: 1 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 7–10 days, with a higher dose of 1.66 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for life-threatening infections, which directly addresses the pathogen and severity construct here [^01770f73] [^8f00374d]. I should also note that cefepime is indicated for cIAI when combined with metronidazole and lists Klebsiella among covered organisms, though the exact IAI dose is inferred from general adult dosing rather than a Klebsiella-specific IAI line item, so I need to be cautious and anchor dosing to the cIAI indication plus metronidazole [^54f73328] [^7e96bc7b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about empiric choices. I should review guideline-backed regimens by risk. For higher-risk patients, including those with severe illness, HA-IAI, or ESBL risk, carbapenems such as meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours or imipenem-cilastatin 500–1000 mg IV every 6–8 hours are recommended, with ertapenem 1 g IV every 24 hours reserved for lower-risk CA-IAI or as de-escalation when appropriate. This aligns with SIS 2024 and prior SIS guidance and is supported by FDA labeling for meropenem in cIAI [^41ae0612] [^597c5b7a] [^359d6ad9]. I should double-check that these choices cover ESBL-Klebsiella, which they do, though local susceptibility patterns should guide selection and de-escalation [^41ae0612].

> I need to ensure I incorporate newer options for resistant Klebsiella. For suspected or confirmed ESBL or KPC-producing Klebsiella, ceftazidime-avibactam plus metronidazole is recommended in higher-risk settings, and imipenem-relebactam is also recommended for empiric therapy in appropriate contexts. Observational data suggest improved outcomes with CAZ-AVI in KPC infections, though I should confirm that these data are largely from bloodstream infections and extrapolated to IAI, which is reasonable in the absence of IAI-specific RCTs [^71751948] [^ae31433d] [^8ed9427f]. But wait, what if the patient is critically ill with augmented renal clearance or high MICs? In that scenario, prolonged or continuous infusion of beta-lactams may be considered to optimize PK/PD targets, acknowledging mixed clinical trial data and the need for individualized assessment [^7c3da6c0] [^87bebbef].

> Let me consider alternative regimens when beta-lactams are not suitable. Fluoroquinolone-based therapy such as ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV every 12 hours or levofloxacin 750 mg IV/PO daily plus metronidazole can be used in lower-risk patients or when beta-lactams are contraindicated, but I should confirm local fluoroquinolone resistance rates for Klebsiella because resistance is substantial in many regions, which limits empiric reliability [^e6c9da26] [^161cd405] [^7c0d8442]. I should also remember that moxifloxacin monotherapy is an option in select lower-risk CA-IAI, though it lacks reliable anaerobic coverage and should be chosen judiciously [^b971fdce] [^41b152a2].

> Next, I should review dosing principles that apply across agents. For hydrophilic beta-lactams in severe sepsis, a loading dose 1.5 times the standard dose is reasonable to overcome third-spacing, with subsequent dosing adjusted to renal function and reassessed daily. For aminoglycosides, once-daily dosing is preferred in many contexts, but the FDA Klebsiella IAI entries specify 1 mg/kg every 8 hours, so I should adhere to that label for tobramycin in this indication and consider TDM to mitigate nephrotoxicity and ensure target attainment [^7d084cb7] [^01770f73] [^790f8848]. I should confirm that dose adjustments for obesity and organ dysfunction are addressed; SIS suggests using higher-end beta-lactam dosing or TDM in critically ill or obese patients, and tobramycin dosing should be based on adjusted body weight in obesity [^f416e843].

> I will now examine duration and de-escalation. Standard durations for complicated IAI are 5–14 days, with shorter validated courses when source control is achieved and the patient is clinically improving. SIS 2024 supports de-escalation to the narrowest effective agent once cultures return and clinical response is satisfactory, which is especially pertinent when empiric carbapenems were used for ESBL risk [^41ae0612]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies even if the initial regimen was broader than ultimately required, which the guideline explicitly endorses to reduce resistance pressure [^41ae0612].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified answer. For serious Klebsiella IAI in adults, if the patient is higher risk or ESBL/KPC risk is present, use meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours or imipenem-cilastatin 500–1000 mg IV every 6–8 hours, adding metronidazole if anaerobic coverage is needed; consider ceftazidime-avibactam 2.5 g IV every 8 hours plus metronidazole if KPC-producing Klebsiella is suspected or confirmed, and consider prolonged infusion for beta-lactams in critical illness. If the patient is lower risk and local resistance allows, cefepime 2 g IV every 8–12 hours plus metronidazole is reasonable, with ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV every 12 hours plus metronidazole as an alternative when beta-lactams are unsuitable. For tobramycin specifically, use 1 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 7–10 days, escalating to 1.66 mg/kg IV every 8 hours if life-threatening, with TDM and renal function monitoring. I should confirm that all choices are adjusted to renal function and local susceptibility data before finalizing [^359d6ad9] [^498a8e6a] [^71751948] [^54f73328] [^e6c9da26] [^01770f73] [^8f00374d].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought tobramycin could be dosed once daily for IAI based on general PK/PD principles, but that would contradict the FDA labeling for Klebsiella IAI, which specifies 1 mg/kg every 8 hours. I should correct that and stick to the labeled regimen here, reserving once-daily aminoglycoside strategies for other indications or when supported by local protocols and TDM infrastructure [^01770f73] [^790f8848]. I also need to ensure that any mention of piperacillin-tazobactam is framed carefully; while it remains an option for some IAIs, evidence suggests inferior outcomes in ESBL bloodstream infections compared with carbapenems, so if ESBL-Klebsiella is likely, a carbapenem or CAZ-AVI is preferred over piperacillin-tazobactam for empiric therapy pending susceptibilities [^d23e3528] [^f9490780].

> Finally, I should confirm that source control and timely administration are emphasized alongside dosing. Early operative or percutaneous source control and prompt antibiotics within the first hour in septic patients are critical modifiers of outcome, and dosing should be reassessed daily as renal function, clinical status, and culture results evolve to enable de-escalation and avoid under- or overdosing in dynamic critical illness [^41ae0612] [^7d084cb7].

For serious intra-abdominal infections caused by Klebsiella species in adults, **meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours** [^359d6ad9] is first-line therapy due to broad-spectrum coverage, including ESBL-producing strains [^597c5b7a]. If meropenem is unavailable or contraindicated, **ertapenem 1 g IV every 24 hours** [^6a1b04c9] is an alternative for lower-risk patients or as step-down therapy [^41ae0612]. For severe or life-threatening infections, **imipenem-cilastatin 500–1,000 mg IV every 6–8 hours** [^498a8e6a] is recommended. Adjust dosing for renal impairment [^9dc9c853] and consider therapeutic drug monitoring for aminoglycosides when used [^790f8848]. Treat for 7–10 days, extending to 10–14 days if response is slow or source control is delayed [^notfound].

Table 3 (continued) — antimicrobial therapy for community-acquired intra-abdominal infection (CA-IAI) and healthcare-associated intra-abdominal infection (HA-IAI) includes graded recommendations as follows: We recommend ertapenem for empiric therapy of CA-IAI in lower risk patients or a broad-spectrum carbapenem (doripenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or meropenem) for CA-IAI in higher risk patients who reside in MDR-endemic areas (Grade I-B). We recommend standard antimicrobial agent dosages for lower risk patients with CA-IAI who are not severely obese or do not have substantial renal or hepatic impairment (Grade I-B). We recommend against changing antimicrobial agent therapy based on culture results in lower risk patients with CA-IAI who have a satisfactory clinical response to source control and empiric therapy (Grade I-B). We recommend routinely de-escalating antimicrobial agent therapy in higher risk patients with CA-IAI and HA-IAI to the narrowest spectrum agent or agents with activity against microorganisms isolated by definitive culture (Grade I-B). We recommend against antimicrobial agents to prevent infection in patients with severe or necrotizing pancreatitis (Grade I-B). Where Enterobacteriaceae are mentioned in this table, the order Enterobacterales should be substituted.

Use adjusted dosages based on outcome data, pharmacokinetic parameters, and therapeutic drug monitoring, where applicable, in patients with significant renal impairment (Grade 2-B), and use adjusted dosages of selected, hepatically eliminated or metabolized agents in substantial hepatic impairment (Grade 2-B). Consider use of adjusted dosages based on outcome data and pharmacokinetic parameters in obese patients (Grade 2-B).

Carbapenems are generally considered the empiric agents of choice for treating patients with the most common ESBL-producing Enterobacterales. To avoid excessive carbapenem use, however, de-escalation to other agents, such as piperacillin-tazobactam when a MIC ≤ 8 mg/L (according to the EUCAST breakpoint) is detected, can be considered. Several studies compared piperacillin-tazobactam with carbapenems in the treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales. In the MERINO trial, the efficacy of piperacillin-tazobactam versus meropenem in the treatment of BSIs caused by ceftriaxone-resistant E. coli or K. pneumoniae was compared, showing an overall 30-day mortality rate threefold higher in the piperacillin-tazobactam arm than in the meropenem one (12.3% versus 3.7%, p = 0.90). Since the low mortality rate in the meropenem group was an unexpected finding, the results of this study have been debated and several issues may have influenced the outcomes of this trial. Among the debated biases, the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target attainment of piperacillin-tazobactam was not optimized, as the trial favoured intermittent 1-h infusion over a prolonged infusion protocol. Also, from a microbiological point of view, the use of the E-test to determine piperacillin/tazobactam susceptibility led to an elevated percentage of OXA-1-producing pathogens being incorrectly identified as piperacillin-tazobactam susceptible (E-test method cannot detect OXA-1). In a second comparative study (MERINO-2 trial), 72 patients with BSIs due to chromosomal AmpC producers were enrolled in a multicenter randomized controlled trial, where they were assigned 1:1 to receive piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem. Piperacillin-tazobactam led to more microbiological failures, although fewer microbiological relapses were observed. Despite several pieces of evidence coming from observational studies showed no significant difference in efficacy and mortality rate between piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems among patients with ESBL-producing BSIs, the use of a carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem) for severe infections caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales is generally recommended in critically ill patients.

Antimicrobial dosing recommendations by patient risk and organ function — We recommend use of standard doses of antimicrobial agents for lower-risk patients with CA-IAI who are not severely obese and who do not have substantial renal or hepatic impairment (Grade 2-B). We suggest use of higher dosages of antimicrobial agents for selected higher-risk patients with severe or advanced IAI or HA-IAI (Grade 2-B). We suggest use of adjusted doses for patients with significant renal impairment, with therapeutic drug monitoring where applicable (Grade 2-B). We suggest use of adjusted doses of selected, hepatically cleared agents in substantial hepatic impairment (Grade 2-B). We suggest use of adjusted doses of selected agents for management of IAI in obese patients (Grade 2-B). We suggest that prolonged or continuous infusion of β-lactam antibiotic agents does not need to be used routinely for treatment of IAI, but is an option for critically ill patients and those at risk for infection with resistant gram-negative pathogens (Grade 2-B).

(6) Intra-abdominal infections including peritonitis caused by Streptococcus species*, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci (including Peptostreptococcus* species and Peptococcus* species) Proteus mirabilis*, and Clostridium species*.

(7) Bone and/or joint infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase and non-penicillinase producing strains), Streptococcus species (including S. pyogenes*), Pseudomonas species (including P. aeruginosa*), and Proteus mirabilis*.

(8) Central nervous system infections, e.g., meningitis and ventriculitis, caused by Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae* and Escherichia coli*.

(*) Efficacy for this organism, in this organ system, has been studied in fewer than 10 infections.

Although many strains of enterococci (e.g. S. faecalis) and Pseudomonas species are resistant to cefotaxime sodium in vitro, Cefotaxime for Injection, USP has been used successfully in treating patients with infections caused by susceptible organisms.

Specimens for bacteriologic culture should be obtained prior to therapy in order to isolate and identify causative organisms and to determine their susceptibilities to cefotaxime. Therapy may be instituted before results of susceptibility studies are known; however, once these results become available, the antibiotic treatment should be adjusted accordingly.

In certain cases of confirmed or suspected gram-positive or gram-negative sepsis or in patients with other serious infections in which the causative organism has not been identified, Cefotaxime for Injection, USP may be used concomitantly with an aminoglycoside. The dosage recommended in the labeling of both antibiotics may be given and depends on the severity of the infection and the patient's condition. Renal function should be carefully monitored, especially if higher dosages of the aminoglycosides are to be administered or if therapy is prolonged, because of the potential nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of aminoglycoside antibiotics. It is possible that nephrotoxicity may be potentiated if Cefotaxime for Injection, USP is used concomitantly with an aminoglycoside.

Recently, Montravers et al. demonstrated that de-escalation is a feasible option in patients with polymicrobial infections such as healthcare-associated IAIs. In a context of a dedicated "antibiotic stewardship" program, de-escalation should be encouraged, whenever possible, to optimize antibiotic use.

Emphasis on MDRO epidemiology is needed to better understand current strategies of prevention and management of critically ill patients in ICUs.

A rational use of antibiotics is important in order to prevent the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, especially in ICUs. In critically ill patients, positive cultures may actually represent contamination. Antibiotic stewardship for critically ill patients may be translated into the implementation of specific guidelines, which were largely promoted by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, targeted to optimizing choice, dosage, and duration of antibiotics in order to improve outcomes and reduce the development of resistance.

Some prospective and several retrospective observational studies support CAZ-AVI in the treatment of BSIs, cIAIs, and complicated urinary tract infections in settings with an ICU admission for up to 60%. Van Duin et al. assessed prospectively 137 CPE infections (38 treated with CAZ-AVI versus 99 with colistin-based regimens). In patients treated with CAZ-AVI versus colistin, 30-day hospital mortality after starting treatment was 9% versus 32%, respectively. Moreover, at 30 days, patients treated with CAZ-AVI, compared with those treated with colistin, had a 64% probability of better outcomes. Tumbarello et al. demonstrated the effectiveness of CAZ-AVI against KPC-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) infections by two retrospective observational studies, conducted in Italy. The first study enrolled 138 patients starting CAZ-AVI salvage therapy after first-line treatment (median, 7 days) with other antibiotics. CAZ-AVI was administered with at least 1 other active antibiotic in 109 (78.9%) cases. Thirty-day mortality among the 104 patients with BSIs secondary to KPC-Kp infections was significantly lower than that of a matched cohort whose KPC-Kp bacteremia had been treated with drugs other than CAZ-AVI (36.5% versus 55.8%, p = 0.005). In the second study 577 adult patients with BSIs (391) or nonbacteremic infections, involving mainly urinary tract, lower respiratory tract and intra-abdominal structures, were analyzed. All received treatment with CAZ-AVI alone (165) or with ≥ 1 other active antibiotics (412). The all-cause mortality rate 30 days after infection onset was 25% (146/577). There was no significant difference in mortality between patients managed with CAZ-AVI alone and those treated with combination regimens (26.1% versus 25.0%, p = 0.79). Only 35 out of 577 BSIs were associated with IAIs. This did not give sufficient information about the role of the drug in this specific setting but conformed how often IAIs are compartmentalized. CAZ-AVI has activity against most KPC and OXA-48-like-producing CPE, and currently, it represents the preferred treatment option for OXA-48-like-producing infections.

Antimicrobial dosing optimization in critically ill intra-abdominal infection (IAI) patients — optimizing dosing is presented as another means to conserve antimicrobial resources, with altered pharmacokinetic parameters common in critically ill patients (including those with IAI) that can cause underdosing and overdosing. The guideline states that extended infusions to optimize pharmacodynamics are an attractive approach but have not yet shown clear clinical benefits in patients with IAI, and that dosing optimization for patients at the extremes of age, obese patients, and those with renal or hepatic impairment has not been investigated sufficiently and should be considered given their risk profile.

### The surgical infection society guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection: 2024 update [^658e676a]. Surgical Infections (2024). High credibility.

Surgical Infection Society (SIS) intra-abdominal infection guideline — 2024 update methods and scope state that SIS previously issued evidence-based guidelines in 1992, 2002, 2010, and 2017. The update was based on a systematic review using PubMed/Medline, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science from 2016 until February 2024; Keywords/descriptors combined "surgical site infections" or "intra-abdominal infections" in adults limited to randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, and additional relevant publications identified during literature review were included. Recommendations were graded with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system, with strength rated strong (1) or weak (2) and quality rated high (A), moderate (B), or weak (C). The guideline contains new recommendations and updates to recommendations from previous 14 guideline versions, with final recommendations developed by an iterative process and all writing group members voting to accept or reject each recommendation. The updated evidence-based guideline provides recommendations for the treatment of adult patients with IAI, including antimicrobial agent selection, timing, route of administration, duration, and de-escalation; timing of source control; and treatment of specific pathogens.

Statement 25

The correct dose and correct administration of antimicrobials should include: 1) loading dose when indicated, especially in critically ill patients; 2) extended or prolonged infusion for beta-lactam antibiotics; 3) peritoneal distribution (Recommendation 2 C).

To ensure timely and effective administration of antimicrobial therapy in patients with severe infection, clinicians must consider also the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics properties of the employed antibiotics.

The "dilution effect", also known as the "third spacing phenomenon", is very important for hydrophilic agents. Higher than standard loading doses (LD) of hydrophilic agents such as beta-lactams should be administered to ensure optimal exposure at the infection site, maintaining a therapeutic threshold that considers the effects of renal function.

In patients with sepsis and septic shock, missing of LD results in an under exposure to hydrophilic antibiotics that may be critical for patients.

Once appropriate initial loading is administered, daily reassessment of the antimicrobial regimen is warranted because pathophysiological changes may significantly affect drug availability.

The mechanisms of action of antibiotics should also be taken into account in establishing the maintenance dose. Some antibiotics, including beta-lactam antibiotics, exhibit time-dependent activity and exert optimal bactericidal activity when drug concentrations are maintained above the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), whereas high peak concentrations are not beneficial. As a consequence, the more prolonged the time during which the drug levels are above the MIC value, the greater is the chance of clinical cure. In fact, prolonged or continuous infusions of beta-lactams have been proposed in order to maximize the time that the drug concentration exceeds the MIC.

However, the results obtained from clinical studies on the continuous or extended infusion of beta-lactams, including two blinded multicenter RCTs, were not conclusive. The first RCT, of 60 patients, showed that continuous infusion (CI) was associated with higher clinical cure, while the second one, of 432 patients, did not find significant differences in the clinical cure of patients receiving CI or intermittent administration of beta-lactams. This difference could be partially explained by the enrollment of patients on renal replacement therapy in the second RCT.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^81920fa6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Statement 14

Antibiotic regimens with activity against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria should be used for selected patients with IAIs who are strongly suspected or proved to be harbouring a resistant pathogen (Moderate-quality evidence, Strong recommendation).

Initial antibiotic therapy for cIAIs is typically empiric in nature because standard microbiologic data and susceptibility results generally require 24–72 h after peritoneal fluid specimen collection. Blood cultures are seldom positive in cIAI (< 10%) and therefore largely unreliable. Typical bacterial pathogens in IAIs reflect endogenous gut flora including Enterobacterales such as E. coli and Klebsiella spp. viridans group Streptococcus, and anaerobes (especially Bacteroides spp.). Historically, cIAI pathogens tended to have greater susceptibility in community- as opposed to hospital-acquired infections.

IAIs caused by susceptible bacteria may be managed by beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (e.g. ticarcillin/clavulanic acid or piperacillin/tazobactam), or a non-pseudomonal carbapenem (e.g. ertapenem). Increasing AMR to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid among E. coli and other Enterobacterales worldwide has compromised its clinical utility for empiric therapy; it should only be prescribed as targeted therapy based on demonstrated susceptibility. The comparably broad-spectrum activity of piperacillin/tazobactam makes it still useful in managing severe IAIs. However, the anti-pseudomonal activity of piperacillin/tazobactam is unnecessary for most community-acquired cIAIs, and its use in hospital-acquired infections should be determined based on local microbiologic epidemiology.

Many isolates of E. coli and other Enterobacterales are susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins that, in combination with metronidazole, may be options for empiric therapy of non-severe IAIs. Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin with a broader spectrum of activity than third-generation cephalosporins. Compared to ceftriaxone, cefepime is poorly hydrolysed by AmpC beta-lactamase, allowing it to be effective against AmpC-producing organisms. For empiric therapy, cefepime must also be given with metronidazole. Fluoroquinolones have been prescribed widely for the treatment of IAIs because of their putative activity against aerobic gram-negative bacteria, tissue penetration, and high oral bioavailability. However, resistance of E. coli and Klebsiella spp. to fluoroquinolones has increased substantially over time, limiting their use for empiric treatment of IAIs.

Antimicrobial therapy

Empirical antibiotic therapy plays a crucial role in the effective management of IAIs; as inadequate initial antimicrobial treatment is associated with less favourable patient outcomes and the emergence of AMR, it is crucial to prescribe antibiotics correctly, with the right spectrum of activity, at the right time, for the right duration and with the right dosage. Optimizing antibiotic prescribing in the hospital setting results in improved treatment effectiveness and patient safety. This minimizes the risk of opportunistic infections such as Clostridioides difficile infection and mitigates the risk of selecting antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. The growing emergence of MDR organisms has caused an impending crisis with alarming implications, particularly concerning Gram-negative bacteria. Antimicrobial treatment should be started when a treatable infection has been recognized or strongly suspected. Misuse and abuse of antimicrobial agents, combined with the inappropriate application of infection prevention and control measures, are recognized as major drivers of the increasing prevalence of AMR.

AMR has become a global threat to public health systems in recent decades. Italy is ranked among the lowest-performing countries in AMR control in Europe by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), primarily due to alarmingly high levels of AMR observed in Italian hospitals. In January 2017 a team of experts in antimicrobial stewardship selected by the ECDC planned a four-day visit to Italy to investigate and evaluate the situation in the country regarding prevention and control of AMR. In the report drafted by the ECDC Committee, the experts highlighted the threat represented by the AMR, and the crucial necessity to design a national plan of action to address this burden.

In 2022, the ECDC published an interesting document evaluating the health impact of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the EU/EEA. The report, covering the period from 2016 to 2020, showed that the overall burden of infections attributed to AMR pathogens, adjusted for population size, was highest in Greece, Italy, and Romania. In Italy, an alarming pattern of resistance involving MDR and extensively drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria has emerged in recent years, and multi-resistant Enterobacterales are now a major concern in daily clinical practice. This phenomenon may be partially attributed to a high average age of the population, predisposing to the development and spread of AMR. However, it is likely to be influenced by a poor perception of the AMR burden. Hence, there is a critical need to raise awareness among Italian healthcare workers regarding the importance of the management of infections, including IAIs.

In addition, these results may not be generalizable to patients with high severity of illness and infections caused by less susceptible pathogens with high MIC for which the greatest potential for a clinically relevant benefit may be predicted by pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic theory. This has been supported by some retrospective studies. Prolonged or continuous infusions of beta-lactams should therefore be considered for the treatment of critically ill patients with HAI-IAIs.

Conversely, for antibiotics with concentration dependent activity, such as aminoglycosides, the use of a higher dose at extended interval (i.e. once daily) is strongly recommended.

The use of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has been associated with higher clinical success and lower rate of toxicity. It is recommended mainly, but not only, for drugs with a narrow ratio between efficacy and toxicity, such as glycopeptides and aminoglycosides.

Antimicrobials typically need to reach a site of action outside the plasma passing through the capillary membranes. Disease- and drug-related factors contribute to differential tissue distribution. Concentration gradient between the plasma and the peritoneal space may be of high relevance in case of multidrug-resistant bacteria. It has been studied for some antibiotics and has shown large variability in drug availability. Data suggest that increased doses of ceftazidime, meropenem, and imipenem are required to reach adequate concentrations in patients with severe intra-abdominal infections. In contrast, plasma and peritoneal concentrations of cefepime and cefotaxime seem to be quite similar and an increase in the doses is probably not required. The same concept can be applied for tigecycline with lipophilic characteristics that are minimally impacted by severe intra-abdominal infections.

Statement 26

The patient should be reassessed when the results of microbiological testing are available. Antimicrobial de-escalation or withdrawal should be considered (Recommendation 1C).

Once initial loading is achieved, it is recommended that clinicians reassess the antimicrobial regimen daily, given that pathophysiological changes may occur that significantly alter drug disposition in critically ill patients.

Lower-than-standard dosages of renally excreted drugs must be administered in the presence of impaired renal function, while higher-than-standard dosages of renally excreted drugs may be required for optimal exposure in patients with glomerular hyperfiltration.

Table 2 overviews recommended dosing regimens of the most commonly used renally excreted antimicrobials.

Table 2
Recommended dosing regimens (according to renal function) of the most commonly used renally excreted antimicrobials

The therapeutic approach undertaken by clinicians must take into account the activity of employed antimicrobials.

Antibiotics such as quinolones, daptomycin, tigecycline, aminoglycosides, polienes, and echinocandins exhibit concentration-dependent activity; as such, the dose should be administered in a once-a-day manner (or with the lowest possible daily administrations) in order to achieve zenithal plasma levels.

Beta-lactams, glycopeptides, oxazolidinones, and azoles exhibit time-dependent activity and exert optimal bactericidal activity when drug concentrations are maintained above the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC).

The efficacy of time-dependent antibacterial agents in severely ill patients is related primarily to the maintenance of supra-inhibitory concentrations, and therefore multiple daily dosing may be appropriate.

For these drugs, continuous intravenous infusion ensures the highest steady-state concentration under the same dosage constraints and may therefore be the most effective means of maximizing pharmacodynamic exposure.

For patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal infections (CA-IAIs), agents with a narrower spectrum of activity are preferred. However, if CA-IAI patients have prior exposure to antibiotics or serious comorbidities requiring concurrent antibioitic therapy, anti-ESBL-producer converage may be warranted. By contrast, for patients with healthcare-associated infections, antimicrobial regimens with broader spectra of activity are preferred (Recommendation 1B).

### 2013 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^e51f74a8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy

Initial antibiotic therapy for IAIs is typically empirical in nature because the patient needs immediate attention, and microbiological data (culture and susceptibility results) can require up to 48 hours before they are available for a more detailed analysis.

IAIs can be treated with either single or multiple antimicrobial regimens depending on the range requirements of antimicrobial coverage.

Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations exhibit in vitro activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms and are viable options for empirical treatment of IAIs. However, the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae observed in community-acquired infections restricts this regimen's empirical use to patients who are not at risk for these drug-resistant microorganisms.

In the past, Cephalosporins have often been used in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. Among third generation cephalosporins, subgroups with both limited and strong activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (cefepime and ceftazidime) have been used in conjunction with metronidazole to treat IAIs. Enterobacteriaceae can have acquired resistance to both cephalosporins, while such resistance is intrinsic in Enterococci.

In light of the increasing prevalence of ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae due to selection pressures related to overuse of cephalosporins, routine use of these antibiotics is strongly discouraged.

Aztreonam is a parenteral synthetic beta-lactam antibiotic and the first monobactam marketed for clinical use. The drug exhibits potent in vitro activity against a wide spectrum of gram-negative aerobic pathogens (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa), but its routine use is discouraged due to selection pressures favoring resistant strains, and it therefore shares the same constraints associated with cephalosporin use.

Carbapenems offer a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic pathogens (with the exception of MDR resistant gram-positive cocci). For more than 2 decades, carbapenems have been considered the agents of "last resort" for multidrug-resistant infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae. In the last decade, increased carbapenem consumption has been associated with an increased emergence of carbapenem resistance among Enterobacteriacea, particularly in Klebsiella pneumoniae.

Cultures should be taken from intra-abdominal samples during surgical or interventional drainage procedures. Surgeons must ensure sufficient volume (a minimum of 1 mL of fluid or tissue) before sending the samples to a clinical laboratory by means of a transport system that properly handles the samples so as not to damage them or compromise their integrity.

The empirically designed antimicrobial regimen depends on the underlying severity of infection, the pathogens presumed to be involved, and the risk factors indicative of major resistance patterns (Recommendation 1B).

Predicting the pathogens and potential resistance patterns of a given infection begins by establishing whether the infection is community-acquired or healthcare-associated (nosocomial).

The major pathogens involved in community-acquired intra-abdominal infections are Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus species, and anaerobes (especially B. fragilis).

Contrastingly, the spectrum of microorganisms involved in nosocomial infections is significantly broader. In the past 20 years, the incidence of healthcare-associated infections caused by drug-resistant microorganisms has risen dramatically, probably in correlation with escalating levels of antibiotic exposure and increasing frequency of patients with one or more predisposing conditions, including elevated severity of illness, advanced age, degree of organ dysfunction, low albumin levels, poor nutritional status, immunodepression, presence of malignancy, and other comorbidities.

Although the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms is most frequently observed in acute care facilities, all healthcare settings are affected by the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens.

In past decades, an increased prevalence of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus species, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species, multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter species, and Candida species has been observed, particularly in cases of intra-abdominal infection.

Which interventions improve antibiotic prescribing practices for patients with IAIs?

Interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing practices for patients with IAIs should be directed at two different levels:
Patient level — which includes clinical severity, epidemiological exposures, PK/PD factors, comorbidities, prior antibiotic exposure, prior infection, or colonization with MDROs and infection source
Hospital level — including presence of in-hospital antimicrobial stewardship programs, availability of local guidelines and updated microbiological data, infection control policy, educational activities, and structural resources (like computer-assisted order entry)

Significant data supports the importance of antibiotic prescribing practices for patients with IAIs, in critically ill and non-critically ill patients and in community and hospital-acquired infections. Prescribing practices may influence the outcome and cost of treatment as well as the risk of superinfection and resistant pathogens in the individual patient and the broader environment. Components of antibiotic prescribing practices that may influence outcome and the risk of developing superinfection and antibiotic resistant infections include (a) adequacy of empiric antibiotic therapy, (b) the time to initial antibiotic therapy, (c) appropriate pharmacokinetic dosing, (d) de-escalation of antibiotic therapy, (e) length of treatment, and (f) avoidance of unnecessary antibiotic therapy.

### KPC-3 Klebsiella pneumoniae ST258 clone infection in postoperative abdominal surgery patients in an intensive care setting: analysis of a case series of 30 patients [^411bc46b]. BMC Anesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominal surgery carries significant morbidity and mortality, which is in turn associated with an enormous use of healthcare resources. We describe the clinical course of 30 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients who underwent abdominal surgery and showed severe infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae sequence type (ST) 258 producing K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC-Kp). The aim was to evaluate risk factors for mortality and the impact of a combination therapy of colistin plus recommended regimen or higher dosage of tigecycline.

Methods

A prospective assessment of severe monomicrobial KPC-Kp infections occurring after open abdominal surgery carried out from August 2011 to August 2012 in the same hospital by different surgical teams is presented. Clinical and surgical characteristics, microbiological and surveillance data, factors associated with mortality and treatment regimens were analyzed. A combination regimen of colistin with tigecycline was used. A high dose of tigecycline was administered according to intra-abdominal abscess severity and MICs for tigecycline.

Results

The mean age of the patients was 56.6 ± 15 and their APACHE score on admission averaged 22.72. Twenty out of 30 patients came from the surgical emergency unit. Fifteen patients showed intra-abdominal abscess, eight anastomotic leakage, four surgical site infection (SSI) and three peritonitis. The overall crude ICU mortality rate was 40% (12 out of 30 patients). Twelve of the 30 patients were started on a combination treatment of high-dose tigecycline and intravenous colistin. A significantly lower mortality rate was observed among those patients compared to patients treated with approved dose of tigecycline plus colistin. No adverse events were reported with high doses of tigecycline.

Conclusions

Critically-ill surgical patients are prone to severe post-surgical infectious complications caused by KPC-Kp. Timely microbiological diagnosis and optimizing antibiotic dosing regimens are essential to prevent worse outcomes. Further studies and well-controlled clinical trials are needed to define the optimal treatment of infections by KPC-Kp and, more generally, carbapenem-resistant bacteria.

Given the results of these studies, the inclusion of an anticandidal drug in empirical regimens for nosocomial IAIs seems appropriate.

The recently published Pappas IDSA guidelines for the treatment of invasive candidiasis do not dedicate a specific section to candidal peritonitis. However, the use of echinocandins is generally recommended as a first-line empirical treatment for critically ill patients, while fluconazole is typically recommended for less severe conditions.

Applying these trends to IAIs, the use of echinocandins is recommended as a first-line treatment in cases of severe nosocomial IAI.

Knowledge of mechanisms of secretion of antibiotics into bile is helpful in designing the optimal therapeutic regimen for patients with biliary-related intra-abdominal infections (Recommendation 1C).

The bacteria most often isolated in biliary infections are Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia, gram-negative aerobes, as well as certain anaerobes, particularly Bacteroides fragilis. Given that the pathogenicity of Enterococci in biliary tract infections remains unclear, specific coverage against these microorganisms is not routinely advised.

The efficacy of antibiotics in the treatment of biliary infections depends largely on the therapeutic level of drug concentrations.

The medical community has debated the use of antimicrobials with effective biliary penetration to address biliary infections. However, no clinical or experimental evidence is available to support the recommendation of biliary-penetrative antimicrobials for these patients. Other important factors include the antimicrobial potency of individual compounds and the effect of bile on antibacterial activity.

If there are no signs of persistent leukocytosis or fever, antimicrobial therapy for intra-abdominal infections should be shortened for patients demonstrating a positive response to treatment (Recommendation 1C).

An antimicrobial-based approach involves both optimizing empirical therapy and curbing excessive antimicrobial use to minimize selective pressures favoring drug resistance.

Shortening the duration of antimicrobial therapy in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections is an important strategy for optimizing patient care and reducing the spread of antimicrobial resistance.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^45deca07]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

How should the correct antibiotic be chosen in patients with IAIs?

14. In patients with IAIs, empiric antibiotic therapy should be based on the local microbiological epidemiology, clinical severity, and individual patient risk factors for resistant bacteria (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

15. In most patients with IAIs, agents with a narrow spectrum of activity should be preferred. In community-acquired IAIs, the most common resistance problem is posed by alarmingly prevalent extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

16. The following risk factors for ESBLs-producing Enterobacterales infections should be always considered: (a) hospitalization for 48 h within the last 90 days, (b) use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for 5 days within the last 90 days, (c) gut colonization by ESBLs within 90 days and (d) patients coming from healthcare settings with a high incidence of MDR bacteria (Low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

17. Antibiotic therapy aimed at enterococcal coverage should not be routinely prescribed in patients with community-acquired IAIs unless they are immunocompromised (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

18. Empirical antibiotic therapy covering MDR Gram-negative bacteria should be considered only in specific settings, and based on country-wide epidemiological conditions, clinical severity, immunological impairment, knowledge of colonization status, prolonged exposure to carbapenems and/or quinolones (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

In the setting of IAIs, inappropriate choice of initial antibiotic therapy in patients leads to more clinical failure, resulting in a longer hospital stay and higher costs of hospitalization compared with appropriate initial antibiotic therapy. Before causative agent(s) and susceptibilities are known, the optimal choice of antibiotic therapy depends on the local prevalence of resistant bacteria and patient risk factors for them as long as available microbiological data (e.g. colonization status).

Dosing regimens should depend on the time-dependency or concentration-dependency antibacterial activity of the selected agent. Beta-lactams exhibit time-dependent activity which is optimal when trough concentrations (C min) persist above the MIC, namely C min > MIC. Intensified frequency dosing, prolonged infusions and/or continuous infusions may improve the likelihood of achieving this target. Under the same daily dose, prolonged or continuous infusions may maximize the attainment of C min > MIC. Large randomized controlled trials comparing continuous versus intermittent infusion of piperacillin/tazobactam in patients with cIAIs as well as of piperacillin/tazobactam, ticarcillin/clavulanate or meropenem in patients with severe sepsis, did not find improvement in clinical outcomes. However, the generalizability of these findings should not be extended to patients having high severity of illness and/or infections caused by borderline susceptible pathogens with high MIC, for whom the clinically relevant benefit predicted by the PK/PD theory should be the greatest. This has been supported by some retrospective studies. Consequently, prolonged, or continuous infusions of beta-lactam agents should be considered beneficial for treating severely critically ill patients with abdominal sepsis, especially in settings with a high prevalence of MDR pathogens.

A recent multicentre randomized trial showed that, in critically ill patients with sepsis, continuous infusion of meropenem was not superior to intermittent infusion in reducing mortality and emergence of pandrug-resistant or extensively drug-resistant bacteria at day 28. However, it has been argued that some bias might have affected the findings and limited the possibility of drawing definitive conclusions, namely a relatively long duration of hospitalization before randomization, the baseline severity of the underlying condition and the relatively small sample size. Overall, prolonged or continuous infusions of beta-lactam agents should therefore be considered as an added value when treating critically ill patients with abdominal sepsis. Conversely, antibiotics with concentration-dependent activity may maximize their effect when attaining a peak plasma concentration (C max) to MIC (C max /MIC) ratio > 8–10, so once-daily pulse dosing should be the preferred method of administration.

Third generation cephalosporins including cefotaxime and ceftriaxone in association with metronidazole, may be still options for the treatment of mild IAIs. Ceftazidime and cefoperazone are third generation cephalosporins with an activity against P. aeruginosa. Cefepime, is a fourth-generation cephalosporin, with broader spectrum activity than third generation cephalosprins and effective against AmpC-producing organisms. For empiric therapy, also cefepime should also be combined with metronidazole because it does not possess anti-anaerobic activity.

Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are no longer appropriate choice as first-line treatment in many geographic regions because of the prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance. However, when employed, these drugs should be used in association with metronidazole. In many current practices, the fluoroquinolones remain available for patients presenting allergy to beta-lactams, with mild intra-abdominal infections.

Carbapenems offer a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic pathogens (with the exception of MDR-resistant gram-positive cocci). Group 1 carbapenems include ertapenem. This group has activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens, but not active against P. aeruginosa and Enterococcus species. Group 2 includes imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem, and doripenem, which share activity against non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli.

For more than two decades, carbapenems have been considered the agents of choice for multidrug-resistant infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae. The recent and rapid spread K. pneumoniae carbapenems resistant has become a critical issue in hospitals worldwide. The use of carbapenems should be limited so as to preserve activity of this class of antibiotics because of the concern of emerging carbapenem-resistance.

Antibiotic PD refers to the relationship existing between drug exposure and its capability to inhibit bacterial growth. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) is the primary parameter used in vitro to assess the effectiveness of an antibiotic against its target bacteria. To obtain a therapeutic effect, in case of time-dependent antibiotics, namely the beta-lactams, the concentration at the infection site should exceed the MIC against the target bacteria for at least 40% of the dosing interval, and ideally for longer up to 400% (e.g. 100% fT > 4 × MIC); in case of concentration-dependent antibiotics, namely the aminoglycosides maximum concentration should be 8–tenfold higher than the MIC (C max /MIC ratio > 8–10). Antibiotic PK describes how antibiotics are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated from the body, determining the time course and concentration of antibiotics in serum and tissues and at the site of infection. Suboptimal concentrations at the target site may have important clinical consequences such as therapeutic failure and promotion of AMR development, especially when clinical isolates have borderline in vitro susceptibility. Tissue distribution is an important feature because high concentrations at the infection site may prevent resistance development. Generally, tissue distribution is higher for lipophilic agents compared to hydrophilic ones, but disease-related factors may concur with differential tissue distribution. In patients with severe IAIs, increased doses may be needed to attain adequate concentrations of ceftazidime, meropenem, and imipenem. The findings of an observational prospective study including critically ill patients with suspicion of IAI needing surgery and empirical therapy with a beta-lactam were published in 2020. It was found that high doses of beta-lactams were able to attain 100% serum fT > 4 × MIC within the first 24 h in as much as 78% of critically ill patients having severe IAIs. To define optimal beta-lactam dosing, the PK/PD target should consider both tissue penetration rate and local antimicrobial susceptibility.

### Ceftazidime-avibactam use for Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae infections: a retrospective observational multicenter study [^8ed9427f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

A growing body of observational evidence supports the value of ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI) in managing infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed observational data on use and outcomes of CAZ-AVI therapy for infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) strains. Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify variables independently associated with 30-day mortality. Results were adjusted for propensity score for receipt of CAZ-AVI combination regimens versus CAZ-AVI monotherapy.

Results

The cohort comprised 577 adults with bloodstream infections (n = 391) or nonbacteremic infections involving mainly the urinary tract, lower respiratory tract, and intra-abdominal structures. All received treatment with CAZ-AVI alone (n = 165) or with ≥ 1 other active antimicrobials (n = 412). The all-cause mortality rate 30 days after infection onset was 25% (146/577). There was no significant difference in mortality between patients managed with CAZ-AVI alone and those treated with combination regimens (26.1% vs 25.0%, P = 0.79). In multivariate analysis, mortality was positively associated with presence at infection onset of septic shock (P = 0.002), neutropenia (P < .001), or an INCREMENT score ≥ 8 (P = 0.01); with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) (P = 0.04); and with CAZ-AVI dose adjustment for renal function (P = 0.01). Mortality was negatively associated with CAZ-AVI administration by prolonged infusion (P = 0.006). All associations remained significant after propensity score adjustment.

Conclusions

CAZ-AVI is an important option for treating serious KPC-Kp infections, even when used alone. Further study is needed to explore the drug's seemingly more limited efficacy in LRTIs and potential survival benefits of prolonging CAZ-AVI infusions to ≥ 3 hours.

Treatment

Participants were stratified and dosed by age group as summarized in Table 1. The selected doses were based on population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulations. Treatment duration was 5–14 days. Optional open-label oral step-down therapy with a protocol-defined standard-of-care regimen was permitted after 3 days (9 doses) of IV therapy. Recommended oral step-down therapy options included β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, second- or third-generation cephalosporins in combination with metronidazole, or quinolones (if ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin were chosen, it was to be used in combination with metronidazole), with choice of therapy guided by culture results and based on local antibacterial susceptibility patterns.

TABLE 1.
Summary of Dosing and Pharmacokinetic Sampling Schedule by Age Cohort

Specimen Collection

Details regarding specimen collection and pathogen characterization are provided in Supplemental Digital Content 1. Briefly, specimens were collected at the beginning of the interventional procedure before debridement, removal or disinfection of the primary infection site. Culture of the intra-abdominal specimen, isolation of pathogen(s), initial identification of pathogen(s) and susceptibility testing were conducted by local laboratories. Isolates were submitted to a central laboratory for identification and evaluation of antibacterial susceptibility profiles using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) reference testing methodology and quality control recommendations. Isolates that displayed predefined minimum inhibitory concentration criteria were screened for the presence of ESBL-encoding genes.

Assessments and End Points

Clinical and microbiologic assessments were performed at the end of the IV treatment visit, which was scheduled < 24 hours after the last IV dose of therapy, the end of treatment (EOT) visit, which was scheduled < 48 hours after the last dose of oral step-down therapy (if applicable), and the test of cure (TOC) visit, which occurred 7–14 days after the last dose of study treatment. The EOT visit only applied to those participants who were switched to oral step-down therapy.

The primary end points were rates of AEs and changes in laboratory values and vital signs from the first dose of study treatment through the last follow-up visit (21–28 days after the last dose) in all participants of the treated population. Key secondary end points were clinical success rate at the EOT and TOC visits, defined as the proportion of participants who had a clinical response of cure, and per-participant microbiologic success rate at the EOT and TOC visits, defined as the proportion of participants who had microbiologic eradication or presumed eradication (defined in Supplemental Digital Content 1,) of all baseline pathogens.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^f9490780]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The role of piperacillin/tazobactam in treating patients with ESBL-producing Enterobacterales has been debated. Gram-negative bacteria may express multiple ESBLs as well as AmpC beta-lactamases concomitantly, and can manifest other mechanisms of resistance, limiting the activity of piperacillin/tazobactam. On the other hand, the activity of beta-lactam agents, including piperacillin/tazobactam, is influenced by the "inoculum effect", an increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an antibiotic when the inoculum size is larger. A RCT conducted in patients with ESBL-producing Enterobacterales blood stream infections showed inferior results of piperacillin/tazobactam compared to carbapenems. Although piperacillin/tazobactam is not considered the first-choice antibiotic to treat ESBL-producing Enterobacterales, it may be an option for IAIs with adequate source control when bacteria are susceptible (MIC ≤ 4 mg/L). A high dose or prolonged/continuous infusion should be prescribed to optimise pharmacokinetics (PK) targeting in critically ill patients.

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^7c0d8442]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

In addition to the expected increased resistance to beta-lactams, fluoroquinolone resistance in ESBL-positive Escherichia coli causing intra-abdominal infections ranges from 60 to 93% in India, China, North America, Europe, and South Africa. Although carbapenem activity against isolates from IAIs is also high, it is slightly lower than activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from urinary tract infections.

Predicting the pathogens and potential resistance patterns of a given infection begins by establishing whether the infection is community-acquired or healthcare-associated.

F or patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal infections (CA-IAIs), agents with a narrower spectrum of activity are preferred. However, in CA-IAI patients at risk for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) producing Enterobacteriaceae infections, anti-ESBL-producer coverage may be warranted. For patients with healthcare-associated infections (HA-IAIs), antibiotic regimens with broader spectra of activity are preferred (Recommendation 1B).

Initial antibiotic therapy for IAIs is typically empirical in nature because a patient with abdominal sepsis needs immediate treatment, and microbiological data (culture and susceptibility results) can require up to 48–72 h before they are available for a more detailed analysis. Selection of appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy is critical for preventing unnecessary morbidity and mortality from cIAIs. The major pathogens involved in community-acquired intra-abdominal infections are usual residents of gastrointestinal flora, including Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci, and certain anaerobes (particularly Bacteroides fragilis). Narrower spectrum antimicrobial agents are appropriate for these patients.

In the context of intra-abdominal infections, the main resistance problem is posed by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, which are prevalent in hospital-acquired infections but observed in CA-IAIs too.

Specific risk factors for ESBL-producing bacteria in community-acquired infections include recent exposure to antibiotics (particularly third generation cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones) within 90 days of IAI or known colonization with ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae.

Coque and coll. highlighted the growing threat posed by increasing prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae all over Europe, even in countries traditionally showing low prevalence rates of resistance. Increase of this resistance pattern has led to a progressive expansion of carbapenems use, because this class of antibiotics was traditionally considered the last resort for managing ESBL producers Enterobacteriaceae.

The inevitably increased carbapenem consumption has been associated to increasing carbapenemase production among Enterobacteriaceae. The recent rapid spread of serine carbapenemase in Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC) is now an additional major threat for antimicrobial therapy in hospitals worldwide, and stresses the concept that the use of carbapenems must be mandatorily optimized in terms of indication and exposure.

Also Acinetobacter spp have worldwide shown similar alarming rates of increasing resistance to antibiotics. Today, Carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii-producing oxacillinases retaining susceptibility to only colistin and tigecycline is an ominous reality in hospitals worldwide and compounding this problem is the paucity of new antibiotics under development to address it.

In hospital acquired IAIs also P. aeruginosa plays an important - although less critical than in other settings - role. The high intrinsic antibiotic resistance of this pathogen, together with its extraordinary capacity for acquiring additional resistances through chromosomal mutations, should be always taken into consideration.

Among multidrug resistant Gram positive bacteria, Enterococci remain a challenge despite the availability of large number of antimicrobial agents theoretically active against this species. The clinical management of enterococcal infection remains challenging, mainly because no single agent could be anticipated to exert strong bactericidal activity against them.

Intra-abdominal infection (IAI) carbapenem use — The task force concluded that ertapenem is an acceptable agent for monotherapy for lower-risk patients with CA-IAI, and because its spectrum is narrower the task force recommends use of broader-spectrum carbapenems for empiric treatment of higher-risk patients with CA-IAI and those with HA-IAI, although treatment could be de-escalated to ertapenem if resistant pathogens were not identified in definitive cultures. For ertapenem evidence, the task force identified nine RCTs published since 2000 evaluating monotherapy and success rates were similar to comparators except in one trial, in which ertapenem was found to be superior to ampicillin–sulbactam. Across broad-spectrum carbapenems, doripenem versus meropenem in adult IAI was studied in two large RCTs with no significant differences in clinical success; doripenem, however, has not been approved for use in pediatric patients. Imipenem–cilastatin has been evaluated in seven RCTs published since 2000 and in 19 RCTs previously, with one small recent study showing significantly lower success than ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole and prior trials finding one study where it was superior to comparators and two where it was inferior. Meropenem has eight RCTs published since 2000 with no statistically significant differences versus comparators.

### Pathogen prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility among enterobacteriaceae causing hospital-associated intra-abdominal infections in adults in the United States (2012–2013) [^1e970585]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Selection and prompt initiation of the appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy are critical to decrease morbidity and mortality and shorten the length of hospitalization among patients with hospital-associated intra-abdominal infections (HA-IAIs). Therapeutic choices for the treatment of patients with HA-IAI require careful consideration. This study was conducted to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility of common pathogens collected from adult patients with HA-IAI in the United States.

Methods

Gram-negative bacilli (N = 1285) were collected during 2012–2013 from SMART (Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends). Isolates were tested at a central laboratory by using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methods and interpretation of susceptibility to 12 antimicrobial agents.

Findings

Most of the isolates (80.8%) were Enterobacteriaceae, and Escherichia coli was the most common species. Susceptibility to frequently used antimicrobial agents for treating IAI showed that ertapenem, imipenem, and amikacin were more active than other agents against Enterobacteriaceae, including multidrug-resistant isolates. More than 92% of E coli, including extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producers, and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to ertapenem, imipenem, and amikacin. Cefepime was the most active (> 90% susceptibility) cephalosporin against all species except K pneumoniae (86.6%) but with much reduced activity against isolates with ESBLs. Piperacillin/tazobactam had reduced activity against Enterobacter species (70.4%-76.4% susceptible) and ESBL-producing K pneumoniae (22.5% susceptible). Fluoroquinolones exhibited poor activity against E coli (overall susceptibility < 70%).

Implications

Proper empiric antimicrobial treatment, including combining appropriate agents, of HA-IAI requires detailed understanding of the epidemiology of common pathogens and antimicrobial resistance patterns. In light of rising rates of antimicrobial resistance, ongoing surveillance is critical for clinical decision-making.

Meropenem-vaborbactam is another agent active against KPC-producing CPE. A phase III RCT (TANGO II) assessed 47 patients affected by CPE infections. Of these patients, 32 were treated with meropenem-vaborbactam and the other 15 with best-available therapy (including mono/combination therapy with colistin, carbapenems, aminoglycosides, tigecycline, or ceftazidime-avibactam alone). Meropenem-vaborbactam showed a better clinical cure rate (65.6% versus 33.3%; p = 0.03) and a lower mortality rate (15.6% versus 33.3%; p = 0.20) compared to the best available therapy. However, patients enrolled in this RCT required ICU admission only in 15.6% of cases. Other evidence for meropenem-vaborbactam as targeted therapy for CPE infections in critically ill patients came from observational studies, in which ICU admission ranged from 65.4% to 70%.

Imipenem-relebactam, another agent active against KPC, was compared to imipenem and colistin in the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, cIAIs, or complicated urinary tract infections caused by imipenem-non susceptible bacteria (RESTORE-IMI 1 trial). The favourable overall response was observed in 71% imipenem/relebactam and 70% colistin + imipenem patients. Day 28 favourable clinical response was observed in 71% imipenem/relebactam and 40% colistin + imipenem patients, and 28-day mortality in 10% imipenem/relebactam and 30% colistin + imipenem patients. Unfortunately, only 2 patients per arm with cIAIs were enrolled. Serious adverse events, as well as nephrotoxicity, occurred more often in patients treated with imipenem and colistin. Imipenem-relebactam retains good in vitro activity against P. aeruginosa. Of 1912 P. aeruginosa isolates recovered as a part of a multicenter Canadian surveillance study, 166 (8.7%) and 495 (25.9%) demonstrated difficult-to-treat resistance and MDR phenotypes, respectively. Among these isolates, several antibiotics were tested.

When treating abdominal sepsis, clinicians must be aware that drug pharmacokinetics may significantly vary between patients due to the changeable pathophysiology of sepsis and must also consider the pathophysiological and immunological status of the patient.

The "dilution effect", also called as "third spacing" phenomenon, must be considered when administering the loading dose of hydrophilic antibacterial agents such as beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and glycopeptides, which distribution is limited to the extracellular space. Otherwise, the dilution effect may cause underexposure at the infection site, namely in the peritoneal fluid, and may cause treatment failure and/or resistance development.

Generally, to ensure prompt achievement of adequate therapeutically effective drug exposure at the infection site in patients with sepsis or with septic shock the loading dose of beta-lactams or glycopeptides should be 1.5-fold higher than the standard one used in clinically stable patients. Afterwards, the maintenance doses should be based on the degree of the patient's renal function and should be reassessed daily, because the changeable pathophysiological conditions of the critically ill patients may significantly affect drug disposition. Maintenance doses of renally excreted drugs must be decreased in patients with impaired renal function and must be increased in patients with augmented renal clearance (a creatinine clearance > 130 mL/min). Serum creatinine is an unreliable marker of renal function in critically ill patients. Urinary creatinine clearance should be measured to properly assess the renal function.

In the context of intra-abdominal infections, the main resistance problem is posed by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, which are alarmingly prevalent in nosocomial infections and frequently observed in community-acquired infections, albeit to a lesser extent.

The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) program monitors the activity of antibiotics against aerobic gram-negative intra-abdominal infections. Hawser et al. reported susceptibility levels of key intra-abdominal pathogens in Europe in 2008 and noted that the number of viable treatment options available for empirical treatment of intra-abdominal infections had fallen dramatically.

Although a variety of factors can increase the risk of selection for ESBL producers, the most significant risk factors include prior exposure to antibiotics (especially third generation cephalosporins) and comorbidities requiring concurrent antibiotic therapy.

In a study published by Ben-Ami et al. researchers evaluated risk factors for non-hospitalized patients that increased susceptibility to ESBL-producing infections; the study compiled data from 6 treatment centers in Europe, Asia, and North America.

A total of 983 patient-specific isolates were analyzed; 890 [90.5%] were Escherichia coli; 68 [6.9%] were Klebsiella species; and 25 [2.5%] were Proteus mirabilis. Overall, 339 [34.5%] of the observed isolates produced ESBLs. Significant risk factors identified by multivariate analysis included recent antibiotic exposure, residence in long-term care facilities, recent hospitalization, and advanced age greater than 65 years. Additionally, men appeared to be more prone to these infections than women.

However, 34% of the analyzed ESBL isolates were derived from patients with no recent healthcare exposure.

Bacteria producing Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs) are rapidly emerging as a major source of multidrug-resistant infections worldwide. The recent emergence of carbapenem resistance among Enterobacteriaceae poses a considerable threat to hospitalized patients.

Key points Klebsiellais a type of bacteria normally found in human stool that can cause healthcare-associated infections. Klebsiellacan cause pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound or surgical site infections, and meningitis.
- Some Klebsiellabacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. Overview Klebsiella is a type of gram-negative bacteria normally found in human stool that can cause HAIs. Klebsiella are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, including carbapenems. Signs and symptoms Klebsiella can cause pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound or surgical site infections, and meningitis. Who is at risk In healthcare settings, Klebsiella infections commonly occur among sick patients receiving treatment for other conditions.

Patients with devices like ventilators or intravenous catheters, and patients taking long courses of certain antibiotics are most at risk for Klebsiella infections. Healthy people usually do not get Klebsiella infections. How it spreads
- Person-to-person contact.
- Contact with contaminated water or soil.
- Contact with contaminated equipment or intravenous catheters).
- Wounds caused by injury or surgery. Klebsiella does not spread through the air. Prevention Patients Patients should clean their hands often, including:

- Before preparing or eating food.
- Before touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
- Before and after changing wound dressings or bandages.
- After using the restroom.
- After blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
- After touching hospital surfaces such as bed rails, bedside tables, doorknobs, remote controls or the phone.

Healthcare providers Healthcare staff should always follow core infection control practices to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients. Testing and diagnosis To determine if someone has a Klebsiella infection, healthcare providers will send a specimen to the laboratory. Testing can also determine what treatment will work best. Treatment and recovery Klebsiella infections are generally treated with antibiotics. Unfortunately, some Klebsiella bacteria are resistant to multiple antibiotics, which makes them difficult to treat.
