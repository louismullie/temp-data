## Question

Tetralogy of fallot

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about tetralogy of Fallot. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core anatomy and pathophysiology to anchor decisions. Then, I should verify epidemiology and natural history to frame urgency. Next, I will examine diagnostic strategies, including prenatal predictors of early intervention. After that, I need to appraise management controversies: timing, primary versus staged repair, and valve-sparing techniques. I will then review long-term outcomes and surveillance, including pulmonary regurgitation and arrhythmias. Finally, I should consider special populations, emerging interventional strategies, and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified algorithm with explicit uncertainties and evidence gaps.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental anatomy and pathophysiology, because surgical strategy hinges on this. Tetralogy of Fallot is classically defined by four features: a malaligned ventricular septal defect, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction at multiple levels, overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy, all stemming from anterior and cephalad deviation of the infundibular septum; critically, the degree of RVOT obstruction determines the severity of right-to-left shunting and cyanosis, not the size of the VSD itself [^db563e2e] [^2371b196]. Hold on, I should verify the spectrum concept: TOF spans from pulmonary stenosis to pulmonary atresia, and the latter often involves MAPCAs, which materially alter surgical planning and risk [^28d08250] [^77ddb5f0].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and natural history to calibrate urgency. TOF is the most common cyanotic congenital heart defect, with an incidence around 3–5 per 10,000 live births, and prenatal detection is increasingly common, approaching 70% in some series, which facilitates anticipatory planning [^28d08250] [^2b06a6d8]. Wait, let me verify survival without surgery: historical data show dismal outcomes, with only about 3% surviving to age 40 without repair, whereas contemporary series report greater than 98% survival after repair, typically within the first year of life, underscoring the transformative impact of modern surgery [^f6f64f11] [^9ee32dde].

> I will now examine diagnostic strategy, starting with prenatal predictors of early intervention. Fetal echocardiography can identify a subset requiring intervention within 30 days; a pulmonary valve z-score ≤ −3.5 and abnormal ductal flow at 28–32 weeks are strong predictors of prostaglandin dependence and early intervention, guiding delivery planning to centers with surgical capability [^c852dac4] [^2b06a6d8]. Hold on, I should verify postnatal confirmation: pulse oximetry screening helps detect critical CHD, but definitive diagnosis relies on transthoracic echocardiography to define VSD anatomy, RVOT levels of obstruction, pulmonary annular size, branch PA morphology, and coronary course, with CTA reserved for ambiguous coronaries or prior palliation [^f23a5598] [^7ac6f2ce].

> Now, I need to appraise management controversies, starting with timing of repair. For asymptomatic infants, elective complete repair between 3 and 6 months is reasonable and associated with fewer complications and less need for a transannular patch, balancing pulmonary vascular maturity and surgical risk; neonatal repair is generally avoided unless cyanosis is severe or the infant is unstable [^e6c3ce53] [^a372047a]. Wait, let me double-check the evidence signal: multiple cohorts show higher complication rates with repair before 3 months, including longer ventilation and length of stay, and a meta-analysis suggests worse early outcomes with neonatal repair, reinforcing the preference for 3–6 months when feasible [^054c11e9] [^9e7f2792].

> For symptomatic neonates, I should confirm the debate between primary repair and staged palliation. Historically, many centers favored a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt to stabilize pulmonary blood flow, but emerging data suggest transcatheter options such as ductal stenting or RVOT stenting can achieve stabilization with less morbidity than surgery, though they may increase later reintervention burden and require advanced surgical skills at definitive repair [^cd79ae8e] [^452ac096]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: multicenter analyses show no mortality difference between primary repair and staged strategies, but primary repair is associated with more early morbidity, whereas staged approaches may facilitate valve-sparing at the definitive repair; thus, strategy should be individualized to weight, PA size, coronary anatomy, and center expertise [^44fd7207] [^8595b726].

> I should confirm the role of valve-sparing techniques and how anatomy dictates feasibility. When the pulmonary annulus is adequate (z-score > −2.5), valve-sparing repair is reasonable and may reduce chronic pulmonary regurgitation and RV dilation; however, significant annular hypoplasia necessitates transannular patch, and in borderline cases, limited transannular incisions with valve reconstruction are acceptable compromises [^7e0b54e2] [^129e72cb]. Let me reconsider the long-term implications: chronic pulmonary regurgitation is nearly universal after transannular repair and drives RV dysfunction, arrhythmias, and the need for pulmonary valve replacement, so preserving native valve function when possible is a key modifiable factor in long-term outcomes [^dd1b19a2].

> Next, I should review long-term outcomes and surveillance, because survival is only the beginning. Contemporary 30-year survival approximates 90%, but reintervention is common, with freedom from reintervention around 80% at 5 years in some series, driven largely by pulmonary regurgitation and RVOT issues; arrhythmias, exercise intolerance, and heart failure emerge in adolescence and adulthood, necessitating lifelong ACHD follow-up [^9ee32dde] [^6e52e020]. I need to ensure imaging surveillance is explicit: echocardiography remains first-line, with CMR added for RV quantification and pulmonary regurgitation assessment, and CCT when CMR is contraindicated; catheterization is reserved for intervention or when noninvasive imaging is inconclusive [^be8a21a4] [^cff46b55].

> I will now examine special populations and anatomic variants that alter management. Low-birth-weight infants (< 2.5 kg) carry markedly higher mortality and morbidity regardless of strategy, so many centers prefer staged approaches to mitigate risk; similarly, prematurity, small or discontinuous PAs, and genetic syndromes such as 22q11 deletion increase complexity and may favor palliation or hybrid strategies pending growth and stabilization [^0adc7607] [^e05a00f3]. But wait, what if the coronary artery crosses the RVOT? In that scenario, a coronary-sparing ventriculotomy or RV-PA conduit may be necessary to avoid ischemia, reinforcing the need for meticulous preoperative coronary mapping [^96ae7977].

> Let me consider emerging interventional strategies and the future landscape. While complete transcatheter repair is not yet standard, hybrid approaches using ductal or RVOT stenting as a bridge, followed by valve-sparing surgery, are gaining traction; percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement is increasingly used in older children and adults with significant pulmonary regurgitation, and advances in device design and delivery may expand candidacy downward in age [^567ed3f4] [^54508d4b]. Hold on, I should verify the current limitations: durability, infection risk, and the need for repeated interventions remain challenges, so surgical expertise and collaborative decision-making remain essential [^dd1b19a2].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical, risk-stratified algorithm and explicitly state uncertainties. For asymptomatic infants with adequate weight and PA size, elective complete repair at 3–6 months is preferred; for symptomatic neonates or those with high-risk features, consider transcatheter palliation with ductal or RVOT stenting followed by valve-sparing repair after growth; for borderline anatomy, tailor the approach to maximize valve preservation while ensuring adequate RVOT relief, and always plan for lifelong surveillance of RV function and pulmonary regurgitation [^e6c3ce53] [^cd79ae8e]. I should double-check the key evidence gaps: optimal timing in specific subgroups, the true long-term impact of neonatal primary repair versus staged strategies on neurodevelopment, and precise criteria for pulmonary valve replacement timing are still evolving; prospective registries and randomized or quasi-experimental designs are needed to resolve these questions [^efd3c9d9] [^b94826d7].

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is a **cyanotic congenital heart defect** with four features: a ventricular septal defect, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy [^db563e2e]. It presents with cyanosis, hypoxic spells, and a systolic murmur; diagnosis is confirmed by echocardiography [^5d150787], with cardiac MRI and catheterization for detailed anatomy or intervention planning [^cff46b55] [^567ed3f4]. Management is **surgical repair** — typically at 3–6 months [^e6c3ce53] — closing the VSD and relieving RVOT obstruction; symptomatic neonates may need staged repair or transcatheter palliation [^cd79ae8e] [^452ac096]. Early outcomes are excellent (> 98% survival) [^9ee32dde], but long-term complications include pulmonary regurgitation, RV dysfunction, arrhythmias, and the need for pulmonary valve replacement; lifelong surveillance is essential [^dd1b19a2] [^eecddfce].

---

## Anatomical features

The four characteristic features of TOF are:

- **Ventricular septal defect (VSD)**: A large, nonrestrictive VSD allowing right-to-left shunting [^db563e2e].
- **Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (RVOT)**: Subvalvular, valvular, or supravalvular stenosis causing right-to-left shunting and cyanosis [^db563e2e].
- **Overriding aorta**: The aorta straddles the VSD, receiving blood from both ventricles [^db563e2e].
- **Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)**: Secondary to chronic pressure overload from RVOT obstruction [^db563e2e].

---

## Pathophysiology

RVOT obstruction increases right ventricular pressure, causing right-to-left shunting through the VSD and mixing of systemic and venous blood, producing **cyanosis** [^db563e2e]. Hypoxic spells occur when RVOT obstruction suddenly worsens, reducing pulmonary blood flow and increasing right-to-left shunting [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation

Infants with TOF typically present with:

- **Cyanosis**: Bluish discoloration of the skin, lips, and nails due to reduced oxygen saturation [^5d150787].
- **Tet spells**: Hypercyanotic episodes triggered by crying, feeding, or exertion [^notfound].
- **Growth retardation**: Poor weight gain and failure to thrive due to chronic hypoxemia [^notfound].
- **Clubbing**: Digital clubbing from chronic hypoxemia [^eb53361a].
- **Murmur**: A harsh systolic ejection murmur from RVOT obstruction [^eb53361a].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Echocardiography**: Gold standard for diagnosis, defining anatomy and guiding management [^notfound].
- **Chest radiography**: Boot-shaped heart (coeur en sabot), oligemic lungs, and right-sided aortic arch in some cases [^f6f64f11].
- **Electrocardiography**: Right axis deviation, RVH, and right atrial enlargement [^notfound].
- **Cardiac MRI**: Detailed RV function, pulmonary arteries, and aortopulmonary collaterals [^189c9539].
- **Cardiac catheterization**: Reserved for complex anatomy or intervention planning [^a3605c27].

---

## Management

### Surgical management

- **Primary repair**: Elective complete repair at 3–6 months is standard [^e6c3ce53]; VSD closure and RVOT relief (transannular patch or valve-sparing) are performed [^853f6c07].
- **Staged repair**: Initial palliation (BT shunt or ductal/RVOT stent) for symptomatic neonates or high-risk infants, followed by complete repair [^cd79ae8e] [^452ac096].
- **Valve-sparing repair**: Preferred when feasible to reduce chronic pulmonary regurgitation and RV dysfunction [^7e0b54e2] [^fe5b63ea].

---

### Transcatheter interventions

Transcatheter options include **pulmonary valve replacement** for significant pulmonary regurgitation or stenosis [^567ed3f4] and **balloon valvuloplasty** for isolated pulmonary valve stenosis [^3618632d].

---

## Outcomes and complications

Early outcomes are excellent, with **> 98% survival** after repair [^9ee32dde]. Long-term complications include **pulmonary regurgitation** with RV dysfunction, arrhythmias (notably atrial flutter/tachycardia), and the need for pulmonary valve replacement; lifelong cardiology follow-up is required [^dd1b19a2] [^eecddfce].

---

## Prognosis

With modern surgical techniques, long-term survival is **85–90% at 30 years** [^9ee32dde], and most patients lead active lives with appropriate surveillance and management [^73a5cd0e].

---

Tetralogy of Fallot is a complex congenital heart defect requiring **timely surgical repair** and lifelong follow-up. Advances in surgical and transcatheter techniques have markedly improved outcomes, but long-term complications necessitate ongoing surveillance and management [^cdf0c67f].

### Does valve-sparing repair improve outcomes in tetralogy of Fallot? A systematic review [^e1af369e]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

There are good outcomes for patients with TOF due to the development of surgery and enhanced health care. With surgical correction, more than 95% of patients with TOF survive into adulthood. In contrast, among patients who do not undergo corrective surgery, more than 70% are expected to die before reaching adulthood. Early TOF repair is typically performed between 2 and 12 months of age, with optimal timing often between 3 and 6 months in asymptomatic cases, balancing surgical risks and pulmonary vascular development. Early TOF repair in children is one of the surgical improvements that has contributed to these outcomes. Early TOF repair can reduce the negative development of the lungs; in children with TOF, the developing pulmonary vasculature has abnormally reduced flow and pressure, which leads to a reduced cross-sectional area for gas exchange in the lungs. Additionally, failure to repair TOF early can lead to decreased right ventricular compliance, lower left ventricular function, and the presence of arrhythmias. Despite positive outcomes for patients with TOF, improvements in surgical outcomes still have not advanced fast enough. As the prevalence of congenital heart disease increases, continuous refinements in surgical techniques are crucial to improving long-term outcomes for TOF patients. While TOF repair strategies are well established, ongoing discussions exist regarding the optimal timing of repair — particularly the choice between early primary repair and staged palliation in certain high-risk neonates. Additionally, while existing classifications differentiate TOF from TOF with pulmonary atresia, clinical decision-making remains highly individualized based on anatomical and hemodynamic factors, such as duct-dependent circulation and MAPCAs. Rather than relying solely on rigid classification schemes, surgical decisions are tailored to patient-specific presentations. Although there is a growing preference for correcting TOF within the first year of life, the ideal timing remains a subject of discussion. Current practice generally favors performing repair once the infant reaches approximately 6 kg, but in cases of significant cyanosis or hemodynamic instability, earlier intervention may be necessary. Factors contributing to this debate include ongoing discussions regarding the optimal timing of TOF repair within the first year of life, particularly balancing the benefits of early correction with potential risks in smaller infants. While neonatal repair is generally avoided when possible, most centers aim to perform TOF correction as soon as the infant reaches an appropriate weight threshold, typically around 6 kg. The American Association for Thoracic Surgery reported that despite evolving treatment strategies, there are limited data to help clinicians make decisions. This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of preserving the native pulmonary valve in TOF repair for patients in whom valve-sparing techniques are feasible, compared with the non-valve-sparing approach. It is well recognized that the pulmonary annular diameter is a key determinant of surgical strategy, and valve-sparing repair is only applicable in patients with an adequate annulus. In cases of significant annular hypoplasia, transannular patch repair or other techniques are required to relieve right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. While the choice of surgical strategy is dictated by anatomical and clinical considerations, understanding the long-term functional outcomes of these approaches may aid in optimizing postoperative care and patient counseling.

### Tetralogy of Fallot [^cdf0c67f]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common form of cyanotic congenital heart disease, and one of the first to be successfully repaired by congenital heart surgeons. Since the first procedures in the 1950s, advances in the diagnosis, perioperative and surgical treatment, and postoperative care have been such that almost all those born with tetralogy of Fallot can now expect to survive to adulthood. The startling improvement in outcomes for babies born with congenital heart disease in general-and for those with tetralogy of Fallot in particular-is one of the success stories of modern medicine. Indeed, in many countries adults with tetralogy of Fallot outnumber children. Consequently, new issues have emerged, ranging from hitherto unpredicted medical complications to issues with training for caregivers and resource allocation for this population of survivors. Therefore, evolution of treatment, recognition of late complications, research on disease mechanisms and therapies-with feedback to changes in care of affected children born nowadays-are templates on which the timely discussion of organisation of care of those affected by congenital heart diseases from the fetus to the elderly can be based. Here, we focus on new developments in the understanding of the causes, diagnosis, early treatment, and late outcomes of tetralogy of Fallot, emphasising the continuum of multidisciplinary care that is necessary for best possible lifelong treatment of the 1% of the population born with congenital heart diseases.

Objective

Despite decades of experience, aspects of the management of tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis (TOF) remain controversial. Practitioners must consider newer, evolving treatment strategies with limited data to guide decision making. Therefore, the TOF Clinical Practice Standards Committee was commissioned by the American Association for Thoracic Surgery to provide a framework on this topic, focused on timing and types of interventions, management of high-risk patients, technical considerations during interventions, and best practices for assessment of outcomes of the interventions. In addition, the group was tasked with identifying pertinent research questions for future investigations. It is recognized that variability in institutional experience could influence the application of this framework to clinical practice.

Methods

The TOF Clinical Practice Standards Committee is a multinational, multidisciplinary group of cardiologists and surgeons with expertise in TOF. With the assistance of a medical librarian, a citation search in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science was performed using key words related to TOF and its management; the search was restricted to the English language and the year 2000 or later. Articles pertaining to pulmonary atresia, absent pulmonary valve, atrioventricular septal defects, and adult patients with TOF were excluded, as well as nonprimary sources such as review articles. This yielded nearly 20,000 results, of which 163 were included. Greater consideration was given to more recent studies, larger studies, and those using comparison groups with randomization or propensity score matching. Expert consensus statements with class of recommendation and level of evidence were developed using a modified Delphi method, requiring 80% of the member votes with 75% agreement on each statement.

Results

In asymptomatic infants, complete surgical correction between age 3 and 6 months is reasonable to reduce the length of stay, rate of adverse events, and need for a transannular patch. In the majority of symptomatic neonates, both palliation and primary complete surgical correction are useful treatment options. It is reasonable to consider those with low birth weight or prematurity, small or discontinuous pulmonary arteries, chromosomal anomalies, other congenital anomalies, or other comorbidities such as intracranial hemorrhage, sepsis, or other end-organ compromise as high-risk patients. In these high-risk patients, palliation may be preferred; and, in patients with amenable anatomy, catheter-based procedures may prove favorable over surgical palliation.

Conclusions

Ongoing research will provide further insight into the role of catheter-based interventions. For complete surgical correction, both transatrial and transventricular approaches are effective; however, the smallest possible ventriculotomy should be utilized. When possible, the pulmonary valve should be spared; and if unsalvageable, reconstruction can be considered. At the conclusion of the operation, adequate relief of the right ventricular outflow obstruction should be confirmed, and identification of a significant fixed anatomical obstruction should prompt further intervention. Given our current knowledge and the gaps identified, we propose several key questions to be answered by future research and potentially by a TOF registry: When to palliate or proceed with complete surgical correction, as well as the ideal type of palliation; the optimal surgical approach for complete repair for the best long-term preservation of right ventricular function; and the utility, efficacy, and durability of various pulmonary valve preservation and reconstruction techniques.

### Tetralogy of Fallot will be treated interventionally within two decades [^54508d4b]. Pediatric Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Tetralogy of Fallot is considered a prototype congenital heart disease because of its embryological, anatomical, pathophysiological, and management aspects. Current management usually relies on a complete surgical repair that is electively performed between 3 and 6 months of age. With the advances of interventional cardiology especially in the fields of ventricular septal defect closure, stent, and pulmonary valve replacement, the question of complete repair of tetralogy of Fallot by interventional means can be discussed. Tetralogy of Fallot is a complex disease with multiple lesions, all individually amenable to transcatheter treatment. In this article, we will review current status of various aspects of tetralogy of Fallot focusing on interventional aspects, giving insights of what would be the ideal platform of a fully interventional repair.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2014). Medium credibility.

Repaired tetralogy of Fallot — epidemiology and survival — has an average incidence of 32.6 per 100,000 live births, and in the United States, approximately 4 million live births annually translate to roughly 1,300 new patients each year. Contemporary reports indicate that > 98% of these infants survive surgical repair, usually during the first year of life, and long-term outcomes show a 30-year survival rate of 90%. As a result, the number of patients with repaired TOF increases each year, and in many communities, adult survivors now outnumber infants and children.

### Early primary repair of tetralogy of Fallot [^69af753e]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery: Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Annual (2009). Low credibility.

Outcomes for surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis are often considered to be a useful benchmark for the assessment of congenital surgical programs. This procedure, including preoperative assessment and postoperative management, falls in the middle of the spectrum of difficulty of all the congenital cardiac procedures. Within this anomaly itself, there is a wide spectrum of severity and difficulty. However, it is important to distinguish tetralogy with pulmonary stenosis or "simple tetralogy" from the much more complex anomaly tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia. Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis is virtually always operable. It is also a progressive condition that is therefore best repaired in early infancy following echocardiographic diagnosis alone.

Long QT syndrome is a well-described entity in infants. Its presentation in the context of congenital heart disease is rare and is almost exclusively diagnosed postoperatively. For patients undergoing surgical intervention, preoperative knowledge of the diagnosis and appropriate perioperative management can be life-saving. We present the rare case of an infant with tetralogy of Fallot who was preoperatively diagnosed with long QT syndrome and discuss the implications of this diagnosis for his perioperative management.

Introduction

Tetralogy of Fallot is considered a prototype congenital heart disease because of its embryological, anatomical, pathophysiological, and management aspects. Understanding of pathophysiology and management of this disease have evolved over decades. Operated tetralogy of Fallot patients have become a major group of patients in adult congenital heart disease category. Clinical spectrum of tetralogy of Fallot varying from severe cyanosis and ductus dependent pulmonary circulation to older patients with subtle cyanosis. Current management usually relies on a complete surgical repair that is electively performed between 3 and 6 months of age. This timing can be overwhelmed in situation where pulmonary blood is not sufficient to provide adequate oxygenation. Care of those patients may be more complicated requiring a multi-disciplinary approach involving cardiologists, interventionists, and cardiac surgeons. Patients with inadequate pulmonary blood flow usually have to go to palliative approach before being amenable to a complete repair. With the advances of interventional cardiology especially in the fields of ventricular septal defect closure, stent, and pulmonary valve replacement, the question of complete repair of tetralogy of Fallot by interventional means can be discussed. Tetralogy of Fallot is a complex disease with multiple lesions, all individually amenable to transcatheter treatment. In this article, we will review current status of various aspects of tetralogy of Fallot focusing on interventional aspects, giving insights of what would be the ideal platform of a fully interventional repair.

Anatomical Features of Tetralogy of Fallot

Fundamentally, tetralogy of Fallot is a monology as the hallmark lesion is a cephalad and anterior displacement of the infundibular septum resulting in both ventricular septal defect and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (Fig. 1). However, tetralogy of Fallot represents a wide spectrum of diseases. There might be varying degree of aortic override and condition will be labeled as double outlet right ventricle if there is more than 50% of the aortic valve override to the right ventricle. Obstruction to pulmonary flow in tetralogy of Fallot is usually sub-valvular but other lesions can be present. Pulmonary valve stenosis can rarely be the major cause of obstruction especially in infants. All types of lesions can be seen here from stenosis of a three leaflet valves to hypoplastic annulus with absent leaflets. In addition, stenosis of the pulmonary arteries can also be seen complicating management of those patients.

### Tetralogy of Fallot with absent pulmonary valve syndrome [^e371902e]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery: Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Annual (2004). Low credibility.

Tetralogy of Fallot with absent pulmonary valve syndrome is a rare variant of tetralogy of Fallot marked by severe pulmonary insufficiency in utero and significant, sometimes massive, dilation of the pulmonary arteries. This syndrome can be associated with airway abnormalities that can cause respiratory compromise. Patients who present with respiratory symptoms early in life continue to present a major clinical challenge associated with relatively high mortality rates, typically in the 20% to 30% range. A variety of surgical techniques have been developed to address absent pulmonary valve syndrome that may improve long-term outcomes.

### How and when should tetralogy of Fallot be palliated prior to complete repair? [^85d59c7d]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery: Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Annual (2021). Medium credibility.

The controversy regarding the best or ideal surgical management of Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) stems from the recognition of there being a spectrum of morphology and associated lesions, each of which require a different approach to achieve the three goals of minimizing mortality preserving right ventricular function long-term and minimizing reinterventions. A one-size-fits-all approach to ToF needs to be replaced by a considered and personalized approach in order to yield the best outcomes possible for individual patients. The great majority of patients with ToF undergo primary complete repair between age 3–9 months with excellent outcomes. However, the greatest challenge is the severely cyanotic neonates where primary repair is still associated with high mortality and reintervention rates. Risk factors are low weight and small/poorly developed pulmonary vasculature. High-risk neonates have better outcomes with palliation-but mortality is still high. Palliative interventions in the catherization lab are showing better outcomes than traditional BT shunt and the RVOT stent is emerging as potential game-changer. Primary neonatal repair is still recommended if weight > 3 kg and Nakata > 100 mm²/m². However, neonates with low weight, small pulmonary arteries or multiple comorbidities (including ToF/AVSD and anomalous LAD) may do better with a staged approach, There is good argument for RVOT stenting as a bridge to complete repair due to its stable circulation without diastolic run off and volume loading of the circulation, and its potential to allow branch PA growth.

### An extraordinary survival at the age of 67 years in an unoperated case tetralogy of Fallot presenting as systemic hypertension despite RV dysfunction [^3e6ab533]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Tetralogy of Fallot is a cyanotic congenital heart disease characterised by a tetrad of four anomalies including ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, over-riding of aorta and right ventricular hypertrophy with high incidence of infant and early childhood mortality with middle age survival less than 5%. Most cases require treatment in infancy and are symptomatic early on. Rare cases of survival to middle age have been reported especially after the fourth decade. We report an unoperated case of tetralogy of Fallot diagnosed at the age of 67 which is one of the longest time periods of diagnosis of a life-threatening congenital heart disease. Despite tetralogy and having right ventricular dysfunction manifested in the form of congestive symptoms, this patient presented with systemic hypertension along with cyanosis and clubbing which is considered to be a relatively rare presentation in this syndrome. The patient wished to be managed conservatively.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) infants — age at repair and outcomes — are described across multiple cohorts showing younger age associates with longer postoperative support and higher complications, while overall "an elective complete repair between 3 and 6 months is reasonable and generally safe". Evidence includes cohorts where 277 patients had "age younger than 3 months" linked to longer ventilation and length of stay; a 130-patient series with a "mean follow-up of 3.9 years" showed higher complications in those "younger than age 3 months (70% vs 43%)" without mortality or reintervention differences; and a database study of "1112 infants" found postoperative complications "was 40% lower in those aged 3 months or older compared with < 30 days". Longer-term analyses reported worse outcomes when primary repair was performed at "younger than 60 days", and mortality was assessed "at 12 years".

Preoperative imaging and anatomic evaluation in TOF emphasizes pulmonary valve and coronary assessment. Pulmonary valve assessment is explicitly directed: The pulmonary valve should be thoroughly visualized, and on transthoracic echocardiography the key features to be evaluated include cusp mobility, cusp dysplasia and thickening, and the pulmonary annular dimension expressed as a z score. The pulmonary arteries are typically underfilled, but attention should be paid to concerning features, such as left pulmonary artery narrowing, often secondary to the ductus insertion rather than at the pulmonary artery bifurcation. Coronary artery anatomy is also important to visualize preoperatively and can usually be determined via echocardiography, though challenging cases may benefit from computed tomography angiography (CTA), but this is not standard for typical TOF. CTA may also be useful in the setting of prior palliation, the cardiology and surgical team should review the coronary artery anatomy before any intervention where an incision across the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) is anticipated, and CTA or other imaging could prove helpful when there is ambiguity. Additional standard echocardiographic evaluation includes the location of the ventricular septal defect (VSD), any additional VSDs, and the status of the aortic septum.

### Clinical status and reintervention in neonates with symptomatic tetralogy of Fallot: a landmark analysis [^2523f6ee]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Neonates with tetralogy of Fallot and symptomatic cyanosis (sTOF) require early intervention to establish a stable circulation. Management strategies involve either primary repair (PR) or staged repair (SR), with initial palliation (IP) followed by complete repair (CR). Identifying the optimal approach has proven challenging, with early studies limited by methodological flaws and evolving care standards. Recent data fail to show a mortality difference between strategies but consistently favor PR in terms of early reintervention (RI) rates and cumulative risk exposure. Early advantages may, however, come at a long-term cost. To more fully understand the implications of initial treatment strategies, it is essential to assess outcomes beyond the early high-risk period. In this study, we leveraged a large, multicenter cohort of sTOF patients to evaluate long-term outcomes and RI rates among infants who survived beyond the first year of life, stratified by initial management strategy.

### Transcatheter-based interventions for tetralogy of Fallot across all age groups [^567ed3f4]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). Medium credibility.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common form of cyanotic congenital heart disease. Palliative procedures, either surgical or transcatheter, aim to improve oxygen saturation, affording definitive procedures at a later stage. Transcatheter interventions have been used before and after surgical palliative or definitive repair in children and adults. This review aims to provide an overview of the different catheter-based interventions for TOF across all age groups, with an emphasis on palliative interventions, such as patent arterial duct stenting, right ventricular outflow tract stenting, or balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty in infants and children and transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement in adults with repaired TOF, including the available options for a large, dilated native right ventricular outflow tract.

A study from the Pediatric Cardiac Care Consortium of "more than 3000 patients" found "weight < 2.5 kg at the time of surgery to be a risk factor for in-hospital mortality with an odds ratio of 12.5". A Congenital Cardiac Research Collaborative analysis of patients " < 2.5 kg" reported "more than 15% at 5 years" mortality for either approach.

### Surgical management of tetralogy of fallot: in defense of the infundibulum [^90c86db3]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Surgical treatment of the Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) is one of the great successes of medicine and also a topic of controversy. Different strategies have been proposed, including age-based (neonatal) management strategies as well as anatomic-based management strategies. Regardless of the management strategy entailed, the surgical management of ToF has considerably evolved over the years. As a result, patients can now expect excellent early results with survival approaching 100% for those without genetic syndromes. The goals of current surgical therapy should be to mitigate the late right ventricular (RV) dysfunction that may occur by minimizing the extent of surgical injury during the intial repair. As the surgical techniques continue to advance, the outcomes will continue to improve.

It is unclear if neonatal tetralogy of Fallot repair offers better outcomes compared to repair later in infancy. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis comparing outcomes of neonatal and non-neonatal repair. Manuscripts were identified and reviewed for quality and bias with favorably scored manuscripts being included in the final meta-analysis. Several perioperative and postoperative variables were compared. A total of 8 studies with 3858 patients were included in the analysis. Of these patients, 19% underwent neonatal repair. Neonatal repair was associated with increased mortality, longer intensive care unit stays, and longer total hospital length of stay.

### Long-term management of right ventricular outflow tract dysfunction in repaired tetralogy of Fallot: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^dd1b19a2]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Right ventricular outflow dysfunction, manifesting as stenosis, regurgitation, or both, is nearly universal in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot, precipitating a complex pathophysiological cascade that leads to increasing rates of morbidity and mortality with advancing age. As the number of adolescent and adult patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot continues to grow as a result of excellent survival during infancy, the need to improve late outcomes has become an urgent priority. This American Heart Association scientific statement provides an update on the current state of knowledge of the pathophysiology, methods of surveillance, risk stratification, and latest available therapies, including transcatheter and surgical pulmonary valve replacement strategies, as well as management of life-threatening arrhythmias. It reviews emerging evidence on the roles of comorbidities and patient-reported outcomes and their impact on quality of life. In addition, this scientific statement explores contemporary evidence for clinical choices such as transcatheter or surgical pulmonary valve replacement, discusses criteria and options for intervention for failing implanted bioprosthetic pulmonary valves, and considers a new approach to determining optimal timing and indications for pulmonary valve replacement.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) — benefits and tradeoffs of primary complete repair versus initial palliation: Options for early intervention include primary, complete surgical correction, as well as palliative procedures aimed at augmenting pulmonary blood flow. A primary, complete surgical correction may reduce the duration of cyanosis, limit repeat exposures to anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass, reduce overall morbidity and mortality by eliminating an interstage period, and improve pulmonary artery growth. Initial palliation may reduce exposure to anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass during the vulnerable neonatal period, decrease early morbidity and mortality, and may reduce the need for a transannular incision by facilitating somatic growth before complete surgical correction, but it may increase the technical complexity of the complete surgical correction and palliation in the form of RVOT stenting eliminates the potential for valve preservation.

Summary

What's already known about this topic? ◦ Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart defect, with approximately 70% of infants diagnosed before birth. ◦ A minority of infants with simple ToF will require intervention within 30 days of birth due to severe right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction. ◦ Previously identified features on fetal echocardiogram that predict neonatal intervention in simple ToF include reversal of ductus arteriosus (DA) flow, reduced pulmonary valve (PV) Z ‐score and reduced pulmonary‐to‐aortic valve ratio.
What does this study add? ◦ Fetal echocardiography measures can accurately identify those requiring cardiac catheter or surgical intervention before discharge from hospital after birth in prenatally diagnosed tetralogy of Fallot. ◦ A PV Z ‐score ≤ −3.5 or abnormal flow in the ductus arteriosus at 28–32 weeks gestation suggest inadequate pulmonary blood flow to allow discharge home. ◦ Identifying this small but significant cohort prenatally improves the accuracy of prenatal counselling and allows for better planning of delivery location and neonatal management.

### Balloon dilation of the pulmonary valve in premature infants with tetralogy of Fallot [^3618632d]. Pediatric Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Infants with tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) presenting with desaturation may require augmentation of the pulmonary blood flow, usually in the form of a Blalock-Taussig shunt. Shunts may result in a preferential increase in blood flow to one lung. They also may be associated with significant morbidity and possibly mortality of premature infants. Balloon dilation of the pulmonary valve is reported to improve saturation in early infancy. This report describes two premature infants (weighing, respectively, 1.8 and 1.6 kg) with ToF and desaturation for whom balloon dilation of the pulmonary valve showed good results. Neither infant required palliative surgery. At this writing, one infant has already undergone complete repair.

Introduction

Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart defect, with a reported birth rate of ≈0.3 per 1000 live births. 1, 2 It belongs to the spectrum of conotruncal diseases and is attributable to an anterocephalad deviation of the outlet septum. In the most severe form of the disease, the pulmonary valve is imperforate, leading to an anatomical variant termed ToF with pulmonary atresia (ToF‐PA). 3 Surgical management of ToF began in the 1940s with the Blalock‐Taussig shunt, and it was initially only palliative. 4 Thanks to the considerable advances in pediatric anesthesiology, extracorporeal circulation, and pediatric surgery, patients with ToF without PA usually undergo a complete repair within the first months of life, with excellent short‐ and long‐term outcomes. 5 Understanding of the pathophysiological process has also expanded in the past 20 years. Although there are still gaps in our knowledge of the developmental genetics of congenital heart diseases, several chromosome anomalies have been identified. For example, a microdeletion on chromosome 22 is associated with up to one‐quarter of all patients with ToF; trisomy (in 21, 18, or 13) is associated with up to one‐eighth of patients with ToF. 3, 6 On the basis of autopsy and radiological findings, several cardiovascular defects, including anomalous origin of the coronary arteries, atrial septal defects, right‐sided aortic arch, pulmonary stenosis, and aberrant subclavian artery, are also known to be associated with ToF 3, 7; some have a direct impact on surgical repair. 8, 9 Thus, ToF is one of the best‐understood congenital heart diseases.

### About tetralogy of Fallot… [^5d150787]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect. Congenital means present at birth.
- Tetralogy of Fallot occurs when a when a baby's heart does not form correctly during pregnancy.
- People with this condition should schedule routine checkups with a heart doctor to stay as healthy as possible.
- A hole in the wall between the two lower chambers, or ventricles, of the heart
- led a Ventricular Septal Defect.
- A narrowing of the pulmonary valve and main pulmonary artery. This condition also is called pulmonary stenosis.
- The aortic valve, which leads to the aorta, is enlarged and receives blood from both ventricles.
- In a normal heart, it only receives blood from the left ventricle. In this defect, the aortic valve sits directly on top of the VSD.
- The muscular wall of the lower right chamber of the heart is thicker than normal
- ventricular hypertrophy.

Because a baby with tetralogy of Fallot may need surgery or other procedures soon after birth. This condition is considered a critical congenital heart defect. After the baby is born Tetralogy of Fallot usually is diagnosed after a baby is born. It is often diagnosed after the infant has an episode of turning blue during crying or feeding. Findings on a physical exam may make a healthcare provider suspect a baby has tetralogy of Fallot. This may include bluish-looking skin or hearing a heart murmur. If these findings are present, the health care provider might request one or more tests to confirm the diagnosis. The most common test is an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of the heart. Tetralogy of Fallot can also be detected with newborn pulse oximetry screening. Newborn screening using pulse oximetry can identify some infants with tetralogy of Fallot before they show any symptoms.

Treatments Tetralogy of Fallot can be treated by surgery soon after the baby is born. During surgery, doctors widen or replace the pulmonary valve and enlarge the passage to the pulmonary artery. They also will place a patch over the VSD to close the hole between the two lower chambers of the heart. These actions will improve blood flow to the lungs and the rest of the body.

### Prenatal predictors of early intervention in simple tetralogy of Fallot: a retrospective multi-centre study [^2b06a6d8]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart defect that affects 3 of every 10,000 live‐born infants and accounts for 7%–10% of congenital heart diseases. Prenatal detection of ToF has increased in recent years, with approximately 70% of infants diagnosed before birth. Simple ToF is characterised by a ventricular septal defect (VSD) with anterior and cephalad deviation of the infundibulum, resulting in right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction, aortic override and right ventricular hypertrophy. There are varying degrees of RVOT obstruction, and of those with simple ToF, a minority will require intervention within 30 days of birth. Prenatal identification of this subgroup has the potential to assist decision‐making and ensure delivery occurs in a facility with ready access to cardiology and cardiac surgical expertise, thereby avoiding emergent postnatal transfer.

The morphological and haemodynamic features on fetal echocardiogram that predict the timing of intervention in previous studies of simple ToF include reversal of ductus arteriosus (DA) flow, reduced pulmonary valve (PV) Z‐score, and reduced pulmonary‐to‐aortic valve ratio. Despite numerous previous studies evaluating these indices, a lack of consensus remains regarding the lower limit of PV size predictive of intervention within 30 days of birth, complicating counselling, delivery planning and postnatal care. In addition, genetic and extracardiac anomalies, common in infants with ToF, are associated with greater morbidity and mortality. The impact of genetic and extracardiac anomalies on the timing of intervention is poorly understood.

With these factors in mind, it was hypothesised that infants with PV hypoplasia or abnormal DA flow would present with prostaglandin dependence and require intervention in the neonatal period. This international multi‐centre study aimed to identify prenatal cardiac and non‐cardiac predictors for early intervention in ToF.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) staged repair versus primary repair in symptomatic neonates showed no difference in mortality (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.66–2.24), a trend toward more reinterventions in the initial palliation group (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 0.96–2.98), and no difference in reintervention after the definitive repair (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.66–2.64); the cumulative LOS was longer with staged repair, 44 days (IQR, 27–75 days) versus primary repair, 23 days (IQR, 15–34 days) (P < .001), and delaying complete repair with initial palliation may permit more patients to undergo a valve-sparing procedure (staged repair, 7.6% vs primary repair, 0%; P = 0.06).

Tetralogy of Fallot — evidence and outcomes in low-birth-weight, high-risk symptomatic neonates indicates that the best available data for catheter-based palliations versus surgical palliations stems from studies involving newborn infants with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow in whom PDA stent utilization predominates, and few studies directly compare palliative procedures to primary, complete surgical correction specifically in symptomatic neonates with high-risk features. The limited available data explore outcomes in low-birth-weight neonates, but the high-risk category includes a variety of other features that may interact differently with treatment type; for example, a weight of 1.6 kg likely has a different effect on outcome based on treatment than intracranial hemorrhage or hypoplastic PAs. In a multi-institution cohort, primary, complete surgical correction (n = 44) was compared with palliative procedures (n = 76; transcatheter n = 23) in symptomatic neonates < 2.5 kg among nine institutions, with overall rates of mortality much higher in this subgroup (16.7% at a median follow-up of 5.5 years).

### Does valve-sparing repair improve outcomes in tetralogy of Fallot? A systematic review [^f6f64f11]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

More than half of the cases of tetralogy of Fallot are diagnosed antenatally via fetal echocardiography. It can also be diagnosed via a chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, or echocardiogram. Other diagnostic tools include chest radiographs, which may show a 'boot-shaped' heart due to right ventricular hypertrophy and a decreased main pulmonary artery segment. Without surgical intervention, survival rates drop significantly, with only about 3% reaching 40 years of age. Patient death from tetralogy of Fallot is due to hypoxia, cerebrovascular events, and brain abscesses. For patients who survive, adults face complications due to chronic issues, including the hemodynamic consequences of chronic pulmonary regurgitation, pulmonary stenosis, ventricular arrhythmia, and a lifetime of follow-up with cardiologists. There are also conflicting studies that show the effects of chronic cyanosis; studies that report impact cites impaired motor skills, decreased academic achievement, and worsened behavior. When TOF is diagnosed, TOF repair involves closure of the ventricular septal defect (VSD) and relief of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction. The method of RVOT relief varies based on patient-specific anatomy and may include transannular patch (TAP), valve-sparing repair, or other techniques such as infundibular muscle resection or pulmonary valvotomy. These surgical techniques are effective in relieving RVOT obstruction and improving oxygenation, thereby addressing the primary pathophysiology of TOF. With a transannular patch, there are also consequences of increased right ventricular dilatation, arrhythmia, reintervention, and pulmonary valve replacement. Essentially, a transannular patch creates a state of chronic pulmonary regurgitation. Advancements in surgical techniques, including trans-atrial and transpulmonary approaches, have enabled valve-sparing procedures in appropriately selected TOF patients, preserving the native pulmonary valve when feasible.

### Staged interventional and surgical management for complex low birthweight tetralogy of Fallot: another imperfect but legitimate strategy [^334a0e3d]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Management of spelling low weight infants with complex tetralogy of Fallot is often fraught. We present a 2.8-kg infant with DiGeorge syndrome and spelling tetralogy with non-confluent pulmonary arteries, the left pulmonary artery being supplied by an aberrant ductus arteriosus from the left common carotid artery. We performed stenting of the outflow tract and the ductus to allow this patient to achieve a successful elective surgical correction.

### Short-term outcomes following total correction of tetralogy of Fallot in adult patients [^441207ac]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although it is better to perform TFTC in childhood, age is not a contraindication for surgical management. Moreover, according to the high rate of late diagnosis of TOF in developing countries, TOF should be kept in mind as a potential differential diagnosis in children and adults who have suspicious symptoms and signs. In addition, knowing that accompanying anomalies can affect the course of the disease and the type of surgery, careful preoperative assessment is recommended.

Tetralogy of Fallot with anomalous coronary crossing the right ventricular outflow tract — When a transannular repair would otherwise be necessary, in the presence of an anomalous coronary artery crossing the right ventricular outflow tract, either a coronary artery sparing ventricular incision or a right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduit may be reasonable approaches based on institutional expertise.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) — risk factors for adverse outcomes include low weight treated as a continuum, prematurity, pulmonary artery (PA) anatomy, genetic syndromes, and baseline clinical status. Others propose < 2.0 kg as the new marker for lower weight; weight should be considered on a continuum. Prematurity has been shown to be a risk factor for mortality. The presence of small, or discontinuous, PAs increases technical complexity, leading to higher mortality and an increased need for reintervention. Genetic abnormalities are seen in about 15% of those with TOF, with 22q11.2 deletion and trisomy 21 most common, may be associated with haploinsufficient pulmonary arteries, and increase the risk of mortality; a multicenter consortium identified genetic abnormalities as a risk factor for both early and late postoperative mortality, and Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) data show extracardiac abnormalities have significantly worse outcomes. In many studies, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is a notable exception with outcomes similar to those without genetic syndromes; a PHIS study including 430 patients with trisomy 21 showed increased morbidity but not mortality. Clinical status before surgery or palliation is important, with intracranial hemorrhage or significant infection perhaps portending a worse prognosis, although these risk factors have not been specifically evaluated.

### Hot topics in tetralogy of Fallot [^189c9539]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart defect. We explore "hot topics" to highlight areas of emerging science for clinicians and scientists in moving toward a better understanding of the long-term management of patients with repaired TOF. From a genetic perspective, the etiology of TOF is multifactorial, with a familial recurrence risk of 3%. Cardiac magnetic resonance is the gold standard assessment tool based on its superior imaging of the right ventricular (RV) outflow tract, pulmonary arteries, aorta, and aortopulmonary collaterals, and on its ability to quantify biventricular size and function, pulmonary regurgitation (PR), and myocardial viability. Atrial re-entrant tachycardia will develop in more than 30% of patients, and high-grade ventricular arrhythmias will be seen in about 10% of patients. The overall incidence of sudden cardiac death is estimated at 0.2%/yr. Risk stratification, even with electrophysiologic testing and cardiac magnetic resonance, remains imperfect. Drug therapy has largely been abandoned, and defibrillator placement, despite its high risks for complications and inappropriate discharges, is often recommended for patients at higher risk. Definitive information about optimal surgical strategies for primary repair to preserve RV function, reduce arrhythmia, and optimize functional status is lacking. Post-operative lesions are often amenable to transcatheter intervention. In selected cases, PR may be treated with transcatheter valve insertion. Ongoing surveillance of RV function is a crucial component of clinical assessment. Except for resynchronization with biventricular pacing, no medical therapies have been shown to be effective after RV dysfunction occurs. In patients with significant PR with RV dilation, optimal timing of pulmonary valve replacement remains uncertain, although accepted criteria are emerging.

Clinical Perspective

Since the first repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) in 1954, early and long‐term results of treatment, surgical techniques and approach, timing of initial repair and reinterventions have been extensively studied in this most common cyanotic heart defect. Despite excellent survival after TOF repair, it is now clear that a high number of patients will require additional interventions. We present a retrospective long‐term follow‐up study of patients with TOF repaired in childhood. The study was performed at a single nationwide pediatric cardiac center and represents a complete surgically treated population with TOF from a defined territory.

AATS 2022 expert consensus — after complete repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), intraoperative anatomic and hemodynamic assessment to confirm adequacy of repair is highly recommended (Class I; LOE: C-EO). In the post-bypass period, evaluation may include pressure measurement of the right ventricle (RV) relative to left ventricle/aortic pressure plus transesophageal or epicardial echocardiography, and acceptable repairs are generally considered to have an RV pressure < 70% to 80% of the aortic pressure. Echocardiography should primarily assess adequacy of ventricular septal defect (VSD) closure and any residual right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction; the degree and location(s) should be delineated, dynamic subvalvar obstruction from muscle bundles can improve with adequate filling, minimizing inotropes, and a slower heart rate, and direct needle measurement can be used if the location or degree of obstruction is uncertain. Residual VSDs considered hemodynamically significant include those > 3 mm and/or with a Qp:Qs > 1.5, assessed by sampling blood simultaneously from the superior vena cava and the main pulmonary artery (PA) while on minimal oxygen supplementation (eg, < 40% inspired oxygen fraction). Small muscular VSDs commonly spontaneously close and may not require additional intervention, and attention should also be paid to the direction of the shunt across the atrial septum (commonly a patent foramen ovale is left to aid perioperative recovery) and the degree of tricuspid regurgitation.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) — postrepair clinical examination: The typical postrepair patient has a soft ejection systolic murmur from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT); a low-pitched, delayed diastolic murmur in the pulmonary area is consistent with pulmonary regurgitation, and such patients usually have an absent P2 component of the second sound. Additional findings may include a pansystolic murmur of a VSD patch leak and a diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation (AR). Some adults may present after only a palliative shunt, and such patients usually have cyanosis and clubbing with a continuous murmur if the shunt is patent.

Key points
- Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect. Congenital means present at birth.
- Tetralogy of Fallot occurs when a when a baby's heart does not form correctly during pregnancy.
- People with this condition should schedule routine checkups with a heart doctor to stay as healthy as possible.
- A hole in the wall between the two lower chambers, or ventricles, of the heart
- led a Ventricular Septal Defect.
- A narrowing of the pulmonary valve and main pulmonary artery. This condition also is called pulmonary stenosis.
- The aortic valve, which leads to the aorta, is enlarged and receives blood from both ventricles.
- In a normal heart, it only receives blood from the left ventricle. In this defect, the aortic valve sits directly on top of the VSD.
- The muscular wall of the lower right chamber of the heart is thicker than normal
- ventricular hypertrophy.

Because a baby with tetralogy of Fallot may need surgery or other procedures soon after birth. This condition is considered a critical congenital heart defect. After the baby is born Tetralogy of Fallot usually is diagnosed after a baby is born. It is often diagnosed after the infant has an episode of turning blue during crying or feeding. Findings on a physical exam may make a healthcare provider suspect a baby has tetralogy of Fallot. This may include bluish-looking skin or hearing a heart murmur. If these findings are present, the health care provider might request one or more tests to confirm the diagnosis. The most common test is an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of the heart. Tetralogy of Fallot can also be detected with newborn pulse oximetry screening. Newborn screening using pulse oximetry can identify some infants with tetralogy of Fallot before they show any symptoms.

Treatments Tetralogy of Fallot can be treated by surgery soon after the baby is born. During surgery, doctors widen or replace the pulmonary valve and enlarge the passage to the pulmonary artery. They also will place a patch over the VSD to close the hole between the two lower chambers of the heart. These actions will improve blood flow to the lungs and the rest of the body.

Conclusion

Surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot provides excellent results in the current era. With the recent advances in interventional cardiology in simple cardiac anomalies, the question of complete repair of more complex anomalies like tetralogy of Fallot has been raised. We reviewed current status of various aspects of tetralogy of Fallot focusing on interventional aspects, giving insights of what would be the ideal platform of a fully interventional repair. With the help of 3D modeling and the development of new materials such as bioresorbable devices, we are convinced that, in coming two decades, many advances will be made to interventionally approach more complex congenital heart disease like the tetralogy of Fallot.

Bailey and colleagues demonstrated no difference in mortality between neonates who underwent complete (n = 112) or staged (n = 26) repair. Using PHIS data, Ramakrishnan and colleagues found no difference in mortality at hospital discharge between infants who had primary, complete repair (n = 554) and those with a systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt (n = 267) with rates of primary repair 4% vs systemic-to-pulmonary shunt 4%; P = 1.0.

Tetralogy of Fallot in neonates — primary complete repair versus staged approaches: Primary, complete repair was associated with a greater hazard of death over 2 years compared with staged repair (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.05–2.06; n = 1032 vs n = 1331), whereas pooled multicenter data comparing primary, complete repair (n = 230) versus staged repair (n = 342) showed no difference in overall hazard of mortality over 5 years (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.49–1.38). Staged strategies had a greater hazard of reintervention (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.17–2.05). Valve-sparing repair occurred in 0% after right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) stent palliation versus 41% after primary, complete surgical correction before age 3 months. Across multiple institutions, length of stay was shorter after primary repair, 19 days (interquartile range [IQR], 14–30 days) versus 32 days (IQR, 22–49 days) for staged repair (P < .001), and multicenter analyses reported more total costs associated with staged repair after adjustment for confounding by indication.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) surgical terminology — repair types and anatomical terms are specified as: A complete surgical correction consists of closure of the VSD with adequate relief of RVOT obstruction with or without attempts at preserving valve competency; relief of RVOT obstruction may be adequate rather than complete because a decision to leave some RVOT gradient to preserve pulmonary valve function may be appropriate, and complete surgical correction may also include the intentional maintenance of a patent foramen ovale or other atrial level communication. A transannular incision is any incision across the pulmonary valve annulus, whereas an annulus-preserving repair is a complete surgical correction using RVOT repair techniques that do not disrupt the native pulmonary annulus, that is, when a transannular incision is not performed. Valve reconstruction refers to a complete surgical correction that includes, in addition to a transannular incision, techniques such as monocusp creation, leaflet augmentation, or right atrial appendage leaflet neovalve construction intended to prevent or reduce pulmonary insufficiency. For simplicity, the leaflet hinge point is referred to as the pulmonary valve "annulus", and neonate is defined as age younger than 1 month.

### Angiographic anatomy of major aortopulmonary collateral arteries and association with early surgical outcomes in tetralogy of Fallot [^77ddb5f0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The complexity of managing patients with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs) revolves around the anatomy and function of the pulmonary circulation. Each of the 18 bronchopulmonary segments can be supplied by MAPCAs, central pulmonary artery (PA), or both, with variable location and severity of stenoses. 1 While the spectrum of MAPCA and PA anatomy is generally recognized, there has been no large or comprehensive evaluation of pulmonary vascular anatomy in a clinical cohort with this condition. Because of the challenge of defining and evaluating this variability, the literature on this condition has typically included limited anatomic information related to the pulmonary circulation, such as the presence or absence of intrapericardial PAs, the number of MAPCAs, and/or the number of lung segments connected to the central PAs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Although we recently reported outcomes in a large cohort of patients with TOF/MAPCAs, 3 we have not analyzed patients according to more detailed anatomic features of the pulmonary circulation. However, we suspect that there are important anatomic aspects that can be elucidated via detailed characterization of the pulmonary circulation. The aims of this study were to detail the PA and MAPCA anatomy in a large group of infants, assess relationships between anatomic variables and early outcomes, and consider systems for classifying patients with MAPCAs in an effort to improve communication, facilitate understanding of risk factors and outcomes, and define subgroups to enhance collaboration and clinical and translational research.

### Tetralogy of Fallot… [^202824e8]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Tetralogy of Fallot Tetralogy of Fallot is a structural heart anomaly characterized clinically by cyanosis, and anatomically by an obstructed right ventricular outflow tract associated with a ventricular septal defect; compare left panel with normal anatomy on the right). Fig.
16. Tetralogy of Fallot
- Stenosis at or below the pulmonary valve, or pulmonary valve atresia.
- Ventricular septal defect.
- Aorta overriding ventricular septal defect. Clinically, the classic presentation is a newborn who becomes progressively cyanotic, either constantly or intermittently, and continues to decompensate. Providing oxygen does not help, as it is not a lung problem. Non-invasive newborn screening via pulse oxymetry, though not perfect, is a helpful screening tool to detect cases that could be missed at birth by clinical examination alone.

These babies require a quick diagnosis and treatment. Diagnosis While tetralogy of Fallot can be suspected prenatally, it can be easily missed or misdiagnosed; therefore, postnatal confirmation is imperative. Prenatal. Clinical and epidemiologic notes Tetralogy of Fallot is in fact a spectrum of diseases and might be clinically severe or mild, depending on the degree of obstruction in the right ventricular outflow tract. In milder cases, cyanosis might be mild or absent, and might escape detection at birth. Pulse oximetry, available in many nurseries, is a helpful initial tool to screen for low blood oxygenation, though not specifically for tetralogy of Fallot as there are many causes of low oxygen saturation in the newborn, including sepsis, lung disease and a variety of CHDs.
- A common genetic condition with tetralogy of Fallot is deletion 22q11, a condition in which a small part of chromosome 22 is missing. This deletion leads to some CHDs and many types of birth defects, both visible externally and internally.

4. 5d Tetralogy of Fallot Tetralogy of Fallot is a structural heart anomaly that comprises a. spectrum of disease, from severe to mild, with a common anatomic finding of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction – due to pulmonic and subpulmonic stenosis or atresia, or an absent pulmonary valve – associated with a malpositioned aorta that overrides a ventricular septal defect. The functional consequence is shunting/mixing of poorly oxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the aorta and thus to the systemic circulation. Depending on the degree of the shunting, which is a function of the severity of outflow tract obstruction, the child might become cyanotic, either constantly or intermittently. This form of CHD requires surgical treatment. Fig.
4. 17. Tetralogy of Fallot.
- Pulmonary valve atresia with ventricular septal defect is nearly always a form of tetralogy of Fallot, and for this reason it is grouped with classic tetralogy of Fallot.
- Pentalogy of Fallot – which comprises tetralogy of Fallot plus atrial septal defect – is an old term seldom used now. If tetralogy of Fallot occurs with an atrial septal defect, code separately the two defects; this approach also allows the atrial septal defect to be coded using a more specific code. Diagnosis Tetralogy of Fallot can be suspected prenatally on a second trimester obstetric anatomic scan, using a combination of four-chamber and outflow tract views, and confirmed with fetal echocardiography. Detection rates are improving but diagnosis can be challenging. Postnatal confirmation is necessary for a firm diagnosis, especially to distinguish between tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis versus with pulmonary atresia. Prenatal.

A case report of a newborn is presented where the closing arterial duct was balloon-dilated and stented to reestablish blood supply to the affected lung as a strategy of improving systemic saturations and promoting the growth of the hiliar branch pulmonary artery. Five months after the initial palliation, complete surgical repair with stent removal was successfully achieved.

### Outcome of tetralogy of Fallot through initial palliation and surgical repair [^6e52e020]. Pediatric Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease, frequently diagnosed prenatally. To enhance understanding, we reviewed 18 years of our institutional outcomes for patients with classic ToF. There were 410 patients of whom 233/410 (56.8%) were diagnosed prenatally. A genetic abnormality was diagnosed in 38/410 (9.3%), most commonly 22q11.2 microdeletion (43.6%). There were 10/410 (2.4%) deaths in the neonatal period prior to any cardiac intervention. Prior to complete ToF repair, 66/400 (16.5%) of patients required cardiac procedures, in 15 in the first week after birth. Babies with an antenatal diagnosis were more likely to require at least one procedure before complete ToF repair than those with a postnatal diagnosis (p = 0.039). There was a trend to shorter median length of stay in patients with RVOT stent (median 5.4 days) or duct stenting (median 4.2 days) versus BTT shunt (median 8 days). Complete ToF repair was undertaken in 396/410 at a median age of 6 months (IQR: 4.0–8.0 months), with a 30-day postoperative survival rate of 99.5%. The actuarial survival for the whole group (n = 410) of 410 patients was 98.5% at 30 days, 96.2% at 1 year, and 95.2% at 3 years of age. Following complete surgical repair, reintervention was required in 25% of cases: 3.3% at 30 days, 10.6% at 1 year, and 19.2% at 5 years. The freedom from reintervention was 89.4% after 1 year and 80.8% after 5 years. There were no deaths beyond 2.5 years post-repair. In conclusion, ToF can be repaired with a low procedural mortality rate and promising long-term survival outcomes, but there may be pre-procedural deaths and there is a likelihood of requiring reinterventions during follow-up.

### Does valve-sparing repair improve outcomes in tetralogy of Fallot? A systematic review [^fe5b63ea]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this systematic review, we meticulously analyzed the evidence to determine which of the repair VSR offers significant advantages over TAP in TOF repair, particularly in reducing PR, enhancing PV growth, and improving RV function. However, the choice of surgical technique should consider individual patient characteristics, including birth weight and anatomical suitability. The further nuance is that it is not merely about finding the surgical approach but also whether to decide to use TAP (surgical approach + TAP strategy) which may influence the long-term outcomes. Further long-term studies are warranted to confirm these findings and refine patient selection criteria for optimal surgical outcomes.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2014). Medium credibility.

Repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) surveillance — age-based imaging intervals and modality indications are specified as follows: Echocardiography is listed at 12 mo for age < 2 y and 2–9, and 24 mo for 10–19, 20–49, and ≥ 50. CMR is "Not recommended routinely; ordered to address specific questions not answered by echocardiography" with frequency notes "36 mo in stable patients" and "12 mo if moderate (≥ 150 mL/m²) or progressive (increase of > 25 mL/m²) RV dilatation or dysfunction (RV EF ≤ 48% or ≥ 6% decrease in EF)". CT is "Not recommended routinely; ordered when CMR is indicated but cannot be performed (e.g., metallic artifacts or contraindications to CMR)". Lung perfusion scan guidance states "If predicted RV systolic pressure 60% systemic or smallest branch PA diameter Z score < −2.5; in patients ≥ 10 y of age, consider CMR flow measurements". X-ray angiography is "Not recommended routinely; ordered when noninvasive methods either cannot be performed or have failed to provide satisfactory diagnostic data", with "Coronary angiography when clinically indicated". Chest radiography is "Not recommended routinely; may be ordered for evaluation of stent integrity", and the schedule applies "After the first postoperative outpatient evaluation".

### The predicament of surgical correction of tetralogy of Fallot [^4b4bf89a]. Pediatric Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Surgery for tetralogy of Fallot has a long history, which may be described as both a success story and a failure story. It is a success story because prognosis without surgery is very poor, but surgery makes it possible for affected babies to reach adulthood and lead productive lives. It is a failure story, however, since we still cannot cure this condition; we can only palliate it as illustrated in the sobering long-term outcome of affected patients. In this review article, we aim to explore the reason for this failure. This may be summed up in terms of the nature of the obstruction to the right ventricular outflow tract, which characterizes this malformation and must be relieved. This obstruction has several possible components, but none may be eliminated without harming the ventricle. There seems to be no 'extra' muscle band in tetralogy of Fallot that may be dispensed with without undermining ventricular function; every muscle band that is there should be there, just like in the normal heart, except that these are thicker than normal and somewhat displaced in tetralogy of Fallot, thus narrowing the right ventricular outflow tract. Consequently, ventricular function deteriorates with every muscle band that is cut, just like in the normal heart. We have to harm the heart in order to repair it. Every repaired Fallot is inevitably a damaged heart. Consequently, repair of this condition cannot be curative at present; it is palliative surgery.

### Tetralogy of fallot: yesterday and today [^02e61c36]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is a cyanotic congenital cardiac defect that was first described by Stenson in 1672 and later named for Fallot, who in 1888 described it as a single pathological process responsible for (1) pulmonary outflow tract obstruction, (2) ventricular septal defect (VSD), (3) overriding aortic root, and (4) right ventricular hypertrophy. The surgical history of TOF began with the development of the systemic to pulmonary artery shunt (BT shunt) by Blalock, Taussig, and Thomas in 1944. Ten years later complete repair of TOF was performed by Lillehei using cross-circulation and by Kirklin with a primitive cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. Notable contributions by several other surgeons including Bahnson, Ebert, Malm, Trusler, Barratt-Boyes, and Castaneda would lead us into the modern era of surgery. Today, complete repair of TOF is performed before six months of age with low mortality (< 2%). In select cases a modified version of the BT shunt is still performed as the initial procedure. Long-term survival rates are excellent (85%-90%). Adult survivors with TOF are an ever-increasing population and may require reintervention, surgically or catheter based. Promising future innovations include percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement, tissue-engineered autologous valves and conduits, and genetic manipulation. This article presents a review of TOF, including the history of surgical treatment, present-day approaches, and long-term outcomes.

### Predicting the future: tetralogy of Fallot will Be primarily treated with catheter based intervention within two decades. surgeon's perspective [^bf9858f6]. Pediatric Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Interventional cardiology has made extraordinary advances over recent years, but most are still limited to addressing single intracardiac or valvular lesions. This debate considers whether complete interventional repair of more complex congenital defects might become achievable. Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) is probably the first candidate where complete interventional repair might be achieved-given that various components of the defect have already been successfully addressed-albeit as either a palliative intervention (RVOT stenting) or to address the sequelae of standard surgery (percutaneous PVR). This article considers the challenges that would need to be overcome in terms of the morphology of the condition, the age limitations, and the necessary technological advancements that would be required-while setting these against the benchmark of current surgical outcomes and the parallel progress that is being developed in surgical correction. While complete interventional repair of ToF may still be beyond current techniques, a hybrid approach between surgeons and intentional cardiologists can strive to create a life-long paradigm of care that minimizes the need for surgery and focuses on the maintenance of a healthy right ventricle, such that patients born with ToF can achieve normal life expectancy.

Tetralogy of Fallot Tetralogy of Fallot is a structural heart anomaly characterized clinically by cyanosis, and anatomically by an obstructed right ventricular outflow tract associated with a ventricular septal defect; compare left panel with normal anatomy on the right). Fig.
16. Tetralogy of Fallot
- Stenosis at or below the pulmonary valve, or pulmonary valve atresia.
- Ventricular septal defect.
- Aorta overriding ventricular septal defect. Clinically, the classic presentation is a newborn who becomes progressively cyanotic, either constantly or intermittently, and continues to decompensate. Providing oxygen does not help, as it is not a lung problem. Non-invasive newborn screening via pulse oxymetry, though not perfect, is a helpful screening tool to detect cases that could be missed at birth by clinical examination alone.

These babies require a quick diagnosis and treatment. Diagnosis While tetralogy of Fallot can be suspected prenatally, it can be easily missed or misdiagnosed; therefore, postnatal confirmation is imperative. Prenatal. Clinical and epidemiologic notes Tetralogy of Fallot is in fact a spectrum of diseases and might be clinically severe or mild, depending on the degree of obstruction in the right ventricular outflow tract. In milder cases, cyanosis might be mild or absent, and might escape detection at birth. Pulse oximetry, available in many nurseries, is a helpful initial tool to screen for low blood oxygenation, though not specifically for tetralogy of Fallot as there are many causes of low oxygen saturation in the newborn, including sepsis, lung disease and a variety of CHDs.
- A common genetic condition with tetralogy of Fallot is deletion 22q11, a condition in which a small part of chromosome 22 is missing. This deletion leads to some CHDs and many types of birth defects, both visible externally and internally.

### Symptomatic neonatal tetralogy of Fallot: repair or shunt? [^23958933]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The management of neonates with symptomatic tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) requiring surgical intervention in the first month of life remains controversial. We reviewed our experience with neonates 30 days or greater with TOF from 2002 to 2008 requiring surgical intervention.

Methods

Thirty-seven consecutive symptomatic nonrandomized neonates with TOF or its variants (including TOF with complete atrioventricular septal defect or absent pulmonary valve but excluding pulmonary atresia) had either a shunt (n = 17) or primary repair (n = 20). The shunted patients more commonly required emergency operation (24% vs 0%; p = 0.036); otherwise, the two groups were similar.

Results

One infant with preoperative bowel ischemia died one day postoperatively after emergency shunting. There were two late deaths 11 and 12 months postoperatively, both in primary repair patients. The 16 surviving shunted patients had TOF repair 216 ± 99 days after the original shunt. The shunted patients had shorter intensive care unit and hospital stays for the first operation, which became equivalent when the second hospitalization (repair) values were added. The primary repair patients more frequently had a transannular patch and a tendency to more frequent delayed sternal closure. Four primary repair (20%) and two shunted (12.5%) patients required subsequent cardiac operations after complete repair (p = not significant).

Conclusions

Shunting or primary repair of neonates with symptomatic TOF provides equivalent mortality and results. Shunted patients had fewer transannular patch repairs despite having more emergent initial operations. Compared with the primary repair group, shunted patients had decreased intensive care unit and hospital stays for the first hospitalization, which were neutralized when the second operation (repair) values were added.

### Transcatheter approaches to palliation for tetralogy of Fallot [^452ac096]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery: Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Annual (2022). Medium credibility.

To this day, controversy still exists regarding the optimal method to treat symptomatic neonates and infants with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). Symptomatic (severely cyanotic or ductal dependent) infants with TOF can undergo either a staged repair approach (consisting of initial palliation followed by complete repair) or primary repair. Traditionally, initial palliative procedures have been surgical, for example placement of a Blalock-Taussig-Thomas (BTT) shunt. Recent advances in technology have facilitated the introduction of catheter-based procedures as palliative techniques, for example, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stenting and right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) stenting as more durable solutions than balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (BPV). In this article, we discuss the rationale for these procedures, technical aspects of these procedures and outcomes data compared to traditional surgical procedures. Recent data have suggested that RVOT and PDA stenting procedures offer many advantages over traditional surgical palliative procedures as palliative methods in this patient population. This comes at a cost of increased reintervention burden, which may be considered part of the overall treatment strategy in smaller neonates and can be minimized with a focus on technical aspects and overall treatment strategies. Advanced surgical techniques are required at the eventual complete repair to negotiate removal of stent material and pulmonary artery reconstruction in some instances. Further adoption of catheter based palliative procedures for infants with symptomatic TOF has the potential to tip the outcomes towards favoring a staged approach, particularly in high-risk infants.

### Clinical status and reintervention in neonates with symptomatic tetralogy of Fallot: a landmark analysis [^b94826d7]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Taken in the context of prior comparisons of these 2 treatment strategies, these findings suggest that while the vast majority of early morbidity and risk exposure favors PR, this pathway is not without its perils. Mortality is uncommon but is also an insufficient metric for evaluation of outcomes in contemporary management of this population. Subsequent RI is required for most, irrespective of management strategy. Residual hemodynamic burdens bear heavily, but largely without discrimination between treatment strategies (Central Illustration).

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: In symptomatic neonates with tetralogy of Fallot, both primary and staged repair strategies are associated with substantial long-term reintervention burden. While early anatomic correction with primary repair may offer a slight reduction in late reintervention, this advantage does not reach statistical significance. Individualized surgical planning — accounting for patient comorbidities and center expertise — remains critical, as long-term clinical and echocardiographic outcomes are similar between strategies.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: While clinical outcomes continue to improve, future studies should evaluate strategies to mitigate reintervention risk regardless of initial surgical approach, including novel valve-sparing techniques, improvement of existing transcatheter valve therapy together with a reduction in infections complications of valve implants and imaging-based surveillance protocols. Multi-institutional, prospective registries could clarify patient selection criteria and optimize timing for definitive repair to improve long-term durability of repair.

This retrospective comparison of primary vs staged repair of infants with sTOF finds that after the high-risk perioperative period, significant hemodynamic burdens remain, largely independent of initial management strategy. PR = primary repair; RI = reintervention; SR = staged repair; sTOF = symptomatic tetralogy of Fallot.

### Staged versus complete repair in the symptomatic neonate with tetralogy of Fallot [^0dad950c]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal management of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) in symptomatic neonates remains unknown. We compared outcomes for those undergoing palliation vs complete repair in the neonatal period.

Methods

In a retrospective cohort study of symptomatic neonates with TOF who had a neonatal complete repair (group 1, n = 112) or staged repair (group 2, n = 26) from 2000 to 2013, we compared outcomes at 4 time points: neonatal complete repair vs palliation (group 1 vs 2A), neonatal vs later complete repair (group 1 vs 2B), the single vs combined admissions to achieve a complete repair (group 1 vs group 2A + 2B), and cumulative events 2 years after complete repair for both groups.

Results

Demographics, anatomy, comorbidities, surgical approach, and mortality were similar between groups 1 and 2. Group 1 had a longer duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest and more postprocedure cardiac events compared with group 2A; a longer duration of intubation, intensive care, and postprocedure hospital stay compared with groups 2A and 2B; and a longer total hospital stay compared with group 2B. With combined admissions for group 2, there was no difference in the total duration of intensive care, total hospital stay, or reinterventions compared with group 1.

Conclusions

Both management options result in similar survival; however, early morbidity was greater with neonatal complete repair. The impact of increased neonatal exposures, such as cardiopulmonary bypass, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, and intensive care, on neurocognitive development requires further study but should be considered when choosing an optimal strategy.

### Impact of clinical follow-up and diagnostic testing on intervention for tetralogy of Fallot [^9c3842b4]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Limitations

This is a retrospective study. The only outcome studied was active management change, whereas clinically important decisions not to change management were not accounted for in this design. The patient population was heterogeneous, and included many potential confounders, ranging from a variety of insurance types and financial circumstances, to other non-cardiac medical conditions, chromosomal anomalies, diverse ages at intracardiac repair and at entry into the study, inconsistent history of prior palliative shunts and inconsistent history of subsequent surgical and catheter-mediated cardiac procedures. While this heterogeneity is an advantage in the sense that it reflects the clinical realities of surgically modified TOF, the influences of the many clinical factors on the frequency of clinical follow-up and the application of diagnostic modalities could not be effectively addressed. Attribution of the decision to the information gathered by one or more of the diagnostic tools was done with care, but when derived from record review, is recognised to be imperfect. Finally, there are no safeguards to assure that the clinical INTs in this series were always appropriate. While we believe that most times they were, and therefore the tests on which they are based were of positive value to the patient, we acknowledge that it is a leap to conclude that a diagnostic modality is good just because it leads to an INT.

We report a case of an infant presenting with the rare association of tetralogy of Fallot, hypoplasia of the pulmonary arteries, and stenotic bicuspid aortic valve. Surgical correction, performed at 16 months of age, included aortic valvular commissurotomy, opening the right ventricular outflow tract (transannular patch), and ventricular septal defect closure. The postoperative course was favorable, and the child was discharged from the hospital. Three months after the procedure, the patient is in excellent condition, without cardiac medication.

### Survival and freedom from reinterventions in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot: up to 42-year follow-up of 917 patients [^e081ba83]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Most patients with TOF currently undergo repair within the first year of life. Initial surgical repair is now a safe procedure approaching zero early mortality. Long‐term results, and specifically pulmonary valve competence and need for later replacement, are dictated by the surgical approach to the initial repair. This has shifted towards transatrial approach over time. Specific right ventricular outflow tract anatomy, however, still remains the main driving factor for surgical decision making.
