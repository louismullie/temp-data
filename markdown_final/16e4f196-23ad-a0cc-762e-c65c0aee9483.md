## Question

Vinegar treatment yeast infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether vinegar can be used to treat a vaginal yeast infection and how to interpret the evidence and safety considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity and standard-of-care treatments. Then, I should verify what, if any, direct evidence exists for vinegar in vulvovaginal candidiasis. Next, I will examine indirect or in vitro data and consider plausibility. After that, I need to assess safety and potential harms. Finally, I will align conclusions with guideline-based recommendations and outline practical, evidence-based options, including what to do if symptoms persist or recur.

> Let me first confirm the condition and the usual treatments. Vulvovaginal candidiasis is most often due to Candida albicans and is typically treated with topical azoles or a single 150 mg oral dose of fluconazole, with adjustments for severity, non-albicans species, or recurrence; uncomplicated cases generally respond well to these regimens, and guidelines emphasize confirming the diagnosis when possible and tailoring therapy accordingly [^a1096638] [^f151b882] [^9b546387].

> Wait, let me verify whether any clinical trials or guideline statements support vinegar for vaginal yeast infections. I need to check the provided sources carefully. I do not find randomized trials, cohort studies, or case series evaluating vinegar douches, soaks, or suppositories for vulvovaginal candidiasis, and no major guideline lists vinegar as a treatment option for VVC, which strongly suggests a lack of clinical evidence for efficacy in this context [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should consider indirect evidence. Acetic acid has in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activity and can disrupt biofilms, and dilute acetic acid solutions show antimicrobial effects in ear infection models and wound care contexts; however, these data do not establish safety or efficacy for intravaginal use in VVC, and extrapolation from skin or ear to vaginal mucosa is risky without clinical validation [^f66362ce] [^acd67716] [^1ae4a378].

> I should double-check safety considerations before suggesting any off-label use. Vinegar is acidic and can cause mucosal irritation; in a vaginal safety study of lime juice (also acidic), participants reported burning, dryness, and even new yeast infections, underscoring that acidic douching can disturb normal flora and worsen symptoms; additionally, douching in general is discouraged because it disrupts vaginal balance and may increase infection risk, so vinegar douching is not a benign home remedy [^5b0cd587] [^fc799393].

> Let me think about mechanism and plausibility. Candida albicans undergoes a yeast-to-hypha transition that is promoted by higher pH and temperature; theoretically, acidifying the vagina might reverse hyphae to yeast, but clinical studies of cooling and pH manipulation are preliminary and not validated for vinegar, and relying on unproven acid douching risks irritation without proven benefit, so I should be cautious not to over-interpret mechanistic hypotheses as clinical guidance [^9279483c].

> Next, I should review what to do if someone is considering vinegar because symptoms persist or recur. I need to ensure the diagnosis is correct with KOH microscopy or culture, assess for non-albicans species or complicated VVC, and use guideline-supported therapy; for non-albicans or azole-refractory cases, options include boric acid suppositories, nystatin, or flucytosine, and for recurrent VVC, induction followed by fluconazole maintenance is recommended; none of these pathways include vinegar as a therapy [^9b546387] [^84d6f45d] [^372ed96e].

> But wait, what if the patient is using vinegar already and reports improvement? I should confirm the diagnosis, screen for confounders like self-limited fluctuations, and counsel on stopping vinegar due to irritation risk and lack of evidence; if symptoms persist, I should treat per guidelines and consider evaluation for diabetes, immunosuppression, or other contributors, rather than attributing benefit to vinegar [^9b546387] [^519bfdd7].

> In summary, I should conclude clearly: there is no clinical evidence supporting vinegar to treat vaginal yeast infections, and potential harms from mucosal irritation and disruption of normal flora outweigh theoretical benefits; guideline-based antifungal therapy remains the standard, and vinegar should not be recommended for VVC management [^a1096638] [^f151b882] [^5b0cd587].

Vinegar is **not recommended** for treating yeast infections because there is **no clinical evidence** supporting its efficacy and it may cause significant irritation or disrupt normal vaginal flora [^629050c4] [^5b0cd587]. Standard antifungal treatments (topical azoles or oral fluconazole) are **safe and effective** and should be used instead [^a1096638] [^f151b882]. If you are considering vinegar, consult a healthcare provider first to avoid harm and ensure proper treatment [^6baca190].

## Evidence regarding vinegar for yeast infections

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting vinegar for yeast infections; available data are limited to in vitro studies and anecdotal reports, with no randomized controlled trials or observational studies in humans.

---

## Mechanisms of action

Vinegar's antifungal effect is attributed to acetic acid, which can lower pH and may inhibit Candida growth in vitro [^f66362ce]. However, this has **not been validated in clinical studies** of vaginal yeast infections.

---

## Safety concerns and potential risks

Vinegar use vaginally carries **significant risks**:

- **Irritation**: Vinegar can cause burning, itching, and irritation of the vaginal mucosa [^5b0cd587].

- **Disruption of normal flora**: Vinegar may disrupt the vaginal microbiome, potentially worsening infections or causing new ones [^5b0cd587].

- **Allergic reactions**: Some individuals may experience allergic reactions to vinegar.

---

## Comparison with standard antifungal treatments

Standard antifungal treatments (topical azoles or oral fluconazole) are **clinically proven**, safe, and effective, with high cure rates and well-established safety profiles [^a1096638] [^f151b882]. Vinegar lacks clinical evidence and may cause harm, making it an inferior choice.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines **do not recommend vinegar** for yeast infections. Instead, they endorse antifungal medications as first-line therapy [^a1096638] [^f151b882].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Vinegar is **not recommended** for yeast infections due to lack of evidence and potential harm. Use **clinically proven antifungal treatments** and consult a healthcare provider for persistent or recurrent symptoms [^a1096638] [^f151b882].

### Can vinegar be used in treating Pseudomonas ear infections in a patient with a perforated eardrum? [^487cc989]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic Pseudomonas ear infections are difficult to treat, particularly in immunodeficient patients. Vinegar therapy is a time-tested measure for the treatment of these infections. It is inexpensive, simple, easy to administer, and very effective. However, some physicians are reluctant to use it in immunocompromised patients or in the setting of a perforated tympanic membrane. We describe our successful use of vinegar therapy in a 32-year-old man with both of these conditions. His Pseudomonas ear infection had persisted for more than 5 years despite conventional drug treatment. Eventually, we treated him with instillations of topical vinegar, and his infection cleared in 3 weeks.

### A randomized double-blind trial of iseganan in prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia [^bfb0fbca]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Rationale

Iseganan, an antimicrobial peptide, is active against aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria as well as fungi and yeasts. The drug has shown little resistance in vitro and to be safe and well tolerated in 800 patients with cancer treated for up to 6 wk.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of iseganan for the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Methods

Mechanically ventilated patients in the United States and Europe were randomized to oral topical iseganan or placebo (1:1) and treated six times per day while intubated for up to 14 d. Patients were eligible if randomized within 24 h of intubation and estimated to survive and remain mechanically ventilated for 48 h or more. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was VAP measured among survivors at Day 14.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 709 patients were randomized and received at least one dose of study drug. The two groups were comparable at baseline except iseganan-treated patients were, on average, 3 yr older. The rate of VAP among survivors at Day 14 was 16% (45/282) in patients treated with iseganan and 20% (57/284) in those treated with placebo (p = 0.145). Mortality at Day 14 was 22.1% (80/362) in the iseganan group compared with 18.2% (63/347) in the placebo group (p = 0.206). No pattern of excess adverse events in the iseganan group compared with placebo was observed.

Conclusions

Iseganan is not effective in improving outcome in patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation.

### Lime juice as a candidate microbicide? An open-label safety trial of 10% and 20% lime juice used vaginally [^5b0cd587]. Journal of Women's Health (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Lime has a long history as a contraceptive and vaginal hygiene douche, and ongoing use in Africa is documented. We report on the first safety study on diluted lime juice to assess its potential as a candidate microbicide.

Methods

Twenty-five sexually abstinent women were randomly assigned to apply a 10% or 20% concentration of lime juice or 0% (water-only) through a soaked tampon once daily for 14 consecutive days. Tests for genital infections, measurement of inflammatory biomarkers, and a colposcopy were performed before and after treatment.

Results

No participant showed severe vaginal irritation. Two women developed a yeast infection after using lime juice. More than 70% of women in all groups reported side effects, most being singular, mild, and transient events. The users of 20% diluted lime juice experienced a significantly higher frequency of burning and dryness. Vaginal inflammatory biomarkers showed no significant change between preexposure and postexposure levels. The naturally low vaginal pH showed little change, and lactobacilli colonization did not decrease.

Conclusions

Lime juice up to 20% concentration has an acceptable safety profile for vaginal use. However, as new in vitro research shows that the effectiveness of lime juice to prevent HIV transmission in concentrations lower than >or=50% is unlikely and concentrations of 50% have been shown to be toxic, women should be discouraged from commencing or continuing the vaginal use of lime juice.

### Minimal inhibitory concentration of natural vinegar and of aluminium acetate-tartrate solution [^acd67716]. Otology & Neurotology (2013). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

Vinegar and aluminium acetate preparations are used for treatment of ear infections. It is instrumental to know the minimal inhibitory concentration to get effective remedies. This study was performed to assess the lowest dilution of vinegar (specified content, 6% acetic acid) and aluminium acetate-tartrate solution (specified content, 1.4% aluminium and 6% acetic acid) to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration against bacteria commonly found in chronic ear infections.

Background

Laboratory study on 2 samples of aluminium acetate-tartrate and on 1 sample of natural white wine vinegar on antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli.

Methods

Performing of a susceptibility testing-determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) with the method of microbouillon dilution (DIN 58940 part 7).

Results

Acetic acid was found to be effective in vitro in concentrations of 0.1% to 0.2% against the tested bacteria; aluminium acetate-tartrate solution was found to be effective in vitro in concentrations of 1.25% to 2.5% against the tested bacteria.

Conclusion

Vinegar respectively acetic acid diluted with water and aqueous aluminium acetate-tartrate solution could be effective ototopic preparations caused by one of the tested bacteria. For its effectiveness, an acid pH not higher than 4.5 is essential. Experiments with aluminium acetate-tartrate preparations on animals and clinical trials are required to obtain information about the response rates in ear infections and about any adverse effects.

How can I prevent yeast infections?

Certain factors may increase your chance of developing a yeast infection. These factors don’t actually cause the problem, but they may create a situation that allows the yeast to grow rapidly.

Clothing: Tight jeans, nylon underwear, pantyhose, and wet bathing suits can hold in heat and moisture (two conditions in which yeast organisms thrive). Looser pants or skirts, 100% cotton underwear, and stockings may help avoid this problem.

Diet: Cutting down on sweets, milk products, and artificial sweeteners reduce the risk of yeast infections.

Antibiotics: Antibiotics work by eliminating disease-causing organisms. While they are helpful in curing other problems, antibiotics may lead to an overgrowth of Candida in the vagina.

Pregnancy: Hormonal changes in the body during pregnancy encourage the growth of yeast. This is a very common time for an infection to occur. Until the baby is born, it may be hard to completely eliminate yeast infections. If you believe you are pregnant, tell your doctor.

Menstruation: Sometimes, monthly changes in hormone levels may lead to yeast infections.

Diabetes: In addition to heat and moisture, yeast thrives on sugar. Because diabetics often have sugar in their urine, their vaginas are rich in this substance. Careful control of diabetes may help prevent yeast infection.

### Candidiasis (vulvovaginal) [^7f0f7066]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vulvovaginal candidiasis is estimated to be the second most common cause of vaginitis after bacterial vaginosis. Candida albicans accounts for 85-90% of cases.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments, alternative or complementary treatments for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant symptomatic women? What are the effects of treating a male sexual partner to resolve symptoms and prevent recurrence in non-pregnant women with symptomatic acute vulvovaginal candidiasis? What are the effects of drug treatments, alternative or complementary treatments for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant symptomatic women? What are the effects of treating a male sexual partner in non-pregnant women with symptomatic recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis? What are the effects of treating asymptomatic non-pregnant women with a positive swab for candidiasis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to October 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 58 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: alternative or complementary treatments, douching, drug treatments, garlic, intravaginal preparations (boric acid, nystatin, imidazoles, tea tree oil), oral fluconazole, oral itraconazole, treating a male sexual partner, and yoghurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus (oral or vaginal).

Controlling these factors can help eliminate yeast infections and may prevent them from coming back.

Some other helpful tips:

For best results, be sure to use the medication as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better very quickly.
Avoid sexual intercourse, if your doctor advises you to do so. The suppository formulation (not the cream) may damage the diaphragm. Therefore, use of the diaphragm during therapy with the suppository is not recommended. Consult your physician.
If your partner has any penile itching, redness, or discomfort, he should consult his physician and mention that you are being treated for a yeast infection.
You can use the medication even if you are having your menstrual period. However, you should not use tampons because they may absorb the medication. Instead, use external sanitary pads or napkins until you have finished your medication or if the vaginal medication leaks.
Dry the genital area thoroughly after showering, bathing, or swimming. Change out of a wet bathing suit or damp exercise clothes as soon as possible. A dry environment is less likely to encourage the growth of yeast.
Wipe from front to rear (away from the vagina) after a bowel movement.
Don’t douche unless your doctor specifically tells you to do so. Douching may disturb the vaginal balance.
Don’t scratch if you can help it. Scratching can cause more irritation and spread the infection.
Discuss with your physician any medication you are already taking. Certain types of medication can make your vagina more susceptible to infection.
Eat nutritious meals to promote your general health.

Nail Changes.

When monitoring for paronychia or fissures, it is important to begin careful inspections of the hands and feet early during treatment and to continue these inspections at every clinic visit. If nail abnormalities are identified, the treatments described included antibacterial emollient applied regularly, corticosteroid ointments, or a white vinegar in water solution (1 part vinegar, 1 part water). Other suggested treatments for paronychia include the use of gentamycin ointment for 4 to 5 weeks, bathing the hands and/or feet in a diluted chloramine bath, and wearing loose-fitting shoes to avoid pressure to the nail beds. Preemptive daily treatment with corticosteroids was shown to reduce the incidence of paronychia in both the J-STEPP and STEPP studies.

Hair Abnormalities.

For the treatment of trichomegaly, the reported data suggest trimming eyelashes that are long or curled (usually by an ophthalmologist) and removing eyelashes that have misdirected growth (again, usually by an ophthalmologist). For other hair and scalp problems, emollients, such as those used for skin rash, and erythromycin ophthalmic ointments can be used. Patients who experience an acneiform eruption on the scalp can be treated with an oil bath and topical steroid therapy.If the eruption is infected, an oil bath, followed by treatment with oral antibiotics, has been recommended; topical antibiotics, such as neomycin and bacitracin, are not effective in the treatment of scalp infections. Hair stickiness can also be treated with an oil bath or using mild shampoos.

### Apple cider vinegar soaks [ 0.5% ] as a treatment for atopic dermatitis do not improve skin barrier integrity [^14a3b35d]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common chronic inflammatory skin condition associated with high transepidermal water loss, high skin pH, and Staphylococcus aureus skin colonization. The treatment of AD with bath additives remains highly debated. Recent evidence suggests that dilute apple cider vinegar (ACV) may improve skin barrier integrity in AD, but its safety and efficacy are not well studied. This pilot split-arm study analyzed the effect of dilute apple cider vinegar soaks on skin barrier integrity in patients with atopic dermatitis as measured by skin transepidermal water loss and skin pH.

Methods

A total of 22 subjects (11 AD and 11 healthy controls) were enrolled. Subjects soaked both of their forearms for 14 days, with one arm in dilute ACV (0.5% acetic acid) and the other in water 10 minutes daily. Transepidermal water loss and pH were measured pre- and post-treatment.

Results

In both groups, transepidermal water loss increased and pH decreased at 0 minutes post-ACV treatment, but these effects were not sustained at 60 minutes. In total, 72.7% (16/22) of subjects reported mild side effects from ACV with improvement after discontinuing the soaks.

Conclusions

Dilute ACV soaks have no significant effect on skin barrier integrity but caused skin irritation in a majority of subjects. Study limitations include analysis of a single brand, dilution, and application of ACV. Future studies are needed to explore whether lower concentrations of ACV soaks or other applications such as a leave-on acidic ointment could improve skin barrier integrity in a safe, nonirritating way.

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^7b1282b1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Design and Patients

Enrolled patients were ≥18 years of age with a diagnosis of symptomatic moderate-to-severe acute VVC determined by a vulvovaginal signs and symptoms (VSS) score of ≥7. Other eligibility criteria included a positive microscopic examination with 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) in a vaginal sample revealing yeast forms (hyphae/pseudohyphae) or budding yeasts and a vaginal pH of ≤4.5. Exclusion criteria included patients with any vaginal condition that would interfere with the diagnosis and evaluation of VVC (suspected or concurrent causes of vulvovaginitis and/or cervicitis including bacterial vaginosis, Trichomonas, active herpes virus or human papillomavirus infection, positive tests for Neisseria gonorrheae or Chlamydia trachomatis, or other mixed infections), the use of antifungal treatments (topical or systemic) within 28 days of baseline visit, vaginal contraceptives, use of CYP3A4/3A5 inducers and strong time-dependent CYP3A4/3A5 inhibitors 14 days before enrollment and during treatment, strong or moderate reversible CYP3A4/3A5 inhibitors including azoles or grapefruit juice 48 hours before enrollment and during treatment, select CYP2C8 substrates (ie, amiodarone, amodiaquine, paclitaxel, repaglinide, montelukast, pioglitazone, and rosiglitazone) within 48 hours before enrollment and during treatment, or select P-gp substrates (ie, digoxin, colchicine) 48 hours before enrollment and during treatment, patients menstruating at the baseline visit, patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, HIV infection, active cervical or vaginal cancer, and patients who were pregnant. This study was conducted in accordance with the general principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Each study site obtained institution review board approval for the protocol, informed consent form, recruitment flyers, and other written information before study initiation.

A WORD ABOUT YEAST INFECTIONS

Why do yeast infections occur?

Yeast infections are caused by an organism called Candida (KAN di duh). It may be present in small and harmless amounts in the mouth, digestive tract, and vagina. Sometimes the natural balance of the vagina becomes upset. This may lead to rapid growth of Candida, which results in a yeast infection. Symptoms of a yeast infection include itching, burning, redness, and an abnormal discharge.

Your doctor can make the diagnosis of a yeast infection by evaluating your symptoms and looking at a sample of the discharge under the microscope.

How can I prevent yeast infections?

Certain factors may increase your chance of developing a yeast infection. These factors don't actually cause the problem, but they may create a situation that allows the yeast to grow rapidly.

Clothing: Tight jeans, nylon underwear, pantyhose, and wet bathing suits can hold in heat and moisture (two conditions in which yeast organisms thrive). Looser pants or skirts, 100% cotton underwear, and stockings may help avoid this problem.
Diet: Cutting down on sweets, milk products, and artificial sweeteners may reduce the risk of yeast infections.
Antibiotics: Antibiotics work by eliminating disease-causing organisms. While they are helpful in curing other problems, antibiotics may lead to an overgrowth of Candida in the vagina.
Pregnancy: Hormonal changes in the body during pregnancy encourage the growth of yeast. This is a very common time for an infection to occur. Until the baby is born, it may be hard to completely eliminate yeast infections. If you believe you are pregnant, tell your doctor.
Menstruation: Sometimes monthly changes in hormone levels may lead to yeast infections.
Diabetes: In addition to heat and moisture, yeast thrives on sugar. Because diabetics often have sugar in their urine, their vaginas are rich in this substance. Careful control of diabetes may help prevent yeast infections.
Controlling these factors can help eliminate yeast infections and may prevent them from coming back.

### Yeast metabolic products, yeast antigens and yeasts as possible triggers for irritable bowel syndrome [^7dd1d804]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Many patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are disillusioned by the lack of efficacy of treatments and suffer from numerous symptoms not covered by the Rome criteria for IBS, as the current empirical treatment regimens fail to address these persistent debilitating 'IBS associated symptoms'. These symptoms are similar to other symptom complexes like chronic fatigue and the so-called 'candida syndrome', and many seek help from alternative medicine. The possible role of Candida and yeasts in non-immune compromised individuals is disputed and is the subject of this review. Even if the involvement of yeasts in the aetiology of IBS still remains unclear, there is increasing evidence for yeasts being able to cause IBS-symptoms in sensitized patients via Candida products, antigens and cross-antigens. But more research is needed before antifungal treatment can be recommended as a first line treatment for IBS.

### Warning (...) [^6baca190]. wonder.cdc.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Use of 10% KOH in wet preparations improves the visualization of yeast and mycelia by disrupting cellular material that may obscure the yeast or pseudohyphae. Identifying Candida in the absence of symptoms should not lead to treatment, because approximately 10%-20% of women normally harbor Candida spp and other yeasts in the vagina. VVC may be present concurrently with STDs. Treatment Topical formulations provide effective treatment for VVC. The topically applied azole drugs are more effective than nystatin. Treatment with azoles results in relief of symptoms and negative cultures among 80%-90% of patients after therapy is completed. Recommended Regimens
- The following intravaginal formulations are recommended for the treatment of VVC. * Although information is not conclusive, single-dose treatments should probably be reserved for cases of uncomplicated mild-to-moderate VVC. Multi-day regimens are the preferred treatment for severe or complicated VVC.

Preparations for intravaginal administration of both miconazole and clotrimazole are now available over-the-counter, and women with VVC can choose one of those preparations. The duration for treatment with either preparation is 7 days. Self-medication with OTC preparations should be advised only for women who have been diagnosed previously with VVC and who experience a recurrence of the same symptoms. Any woman whose symptoms persist after using an OTC preparation or who experiences a recurrence of symptoms within 2 months should seek medical care. These partners may benefit from treatment with topical antifungal agents to relieve symptoms. Special Considerations Allergy or Intolerance to the Recommended Therapy Topical agents are usually free of systemic side effects, although local burning or irritation may occur. Oral agents occasionally cause nausea, abdominal pain, and headaches.

Therapy with the oral azoles has been associated rarely with abnormal elevations of liver enzymes. Clinical trials addressing the management of RVVC have involved continuing therapy between episodes. Treatment The optimal treatment for RVVC has not been established. Ketoconazole 100 mg orally, once daily for up to 6 months reduces the frequency of episodes of RVVC. Current studies are evaluating weekly intravaginal administration of clotrimazole, as well as oral therapy with itraconazole and fluconazole, in the treatment of RVVC.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection caused by dermatophytes, non-dermatophyte molds, and yeasts. Treatment of this infection can be difficult, with relapse likely to occur within 2.5 years of cure. The objective of this article is to review factors that can impact cure and to suggest practical techniques that physicians can use to maximize cure rates. Co-morbidities, as well as disease severity and duration, are among the many patient factors that could influence the efficacy of antifungal therapies. Furthermore, organism, treatment, and environmental factors that may hinder cure include point mutations, biofilms, affinity for non-target enzymes, and exposure to fungal reservoirs. To address patient-related factors, physicians are encouraged to conduct confirmatory testing and treat co-morbidities such as tinea pedis early and completely. To combat organism-focused factors, it is recommended that disruption of biofilms is considered, and drugs with multiple routes of delivery and unique mechanisms of action are prescribed when traditional agents are not effective. Extending follow-up periods, using combination treatments, and considering pulse regimens may also be of benefit. Through these practical techniques, physicians can maximize cure and limit the risk of relapse and re-infection.

Candidiasis

Candidiasis commonly called "yeast infection" or "thrush" is a fungal infection (mycosis) which occurs when there is overgrowth of any of the Candida species, of which Candida albicans is the most common. Candida is normally found on skin or mucous membranes including the vagina. However, if the environment becomes imbalanced, such as when the normal acidity of the mucous membrane changes or when the hormonal balance changes, Candida can multiply. When that happens, symptomatic candidiasis can occur, ranging from oral thrush and vaginitis, to systemic and potentially life-threatening diseases. Candida infections of the latter category are usually confined to severely immunocompromised persons.

Vaginal candidiasis, usually (90%) due to Candida albicans, is often harmless and causes no symptoms. However it can also cause vaginal soreness, itching and discharge. Approximately 75% of all healthy women of fertile age suffer from at least one episode of vaginal candidiasis, with associated physical and psychological morbidity and approximately half will have a recurrence. Vaginal candidiasis (referred to as 'candidiasis' in this protocol) is not traditionally classified as a sexually transmitted infection, since it occurs in celibate women, and is considered part of the normal vaginal flora. This does not mean that sexual transmission does not occur, although the contribution of sexual transmission to the pathogenesis of infection is unknown. Importantly treatment of male partners has not been effective in reducing recurrence of vaginal candidiasis.

Up to 40% of pregnant women may have vaginal colonisation by Candida species, a two-fold increase from the prevalence rate in non-pregnant women [-,-]. This association is believed to be driven by increased levels of circulating oestrogens and deposition of glycogen and other substrates in the vagina during pregnancy.

Candidiasis and preterm birth

The role of Candida colonisation on the pathway to preterm birth has not been pursued with the vigour ascribed to bacterial vaginosis and other vaginal organisms, possibly because it is considered a normal vaginal commensal organism. However, several factors indicate an association between vaginal candidiasis and preterm birth:

• the rate of spontaneous preterm birth in women with untreated, asymptomatic candidiasis is higher than among women with normal flora - 7.6% versus 2.8% (P = 0.009) in a low-risk obstetric population,

• in a high-risk population, there was increased rate of preterm birth among women with non-albicans Candida compared with uncolonised women (15.4% versus 11.3%, P = 0.05)

Candidemia treatment comparative evidence: Despite randomized controlled trials of therapy for candidemia and other invasive candidiasis, no single trial has demonstrated clear superiority of one therapeutic agent over another; for instance, amphotericin B (AmB) plus fluconazole is at least as effective as higher-dose (800 mg daily) fluconazole given alone for patients with candidemia, but there is little role for this combination in current practice. While awaiting culture and susceptibility data, a working knowledge of the local epidemiology and rates of antifungal resistance is critical for informed therapeutic decisions.

### Global guideline for the diagnosis and management of rare yeast infections: an initiative of the ECMM in cooperation with ISHAM and ASM [^023a5eb0]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Uncommon, or rare, yeast infections are on the rise given increasing numbers of patients who are immunocompromised or seriously ill. The major pathogens include those of the genera Geotrichum, Saprochaete, Magnusiomyces, and Trichosporon (ie, basidiomycetes) and Kodamaea, Malassezia, Pseudozyma (ie, now Moesziomyces or Dirkmeia), Rhodotorula, Saccharomyces, and Sporobolomyces (ie, ascomycetes). A considered approach to the complex, multidisciplinary management of infections that are caused by these pathogens is essential to optimising patient outcomes; however, management guidelines are either region-specific or require updating. In alignment with the One World-One Guideline initiative to incorporate regional differences, experts from diverse geographical regions analysed publications describing the epidemiology and management of the previously mentioned rare yeasts. This guideline summarises the consensus recommendations with regards to the diagnostic and therapeutic options for patients with these rare yeast infections, with the intent of providing practical assistance in clinical decision making. Because there is less clinical experience of patients with rare yeast infections and studies on these patients were not randomised, nor were groups compared, most recommendations are not robust in their validation but represent insights by use of expert opinions and in-vitro susceptibility results. In this Review, we report the key features of the epidemiology, diagnosis, antifungal susceptibility, and treatment outcomes of patients with Geotrichum, Saprochaete, Magnusiomyces, and Trichosporon spp infections.

### Invasive Saccharomyces infection: a comprehensive review [^180d45e1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Saccharomyces cerevisiae (also known as "baker's yeast" or "brewer's yeast") is mostly considered to be an occasional digestive commensal. However, since the 1990s, there have been a growing number of reports about its implication as an etiologic agent of invasive infection. A particular feature of such infections is their association with a probiotic preparation of Saccharomyces boulardii (a subtype of S. cerevisiae) for treatment various diarrheal disorders.

Methods

We collected published case reports, through May 2005, of invasive Saccharomyces infection by use of a Medline query. Epidemiological and clinical charts and therapeutic strategies were analyzed.

Results

We found 92 cases of Saccharomyces invasive infection. Predisposing factors were similar to those of invasive candidiasis, with intravascular catheter and antibiotic therapy being the most frequent. Blood was the most frequent site of isolation (for 72 patients). S. boulardii accounted for 51.3% of fungemias and was exclusively isolated from blood. Compared with patients infected with S. cerevisiae, patients infected with S. boulardii were more frequently immunocompetent and had a better prognosis. Saccharomyces invasive infection was clinically indistinguishable from an invasive candidiasis. Overall, S. cerevisiae clinical isolates exhibited low susceptibility to amphotericin B and azole derivatives. However, global outcome was favorable in 62% of the cases. Treatment with intravenous amphotericin B and fluconazole, in combination with central vascular catheter removal, were effective therapeutic options.

Conclusion

Saccharomyces organisms should now be added to the growing list of emerging fungal pathogens. Special caution should be taken regarding the use of S. boulardii probiotic preparations.

### Topical therapy for fungal infections [^f2d2b449]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Fungi often infect the skin surface and subsequently invade the stratum corneum to avoid being shed from the skin surface by desquamation. Pharmacologic agents applied to the surface of the skin in the form of creams, lotions, or sprays, readily penetrate into the stratum corneum to kill the fungi (fungicidal agents), or at least render them unable to grow or divide (fungistatic agents). Thus, topical therapies work well to rid the skin of topical fungi and yeasts. Azole drugs such as miconazole, clotrimazole, and ketoconazole are fungistatic, limiting fungal growth but depending on epidermal turnover to shed the still-living fungus from the skin surface. Allylamines and benzylamines such as terbinafine, naftifine, and butenafine are fungicidal, actually killing the fungal organisms. Fungicidal drugs are often preferred over fungistatic drugs for treatment of dermatophytic fungal infections, since treatment times as short as one application daily for 1 week are associated with high cure rates. Furthermore, patients often stop treatments when the skin appears healed, usually after about a week of treatment. If this short-term treatment is stopped, fungi recur more often when fungistatic, rather than fungicidal, drugs have been used. Yeast infections such as those caused by Candida albicans respond less well to allylamine drugs. The azole drugs are often preferred for these types of infections. Nail infections are difficult to cure with topical therapies because the infections usually occur under the nail instead of on top of it and products penetrate poorly, if at all, through the nail plate. Infections of hair follicles, nails, and widespread infections often require systemic treatments. Antifungal agents are compounded into many different types of vehicles. Patients often prefer to treat weeping infections with spray formulations. Most physicians prescribe branded products in cream or lotion bases. Cost is a factor dictating prescription choice, especially since most products work well regardless of mechanism of action. Cost becomes especially important when infections involve large areas of the body surface. This article reviews various treatments of cutaneous fungal infections, with special emphasis on cure rates and rationales for choosing particular products.

### Pathogenesis of dermatophytosis and tinea versicolor [^27b98a83]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Dermatophytoses are infections caused by keratinophilic fungi known as dermatophytes. Several steps are required for infection to take place: contact, adherence, and invasion of keratin layers. The severity of the infection depends on the type of agent, environmental factors, and the host immunologic status. Tinea versicolor is caused by the Malassezia spp yeasts, which are microorganisms that belong to normal biota in seborrheic areas, but some contributing factors, such as the application of oily preparations, creams, an increase in ambient humidity, corticosteroid abuse, or genetic predisposition can induce its overgrowth in both filamentous and yeast structures. Exposure to sunlight stimulates the production of azelaic acid, which causes the appearance of hypopigmented spots. Currently, there is no scientific explanation for hyperpigmented lesions.

A WORD ABOUT YEAST INFECTIONS

Why do yeast infections occur?

Yeast infections are caused by an organism called Candida (KAN di duh). It may be present in small and harmless amounts in the mouth, digestive track, and vagina. Sometimes the natural balance of the vagina becomes upset. This may lead to rapid growth of Candida, which results in a yeast infection. Symptoms of yeast infection include itching, burning, redness, and an abnormal discharge. Your doctor can make the diagnosis of a yeast infection by evaluating your symptoms and looking at a sample of the discharge under the microscope.

### Griseofulvin — microsize) — griseofulviin — microsize [^3f9aae70]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Accurate diagnosis of the infecting organism is essential. Identification should be made either by direct microscopic examination of a mounting of infected tissue in a solution of potassium hydroxide or by culture on an appropriate medium.

Medication must be continued until the infecting organism is completely eradicated as indicated by appropriate clinical or laboratory examination. Representative treatment periods are tinea capitis, 4 to 6 weeks; tinea corporis, 2 to 4 weeks; tinea pedis, 4 to 8 weeks; tinea unguium--depending on rate of growth--fingernails, at least 4 months; toenails, at least 6 months.

General measures in regard to hygiene should be observed to control sources of infection or reinfection. Concomitant use of appropriate topical agents is usually required, particularly in treatment of tinea pedis since in some forms of athlete's foot, yeasts and bacteria may be involved. Griseofulvin will not eradicate the bacterial or monilial infection.

Adults: A daily dose of 500 mg will give a satisfactory response in most patients with tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea capitis.

For those fungus infections more difficult to eradicate such as tinea pedis and tinea unguium, a daily dose of 1 gram is recommended.

Children: Approximately 5 mg per pound of body weight per day is an effective dose for most children. On this basis the following dosage schedule for children is suggested:

### Whole genome analysis of 132 clinical Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains reveals extensive ploidy variation [^d5fbf04e]. G3 (2016). Low credibility.

Yeast species classified under the Saccharomyces sensu stricto species complex, in particular S. cerevisiae, have played vital cultural and economic roles in human history (seefor review). Indeed, yeast is probably one of the first species domesticated by man. Ancient evidence for the role of Saccharomyces in fermentation dates as far back as the Neolithic period, including wine jars dating to 7000 B.C. China, 5400–5000 B.C. Iran, and ∼3150 B.C. Egypt. Another Egyptian study revealed some of the oldest evidence for the active use of yeasts in bread and beer making around 1300–1500 B.C. Yeasts are widely used in industrial applications, with yeast fermentation being harnessed in the development of biofuel technologies that produce ethanol as a renewable source of energy (e.g.).

With extensive human contact over nearly 7000 yrs, it is not surprising that S. cerevisiae is often found as an asymptomatic human gut commensal (;;;;). However, it has become clear that not all human– S. cerevisiae interactions are harmless. Indeed, S. cerevisiae has been identified with increasing frequency as the causal invasive species in fungal infections, often but not necessarily associated with the use of S. cerevisiae var. boulardii (;;;;;,). While most fungal infections are caused by C. albicans and C. glabrata, S. cerevisiae has been estimated to be responsible for up to 3.6% of all known cases of fungemia, the most severe clinical manifestation of fungal infections (;;). It is also known to cause or be associated with a multitude of other symptoms that contribute to poor medical outcomes, including pneumonia, peritonitis, and liver abscesses (;;;;). In extreme cases, yeast appears to be the direct cause of mortality, usually by inducing sepsis (;). Because of such reports, S. cerevisiae is now considered a human pathogen, though one of relatively low virulence.

### Use of intravaginal cooling to provide symptom relief in women with vulvovaginal candidiasis and reduce immunopathology in an accompanying mouse model [^9279483c]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), predominantly caused by Candida albicans, is a common fungal infection, affecting approximately 75% of women at least once during their reproductive years. An additional 5%–8% experience recurrent VVC (RVVC), defined as ≥3 episodes per year. VVC is characterized by acute vaginal inflammation in response to fungal overgrowth within the vaginal cavity, with symptoms including itching, burning, swelling, erythema, excoriation, pain and discharge. While current topical or oral antifungal therapies provide short-term relief by suppressing fungal burden, they do not offer complete cure, leading to frequent relapses. Since RVVC can occur without known predisposing factors (such as hormonal changes, microbiome imbalances, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus), treatment often necessitates maintenance antifungal therapies. VVC and RVVC negatively affect the quality of life and increase healthcare burden for otherwise healthy women worldwide.

A key pathogenic factor of C. albicans is its ability to transition from yeast to hyphal morphology, which is considered a hallmark virulence factor for VVC. Clinical and animal studies have demonstrated that this yeast-to-hyphal transition activates an immunopathogenic response by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in the vaginal lumen. Despite accumulating evidence of their roles in VVC/RVVC immunopathogenesis, there are no therapies designed to specifically revert C. albicans hyphae to yeast or reduce PMN infiltration. Such strategies may offer a favorable outcome by reverting C. albicans to its harmless yeast form and restoring vaginal homeostasis without the use of antifungal drugs.

Triggers for C. albicans hyphal transition include elevated temperature (>37°C) and pH (>5.5). Hence, one strategy to revert C. albicans from the pathogenic hyphal form to the commensal yeast form is to cool its growth environment, thereby reducing triggers for the immunopathogenic response and alleviating vaginal symptoms. While the yeast form may once again switch to pathogenic hyphae and trigger more episodes, the cooling strategy could offer a fast-acting, nonpharmacologic alternative to drugs that can be slower acting, costly, and promote resistance.

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) treatment—most episodes caused by C. albicans respond to short-duration azoles, but to maintain control a longer initial course is recommended: 7–14 days of topical therapy or a 100-mg, 150-mg, or 200-mg oral dose of fluconazole every third day for a total of 3 doses (days 1, 4, and 7); the indicated maintenance regimen is oral fluconazole (a 100-mg, 150-mg, or 200-mg dose) weekly for 6 months, with intermittent topical treatments considered if not feasible; suppressive maintenance therapies are effective at controlling recurrent VVC but are rarely curative long-term, and susceptibility tests should be obtained for symptomatic patients who remain culture positive despite maintenance therapy with management in consultation with a specialist.

### Clinical guidelines: asking the right questions to guide fungal infection management [^32857873]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The section on prophylactic and empirical antifungal therapy targeting Candida species also requires critical refinement. Prophylaxis and empirical treatment are distinct strategies with unique indications and clinical objectives. The aim of prophylaxis is to prevent fungal infections in high-risk populations. At the same time, empirical treatment is initiated on the basis of clinical suspicion and severity of illness, such as organ failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure. Previous guidelines have highlighted that prophylaxis is generally unnecessary for critically ill patients, whereas the complexity of clinical presentations must guide empirical therapy. By conflating these two approaches into a single recommendation, the guideline risks causing confusion and reducing clinical applicability. A stratified approach that distinctly addresses prophylaxis and empirical therapy would enhance clarity, usability, and alignment with evidence-based practice.

Robust methodology is indispensable for developing clinical guidelines but must be complemented by practical clinical insight. Not all clinical questions can be addressed by existing evidence, and overly rigid recommendations may fail to reflect real-world complexities. Effective guidelines require domain experts’ contributions to ensure the recommendations are relevant and applicable. For instance, expertise in methodology only translates seamlessly into addressing complex questions in clinical practice recommendations. Ensuring multidisciplinary collaboration and clinical context is crucial to creating well-rounded, impactful guidelines.

The authors should be commended for their efforts in tackling such a critical topic in pulmonary and critical care medicine. Their work provides a foundation for improving the management of fungal infections in critically ill patients. However, refinements in key areas—such as combination therapy, amphotericin B formulations, voriconazole efficacy, and the distinction between prophylaxis and empirical therapy—would significantly enhance the guideline’s relevance and utility.

A balanced approach that integrates rigorous methodology with practical clinical insights will ensure the guideline’s recommendations are both evidence based and applicable in real-world practice. By addressing these limitations, the guideline can become an even more valuable resource for clinicians, ultimately improving patient outcomes in this challenging and high-stakes area of care.

### Miconazole nitrate, zinc oxide, white petrolatum (Vusion) [^aeb1bbdb]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Study 1 was a double-blind, multicenter study in which VUSION was compared to the zinc oxide and white petrolatum combination treatment and included 236 infants and toddlers with diaper dermatitis, complicated by candidiasis as documented by KOH tests that demonstrated pseudohyphae and/or budding yeasts. Study medication was applied at every diaper change for 7 days.

The primary endpoint was “Overall Cure” and required that subjects be both clinically cured (total resolution of all signs and symptoms of infection) and microbiologically cured (eradication of candidiasis). Primary efficacy was assessed 1 week following the end of treatment, at Day 14.

Study results are shown in the following table.

Two additional studies provided supportive evidence of the clinical efficacy of VUSION in infants and toddlers with diaper dermatitis, some of whom cultured positive for C. albicans . However, candidal infection was not documented in the culture-positive subjects, as microscopic testing (e.g. KOH) was not done. Therefore, the positive culture results may have reflected colonization rather than infection.

Inflammation of the vagina as a result of infectious agents is very common, both as an overgrowth of normal or common colonizers, or as a frank infection. The most common causes of infectious vaginitis are yeast, bacteria, protozoa, viruses, and parasites. Infections of the vagina produce an increase in vaginal secretion, vulvar symptoms of itching or irritation from contact with irritating vaginal fluid, and sometimes odor. A careful microscopic examination of vaginal secretions generally yields the correct diagnosis, but atypical or recalcitrant disease deserves a confirmatory culture, as noninfectious inflammatory processes can produce similar symptoms.

### Single-drug therapy or selective decontamination of the digestive tract as antifungal prophylaxis in critically ill patients: a systematic review [^a7932edd]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Proper management of yeast infections is challenging because the diagnosis is often elusive. At present, laboratory tests can be inconclusive (blood cultures have a sensitivity of only 70%) and it is difficult to distinguish between colonisers and pathogens. Yeast is part of the physiological microbiological flora, thus positive cultures may merely reflect colonisation or environmental contamination instead of actual infection. On the other hand, the gold standard for the diagnosis of candidemia, blood culture, is not perfect. False-negative blood cultures, especially, are a problem because sensitivity is approximately 70%.

Given the high and increasing incidence of Candida infection, its major clinical impact, and the lack of tests for an early and accurate diagnosis, a prophylactic approach for high-risk patients might be beneficial. Previous reviews on this topic have analysed specific yeast prophylaxis regimens with either a single-drug antifungal prophylaxis (SAP) or a multi-drug regimen of selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD). There are no direct randomised comparisons between SAP and SDD treatments. Our aim is to review and compare the effectiveness of both therapeutic strategies on yeast colonisation, invasive yeast infection, candidemia, and in-hospital mortality.

### Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp: etiology and treatment [^b0d74341]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common chronic infection of the lipid-rich areas of skin. While seborrheic dermatitis has been a recognized clinical entity for decades, its etiology is far from clear. Early investigators of the development of seborrheic dermatitis focused on the role of the Malassezia (previously Pityrosporum) yeasts. These yeasts are also normal skin commensals, thus their importance as pathogens in this disorder came to be doubted. However, it was subsequently found that treatment of seborrheic dermatitis with an antifungal agent not only resulted in clinical improvement but also reduced the number of Malassezia yeasts on the skin. This has resulted in a resurgence of interest in the Malassezia yeasts. It has been hypothesized that there is an immunological component to seborrheic dermatitis, possibly representing an abnormal host response to the Malassezia yeasts. This paper will discuss the role of Malassezia in the etiology of seborrheic dermatitis, as well as the various treatment options.

They are not intended to supplant physician judgment with respect to particular patients or special clinical situations. IDSA considers adherence to these guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the physician in the light of each patient's individual circumstances.

Isavuconazole—emerging evidence for primary therapy: Isavuconazole is a recently approved expanded-spectrum triazole antifungal with excellent in vitro activity against Candida species. Preliminary analysis of the recently completed large international double-blind trial comparing isavuconazole to an echinocandin for candidiasis suggests that isavuconazole is noninferior to echinocandins for the primary treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis.

### Chronic vulvovaginal candidiasis [^6bea7b1b]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Frequently ignored by the medical community, chronic vulvovaginal symptoms are relatively common and can frustrating for patients and physicians. Establishing a proper diagnosis will lay the foundation for an effective therapeutic therapeutic plan. Fungal cultures are an important component of the work-up. The most common causes of chronic vaginal symptoms are recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC), vulvar vestibulitis syndrome and irritant dermatitis. In patients with RVVC caused by Candida albicans, host factors may play an important role. Long-term oral antifungal therapy will break the pattern of recurrence in many patients. Infections caused by other species of yeast may be more resistant to standard treatment approaches.

Diagnostic Considerations

A diagnosis of Candida vaginitis is clinically indicated by the presence of external dysuria and vulvar pruritus, pain, swelling, and redness. Signs include vulvar edema, fissures, excoriations, and thick curdy vaginal discharge. Most healthy women with uncomplicated VVC have no identifiable precipitating factors. The diagnosis can be made in a woman who has signs and symptoms of vaginitis when either a wet preparation (saline, 10% KOH) of vaginal discharge demonstrates budding yeasts, hyphae, or pseudohyphae, or a culture or other test yields a positive result for a yeast species. Candida vaginitis is associated with normal vaginal pH (<4.5). Use of 10% KOH in wet preparations improves the visualization of yeast and mycelia by disrupting cellular material that might obscure the yeast or pseudohyphae. Examination of a wet mount with KOH preparation should be performed for all women with symptoms or signs of VVC, and women with a positive result should be treated. For those with negative wet mounts but existing signs or symptoms, vaginal cultures for Candida should be considered. If Candida cultures cannot be performed for these women, empiric treatment can be considered. Identifying Candida by culture in the absence of symptoms or signs is not an indication for treatment because approximately 10%–20% of women harbor Candida species and other yeasts in the vagina. The majority of PCR tests for yeast are not FDA cleared, and providers who use these tests should be familiar with the performance characteristics of the specific test used. Yeast culture, which can identify a broad group of pathogenic yeasts, remains the reference standard for diagnosis.

### Single-drug therapy or selective decontamination of the digestive tract as antifungal prophylaxis in critically ill patients: a systematic review [^198d2285]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Several factors have to be considered while interpreting the results of this review. First, most included studies had small sample sizes and the event rates of several outcomes were small. This means that individual studies had wide CIs, but even CIs around pooled ORs were still wide, and therefore the power for detecting clinically relevant differences for some outcomes was small. It means also that subgroup analyses have to be interpreted with care. Second, although the methodological quality of the studies was good on average, there is still room for improvement as only half of the studies applied blinding of treatment allocation and outcome assessment.

Third, studies used a wide variety of criteria for patient inclusion and exclusion. In addition, definitions of yeast colonisation and invasive yeast infection differed between studies as there is still no consensus on this subject. The value of the effect of prophylaxis on invasive yeast infection, especially, must be interpreted with scepticism because definitions vary between articles and it is debatable whether a mixed culture can be seen as evidence of an invasive infection. Unfortunately, not all articles published data on the culture results. The variation among definitions hampers the comparison of these outcomes between studies. In this review, we used widely accepted definitions and tried to redefine results if individual studies used other definitions. In particular, the definitions of prophylactic and pre-emptive treatment are often overlapping. Critically ill patients in the ICU are often already colonised or may be infected without being cultured, so prophylactic therapy can often be seen as pre-emptive. However, pre-emptive therapy will be given to a selected group of patients with a higher risk of yeast infections. There was one study that compared a pre-emptive strategy with a control group. In the analysis of our data, we made no distinction between prophylactic and pre-emptive treatment strategies. Despite these differences in populations and definitions, the results for most outcomes were relatively homogeneous across studies with accompanying values of the I 2 statistic that were low.

### Ultramicrosize griseofulvin (fulvicin P / G 165) [^58f27e14]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Accurate diagnosis of the infecting organism is essential. Identification should be made either by direct microscopic examination of a mounting of infected tissue in a solution of potassium hydroxide or by culture on an appropriate medium.

Medication must be continued until the infecting organism is completely eradicated as indicated by appropriate clinical or laboratory examination. Representative treatment periods are tinea capitis, 4 to 6 weeks; tinea corporis, 2 to 4 weeks; tinea pedis, 4 to 8 weeks; tinea unguium – depending on rate of growth – fingernails, at least 4 months; toenails, at least 6 months.

General measures in regard to hygiene should be observed to control sources of infection or reinfection. Concomitant use of appropriate topical agents is usually required, particularly in treatment of tinea pedis. In some forms of athlete’s foot, yeasts and bacteria may be involved as well as fungi. Griseofulvin will not eradicate the bacterial or monilial infection.

Adults: Daily administration of 330 mg (as a single dose or in divided amounts) will give a satisfactory response in most patients with tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea capitis. For those fungus infections more difficult to eradicate, such as tinea pedis and tinea unguium, a divided daily dosage of 660 mg is recommended.

Children: Approximately 3.3 mg per pound of body weight per day is an effective dose for most children. On this basis, the following dosage schedule is suggested: Children weighing 30 to 50 pounds- 82.5 mg to 165 mg daily. Children weighing over 50 pounds – 165 mg to 330 mg daily.

Children 2 years of age and younger – dosage has not been established.

Clinical experience with griseofulvin in children with tinea capitis indicates that a single daily dose is effective. Clinical relapse will occur if the medication is not continued until the infecting organism is eradicated.

### Malassezia infections: a medical conundrum [^e6682866]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Malassezia yeasts have long been considered commensal fungi, unable to elicit significant damage. However, they have been associated with a diversity of cutaneous diseases, namely pityriasis versicolor, Malassezia folliculitis, seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and confluent and reticulate papillomatosis. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the pathogenic mechanisms of these fungi, but none have been confirmed. More recently, such organisms have been increasingly isolated from bloodstream infections raising serious concern about these fungi. Given the difficulty to culture these yeasts to proceed with speciation and antimicrobial susceptibility tests, such procedures are most often not performed and the cutaneous infections are treated empirically. The recurring nature of superficial skin infections and the potential threat of systemic infections raise the need of faster and more sensitive techniques to achieve isolation, identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility profile. This article reviews and discusses the latest available data concerning Malassezia infections and recent developments about diagnostic methods, virulence mechanisms, and susceptibility testing.

### Dequalinium chloride for the treatment of vulvovaginal infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^88036f1b]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the efficacy of DQC in treating vaginal infections. Our review focused on acute vaginal infections because the literature on DQC as a maintenance therapy for chronic or recurrent infections is sparse. In this meta-analysis, we demonstrated noninferiority of DQC to the examined reference treatments for BV and VVC, although available data for VVC are limited. In addition, we found that DQC treatment was equivalent to the compared reference treatments for DIV/AV, although a meta-analysis could not be conducted in this subgroup owing to insufficient data.

The local antiseptic agent DQC shows antimicrobial and potentially antifungal effects to treat pathogens that cause vaginal infections.It is widely known as a locally applied treatment option with a generally well tolerance; only few mild adverse events have been described, such as itching, discharge, or light vaginal bleeding.– Several studies regarding its efficacy have been conducted; however, to the best of our knowledge, no recent systematic review and meta-analysis have yet been conducted to assess the efficacy of DQC treatment for vaginal infections.

We found several advantages of treatment with DQC, for example, it seems to have a positive effect on the course and development of concomitant VVC in treating patients who are experiencing BV, compared with that of antibiotic treatment. Incorrect self-diagnosis and self-treatment of vaginal infections, particularly with over-the-counter antifungal medication, is currently a widespread issue.Diagnostic workup for vaginal infections is crucial; however, it might be complicated owing to the need for trained staff and specialized equipment. Furthermore, because standard diagnostics usually require transport to a laboratory and Gram staining, the diagnosis and treatment might be significantly delayed. Dequalinium chloride has the advantage of having a broader antimicrobial spectrum than standard treatments, regardless of the fact that treatment should always follow proper diagnostic workup.Of note, self-treatment is not widely recommended, and treatment should always follow evaluation by medical personnel.

### : an emerging yeast pathogen posing distinct challenges for laboratory diagnostics, treatment, and infection prevention [^213e5252]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Context.—

Candida auris is an emerging yeast species that was first described in 2009. This ascomycetous yeast is notable for resistance to azole antifungal agents, for environmental persistence, and for its ability to contaminate health care environments, resulting in patient colonization and nosocomial infections.

Objective.—

To review the state of current knowledge addressing challenges in the accurate identification of C auris in the diagnostic microbiology laboratory, including application of phenotypic, proteomic, and genomic methodologies; characteristics that may predispose the human host to acquiring C auris ; transmission; clinical presentations; treatment modalities; environmental decontamination; and infection prevention in health care settings.

Data Sources.—

The PubMed search engine was used to access peer-reviewed literature published from 2009 to 2019.

Conclusions.—

The rapid emergence of C auris has presented unique challenges for the areas of laboratory diagnostics and infection prevention and in options for antifungal treatment, which are limited. The current lack of established antifungal susceptibility test breakpoints complicates therapeutic decision making. Enhanced awareness of this pathogen is essential to monitor outbreaks and to reduce the risk of spread within health care environments.

### Global guideline for the diagnosis and management of candidiasis: an initiative of the ECMM in cooperation with ISHAM and ASM [^d2fcbd30]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Candida species are the predominant cause of fungal infections in patients treated in hospital, contributing substantially to morbidity and mortality. Candidaemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis primarily affect patients who are immunocompromised or critically ill. In contrast, mucocutaneous forms of candidiasis, such as oral thrush and vulvovaginal candidiasis, can occur in otherwise healthy individuals. Although mucocutaneous candidiasis is generally not life-threatening, it can cause considerable discomfort, recurrent infections, and complications, particularly in patients with underlying conditions such as diabetes or in those taking immunosuppressive therapies. The rise of difficult-to-treat Candida infections is driven by new host factors and antifungal resistance. Pathogens, such as Candida auris (Candidozyma auris) and fluconazole-resistant Candida parapsilosis, pose serious global health risks. Recent taxonomic revisions have reclassified several Candida spp, potentially causing confusion in clinical practice. Current management guidelines are limited in scope, with poor coverage of emerging pathogens and new treatment options. In this Review, we provide updated recommendations for managing Candida infections, with detailed evidence summaries available in the appendix.

### Antifungals: what's in the pipeline [^364e5be0]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

The therapeutic landscape for mycotic infections is shifting. New generation azoles that are active against clinically relevant, drug-resistant fungal pathogens have improved bioavailability, half-lives and safety profiles. Acylated cyclic peptide inhibitors of beta(1,3)glucan synthesis with origins as fungal metabolites provide an alternative and highly-selective mode of action, targeting cell-wall biogenesis in important pathogens such as Candida and Aspergillus species. The development, in each structural class, of compounds that have advanced to late-stage clinical trials is summarized in this review.

### Miconazole nitrate, zinc oxide, white petrolatum (Vusion) [^706001fa]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

VUSION Ointment is indicated for adjunctive treatment of diaper dermatitis when complicated by documented candidiasis (microscopic evidence of pseudohyphae and /or budding yeast) in immunocompetent pediatric patients 4 weeks and older. (1.1)
VUSION Ointment should not be used as a substitute for frequent diaper changes. (1.1)
VUSION Ointment should not be used to prevent the occurrence of diaper dermatitis, since preventative use may result in the development of drug resistance. (1.2)

1.1 	Indication

VUSION Ointment is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of diaper dermatitis only when complicated by documented candidiasis (microscopic evidence of pseudohyphae and/or budding yeast), in immunocompetent pediatric patients 4 weeks and older. A positive fungal culture for Candida albicans is not adequate evidence of candidal infection since colonization with C. albicans can result in a positive culture. The presence of candidal infection should be established by microscopic evaluation prior to initiating treatment.

VUSION should be used as part of a treatment regimen that includes measures directed at the underlying diaper dermatitis, including gentle cleansing of the diaper area and frequent diaper changes. VUSION should not be used as a substitute for frequent diaper changes.

1.2 	Limitations of Use

The safety and efficacy of VUSION have not been demonstrated in immunocompromised patients, or in infants less than 4 weeks of age (premature or term).

The safety and efficacy of VUSION have not been evaluated in incontinent adult patients. VUSION should not be used to prevent the occurrence of diaper dermatitis, such as in an adult institutional setting, since preventative use may result in the development of drug resistance.

### Mycological considerations in the topical treatment of superficial fungal infections [^7f7599e3]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Trichophyton rubrum remains the most common pathogenic dermatophyte in the United States, Europe, and industrialized Asia, although other species are predminant elsewhere. Candida albicans is the most common pathogenic yeast, with other species occasionally encountered. Just a few of the 14 described species of Malassezia cause pityriasis versicolor worldwide. FDA approval does not always accurately reflect the potential utility of any given topical antifungal agent. Azole, hydroxypyridone, and allylamine agents are beneficial in the management of dermatophytosis; however, the allylamines may lead to faster symptom resolution and a higher degree of sustained response. Although in actual clinical use the allylamines have all shown some activity against superficial cutaneous candidiasis and pityriasis versicolor, the azole agents remain drugs of choice. Ciclopirox is an excellent broad-spectrum antifungal agent. Optimal topical therapy for superficial fungal infections cannot yet be reliably based upon in-vitro laboratory determination of sensitivity. Inherent antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties possessed by some antifungal agents may be exploited for clinical purposes. Candida species may be azole-insensitive due to efflux pumps or an altered target enzyme. So-called "antifungal resistance" of dermatophyets is actually due to poor patient adherence (either in dosing or treatment duration), or to reinfection.

### What is the result of vaginal cleansing with chlorhexidine during labour on maternal and neonatal infections? A systematic review of randomised trials with meta-analysis [^334a5a88]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Chlorhexidine is a bisguanide antiseptic, which works by disrupting the bacterial cell wall. It is effective against most gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria, yeasts and many viruses, although variably effective against enveloped viruses. It is ineffective against bacterial spores and mycobacteria. Christensen et al. found that GBS was extremely sensitive to chlorhexidine, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.5-1 mg/l.Chlorhexidine has been shown to have activity against normal vaginal bacteria, which cause puerperal infection, including GBS, E.coli and enterococci. Upon application it is immediately effective, suppressing bacterial growth for up to 24 h. Although not deactivated by alcohol, soaps or lavage fluid, the presence of organic matter such as blood or amniotic fluid may reduce the effectiveness of chlorhexidine.

### Treatment for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^9284aba4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) affects up to 5% of women. No comprehensive systematic review of treatments for RVVC has been published.

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for RVVC. The secondary objective was to assess patient preference of treatment options.

Search Methods

We conducted electronic searches of bibliographic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (search date 6 October 2021). We also handsearched reference lists of identified trials and contacted authors of identified trials, experts in RVVC, and manufacturers of products for vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Selection Criteria

We considered all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials evaluating RVVC treatments for at least six months, in women with four or more symptomatic episodes of vulvovaginal candidiasis in the past year. We excluded women with immunosuppressive disorders or taking immunosuppressant medication. We included women with diabetes mellitus and pregnant women. Diagnosis of RVVC must have been confirmed by presence of symptoms and a positive culture and/or microscopy. We included all drug and non-drug therapies and partner treatment, assessing the following primary outcomes: • number of clinical recurrences per participant per year (recurrence defined as clinical signs and positive culture/microscopy); • proportion of participants with at least one clinical recurrence during the treatment and follow-up period; and • adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts to identify eligible trials. Duplicate data extraction was completed independently by two authors. We assessed risk of bias as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We used the fixed-effects model for pooling and expressed the results as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where important statistical heterogeneity was present we either did not pool data (I 2 > 70%) or used a random-effects model (I 2 40-70%). We used the GRADE tool to assess overall certainty of the evidence for the pooled primary outcomes.

Main Results

Studies: Twenty-three studies involving 2212 women aged 17 to 67 years met the inclusion criteria. Most studies excluded pregnant women and women with diabetes or immunosuppression. The predominant species found on culture at study entry was Candida albicans. Overall, the included studies were small (<100 participants). Six studies compared antifungal treatment with placebo (607 participants); four studies compared oral versus topical antifungals (543 participants); one study compared different oral antifungals (45 participants); two studies compared different dosing regimens for antifungals (100 participants); one study compared two different dosing regimens of the same topical agent (23 participants); one study compared short versus longer treatment duration (26 participants); two studies assessed the effect of partner treatment (98 participants); one study compared a complementary treatment (Lactobacillus vaginal tablets and probiotic oral tablets) with placebo (34 participants); three studies compared complementary medicine with antifungals (354 participants); two studies compared 'dermasilk' briefs with cotton briefs (130 participants); one study examined Lactobacillus vaccination versus heliotherapy versus ciclopyroxolamine (90 participants); one study compared CAM treatments to an antifungal treatment combined with CAM treatments (68 participants). We did not find any studies comparing different topical antifungals. Nine studies reported industry funding, three were funded by an independent source and eleven did not report their funding source. Risk of bias: Overall, the risk of bias was high or unclear due to insufficient blinding of allocation and participants and poor reporting. Primary outcomes: Meta-analyses comparing drug treatments (oral and topical) with placebo or no treatment showed there may be a clinically relevant reduction in clinical recurrence at 6 months (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.63; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 2; participants = 607; studies = 6; I² = 82%; low-certainty evidence) and 12 months (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.89; NNTB = 6; participants = 585; studies = 6; I² = 21%; low-certainty evidence). No study reported on the number of clinical recurrences per participant per year. We are very uncertain whether oral drug treatment compared to topical treatment increases the risk of clinical recurrence at 6 months (RR 1.66, 95% CI 0.83 to 3.31; participants = 206; studies = 3; I² = 0%; very low-certainty evidence) and reduces the risk of clinical recurrence at 12 months (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.27; participants = 206; studies = 3; I² = 10%; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported on the number of clinical recurrences per participant per year. Adverse events were scarce across both treatment and control groups in both comparisons. The reporting of adverse events varied amongst studies, was generally of very low quality and could not be pooled. Overall the adverse event rate was low for both placebo and treatment arms and ranged from less than 5% to no side effects or complications.

Authors' Conclusions

In women with RVVC, treatment with oral or topical antifungals may reduce symptomatic clinical recurrences when compared to placebo or no treatment. We were unable to find clear differences between different treatment options (e.g. oral versus topical treatment, different doses and durations). These findings are not applicable to pregnant or immunocompromised women and women with diabetes as the studies did not include or report on them. More research is needed to determine the optimal medication, dose and frequency.

### Fluconazole [^e8613b63]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Fluconazole tablets are indicated for the treatment of:

Vaginal candidiasis (vaginal yeast infections due to Candida).
Oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis. In open noncomparative studies of relatively small numbers of patients, fluconazole tablets were also effective for the treatment of Candida urinary tract infections, peritonitis, and systemic Candida infections including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia.
Cryptococcal meningitis. Before prescribing fluconazole tablets for AIDS patients with cryptococcal meningitis, please see CLINICAL STUDIES section. Studies comparing fluconazole tablets to amphotericin B in non-HIV infected patients have not been conducted.

Prophylaxis: Fluconazole tablets are also indicated to decrease the incidence of candidiasis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

Specimens for fungal culture and other relevant laboratory studies (serology, histopathology) should be obtained prior to therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, anti-infective therapy should be adjusted accordingly.

### Antifungal tolerance is a subpopulation effect distinct from resistance and is associated with persistent candidemia [^928e7f88]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Tolerance to antifungal drug concentrations above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) is rarely quantified, and current clinical recommendations suggest it should be ignored. Here, we quantify antifungal tolerance in Candida albicans isolates as the fraction of growth above the MIC, and find that it is distinct from susceptibility/resistance. Instead, tolerance is due to the slow growth of subpopulations of cells that overcome drug stress more efficiently than the rest of the population, and correlates inversely with intracellular drug accumulation. Many adjuvant drugs used in combination with fluconazole, a widely used fungistatic drug, reduce tolerance without affecting resistance. Accordingly, in an invertebrate infection model, adjuvant combination therapy is more effective than fluconazole in treating infections with highly tolerant isolates and does not affect infections with low tolerance isolates. Furthermore, isolates recovered from immunocompetent patients with persistent candidemia display higher tolerance than isolates readily cleared by fluconazole. Thus, tolerance correlates with, and may help predict, patient responses to fluconazole therapy.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^9b546387]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC)—diagnosis and testing: the diagnosis can be made when a wet preparation (saline, 10% KOH) demonstrates budding yeasts, hyphae, or pseudohyphae, or when a culture or other test yields a positive result for a yeast species, and Candida vaginitis is associated with normal vaginal pH (<4.5); examination of a wet mount with KOH preparation should be performed for all women with symptoms or signs of VVC, and women with a positive result should be treated. For those with negative wet mounts but existing signs or symptoms, vaginal cultures for Candida should be considered; if Candida cultures cannot be performed, empiric treatment can be considered. Identifying Candida by culture in the absence of symptoms or signs is not an indication for treatment because approximately 10%–20% of women harbor Candida species and other yeasts in the vagina; the majority of PCR tests for yeast are not FDA cleared, and yeast culture remains the reference standard for diagnosis.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^bc47b84e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Population

Healthy, nonpregnant female participants aged ≥18 years and <65 years with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic acute VVC were enrolled in the study. Participants had a positive baseline potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mount from a vaginal smear revealing filamentous hyphae/pseudohyphae or budding yeast cells, presence of ≥1 vulvovaginal sign, presence of ≥1 vulvovaginal symptom, and a composite severity score of ≥6. Vaginal swabs were obtained at the screening visit and at subsequent study visits. Candida species were characterized and stored frozen for susceptibility testing at study completion. Inclusion criteria required participants to present with a clinical diagnosis of acute VVC and did not differentiate between acute and recurrent VVC participants.

Participants did not have any clinically significant major organ system disease or infection (with the exception of VVC) and were not taking concomitant medications that would have interfered with study assessments.

Participants completed a review of pertinent medical history, vital signs, and body measurements; a symptom/sign evaluation; a physical examination including speculum examination of the vagina; and a KOH wet mount test from a vaginal smear.

### The growing problem of antifungal resistance in onychomycosis and other superficial mycoses [^37ed7fd6]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Superficial mycoses are becoming increasingly resistant to current antifungal medications. As alternative therapeutic options are limited, the increasing frequency of reports of antifungal resistance is alarming. This epidemic parallels the rise of antibiotic resistance; however, the significance of this problem has yet to gain global attention. Here, we discuss the reports of antifungal resistance from around the world, present our own experience with treatment-resistant infections, and examine alternative treatment strategies. The majority of reports of recalcitrant infections indicate terbinafine resistance as the causative factor. Single-point mutations in the squalene oxidase gene is the most reported mechanism of resistance to terbinafine. Mixed infections of dermatophytes with non-dermatophyte molds and/or yeasts are becoming more prevalent and contributing to the resistant nature of these infections. The key to selecting an effective antifungal therapy for a recalcitrant infection is identification of the infectious organisms(s) and testing susceptibility of the organism(s) to antifungal drugs. Combination and sequential therapy regimens are options, but both require active monitoring for hepatic and renal function, drug interactions, and other adverse effects. Selected topical antifungals with a wide spectrum of activity may also be considerations in some clinical presentations. Innovative treatment regimens and novel therapeutics are needed to overcome the rising epidemic of antifungal resistance.

### A phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of orally administered VT-1161 in the treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis [^91112af4]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Lanosterol demethylase is an enzyme that is essential for fungal growth and catalyzes an early step in the biosynthetic pathway of ergosterol, which is a sterol that is required for fungal cell membrane formation and integrity. Lanosterol demethylase is the molecular target of the class of drugs referred to as "azole antifungals." VT-1161 is a novel, oral, selective inhibitor of fungal lanosterol demethylase and is being developed for the treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Objective

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of 4 dosing regimens of oral VT-1161 compared with placebo in women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, which was defined as at least 3 symptomatic episodes of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis within a 12-month period.

Study Design

Two hundred fifteen women with a documented history of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and who, at screening, were experiencing an episode of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis (acute vulvovaginal candidiasis; composite vulvovaginal signs and symptoms score of ≥3 and a positive potassium hydroxide test for yeast) were enrolled. After treatment of the acute infection with fluconazole, subjects were assigned randomly to 1 of 5 treatment regimens: (1) VT-1161 150 mg once daily for 7 days, then 150 mg once weekly for 11 weeks, followed by a once-weekly dose of placebo for 12 weeks; (2) VT-1161 300 mg once daily for 7 days, then 300 mg once weekly for 11 weeks, followed by a once-weekly dose of placebo for 12 weeks; (3) VT-1161 150 mg once daily for 7 days, then 150 mg once weekly for 23 weeks; (4) VT-1161 300 mg once daily for 7 days, then 300 mg once weekly for 23 weeks; or (5) a matching placebo regimen for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of subjects with ≥1 culture-verified acute vulvovaginal candidiasis episodes through week 48.

Results

In the intent-to-treat population, the proportion of subjects with ≥1 acute vulvovaginal candidiasis episodes ranged from 0-7% across the 4 VT-1161 arms vs 52% in the placebo arm, with all arms achieving statistical significance vs placebo. VT-1161 was well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile, and the incidence of adverse events was lower in all VT-1161 arms compared with placebo. In addition, no patient in any VT-1161 arm discontinued the study early because of an adverse event or laboratory abnormality. There was also no evidence of an adverse effect of VT-1161 on liver function or electrocardiogram recordings.

Conclusion

In this study, VT-1161 was shown to be efficacious and safe in the treatment of patients with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis. These data strongly support further clinical investigation of VT-1161 for the treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.

### Treatment of candidiasis (...) [^a0d44dd0]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Candidiasis is treated with antifungal medication.
- Antifungal medications come in different forms: creams, oral gels, pills, or intravenous.
- The type of antifungal, dose, and length of treatment depend on the type and severity of infection and the patient's overall health.
- Take antifungal medications as instructed for as long as directed. Treatment Vaginal candidiasis Treatment is usually an antifungal cream applied inside the vagina or a single dose of fluconazole taken by mouth. Creams can be sold over the counter, but testing is recommended before starting a treatment. If symptoms return, don't improve, or get worse after starting treatment, healthcare providers may adjust the treatment by prescribing:
- More doses of fluconazole taken by mouth.
- Other medicines applied inside the vagina, such as boric acid, nystatin, or flucytosine.

Candidiasis of the mouth and throat Mild to moderate infections: Treatment for most infections include an antifungal oral gel applied inside the mouth for 7-14 days. Types of antifungals used include clotrimazole, miconazole, or nystatin. Severe infections: Antifungal medication in pill form or through an IV. The most common type of antifungal used is fluconazole. Candidiasis of the esophagus The antifungal medication fluconazole is almost always used to treat candidiasis of the esophagus. It can be taken as a pill or, for severe infections, through an IV. Other antifungal medications may be used if fluconazole is not working. The initial recommended antifungal treatment for most adults is an echinocandin given through the vein. Fluconazole, amphotericin B, and other antifungal medications may also be appropriate in certain situations.

For Health Care ProvidersClinical Overview of Invasive Candidiasis. Length of treatment For bloodstream Candida infections, treatment should continue for 2 weeks after signs and symptoms have resolved and Candida yeasts are no longer in the bloodstream. Other forms of invasive candidiasis, such as infections in the bones, joints, heart, or central nervous system, usually need to be treated for a longer period of time.

### Beyond Candida albicans: mechanisms of immunity to non-albicans Candida species [^2cd1d23b]. Cytokine (2015). Low credibility.

The fungal genus Candida encompasses numerous species that inhabit a variety of hosts, either as commensal microbes and/or pathogens. Candida species are a major cause of fungal infections, yet to date there are no vaccines against Candida or indeed any other fungal pathogen. Our knowledge of immunity to Candida mainly comes from studies on Candida albicans, the most frequent species associated with disease. However, non-albicans Candida (NAC) species also cause disease and their prevalence is increasing. Although research into immunity to NAC species is still at an early stage, it is becoming apparent that immunity to C. albicans differs in important ways from non-albicans species, with important implications for treatment, therapy and predicted demographic susceptibility. This review will discuss the current understanding of immunity to NAC species in the context of immunity to C. albicans, and highlight as-yet unanswered questions.

### Fluconazole (Diflucan) [^16d37fc8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

DIFLUCAN (fluconazole) is indicated for the treatment of:

Vaginal candidiasis (vaginal yeast infections due to Candida).
Oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis. In open noncomparative studies of relatively small numbers of patients, DIFLUCAN was also effective for the treatment of Candida urinary tract infections, peritonitis, and systemic Candida infections including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia.
Cryptococcal meningitis. Before prescribing DIFLUCAN (fluconazole) for AIDS patients with cryptococcal meningitis, please see CLINICAL STUDIES section. Studies comparing DIFLUCAN to amphotericin B in non-HIV infected patients have not been conducted.

Prophylaxis:

DIFLUCAN is also indicated to decrease the incidence of candidiasis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

Specimens for fungal culture and other relevant laboratory studies (serology, histopathology) should be obtained prior to therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, anti-infective therapy should be adjusted accordingly.

14.1 Treatment of VVC

Two randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (Trial 1, NCT03734991 and Trial 2, NCT03987620) with a similar design were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single day of BREXAFEMME 600 mg (two 150 mg tablets per dose, administered 12 hours apart) for the treatment of VVC. Non-pregnant post-menarchal females with a diagnosis of VVC were eligible. A diagnosis of VVC was defined as (a) minimum composite vulvovaginal signs and symptoms (VSS) score of ≥4 with at least two signs or symptoms having a score of 2 (moderate) or greater; (b) positive microscopic examination with 10% KOH in a vaginal sample revealing yeast forms (hyphae/pseudohyphae) or budding yeasts, and (c) normal vaginal pH (≤4.5).  The total composite VSS score was based on the vulvovaginal signs (erythema, edema, excoriation) and vulvovaginal symptoms (itching, burning, or irritation) where each was scored as 0= absent, 1= mild, 2= moderate, or 3= severe. Study visits included the test of cure (TOC, Day 8 to 14) visit and a follow-up (Day 21 to 29) visit. The modified intent to treat (MITT) population included randomized subjects with a baseline culture positive for Candida species who took at least 1 dose of study medication.

### Diet-induced changes in titer support a discrete response of wolbachia-associated plastic recombination in drosophila melanogaster [^9b135547]. G3 (2022). Medium credibility.

Effect of Wolbachia infection and diet on fecundity

Though our diet treatments did not affect recombination rate, there was an effect of diet on fecundity. We observed that the average number of offspring per vial was significantly different between diet treatments, with yeast-fed flies displaying the highest average fecundity (Figure  2). The influence of diet on lifespan and fecundity in D. melanogaster has been well-characterized, especially regarding sucrose and yeast content (;). Specifically concerning fecundity, yeast-enriched diets greatly increase female fecundity, while sucrose-enriched diets decrease female fecundity.

Wolbachia are often associated with increased fecundity in host fly species (;;), yet we found no significant effect of Wolbachia infection on fecundity. However, this may reflect a strain-specific response, rather than the effect of Wolbachia infection on D. melanogaster as a whole. Differences in fly fecundity depend on Wolbachia genotype, host genotype, and bacterial-host interactions. For instance, the strain used in this experiment, RAL306, was also used in a study which reported an overall effect of Wolbachia infection on fecundity across multiple strains. However, when examined individually, Wolbachia -infected RAL306 flies had a lower mean fecundity than uninfected RAL306 flies. This suggests that Wolbachia broadly impacts fecundity, but this effect may vary with host genotype.

### A randomized phase 2 study of VT-1161 for the treatment of acute vulvovaginal candidiasis [^3e659f00]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The primary efficacy outcome, therapeutic cure at day 28, was observed in the majority of participants across all treatment groups. Secondary outcome analyses showed similar results as the primary efficacy outcome. Generally, there was no statistical difference between VT-1161 and fluconazole treatment groups; however, the study was not prospectively powered for the primary end point, and sample sizes were small. While the current preliminary study did not differentiate between acute or recurrent VVC participants, requiring only an acute episode at presentation, analyses at the 3-month and 6-month follow-up visits found no indication of mycological recurrence in the VT-1161 groups, while 29% and 46% of participants in the fluconazole group had mycological recurrence at 3 and 6 months, respectively. During the 6-month trial, a higher percentage of fluconazole-treated participants reported TEAEs than VT-1161–treated participants.

### Antibiofilm properties of acetic acid [^1ae4a378]. Advances in Wound Care (2015). Low credibility.

Bacterial biofilms are known to be extremely tolerant toward antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents. These biofilms cause the persistence of chronic infections. Since antibiotics rarely resolve these infections, the only effective treatment of chronic infections is surgical removal of the infected implant, tissue, or organ and thereby the biofilm. Acetic acid is known for its antimicrobial effect on bacteria in general, but has never been thoroughly tested for its efficacy against bacterial biofilms. In this article, we describe complete eradication of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative biofilms using acetic acid both as a liquid and as a dry salt. In addition, we present our clinical experience of acetic acid treatment of chronic wounds. In conclusion, we here present the first comprehensive in vitro and in vivo testing of acetic acid against bacterial biofilms.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^de3787a0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis—uncomplicated vs complicated management: Vulvovaginal candidiasis can be classified as uncomplicated, which is present in about 90% of cases, or complicated, about 10% of cases. Uncomplicated infection can be effectively treated with either single-dose fluconazole or short-course fluconazole for 3 days, both of which achieve >90% response. Complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis requires therapy administered intravaginally with topical agents for 5–7 days or orally with fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 3 doses. Most Candida species, with the exception of C. krusei and C. glabrata, respond to oral fluconazole, and Candida krusei responds to all topical antifungal agents; treatment of C. glabrata vulvovaginal candidiasis is problematic and azole therapy, including voriconazole, is frequently unsuccessful.

### Disseminated Saccharomyces cerevisiae infection in advanced HIV: a literature review [^ec5dac57]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a common environmental fungus and an uncommon, but increasingly recognized, cause of invasive fungal infection. The clinical manifestations of this infection can often be mistaken for histoplasmosis, a major cause of mortality in patients with advanced HIV.

Objectives

This study aims to review the current epidemiology, diagnostic approaches, and management strategies for S. cerevisiae infection in patients with HIV.

Sources

A literature search was conducted using PubMed from January 1980 and May 2024.

Content

This review features a case of S. cerevisiae infection in a patient with HIV to highlight the diagnostic challenges and clinical implications of disseminated infection. A summary of published cases in patients with vs. without HIV is provided alongside a review and discussion of both conventional and novel diagnostic methods. The role of current antifungal therapies in managing S. cerevisiae infections is also examined.

Implications

S. cerevisiae is a rare but clinically important opportunistic pathogen in patients with advanced HIV who have epidemiological risk factors. When found in mucocutaneous lesions under the appropriate clinical scenario, S. cerevisiae should not automatically be dismissed as commensal flora.

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis—definition and suppressive therapy: Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, defined as ≥4 episodes of symptomatic infection within one year, should begin with induction therapy with a topical agent or oral fluconazole for 10–14 days, followed by maintenance azole; for recurring vulvovaginal candidiasis, 10–14 days of induction therapy with a topical agent or oral fluconazole, followed by fluconazole, 150 mg weekly for 6 months, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). The most convenient and well-tolerated regimen is 150 mg fluconazole weekly, achieving control of symptoms in >90% of patients, but after cessation a 40%–50% recurrence rate can be anticipated; if fluconazole therapy is not feasible, topical clotrimazole cream, 200 mg twice weekly, clotrimazole vaginal suppository 500 mg once weekly, or other intermittent oral or topical antifungal treatment is recommended.

Treatment

Most episodes of recurrent VVC caused by C. albicans respond well to short-duration oral or topical azole therapy. However, to maintain clinical and mycologic control, a longer duration of initial therapy (e.g. 7–14 days of topical therapy or a 100-mg, 150-mg, or 200-mg oral dose of fluconazole every third day for a total of 3 doses [days 1, 4, and 7]) is recommended, to attempt mycologic remission, before initiating a maintenance antifungal regimen.

Oral fluconazole (i.e. a 100-mg, 150-mg, or 200-mg dose) weekly for 6 months is the indicated maintenance regimen. If this regimen is not feasible, topical treatments used intermittently can also be considered. Suppressive maintenance therapies are effective at controlling recurrent VVC but are rarely curative long-term. Because C. albicans azole resistance is becoming more common, susceptibility tests, if available, should be obtained among symptomatic patients who remain culture positive despite maintenance therapy. These women should be managed in consultation with a specialist.

Severe Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

Severe VVC (i.e. extensive vulvar erythema, edema, excoriation, and fissure formation) is associated with lower clinical response rates among patients treated with short courses of topical or oral therapy. Either 7–14 days of topical azole or 150 mg of fluconazole in two sequential oral doses (second dose 72 hours after initial dose) is recommended.

Non– albicans Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

Because approximately 50% of women with a positive culture for non– albicans Candida might be minimally symptomatic or have no symptoms, and because successful treatment is often difficult, clinicians should make every effort to exclude other causes of vaginal symptoms for women with non– albicans yeast. The optimal treatment of non– albicans VVC remains unknown; however, a longer duration of therapy (7–14 days) with a nonfluconazole azole regimen (oral or topical) is recommended. If recurrence occurs, 600 mg of boric acid in a gelatin capsule administered vaginally once daily for 3 weeks is indicated. This regimen has clinical and mycologic eradication rates of approximately 70%. If symptoms recur, referral to a specialist is advised.

Management of Sex Partners

No data exist to support treating sex partners of patients with complicated VVC. Therefore, no recommendation can be made.
