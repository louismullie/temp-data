## Question

define difficult to treat asthma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a definition of difficult-to-treat asthma, including how it differs from severe asthma and what to do next in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the authoritative source for definitions and whether severity is assessed retrospectively. Then, I should verify the exact wording for difficult-to-treat asthma and its scope. Next, I will distinguish difficult-to-treat from severe asthma and quantify prevalence. After that, I need to check the common modifiable contributors that make asthma "difficult". Finally, I will outline the practical assessment and management steps, including when to refer and how to phenotype, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the definitional framework and source. GINA 2024 is the most authoritative, globally endorsed guideline, and it assesses asthma severity retrospectively after at least several months of treatment based on the intensity of therapy required to control symptoms and exacerbations, which is the foundation for distinguishing difficult-to-treat from severe asthma [^11172PKk] [^115maK4T].

> Now, I should verify the exact definition of difficult-to-treat asthma. Difficult-to-treat asthma is asthma that remains uncontrolled despite prescribing medium- or high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with a second controller (usually a long-acting beta-agonist, LABA), or that requires high-dose ICS-LABA to maintain good symptom control and reduce exacerbations; importantly, this category includes patients whose poor control reflects modifiable factors such as incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence, smoking, comorbidities, or even an incorrect diagnosis, and it does not mean the patient is "difficult" per se [^113y545t] [^111Nd8o9] [^11429RT8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about severity yet. Severe asthma is a subset of difficult-to-treat asthma defined as asthma that remains uncontrolled despite adherence with optimized high-dose ICS-LABA and management of contributory factors, or that worsens when high-dose therapy is reduced; asthma is not labeled severe if control markedly improves once modifiable factors are addressed, which is why the distinction matters clinically and economically [^113y545t] [^111Nd8o9] [^11172PKk].

> I should double-check the prevalence estimates to anchor magnitude. Approximately 3–10% of people with asthma have severe asthma, whereas a larger proportion — on the order of 17–24% in some cohorts — have difficult-to-treat asthma that could improve with optimization of care. These figures underscore why systematic assessment is crucial before escalating to biologics or other advanced therapies [^111Nd8o9] [^115Ne9ci] [^112dZZQK].

> Next, I should review the modifiable contributors that commonly render asthma "difficult". Let me think about the key domains: adherence and inhaler technique, comorbidities and treatable traits, environmental and behavioral factors, and diagnostic uncertainty. Addressing these can convert a patient from "difficult-to-treat" to well controlled without escalating to biologics, which is both safer and more cost-effective [^114FRaZc] [^114V4JM8] [^116mxoWF] [^115Ki4X8].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic uncertainty piece because mislabeling is common. In 12–50% of patients presumed to have severe asthma, the diagnosis is not confirmed on objective testing. Therefore, confirming variable expiratory airflow limitation with spirometry (and repeating bronchodilator testing or using peak flow diaries or provocation testing when needed) is essential before concluding that asthma is truly refractory [^116i3ybZ] [^1148j9QB].

> I will now examine the practical assessment steps. I need to ensure a structured approach: confirm the diagnosis objectively, review and correct inhaler technique, assess adherence using multiple methods (prescription refill checks, device data, or drug assays where available), screen for and treat comorbidities and treatable traits (obesity, chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps, obstructive sleep apnea, gastroesophageal reflux, dysfunctional breathing, anxiety/depression), and optimize controller therapy including ICS-LABA and, where appropriate, maintenance and reliever strategies; if control remains poor after 3–6 months of optimized care, classify as severe asthma and refer for specialist evaluation and phenotype assessment [^114FRaZc] [^116eivKt] [^115Ki4X8].

> Let me consider the role of phenotyping and biomarkers because this guides add-on therapy. In patients with persistent symptoms or exacerbations despite high-dose ICS-LABA with good adherence and technique, assessing inflammatory phenotype (type 2 versus non–type 2) using blood eosinophils, FeNO, and clinical features helps select among LAMA, LTRA, azithromycin, and biologics targeting IgE, IL-5/IL-5R, or IL-4Rα; notably, real-world cohorts of difficult-to-treat asthma show that the vast majority are type 2–high by multicomponent criteria, which supports systematic biomarker assessment before labeling someone as T2-low [^114Rshjo] [^116eivKt] [^112LPkvD].

> But wait, what if access to testing is limited? I should confirm referral thresholds. GINA advises considering referral at any stage for difficult-to-treat asthma, particularly when the diagnosis is uncertain, there is frequent urgent care use or maintenance oral corticosteroid need, occupational or complex allergic disease is suspected, or multimorbidity is present; specialist centers can provide comprehensive phenotyping, access to biologics, and multidisciplinary care to optimize outcomes and reduce OCS exposure [^113N3vt1] [^1141NNfz] [^116eivKt].

> Let me synthesize to ensure internal consistency. Difficult-to-treat asthma is best understood as asthma that fails to achieve control on, or requires, high-intensity ICS-containing therapy, recognizing that poor control often reflects correctable factors rather than refractory biology; severe asthma is the smaller subset in whom control remains elusive despite optimized high-dose ICS-LABA and management of contributory factors, warranting specialist referral and phenotype-guided add-on therapy including biologics, with the overarching principle that severity is a retrospective label anchored in treatment response rather than baseline symptoms alone [^113y545t] [^111Nd8o9] [^115maK4T].

---

Difficult-to-treat asthma is defined as asthma that remains uncontrolled despite adherence to **medium- or high-dose ICS-LABA** [^113y545t] or requires such therapy to maintain control, often due to modifiable factors like poor adherence, incorrect inhaler technique, or comorbidities [^113y545t] [^112dZZQK]. It is distinct from **severe asthma**, which remains uncontrolled despite optimized high-dose ICS-LABA and management of contributory factors, or worsens when therapy is reduced [^111Nd8o9] [^115S3rJq]. Evaluation should confirm the diagnosis, assess adherence and inhaler technique, and identify comorbidities; **referral to a specialist** is recommended if control remains poor after optimization [^114FRaZc] [^1141NNfz].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

According to GINA, difficult-to-treat asthma is asthma that remains uncontrolled despite prescribing medium- or high-dose ICS with a second controller (usually LABA) or maintenance OCS, or that requires high-dose ICS-LABA to maintain control [^113y545t] [^11429RT8]. This definition emphasizes that poor control may reflect modifiable factors rather than intrinsic severity [^113y545t].

---

## Distinction from severe asthma

Severe asthma is a subset of difficult-to-treat asthma [^113y545t] and is defined by persistent uncontrolled symptoms or exacerbations despite adherence to optimized high-dose ICS-LABA and management of contributory factors, or by worsening control when high-dose therapy is reduced [^115S3rJq]. Thus, severe asthma reflects refractory disease biology, whereas difficult-to-treat asthma often reflects modifiable barriers to control [^111sFA1U].

---

## Prevalence and clinical burden

Difficult-to-treat asthma affects a substantial proportion of patients with asthma and imposes a **disproportionate clinical and economic burden** [^113kbmWL]. Estimates suggest that **up to 17%** of asthma cases are difficult to treat, whereas severe asthma accounts for **approximately 3–10%** of cases [^114p73oY] [^111Nd8o9]. These patients experience higher rates of exacerbations, hospitalizations, and healthcare utilization, significantly impacting quality of life and healthcare costs [^113bJgJm].

---

## Clinical features and characteristics

Patients with difficult-to-treat asthma typically exhibit the following features:

- **Persistent symptoms**: Ongoing symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, dyspnea, and chest tightness despite adherence to standard therapy [^11429RT8].

- **Frequent exacerbations**: Recurrent exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids, emergency department visits, or hospitalizations [^113y545t].

- **High medication burden**: Requirement for multiple controller medications, including high-dose ICS, LABA, leukotriene receptor antagonists, and occasionally systemic corticosteroids [^114p73oY].

- **Comorbidities**: Common comorbidities include obesity, chronic rhinosinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), anxiety, depression, and dysfunctional breathing patterns [^114V4JM8] [^116mxoWF].

- **Behavioral factors**: Poor adherence to medication, incorrect inhaler technique, and environmental exposures significantly contribute to poor control [^114FRaZc] [^111g8VjS].

---

## Factors contributing to difficult-to-treat asthma

Several factors contribute to the complexity of managing difficult-to-treat asthma:

| **Category** | **Factors** |
|-|-|
| Modifiable factors | - Poor adherence <br/> - Incorrect inhaler technique <br/> - Smoking/environmental exposures <br/> - Psychosocial factors (anxiety, depression, stress) [^115Ki4X8] [^111g8VjS] |
| Comorbidities | - Obesity <br/> - Chronic rhinosinusitis <br/> - GERD <br/> - OSA <br/> - Vocal cord dysfunction <br/> - Allergic rhinitis [^114V4JM8] [^116mxoWF] |
| Diagnostic uncertainty | - Misdiagnosis or alternative diagnoses (e.g. COPD, bronchiectasis, cardiac conditions) [^116i3ybZ] [^1148j9QB] |
| Treatment-related factors | - Suboptimal medication regimens <br/> - Inadequate patient education <br/> - Limited access to healthcare resources [^113CD9Bg] |

---

## Evaluation and management strategies

Effective management of difficult-to-treat asthma requires a systematic, multidisciplinary approach:

- **Confirm diagnosis**: Objective confirmation of asthma diagnosis using spirometry, bronchodilator reversibility testing, and assessment of variable airflow limitation [^116i3ybZ] [^1148j9QB].

- **Assess adherence and inhaler technique**: Evaluate adherence using prescription records, electronic monitoring, or patient interviews, and provide education on correct inhaler technique [^115Ki4X8] [^111g8VjS].

- **Identify and manage comorbidities**: Systematically screen for and treat comorbid conditions that may contribute to poor control [^114V4JM8] [^116mxoWF].

- **Optimize pharmacological therapy**: Adjust medication regimens based on patient phenotype, inflammation level, and response to therapy [^113CD9Bg] [^114Rshjo].

- **Non-pharmacological interventions**: Implement smoking cessation, weight management, allergen avoidance, and psychological support [^114FRaZc].

- **Referral to specialist care**: Refer to asthma specialists or severe asthma clinics for comprehensive evaluation, phenotyping, and consideration of advanced therapies, including biologics [^1141NNfz] [^116eivKt].

---

## Role of biomarkers and phenotyping

Biomarkers and phenotyping are increasingly important in managing **difficult-to-treat asthma**. Assessment of **type 2 inflammation** using blood eosinophils, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and IgE levels helps identify patients who may benefit from biologic therapies targeting specific inflammatory pathways [^116eivKt] [^112LPkvD]. Phenotyping based on clinical, physiological, and inflammatory characteristics enables **personalized treatment strategies** and improved outcomes [^115modJg].

---

## Clinical outcomes and prognosis

Patients with difficult-to-treat asthma generally have poorer clinical outcomes compared to those with well-controlled asthma, including higher rates of exacerbations, hospitalizations, and healthcare utilization [^113kbmWL]. However, with appropriate management, including addressing modifiable factors and optimizing therapy, many patients can achieve improved control and quality of life [^112dZZQK].

---

Difficult-to-treat asthma is defined by persistent uncontrolled symptoms despite standard therapy, often due to modifiable factors. It requires a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to confirm the diagnosis, address adherence and comorbidities, and optimize therapy, with specialist referral for persistent cases [^113y545t].

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1179AP9W]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Unanswered clinical questions in patients with overlapping features of asthma and COPD — there is an urgent need for more research to guide better recognition and safe and effective treatment, because patients who do not have 'classical' features of asthma or of COPD, or who have features of both, have generally been excluded from randomized controlled trials of most therapeutic interventions for airways disease, and from many mechanistic studies. Future research should include study of clinical and physiological characteristics, biomarkers, outcomes and underlying mechanisms among broad populations of patients with respiratory symptoms or with chronic airflow limitation. In the meantime, the present chapter provides interim advice about diagnosis and initial treatment from the perspective of clinicians, particularly those in primary care and nonpulmonary specialties, and further research is needed to inform evidence-based definitions, to provide a more detailed classification of these patients, and to encourage the development of specific interventions for clinical use.

Which patients should be referred to asthma specialists?

Patients with difficult-to-treat asthma should be systematically assessed to find out if they have a severe asthma or other reasons explaining their poor response to treatment, such as poor adherence or inappropriate treatment. For patients who do not respond to standard step care management and have poor asthma control despite good adherence and inhalation technique, including management of environmental exposures and co-morbidities, referral to a specialist is clearly essential.

### Why arent't we doing better in asthma: time for personalised medicine? [^1131NKd8]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

After decades of improvement, asthma outcomes have stalled. Mortality, hospitalisations, exacerbations and symptom control remain sub-optimal. In controlled trials, most patients gain high levels of control, but in 'real-life' routine clinical practice most patients do not. Avoidable factors are found in most asthma deaths and hospital admissions. This perspective paper considers and contextualises the factors underlying poor asthma outcomes, and it suggests approaches that could improve the situation. Factors discussed include severe, therapy-resistant disease and the role of new and upcoming pharmacological therapies in improving outcomes. These are likely to be beneficial when targeted on patients with severe disease and discrete phenotypic characteristics, identified through biomarkers. However, for the majority of patients treated in the community, they are unlikely to be used widely, and better use of current therapy classes will be more important. Non-adherence with regular inhaled corticosteroid treatment and over-use of rescue bronchodilators are common, and many patients have poor inhaler technique. Self-management is frequently poor, particularly in those with psychosocial disadvantages and co-morbidities. Communication between clinicians and patients is sometimes poor, with failure to detect avoidable poor control and non-adherence, and failure to provide the necessary information and education to support efficient self-management. Strategies for improving monitoring and clinician–patient interactions to allow personalised treatment are considered. These strategies have the potential to allow individual patient needs to be recognised and efficient targeting of the variety of effective pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions that we possess, which has the potential to improve both individual and population outcomes.

Asthma Severity

By consensus, asthma severity is assessed retrospectively, after at least 2–3 months of treatment, from the level of treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations. GINA does not distinguish between so-called "intermittent" and "mild persistent" asthma because this historical distinction was arbitrary, with no evidence of a difference in the treatment response. Severe asthma is asthma that remains uncontrolled despite optimized treatment with high-dose ICS–LABA or that requires such treatment to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled. It is important to distinguish between severe asthma and difficult-to-treat asthma (i.e. asthma that may be uncontrolled because of other factors, such as incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence, and comorbidities such as obesity and environmental exposures).

Rationale

This definition of asthma severity works well at the severe end of the spectrum but is less useful for describing mild asthma (see TRFR). For example, patients with infrequent or no interval symptoms can still have severe exacerbations. This risk is reduced to a similar extent by either daily ICS treatment or by ICS–formoterol taken only for symptom relief, and the baseline symptom frequency does not predict the need for daily ICS.

### Phenotypes of severe asthma among children and adolescents in Brazil: a prospective study [^116rYyEB]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Differentiating between treatment-resistant severe asthma and difficult-to-treat severe asthma has important implications for clinical practice. Patients with treatment-resistant severe asthma cannot achieve a satisfactory level of control even when potential risk factors are removed, such patients being candidates for clinical trials of new treatment strategies. In patients with treatment-resistant severe asthma, evaluations that are more invasive can be justified. In patients with difficult-to-treat severe asthma, however, control can be achieved when the essential measures are taken, resulting in fewer exacerbations, social reintegration of the patients, and a reduction in health care costs.

In the present study, it was not possible to distinguish between the patients with treatment-resistant severe asthma and those with difficult-to-treat severe asthma on the basis of their baseline clinical characteristics (including ACT and rhinitis scores) or clinical history (number of exacerbations and number of admissions to the intensive care unit). That might explain, in part, the high morbidity that both groups of patients exhibited at baseline. It is possible to distinguish between the two phenotypes only after the essential measures have been taken, which is difficult to achieve outside of a specialized treatment facility. However, we identified markers that are suggestive of a distinction between treatment-resistant and difficult-to-treat severe asthma prior to any intervention, such markers including spirometry values and the FeNO level.

We found statistically significant baseline differences between the patients with treatment-resistant severe asthma and those with difficult-to-treat severe asthma in terms of the pre-bronchodilator FEV₁, FEV₁/FVC ratio, and FEF₂₅–₇₅%, as well as the post-bronchodilator variations in FEV₁ and FEF₂₅–₇₅%. Sharples et al. observed such a difference, although only for post-bronchodilator variations in FEV₁, whereas Konradsen et al. found no difference in FEV₁ values between the two phenotypes. The latter group of authors reported that the parental level of education and family income were both lower among the patients with treatment-resistant severe asthma. In the present study, all of the patients belonged to families with monthly incomes below US$ 600.00 and only one patient had a parent with more than a high school education.

### Difficult-to-control asthma management in adults [^114SB16L]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

The management of difficult-to-control asthma remains a significant challenge, which frequently requires the input of the wider multidisciplinary team. This review covers the importance of systematic assessment, phenotyping, treatment options at step 4, an overview of biologics and novel therapies for type 2 (T2) inflammation, and nonpharmacological interventions. Once people have been identified as suffering from difficult-to-control asthma, it is important to use the systematic assessment process to allow accurate diagnosis and optimization of adherence as well as identification and treatment of any relevant comorbidities. Before initiating a biologic, it is important to optimize inhaled therapies and sufficiently phenotype individual patients to allow for the logical use of biologic agents targeting T2 inflammation. For patients who either do not have evidence of T2 inflammation or remain symptomatic despite biologics, attention should be paid to the available nonpharmacological interventions. Difficult-to-treat asthma remains an area of significant unmet need, but improvements in models of service delivery and the ongoing pharmacological pipeline are causes for significant optimism that sooner rather than later there will no longer be asthmatic patients who are difficult to treat.

### Diagnosis and definition of severe refractory asthma: an international consensus statement from the innovative medicine initiative (IMI) [^115p4tSq]. Thorax (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with severe refractory asthma pose a major healthcare problem. Over the last decade it has become increasingly clear that, for the development of new targeted therapies, there is an urgent need for further characterisation and classification of these patients. The Unbiased Biomarkers for the Prediction of Respiratory Disease Outcomes (U-BIOPRED) consortium is a pan-European public-private collaboration funded by the European Commission Innovative Medicines Initiative of the European Union. U-BIOPRED aims to subphenotype patients with severe refractory asthma by using an innovative systems biology approach. This paper presents the U-BIOPRED international consensus on the definition and diagnosis of severe asthma, aligning the latest concepts in adults as well as in children. The consensus is based on existing recommendations up to 2010 and will be used for the selection of patients for the upcoming U-BIOPRED study. It includes the differentiation between 'problematic', 'difficult' and 'severe refractory' asthma, and provides a systematic algorithmic approach to the evaluation of patients presenting with chronic severe asthma symptoms for use in clinical research and specialised care.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113CD9Bg]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Making decisions about asthma treatment — Asthma treatment is adjusted in a continual cycle of assessment, treatment, and review of the patient's response in both symptom control and future risk (of exacerbations and side-effects), and of patient preferences. For population-level decisions about asthma medications, the 'preferred' regimens in Steps 1–4 represent the best treatments for most patients based on evidence about safety, efficacy and effectiveness, with emphasis on symptom burden and exacerbation risk, and for Steps 1–5 there are different preferred population-level recommendations for adults/adolescents, children 6–11 years, and children 5 years and younger, with Step 5 also differing by inflammatory phenotype (Type 2 or non-Type 2). For individual patients, shared decision-making about treatment should also consider characteristics, phenotype or environmental exposures that predict risk or response, together with the patient's goals or concerns and practical issues (inhaler technique, adherence, medication access and cost to the patient). Optimize asthma management, including inhaled therapy and non-pharmacologic strategies, to reduce the need for oral corticosteroids (OCS) and their multiple associated adverse effects.

Purpose Of Review

To review the latest guidelines on severe asthma.

Recent Findings

An updated definition of severe asthma is provided together with the evaluation steps necessary to reach a diagnosis of severe asthma. The importance of phenotyping is emphasized, and recommendations are provided for therapies specifically directed for severe asthma.

Summary

Severe asthma is widely recognized as a major unmet need. It is defined as asthma that requires treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and a second controller and/or systemic corticosteroid to prevent it from becoming 'uncontrolled' or that remains 'uncontrolled' despite this therapy. Severe asthma is a heterogeneous condition that consists of phenotypes such as eosinophilic asthma. More phenotypes need to be defined. Evaluation of the patient referred to as having severe or difficult-to-control asthma must take into account adherence to treatment, comorbidities and associated factors including side effects from therapies. These need to be addressed. Recommendations on the use of sputum eosinophil count and exhaled nitric oxide to guide therapy are presented. Treatment with anti-IgE antibody, methotrexate, macrolide antibiotics, antifungal agents and bronchial thermoplasty is reviewed and recommendations made. Research efforts into phenotyping of severe asthma will provide both biomarker-driven approaches and newer effective therapies to severe asthma management.

### Steroid-resistant asthma [^114FVeUy]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Steroid-resistant asthma (SRA) refers to patients with symptoms consistent with asthma who show very poor or no response at all to high doses of inhaled or even of systemic corticosteroids. The current article reviews the SRA related literature focusing on the problems associated with the definition of SRA (especially its association with difficult to control, or severe asthma), its various phenotypes, its molecular basis, and the potential treatment options. The article also discusses the limitations of some of the key criteria used for the determination of SRA and proposes a modified set of criteria that are more applicable to children.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116eivKt]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Severe asthma assessment and management in adults and adolescents — assess all patients with difficult-to-treat asthma to confirm the diagnosis of asthma, and to identify and manage factors that may be contributing to symptoms, poor quality of life, or exacerbations, and refer for expert advice at any stage, or if asthma does not improve in response to optimizing treatment. For patients with persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite high-dose ICS-LABA treatment (with good adherence and correct inhaler technique), the clinical or inflammatory phenotype should be assessed, as this may guide the selection of add-on treatment. Depending on the inflammatory phenotype and other clinical features, add-on treatments for severe asthma include long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), low-dose azithromycin (adults), and biologic agents for severe asthma, while low-dose maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS) should be considered only as a last resort if no other options are available, because of their serious cumulative long-term side-effects. After initiating add-on therapy, assess the response to any add-on treatment, stop ineffective treatments, and consider other options; utilize specialist multidisciplinary team care for severe asthma, if available; continue to optimize patient care in collaboration with the primary care clinician and considering the patient's social and emotional needs; and invite patients with severe asthma to enroll in a registry or clinical trial, if available and relevant, to help fill evidence gaps.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115maK4T]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma severity — The current definition of asthma severity is based on retrospective assessment, after at least 2–3 months of asthma treatment, from the intensity of treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations. This definition is clinically useful for severe asthma, as it identifies patients whose asthma is relatively refractory to high intensity treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA) and who may benefit from additional treatment such as biologic therapy, and it is important to distinguish between severe asthma and asthma that is uncontrolled due to modifiable factors such as incorrect inhaler technique and/or poor adherence. However, the retrospective definition of mild asthma as 'easy to treat' is less useful, and short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) alone actually increases the risk of exacerbations. 'Mild asthma' is a retrospective label, so it cannot be used to decide which patients are suitable to receive Step 1 or Step 2 treatment, and GINA suggests that the term 'mild asthma' should generally be avoided in clinical practice if possible or, if used, qualified with a reminder that patients with infrequent symptoms can still have severe or fatal exacerbations, and that this risk is substantially reduced with ICS-containing treatment.

### What is severe asthma? [^117J79aC]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma is common, and some individuals are severely affected by it. Learned institutions have sought to provide a definition of 'severe asthma' to facilitate research and clinical care. This is a challenging undertaking given the difficulty in defining asthma and the lack of supportive evidence for a distinct severe asthma phenotype. In this review, we discuss the rationale for a definition of severe asthma and the relative merits of the sequential attempts that have been made to produce such a definition. The difficulty in disentangling control and severity is highlighted, as is the heterogeneity of phenotype in severe asthma, and potential for misclassification. We conclude that the search for a singular definition of severe asthma is problematic, though likely to continue. We suggest the alternative strategy of using classifiers with a specific aim related to symptoms, pathophysiology or service provision.

### Pathophysiology of severe asthma [^117G1VsM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2000). Low credibility.

Although asthma affects nearly 8% of the adult population, most of these patients have mild-to-moderate disease that can be controlled with appropriate treatment. It is estimated, however, that 5% to 10% of patients with asthma have severe disease that is unresponsive to typical therapeutics, including corticosteroids. Because patients with severe asthma are disproportionately affected by their disease, in terms of both impaired lifestyle and health care costs, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute sponsored a workshop on the pathogenesis of severe asthma. The goals of this workshop were to begin to define the characteristics of severe asthma. In these discussions, it was clear that many characteristics need to be considered in defining this phenotype of asthma, including symptoms, intensity of therapy (including administration of systemic corticosteroids), and impairment of lung function. Also discussed were potential mechanisms of severe asthma including the role of allergic diseases, which may play less of a role in severe asthma than in mild-to-moderate disease, and infections. A major limitation to control of severe asthma is the recalcitrant response of these patients to usual therapy including systemic corticosteroids; the potential of other therapies was reviewed. From these discussions, recommendations were made for future research needs to gain insights into a difficult therapeutic and possibly novel mechanistic area of asthma.

### Asthma: defining of the persistent adult phenotypes [^115VFx2t]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

The common disease asthma is probably not a single disease, but rather a complex of multiple, separate syndromes that overlap. Although clinicians have recognised these different phenotypes for many years, they have remained poorly characterised, with little known about the underlying pathobiology contributing to them. Development of targeted therapies for asthma, and phenotype-specific clinical trials have raised interest in these phenotypes. Improved understanding of these phenotypes in complex diseases such as asthma will also improve our ability to link specific genotypes to their associated disease, which should help development of biomarkers. However, there is no standardised method to define asthma phenotypes. This Review analyses some of the methods that have been used to define asthma phenotypes and proposes an integrated method of classification to improve our understanding of these phenotypes.

### Non-adherence in difficult asthma: time to take it seriously [^111g8VjS]. Thorax (2012). Low credibility.

Recent studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of non-adherence with anti-inflammatory medication in patients referred for specialist assessment with difficult-to-control asthma. As well as poor asthma outcome and increased healthcare cost, failure to detect non-adherence makes identification of true treatment-resistant/refractory asthma challenging. This is because guideline definitions of refractory asthma are all predicated on failure to respond to high-dose anti-inflammatory therapy but do not state how adherence with this therapy should be assessed. With the advent of novel expensive biological therapies, the systematic identification of non-adherence becomes more essential to avoid targeting therapies at an inappropriate patient group. Novel biomarkers of steroid exposure, in combination with more traditional surrogate measures such as prescription filling assessment, may allow more objective assessments of non-adherence to be developed in the future. When identified, non-adherence can potentially be targeted and improved, but the key challenge is to empower patients to make informed choices about medicines rather than decisions influenced by misplaced beliefs about benefit and harm. There is an urgent need for the systematic development of individualised interventions which allow non-adherence to be effectively managed. Thus, non-adherence must become a priority in the clinical assessment of difficult-to-control asthma because addressing non-adherence is likely to deliver greater benefits in this group than any novel treatment. It is essential that future research examines strategies and interventions to address non-adherence in subjects with difficult-to-control asthma.

### Comorbid "treatable traits" in difficult asthma: current evidence and clinical evaluation [^116mxoWF]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

The care of patients with difficult-to-control asthma ("difficult asthma") is challenging and costly. Despite high-intensity asthma treatment, these patients experience poor asthma control and face the greatest risk of asthma morbidity and mortality. Poor asthma control is often driven by severe asthma biology, which has appropriately been the focus of intense research and phenotype-driven therapies. However, it is increasingly apparent that extra-pulmonary comorbidities also contribute substantially to poor asthma control and a heightened disease burden. These comorbidities have been proposed as "treatable traits" in chronic airways disease, adding impetus to their evaluation and management in difficult asthma. In this review, eight major asthma-related comorbidities are discussed: rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux, obstructive sleep apnoea, vocal cord dysfunction, obesity, dysfunctional breathing and anxiety/depression. We describe the prevalence, impact and treatment effects of these comorbidities in the difficult asthma population, emphasizing gaps in the current literature. We examine the associations between individual comorbidities and highlight the potential for comorbidity clusters to exert combined effects on asthma outcomes. We conclude by outlining a pragmatic clinical approach to assess comorbidities in difficult asthma.

### Can early intervention in pediatric asthma improve long-term outcomes? A question that needs an answer [^112rg5FU]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2019). Medium credibility.

9 HETEROGENEITY IN TREATMENT RESPONSE

Children that present with asthma exacerbations generally have more severe disease and signs of eosinophilic inflammation. 74 According to recent estimates, approximately 38% of children with asthma have uncontrolled disease, and 52% of children with uncontrolled asthma were already taking long‐term controller medications. 75 In addition, some children whose asthma is still not controlled despite ICS therapy respond to other standard therapies differently. 76 Another issue to consider is difficult‐to‐treat asthma, defined by the need for multiple medications, frequent and/or severe exacerbations, inability to avoid triggers, and complicated treatment regimens. 77 Although this type of asthma is not a phenotype as defined by treatment guidelines, it can describe asthma of any severity level and is likely to contribute to the population of children with uncontrolled asthma. Overall, efficacy can be difficult to demonstrate in young children due to the confounding influences of socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and comorbidities, as well as the heterogeneity of asthma itself.

### Severe adult asthmas: integrating clinical features, biology, and therapeutics to improve outcomes [^113wUvjf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Compared with the understanding of many core pulmonary diseases, the understanding of asthma and severe asthma has improved exponentially over the last 20–30 years, including understanding concerning the application of precision-medicine approaches. Despite these advances, much remains to be biologically and immunologically clarified. Current "breakthrough" therapies are expensive and often inaccessible, and many patients remain poorly understood and treated. Yet conceptual understanding of "the severe asthmas" is now vastly different from what it was a mere 25 years ago, with accompanying dramatic improvement in the lives of many.

### Uniform definition of asthma severity, control, and exacerbations: document presented for the World Health Organization consultation on severe asthma [^1141wGBX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Asthma is a global health problem affecting around 300 million individuals of all ages, ethnic groups and countries. It is estimated that around 250,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of asthma. Concepts of asthma severity and control are important in evaluating patients and their response to treatment, as well as for public health, registries, and research (clinical trials, epidemiologic, genetic, and mechanistic studies), but the terminology applied is not standardized, and terms are often used interchangeably. A common international approach is favored to define severe asthma, uncontrolled asthma, and when the 2 coincide, although adaptation may be required in accordance with local conditions. A World Health Organization meeting was convened April 5–6, 2009, to propose a uniform definition of severe asthma. An article was written by a group of experts and reviewed by the Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases review group. Severe asthma is defined by the level of current clinical control and risks as "Uncontrolled asthma which can result in risk of frequent severe exacerbations (or death) and/or adverse reactions to medications and/or chronic morbidity (including impaired lung function or reduced lung growth in children)". Severe asthma includes 3 groups, each carrying different public health messages and challenges: (1) untreated severe asthma, (2) difficult-to-treat severe asthma, and (3) treatment-resistant severe asthma. The last group includes asthma for which control is not achieved despite the highest level of recommended treatment and asthma for which control can be maintained only with the highest level of recommended treatment.

### EAACI position statement on asthma exacerbations and severe asthma [^116uWF8v]. Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbations and severe asthma are linked with high morbidity, significant mortality and high treatment costs. Recurrent asthma exacerbations cause a decline in lung function and, in childhood, are linked to development of persistent asthma. This position paper, from the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, highlights the shortcomings of current treatment guidelines for patients suffering from frequent asthma exacerbations and those with difficult-to-treat asthma and severe treatment-resistant asthma. It reviews current evidence that supports a call for increased awareness of (i) the seriousness of asthma exacerbations and (ii) the need for novel treatment strategies in specific forms of severe treatment-resistant asthma. There is strong evidence linking asthma exacerbations with viral airway infection and underlying deficiencies in innate immunity and evidence of a synergism between viral infection and allergic mechanisms in increasing risk of exacerbations. Nonadherence to prescribed medication has been identified as a common clinical problem amongst adults and children with difficult-to-control asthma. Appropriate diagnosis, assessment of adherence and other potentially modifiable factors (such as passive or active smoking, ongoing allergen exposure, psychosocial factors) have to be a priority in clinical assessment of all patients with difficult-to-control asthma. Further studies with improved designs and new diagnostic tools are needed to properly characterize (i) the pathophysiology and risk of asthma exacerbations, and (ii) the clinical and pathophysiological heterogeneity of severe asthma.

### Breaking new ground: challenging existing asthma guidelines [^116ckXw4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is estimated to affect 300 million people worldwide, with an expected increase to 400 million worldwide by 2025. A chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, asthma causes 0.25 million deaths annually and substantial socioeconomic burden around the globe. Moreover, despite the development and dissemination in recent years of both international guidelines and various national guidelines for asthma diagnosis and management, there is evidence that asthma is frequently not well controlled in many children and adults. In this paper we review the limitations of current asthma guidelines and describe important issues and remaining questions regarding asthma guidelines for use in primary care practice.

### Severe asthma treatment: need for characterising patients [^1115aocs]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Asthma is readily diagnosed in most cases and usually responds to inhaled corticosteroids with or without long-acting beta agonists, theophyllines, or leukotriene-receptor antagonists, adjusted stepwise according to symptoms and lung function. However, up to 40% of adult patients with asthma remain symptomatic, and up to 5% have difficult-to-control asthma despite multiple therapies. It is suggested that higher doses of inhaled steroids with long-acting beta2 agonists should be used for total control of symptoms; and anti-IgE therapy is newly licensed in the USA. However, difficult-to-control asthma is complex and multifactorial, and is often not due to severe or therapy-resistant asthma.

Starting Point

Last year saw encouraging reports on omalizumab (anti-IgE therapy) in severe allergic asthma, by Stephen Holgate, Jon Ayres, and their respective colleagues (Clin Exp Allergy 2004; 34: 632–38; Allergy 2004; 59: 701–08). Omalizumab reduced exacerbation rates, improved asthma symptoms and quality of life, and allowed lower doses of inhaled steroid compared with placebo. In placebo-controlled studies with anti-IgE, many patients were able to substantially reduce and even withdraw inhaled steroids in the placebo arm.

Where Next

Severe asthma is often defined as persisting symptoms despite high-dose inhaled steroids. This definition is likely to include patients with various reasons for their persisting symptoms, for whom additional treatment is not always required. Before starting new therapy, it is important to systematically evaluate asthmatic patients to accurately define their disease and to identify those whose symptoms are caused by other factors, and thus avoid unnecessary medication. There might also be subgroups that have differing underlying inflammatory processes and who will respond differently to individual treatments.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^114PgNmk]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society research statement — current challenges in mild asthma research include a lack of a reliable definition (the current definition is based on arbitrary cut offs and is not reliable or valid), suboptimal understanding of heterogeneity (inadequate understanding of mild asthma phenotypes and endotypes and failure to better understand variability in treatment responses), a lack of perceived research needs (no prior initiative from major societies and issues pertaining to lack of funding opportunities), methodological challenges (challenges with consistent inclusion and exclusions criteria and lack of standardized mild asthma outcomes to research), and issues stemming from the patient perspective (patient needs are not consistently factored into current study designs and recruitment issues based on patient perception of "mild" disease).

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111Nd8o9]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Difficult-to-treat and severe asthma in adults and adolescents — difficult-to-treat asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite prescribing of medium or high-dose treatment with the combination of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA), or that requires high-dose ICS-LABA treatment to maintain good symptom control and reduce exacerbations; severe asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite adherence with optimized high-dose ICS-LABA therapy and treatment of contributory factors, or that worsens when high-dose treatment is decreased. Approximately 3–10% of people with asthma have severe asthma. Severe asthma places a large physical, mental, emotional, social and economic burden on patients and is often associated with multimorbidity.

### Asthma-associated bacterial infections: are they protective or deleterious? [^11674m4T]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a chronic disease characterized by airway inflammation, reversible or irreversible airway obstruction, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and lung remodeling. Coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness are the symptoms of the disease. Asthma is viewed as a complex and heterogeneous syndrome, which phenotypically may be classified as mild, moderate, and difficult to treat to severe, that is most likely caused by a combination of genetic predisposition, changes in lifestyle, and environmental factors. Despite this heterogeneity and complexity, 2 endotypes of asthma are defined: allergic (or atopic) and nonallergic asthma.

Asthma affects children, teenagers, and adults. According to the Global Asthma Network, 339 million people are affected worldwide. The prevalence and mortality associated with asthma changes from one region to another. Indeed, although the prevalence of asthma is elevated in high-income countries, the highest number of deaths is recorded in low- and middle-income countries, which corresponds to more than 80% of asthma-related deaths. The global prevalence of asthma also depends on sex and age. The incidence and prevalence of asthma are higher in children, but its morbidity and mortality are higher in adults. Sex prevalence varies along life, with higher prevalence among boys than among girls. However, for all adulthood, females are more affected than males.

In this review, we will address current knowledge about the mechanisms that modulate neutrophilic inflammation in a specific asthma phenotype, which is difficult to treat, in the context of bacterial infectious comorbidities in an attempt to highlight the challenges and to overcome them for the development of host-directed therapies.

### Design and baseline characteristics of the epidemiology and natural history of asthma: outcomes and treatment regimens (TENOR) study: a large cohort of patients with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma [^113kbmWL]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with severe and difficult-to-treat asthma represent a small percentage of asthma patients, yet they account for much of the morbidity, mortality, and cost of disease. The goal of The Epidemiology and Natural History of Asthma: Outcomes and Treatment Regimens (TENOR) study is to better understand the natural history of asthma in these patients.

Objective

To describe the methods and baseline characteristics of the TENOR study cohort.

Methods

The TENOR study is a 3-year, multicenter, observational study of patients with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma. From January through October 2001, more than 400 US pulmonologists and allergists enrolled patients. Patients 6 years or older who were considered to have severe or difficult-to-treat asthma by their physicians were eligible. Patients have been receiving care for 1 year or more, have a smoking history of 30 pack-years or less, and have current high medication or health care utilization in the past year. Data are collected semiannually.

Results

A total of 4,756 patients enrolled and completed a baseline visit. Overall, 73% of the TENOR study patients are adults, 10% are adolescents, and 16% are children. According to physician evaluation, 48% of patients have severe asthma, 48% have moderate asthma, 3% have mild asthma, and 96% have difficult-to-treat asthma. Severe asthmatic patients have the highest health care utilization in the past 3 months (P < .001).

Conclusions

The TENOR study is the largest cohort of patients with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma. Although patients are equally divided into moderate or severe asthma categories, most are considered difficult-to-treat. The TENOR study highlights the lack of control in moderate-to-severe asthma and provides a unique opportunity to examine factors related to health outcomes in this understudied population.

### EAACI biologicals guidelines-recommendations for severe asthma [^116pkF4Q]. Allergy (2021). Medium credibility.

Severe asthma imposes a significant burden on patients, families and healthcare systems. Management is difficult, due to disease heterogeneity, co-morbidities, complexity in care pathways and differences between national or regional healthcare systems. Better understanding of the mechanisms has enabled a stratified approach to the management of severe asthma, supporting the use of targeted treatments with biologicals. However, there are still many issues that require further clarification. These include selection of a certain biological (as they all target overlapping disease phenotypes), the definition of response, strategies to enhance the responder rate, the duration of treatment and its regimen (in the clinic or home-based) and its cost-effectiveness. The EAACI Guidelines on the use of biologicals in severe asthma follow the GRADE approach in formulating recommendations for each biological and each outcome. In addition, a management algorithm for the use of biologicals in the clinic is proposed, together with future approaches and research priorities.

### Difficult-to-control asthma in adults [^116n1VmV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Difficult-to-control asthma in adults is under-diagnosed and under-treated in the United States, particularly in those 40 years of age or older. Increasing attention has been focused on the subset of adult patients with poorly controlled asthma because they consume up to 85% of all health care dollars spent on asthma, while representing 20% of all asthma patients. In this article, we define difficult-to-control asthma and discuss the problem of misdiagnosis. We present an algorithm for confirming the diagnosis in these patients and highlight the importance of patient self-assessment.

### Remission in the world of severe asthma [^116fZKQC]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

What is needed is a paradigm shift in diagnosis and clinical practice, allowing us to move toward a predict and prevent approach with remission very much at the forefront of what we are trying to achieve. This requires early identification of high disease activity (by measuring type 2 inflammatory biomarkers) and prompt intervention with adequate antiinflammatory therapies to prevent downstream damage. We need to move the focus from severe asthma (which is often "too late asthma") to highly active asthma. Asthma attacks are the main clinical readout of high disease activity (Table 1), and their prediction and prevention are not only strongly evidence based but also associated with important reductions in mortality and healthcare costs. This should therefore be the initial focus. However, other key long-term outcomes, such as airway remodeling with associated lung damage and lung function decline, and people remodeling due to associated comorbidities, as well as prolonged illness and use of OCS, may also be predictable and preventable.

Why are we not doing this? A fundamental issue is that our most influential asthma management statement recommends measurement of fractional exhaled nitric oxide and blood eosinophil count and biologic treatment very late. The central but untested tenet of asthma management for 30 years has been a symptom- and lung function–based, one-size-fits-all treatment escalator culminating in the largely non–evidence-based step 4, in which every known asthma treatment is added in an increasingly desperate fashion, and step 5, in which biomarker assessment and precision medicine are finally allowed. This is the ultimate "wait and react", "treat to fail" approach, and its continued propagation in the postbiologic era is disappointing. Management is dangerously wrong in two sizable groups of patients: those with symptom-high/damage-high/activity-low disease, who get futile (and difficult to reverse) antiinflammatory treatment escalation and treatment-associated morbidity as a result of "chasing the symptoms"; and those with symptom-low/activity-high disease, who, if they get on the treatment escalator, are allowed to get progressively damaged by following a series of illogical treatment steps that have no prospect of dealing with the dominant cause of their problems.

### Comprehensive characterization of difficult-to-treat asthma reveals near absence of T2-low status [^112LPkvD]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is conventionally stratified as type 2 inflammation (T2)-high or T2-low disease. Identifying T2 status has therapeutic implications for patient management, but a real-world understanding of this T2 paradigm in difficult-to-treat and severe asthma remains limited.

Objectives

To identify the prevalence of T2-high status in difficult-to-treat asthma patients using a multicomponent definition and compare clinical and pathophysiologic characteristics between patients classified as T2-high and T2-low.

Methods

We evaluated 388 biologic-naive patients from the Wessex Asthma Cohort of difficult asthma (WATCH) study in the United Kingdom. Type 2-high asthma was defined as 20 parts per billion or greater FeNO, 150 cells/μL or greater peripheral blood eosinophils, the need for maintenance oral corticosteroids, and/or clinically allergy-driven asthma.

Results

This multicomponent assessment identified T2-high asthma in 93% of patients (360 of 388). Body mass index, inhaled corticosteroid dose, asthma exacerbations, and common comorbidities did not differ by T2 status. Significantly worse airflow limitation was found in T2-high compared with T2-low patients (FEV₁/FVC 65.9% vs 74.6%). Moreover, 75% of patients defined as having T2-low asthma had raised peripheral blood eosinophils within the preceding 10 years, which left only seven patients (1.8%) who had never had T2 signals. Incorporation of sputum eosinophilia 2% or greater into the multicomponent definition in a subset of 117 patients with induced sputum data similarly found that 96% (112 of 117) met criteria for T2-high asthma, 50% of whom (56 of 112) had sputum eosinophils 2% or greater.

Conclusions

Almost all patients with difficult-to-treat asthma have T2-high disease; less than 2% of patients never display T2-defining criteria. This highlights a need to assess T2 status comprehensively in clinical practice before labeling a patient with difficult-to-treat asthma as T2-low.

### The role of comorbidities in difficult-to-control asthma in adults and children [^114V4JM8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Assessment of asthma comorbidities, conditions that adversely affect the pathobiology of asthma or impair its response to therapies, is a fundamental step in the evaluation and management of patients with difficult-to-treat asthma. Identifying and effectively treating asthma comorbidities, such as obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps, may improve asthma control and reduce exacerbations. In addition, identifying comorbid T2 inflammatory conditions may help guide optimal selection of biologic therapies. Here, we describe common comorbid conditions found in adult and pediatric difficult-to-control asthma, discuss evidence for the association with asthma morbidity and treatment benefit, and provide information on how and when to assess comorbidities.

### Asthma phenotypes: an approach to the diagnosis and treatment of asthma [^1169Zbpw]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2014). Low credibility.

I teach that "Asthma is the most treatable of all chronic diseases known to mankind". Yet, outcome data from throughout the world (emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and quality of life) indicate that the diagnosis and treatment of asthma are not optimal and need improvement. Why? First, asthma is not thought of as a complex, heterogeneous disease or syndrome that consists of different phenotypes and endotypes. Second, asthma is variable, particularly in its severity, and is influenced by known, unknown, avoidable, and unavoidable environmental factors. Third, treatment usually requires complex inhalational devices that are difficult to understand and use, and with which adherence is suboptimal. Continued education on how to appropriately use medications, particularly inhaled medications, is absolutely essential, and knowledge and access to a backup treatment plan to be initiated by the patient for an asthma flare is necessary. Fourth, assessment of asthma is primarily based on symptoms, and, at times, all symptoms are due to asthma, but many times some or all symptoms are due to unrecognized and untreated comorbid or coexisting conditions. Too often, asthma is viewed as a disease that occurs in isolation, and comorbid and coexisting conditions are not appropriately identified and treated. Allergists/immunologists are well suited to provide the type of comprehensive care required to optimize asthma outcomes for the benefit of individual patients and society.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^11429RT8]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Difficult-to-treat asthma — classification and scope: Stages 1–5 can be carried out in primary or specialist care, and a patient is classified as having difficult-to-treat asthma if they have persistent asthma symptoms and/or exacerbations despite prescribing of medium or high-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with another controller such as long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA), or maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS), or require high-dose ICS-LABA treatment to maintain good symptom control and prevent exacerbations; difficult-to-treat asthma does not mean a 'difficult patient'.

### Optimizing care for children with difficult-to-treat and severe asthma through specialist paediatric asthma centres: expert practical experience and advice [^1174GYQZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Future clinical and research implications

Throughout this project, the experts recognized that there is a disconnect between the ideal standard of care described in the consensus and what is feasible within the constraints of existing healthcare models. For example, the ability of primary care providers to perform diagnostic tests – even those noted here as being essential before onward referral – varies greatly among countries and settings, and depends heavily on local practices, expertise, funding and resources. This disconnect is well understood and has inspired a call for a worldwide charter for asthma in children to better implement best practice recommendations. Similarly, while our consensus defines the essential capabilities and personnel needed for specialist asthma centres, in alignment with suggestions from other countries, in practice, the provision of these is limited by the same constraints. We suggest that investing in specialist nurses is a desirable aim for policymakers and healthcare planners. Their activities may help alleviate many of the bottlenecks and frustrations that exist within existing healthcare frameworks, improving the outcomes for patients with severe and difficult-to-treat asthma without the need for unrealistic structural changes to existing healthcare models.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111sFA1U]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for asthma, more specifically with respect to severity definitions, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to define severe asthma as asthma remaining uncontrolled despite optimized treatment with high-dose ICS-LABA, or requiring high-dose ICS-LABA to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled. Distinguish severe asthma (disease that is relatively refractory to corticosteroid treatment) from asthma that is difficult to treat due to inadequate or inappropriate treatment, or problems with adherence or comorbidities, such as chronic rhinosinusitis or obesity since correction of these comorbidities or risk factors ("treatable traits") can significantly improve asthma control.

### Severe asthma phenotypes-how should they guide evaluation and treatment? [^116t2otv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Although patients with "severe" asthma tend to be characterized by ongoing symptoms and airway inflammation despite treatment with high doses of inhaled and systemic corticosteroids, there is increasing recognition of marked phenotypic heterogeneity within affected patients. Although "precision medicine" approaches for patients with severe asthma are needed, there are many hurdles that must be overcome in daily practice. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) has been at the forefront of phenotype discovery in severe asthma for the past decade. SARP, along with other international groups, has described clinical severe asthma phenotypes in both adults and children that can be evaluated in the clinical setting. Although these clinical phenotypes provide a good "starting point" for addressing disease heterogeneity in severe asthma in everyday practice, more efforts are needed to understand how these phenotypes relate to underlying disease mechanisms and pharmacological treatment responses. This review highlights the clinical asthma phenotypes identified to date, their associations with underlying endotypes and potential biomarkers, and remaining knowledge gaps that must be addressed before precision medicine can become a reality for patients with severe asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^115Ki4X8]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Identifying poor adherence — definition and detection: Poor adherence is defined as the failure of treatment to be taken as agreed upon by the patient and the healthcare provider, and approximately 50% of adults and children on long-term therapy for asthma fail to take medications as directed at least part of the time. Checking the date of the last prescription or the date on the inhaler may assist in identifying poor adherence, and in some health systems, pharmacists can assist in identifying poorly adherent patients by monitoring dispensing records. Electronic inhaler monitoring has also been used in clinical practice to identify poor adherence in patients with difficult-to-treat asthma. In clinical studies assessing factors contributing to poor adherence, methods of measuring adherence include using short adherence behavior questionnaires, analysis of dispensing records, dose or pill counting, electronic inhaler monitoring, and drug assay (e.g., for prednisolone).

### Current treatment of severe asthma [^117HyHw7]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Severe asthma is considered a heterogeneous disease in which a variety of clinical, physiological and inflammatory markers determine disease severity. Pivotal studies in the last 5 years have led to substantial progress in many areas, ranging from a more accurate definition of truly severe, refractory asthma, to classification of the disease into distinct clinical phenotypes, and introduction of new therapies. This review focuses on three common clinical phenotypes of severe asthma in adults (early onset severe allergic asthma, late onset non-atopic eosinophilic asthma, late onset non-eosinophilic asthma with obesity), and provides an overview of recent developments regarding treatment options that are best suited for each of these phenotypes.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116i3ybZ]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Diagnosis confirmation in suspected difficult-to-treat asthma — spirometry, thresholds, and bronchodilator withholding: Confirmation of the diagnosis is important, because in 12–50% of people assumed to have severe asthma, asthma is not found to be the correct diagnosis; perform spirometry, before and after bronchodilator, to assess baseline lung function and seek objective evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation, and if initial bronchodilator responsiveness testing is negative (≤ 200 mL or ≤ 12% increase in FEV₁), consider repeating after withholding bronchodilators or when symptomatic or stepping controller treatment before further investigations such as bronchial provocation testing; check full flow-volume curve to assess for upper airway obstruction; if spirometry is normal or is not available, provide a peak flow meter and diary and consider bronchial provocation testing if able to withhold bronchodilators (short-acting beta2 agonist [SABA] for at least 6 hours, LABA for up to 2 days depending on duration of action).

### Most difficult asthma originates primarily in adult life [^113LDjg3]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Epidemiological studies indicate that most asthma starts in childhood. However, the characteristics of adults with difficult asthma differ from the general asthma population. Difficult asthma as defined by poor control despite high dose inhaled steroids and long acting beta 2 agonists disproportionately affects women, more often has onset in adult life and is less frequently associated with atopy, and therefore appears to be a distinct phenotype. If an alternative definition of difficult asthma that is life threatening asthma is used then many of the behavioural traits may have their origin in childhood. Patients with severe and difficult asthma form a specific subgroup of asthmatic patients with high medical need and research specifically into this group of patients is now needed.

### Management of severe asthma before referral to the severe asthma specialist [^112d46dr]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Severe asthma is associated with significant morbidity and can be challenging to assess and control, due to heterogeneity of disease, complexity of diagnosis, and impact of comorbidities. A structured approach to the assessment and management of severe asthma may be helpful to the practicing clinician. First, it is important to confirm a diagnosis of asthma. In patients who are either not responding to treatment, or who require high doses of medication to control symptoms, it is highly possible that disease mimickers or comorbidities are present and can inhibit therapeutic responsiveness. The assessment and management of common comorbidities of asthma may dramatically impact disease control and thus medication requirement. Determining medication adherence and optimizing drug dose and delivery may separate out truly severe asthmatics from those not using medications regularly or properly. Next, although true personalized medicine for severe asthma is not yet realized, for those individuals with severe asthma, phenotypic characteristics of each patient may guide which therapeutic options may be most effective for that patient. Finally, evaluation and management of severe asthma at a referral center can add additional phenotyping, therapeutic, and diagnostic strategies.

### Difficult to treat and severe asthma: management strategies [^114p73oY]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory disease in the United States. Up to 17% of asthma cases are classified as difficult to treat, and 3.7% of these are considered severe. Uncontrolled asthma is characterized by poor symptom control or frequent exacerbations. In difficult-to-treat asthma, the asthma is uncontrolled despite adherence to inhaled corticosteroid therapy in combination with a second controller, an oral corticosteroid is needed to achieve control, or it is uncontrolled despite oral corticosteroid therapy. Severe asthma is a subset of difficult-to-treat asthma in which the disease is uncontrolled despite adherence to optimal management or it worsens when high-intensity therapy is decreased. The diagnosis of asthma should be confirmed and modifiable factors and comorbidities addressed in patients with difficult-to-treat asthma. An adequate trial of an inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta agonist should be implemented with nonbiologic add-on therapies, such as a long-acting muscarinic agent or leukotriene receptor antagonist. Evaluation of severe asthma involves assessment of asthma phenotype. Evidence of type 2 inflammation indicates that the patient may benefit from newer biologic agents. Breathing exercises may improve quality of life, asthma symptoms, lung function, and number of exacerbations. Vitamin D and soy supplementation are ineffective. Bronchial thermoplasty is a procedural option that may be considered if there is inadequate response to other therapies.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114FRaZc]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 8–2. Decision tree – investigate and manage difficult to treat asthma in adult and adolescent patients — applies to adolescents and adults with symptoms or acute exacerbations despite medium or high dose ICS-LABA, or taking maintenance OCS, and advises to consider referring to specialist or severe asthma clinic at any stage. Confirm the diagnosis (asthma/differential diagnoses), then look for factors contributing to symptoms, exacerbations and poor quality of life, including incorrect inhaler technique, suboptimal adherence, comorbidities including obesity, GERD, chronic rhinosinusitis, OSA, modifiable risk factors and triggers at home or work (including smoking, environmental exposures, allergen exposures if sensitized; medications such as beta-blockers and NSAIDS), overuse of SABA relievers, medication side effects, and anxiety, depression and social difficulties. Optimize management, including optimize treatment (e.g. check and correct inhaler technique; add spacer; optimize adherence; switch to ICS-formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy, if available), consider non-pharmacological interventions (e.g. smoking cessation, exercise, weight loss, mucus clearance, influenza and COVID-19 vaccination), treat comorbidities and modifiable risk factors, and consider trial of high dose ICS-LABA, if not used. Review response after ~3–6 months; if the answer to "Is asthma still uncontrolled?" is yes, diagnosis is Severe asthma and, if not done by now, refer to a specialist, if possible. If no, consider stepping down treatment, OCS first (if used); if asthma becomes uncontrolled when treatment is stepped down, restore previous dose, otherwise continue optimizing management.

### Children with difficult asthma: a practical approach [^111NTWTG]. The Journal of Asthma (2001). Low credibility.

Many open studies investigating the effects of innovative treatments for steroid-dependent asthma demonstrate some benefit. This is also true of the majority of placebo arms in placebo-controlled trials. This suggests that children with difficult asthma benefit from the high level of input that is typically provided in clinical trials, with or without additional medication. Such intensive management of patients, with the emphasis on establishing the diagnosis, improving adherence, and identifying provoking factors, is the key to optimizing asthma control for these children. For patients with genuinely severe asthma, despite high doses of conventional treatment, a greater understanding of the pathological basis of persistent symptoms is needed. Identification of different pathological subtypes of severe asthma should allow for more rational prescribing of asthma therapy, as well as the design of further trials of potential steroid-sparing treatments.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1148j9QB]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention — diagnosis in adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years: The diagnosis of asthma is based on the history of characteristic symptom patterns and evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation, which should be documented from bronchodilator reversibility testing or other tests, and more than one test may be needed to confirm asthma or exclude alternative causes of respiratory symptoms. Many health professionals do not have access to spirometry; if so, peak expiratory flow (PEF) should be used, rather than relying on symptoms alone. Test before treating, wherever possible, i.e., document the evidence for the diagnosis of asthma before starting inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatment, as it is often more difficult to confirm the diagnosis once asthma control has improved, and additional or alternative strategies may be needed to confirm the diagnosis of asthma in particular populations including patients already on ICS-containing treatment, the elderly, patients presenting with cough as the only symptom (including cough variant asthma), and patients in low-resource settings.

### Guiding principles for use of newer biologics and bronchial thermoplasty for patients with severe asthma [^117HmiaT]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Severe asthma poses significant disease-related and economic burdens in the United States. Challenges in practice include how to define "severe asthma" for a given patient, knowing which are the right tests to perform and when, and having a better understanding of a patient's asthma phenotype. Furthermore, current guidelines do not address a clear, practical approach to treatment that is based on a patient's asthma phenotype.

Objective

To develop a consensus on the definition of severe asthma, the role of biomarkers and phenotyping severe asthma, and the use of newer biologic therapies and bronchial thermoplasty to help guide practicing clinicians.

Methods

A roundtable meeting was convened with a panel of severe asthma experts to discuss areas in practice that are not adequately addressed by current guidelines, specifically phenotype-guided treatment.

Results

We describe a consensus on the definition of severe asthma, asthma phenotyping with the use of available biomarkers, and guiding principles for newer biologic therapies and bronchial thermoplasty.

Conclusion

To optimize therapy and improve outcomes such as daily symptoms, quality of life, exacerbations, and hospitalizations, a clear picture of a patient's asthma phenotype is needed to guide therapy. Determining asthma phenotypes is the foundation of precision medicine for this persistent, often difficult-to-treat disease.

### Severe adult asthmas: integrating clinical features, biology, and therapeutics to improve outcomes [^115nG8db]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Definition

Advances in the understanding of severe asthma accelerated ∼20 years ago when severe asthma was recognized as a distinct grouping of entities. Severe asthma was specifically defined, first in 2000 by an American Thoracic Society (ATS) workshop, then by the World Health Organization (for a more global definition with relevance to poorly developed and developing countries), and most recently by the European Respiratory Society (ERS)–ATS guidelines. Underlying obstructions with reversibility or reactivity, current or previous, remain at the heart of identifying severe asthma, such that confirmation of an asthma diagnosis, by original ATS definitions, is mandatory. This need to link to current or historical reversible obstruction is sometimes lost when evaluating symptomatic patients, despite guideline-appropriate therapy, leading to inaccurate diagnoses. In addition, lack of reversibility to normal should not invoke a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; rather, it is a hallmark of severe asthmatic disease.

Once an asthma diagnosis is established, ERS–ATS–defined severe asthma (Box 1) is "asthma which requires treatment with high-dose corticosteroids (CSs), plus a second controller, to remain controlled or which remains uncontrolled despite this therapy". Control is defined by symptoms, exacerbations, and degree of obstruction. Yet the current severe asthma definition remains an umbrella definition. It can encompass smokers, ex-smokers, and nonsmokers and a broad range of underlying pathobiologies or molecular phenotypes. Dissecting them is critical to improving treatment.

### Severity, control, and responsiveness in asthma [^117HV3Vm]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Guidelines for asthma management have proposed that initial treatment should be based on assessment of asthma severity. The treatments proposed for different degrees of asthma severity are essentially estimates of the intensity of treatment needed to achieve asthma control. Responsiveness to treatment is heterogeneous, however, even among asthmatic patients with asthma of similar severity. This heterogeneity calls attention to the importance of assessing asthma control and adjusting treatment accordingly. Application of a guidelines-based approach to asthma management thus requires general agreement on what is meant by severity, control, and responsiveness and requires further an awareness of asthma as causing symptoms and functional impairment in the present and also as causing risk of adverse events in the future.

### Severe asthma in childhood: diagnostic and management challenges [^114WpoGE]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Problematic severe asthma is a heterogeneous disease with multiple phenotypes. It is rare (< 5% of children with asthma), but accounts for 30–50% of all pediatric asthma healthcare costs. This review looks into the currently used management strategies and the innovative treatments, considering both conventional medications and innovative biological therapies for targeting airway inflammation.

Recent Findings

Patients with problematic severe asthma should be seen by pediatric asthma specialists using a stepwise approach. The first step is to exclude alternative diagnoses; the second is to consider and exclude comorbidities, and assess adherence to medication; the third step involves identifying the pattern of inflammation; and response to treatment in the fourth. Innovative biological therapies are emerging and healthcare professionals should know how to handle them. Patient phenotyping is the main step towards a targeted therapeutic strategy.

Summary

A careful management is important for children with severe asthma, who form a small but challenging group of patients. More research efforts are needed to enable a personalized medicine and a biomarker-driven approach.

### Differentiation of adult severe asthma from difficult-to-treat asthma-outcomes of a systematic assessment protocol [^1168HwnZ]. Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend a differentiation of difficult-to-treat asthma from severe asthma. However, this might be complex and to which extent this distinction is achievable in clinical practice remains unknown.

Objective

To evaluate to which degree a systematic evaluation protocol enables a differentiation between severe versus difficult-to-treat asthma in patients in specialist care on high intensity asthma treatment, i.e. potentially severe asthma.

Methods

All adult asthma patients seen in four respiratory clinics over one year were screened prospectively for asthma severity. Patients with difficult-to-control asthma according to ERS/ATS criteria (high-dose inhaled corticosteroids/oral corticosteroids) underwent systematic assessment to differentiate severe asthma patients from those with other causes of poor asthma control: objective confirmation of the asthma diagnosis as well as assessment of treatment barriers and comorbidities.

Results

Overall, 1034 asthma patients were screened, of whom 175 (16.9%) had difficult-to-control asthma. 117 of these accepted inclusion, and completed systematic assessment. Asthma diagnosis was objectively confirmed in 88%. Sub-optimal adherence (42.5%), inhaler errors (31.5%) and unmanaged comorbidities (66.7%) were common. After primary assessment, 12% (14/117) fulfilled strict criteria for severe asthma. Moreover, 56% (66/117) were instantly classified as difficult-to-treat asthma due to poor adherence/inhaler technique. Finally, an ´overlap' group of 32% (37/117) were identified with patients being adherent and displaying correct inhaler technique, but had unmanaged comorbidities -potentially fitting into both the difficult-to-treat and severe group.

Conclusion

Only a minority of patients with difficult-to-control asthma were found to have severe asthma after primary systematic assessment. Nevertheless, strict categorisation of severe vs. difficult-to-treat asthma seems to pose a challenge.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^115S3rJq]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Difficult-to-Treat and Severe Asthma in Adults and Adolescents

Detailed information is provided in the GINA 2021 pocket guide on difficult-to-treat and severe asthma, including an integrated decision tree for diagnosis and management across primary and specialist care. A brief summary is included below.

Assessment and Optimization of Therapy

Difficult-to-treat asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite medium- or high-dose ICS–LABA treatment or that requires high-dose ICS–LABA treatment to maintain good symptom control and reduce exacerbations.

Severe asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite good adherence with optimized high-dose ICS–LABA therapy and management of contributory factors or that worsens when high-dose treatment is decreased. Approximately 3–10% of people with asthma have severe asthma.

Assess all patients with difficult-to-treat asthma to confirm the diagnosis of asthma and to identify and manage factors that commonly contribute to symptoms, poor quality of life, and/or exacerbations. For patients with persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite high-dose ICS–LABA, assess the clinical and inflammatory phenotype, as this may guide the selection of add-on treatment. Refer for expert advice if asthma does not improve in response to optimizing Step 4 or 5 treatment (or earlier, if needed).

### Severe asthma and its phenotype [^1131Hm8P]. The Journal of Asthma (2008). Low credibility.

The phenotype of severe, or difficult, asthma is poorly understood, but recent studies have been informative. Factors associated with severe asthma include the presence of co-morbidities such as sinusitis, obesity and gastroesophageal reflux, poor adherence with prescribed medical regimens, and a severe underlying disease process. The worst long-term prognosis in severe asthma is associated with the presence of persistent airflow limitation and exacerbations. Individualization of therapy based on phenotype is highly recommended.

### Distinguishing characteristics of difficult-to-control asthma in inner-city children and adolescents [^1155v45U]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment levels required to control asthma vary greatly across a population with asthma. The factors that contribute to variability in treatment requirements of inner-city children have not been fully elucidated.

Objective

We sought to identify the clinical characteristics that distinguish difficult-to-control asthma from easy-to-control asthma.

Methods

Asthmatic children aged 6 to 17 years underwent baseline assessment and bimonthly guideline-based management visits over 1 year. Difficult-to-control and easy-to-control asthma were defined as daily therapy with 500 μg of fluticasone or greater with or without a long-acting β-agonist versus 100 μg or less assigned on at least 4 visits. Forty-four baseline variables were used to compare the 2 groups by using univariate analyses and to identify the most relevant features of difficult-to-control asthma by using a variable selection algorithm. Nonlinear seasonal variation in longitudinal measures (symptoms, pulmonary physiology, and exacerbations) was examined by using generalized additive mixed-effects models.

Results

Among 619 recruited participants, 40.9% had difficult-to-control asthma, 37.5% had easy-to-control asthma, and 21.6% fell into neither group. At baseline, FEV₁ bronchodilator responsiveness was the most important characteristic distinguishing difficult-to-control asthma from easy-to-control asthma. Markers of rhinitis severity and atopy were among the other major discriminating features. Over time, difficult-to-control asthma was characterized by high exacerbation rates, particularly in spring and fall; greater daytime and nighttime symptoms, especially in fall and winter; and compromised pulmonary physiology despite ongoing high-dose controller therapy.

Conclusions

Despite good adherence, difficult-to-control asthma showed little improvement in symptoms, exacerbations, or pulmonary physiology over the year. In addition to pulmonary physiology measures, rhinitis severity and atopy were associated with high-dose asthma controller therapy requirement.

Difficult-to-treat and severe asthma

Refer people with severe asthma to a respiratory specialist, if possible

Difficult-to-treat asthma is defined as asthma that is uncontrolled despite prescribing of medium- or high-dose ICS with a second controller (usually a LABA) or with maintenance oral corticosteroids, or that requires high-dose ICS to maintain good asthma control. For many such patients, their asthma can be well controlled by optimizing care, including identifying and addressing modifiable risk factors listed in Figs. 2 and 7 and Supplementary Fig. 1. Poor adherence and incorrect inhaler technique are particularly common contributors to poor asthma control.

Severe asthma is a subset of difficult-to-treat asthma (Fig. 8). Severe asthma is defined as asthma that is uncontrolled despite adherence with optimized high-dose ICS-LABA treatment with correct inhaler technique and management of contributory factors such as comorbidities and environment exposures, or that worsens when the dose of ICS-LABA is reduced.

Severe asthma is a subset of those with "difficult-to-treat" asthma. Source: Box 3–15 in GINA report 2022, data from Hekking et al. Reproduced with permission from ref.

Based on a study in the Netherlands, about 3–4% of people with asthma are estimated to have severe asthma, but many more patients have difficult-to-treat asthma, that could be improved by referral for specialist assessment and treatment. While a small proportion of people with asthma have severe disease, they contribute towards a disproportionately high level of morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs.

While most people with asthma can be managed in primary care, it can be challenging to identify those at risk of poor outcomes, and especially those with severe asthma. This difficulty is partly due to the nature of primary care, where large numbers of patients present with many different and often previously undiagnosed medical conditions, there can be severe time pressures, resources may be limited, and at follow-up a patient may see different healthcare professionals with varying levels of expertise or training about asthma. Furthermore, medical records may be poor or incomplete, making it difficult to form a perspective of long-term control and efficacy of treatments, and specifically correctly identifying those that may benefit from specialist referral.

### Asthma diagnosis and treatment: filling in the information gaps [^116WWbHF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Current approaches to the diagnosis and management of asthma are based on guideline recommendations, which have provided a framework for the efforts. Asthma, however, is emerging as a heterogeneous disease, and these features need to be considered in both the diagnosis and management of this disease in individual patients. These diverse or phenotypic features add complexity to the diagnosis of asthma, as well as attempts to achieve control with treatment. Although the diagnosis of asthma is often based on clinical information, it is important to pursue objective criteria as well, including an evaluation for reversibility of airflow obstruction and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, an area with new diagnostic approaches. Furthermore, there exist a number of treatment gaps (ie, exacerbations, step-down care, use of antibiotics, and severe disease) in which new direction is needed to improve care. A major morbidity in asthmatic patients occurs with exacerbations and in patients with severe disease. Novel approaches to treatment for these conditions will be an important advance to reduce the morbidity associated with asthma.

Prevalence and proportions — difficult-to-treat and severe asthma: In a Netherlands study, it was estimated that around 3.7% of asthma patients have severe asthma. In adults depicted in Box 8–1, 24% had high intensity treatment (high dose ICS-LABA or medium dose ICS-LABA + OCS), 17% had difficult-to-treat asthma (high intensity treatment + poor symptom control), and 3.7% had severe asthma (high intensity treatment + poor symptom control + good adherence and inhaler technique).

### Recent asthma exacerbations predict future exacerbations in children with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma [^111ZZ4W2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Children with severe/difficult-to-treat asthma experience high morbidity including frequent severe exacerbations. More knowledge is required to identify predictors of these exacerbations to reduce their occurrence.

Objective

To investigate the risk of future severe exacerbations (FSEs) in children with severe/difficult-to-treat asthma and recent severe exacerbations (RSEs).

Methods

We analyzed the occurrence and association of RSE (defined as 1 or more corticosteroid bursts during the 3 months before each of 3 annual visits) and FSE (defined as 1 or more corticosteroid bursts 6 or 12 months later) in children age 6 to 11 years in The Epidemiology and Natural History of Asthma: Outcomes and Treatment Regimens 3-year observational study. Repeated measures logistic regression analysis assessed the risk of FSE adjusted for demographics and clinical variables.

Results

In a multivariable model, FSE at 6 months was most strongly predicted by RSE (odds ratio [OR], 3.08; 95% CI, 2.21–4.28) and having 3 to 4 allergic triggers (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.31–3.20). Race (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.25–2.51) and being very poorly controlled according to the impairment component of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidelines (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.14–2.23) also significantly predicted FSE.

Conclusion

Recent severe asthma exacerbations are an important independent predictor of FSE in children with severe/difficult-to-treat asthma and should be considered when establishing asthma management plans.

### Treatment of overlapping asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: can guidelines contribute in an evidence-free zone? [^1162wkJw]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

In their most typical forms, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are clearly distinguishable, but many patients with chronic airflow limitation demonstrate features of both conditions and have worse health outcomes than those with either disease alone. This has been called the asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome (ACOS), but as yet, it lacks a precise definition. However, given the different pathways by which a patient can come to demonstrate features of both asthma and COPD, ACOS is not thought to represent a single disease but to include several heterogeneous phenotypes with different underlying mechanisms. These issues have important implications for guidelines because some existing treatment recommendations for asthma and COPD are in conflict, and patients with both asthma and COPD have specifically been excluded from major pharmacologic trials. As a result, there is little evidence at present to support specific treatment recommendations for ACOS on the basis of efficacy or effectiveness, yet these patients continue to present for diagnosis and management, mainly in primary care. This article highlights the need for clinical guidance about ACOS, summarizes recommendations about its diagnosis and treatment from a sample of national asthma and COPD guidelines, and proposes a way forward, as suggested in a collaborative Global Initiative for Asthma/Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease report, to provide health professionals with interim recommendations about syndromic recognition and initial treatment based on both potential effectiveness and potential risk. Additional research in broad populations is urgently needed to develop a precise definition for ACOS, characterize its phenotypes, and identify opportunities for targeted treatment.

### Asthma phenotypes [^116QGrbF]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asthma is a heterogeneous disorder presenting with many phenotypes. Precise phenotypic definition has eluded the medical research community for years, despite recognition of different disease subtypes. Improved phenotypic characterization and knowledge of underlying pathobiology is necessary for linkage of specific genotypes with clinical disease manifestations.

Recent Findings

Phenotyping has been difficult because asthma is likely to be comprised of overlapping syndromes with varying origins and heterogeneous pathobiology. Currently, the field is too reliant on classification by trigger or symptoms. Since genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity are inherent in asthma, patients presenting with different asthma phenotypes may need tailored therapies. Studies have begun to link genetics with disease mechanism and therapeutic response. As disease etiology, onset, progression and severity vary greatly among patients, however, the relative contribution of genetic factors may be difficult to ascertain. Definition of the full array of complex biological consequences of molecular target modulation is a prerequisite for therapies based on this concept.

Summary

The advent of targeted therapies for asthma and clinical trials based on phenotype and genotype have raised interest in more accurate description of asthma phenotypes. Therapies based on phenotypic and genotypic characteristics may be useful in asthma management. A variety of factors, however, must be addressed before such approaches become standard.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^11172PKk]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Assessing asthma severity — The current concept is that asthma severity should be assessed retrospectively from how difficult the patient's asthma is to treat, reflected by the level of treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations after at least several months of treatment; by this definition, severe asthma is defined as asthma that remains uncontrolled despite optimized treatment with high-dose ICS–LABA, or that requires high-dose ICS–LABA to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled, and must be distinguished from difficult-to-treat asthma due to inadequate or inappropriate treatment, adherence problems, or comorbidities such as chronic rhinosinusitis or obesity.

### Balancing the needs of the many and the few: where next for adult asthma guidelines? [^114uR6NB]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Asthma differs from many other chronic conditions in that most key management decisions are made in non-specialist settings, such as general practitioner surgeries and accident and emergency departments. Diagnosis in primary care relies on recognition of a characteristic pattern of symptoms and the occurrence of asthma attacks, sometimes supplemented by basic lung function tests. Ongoing management is guided by the assessment of symptoms and simple lung function measures of airflow obstruction, with little attempt made to personalise management. This approach is flawed because the inadequate specificity of symptoms, as well as the low sensitivity of variable airflow obstruction, means that a diagnosis of asthma is often difficult to exclude with confidence. Moreover, even if diagnosed correctly, dissociation between inflammation, airflow obstruction, and symptoms means that a generalised stepwise approach to managing asthma on the basis of symptoms is unlikely to be successful in a substantial proportion of patients. As a result, effective treatments are used inefficiently, and outcomes are often worse than they could be. Rather than use of either a population-based or personalised approach for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we recommend a new combined approach, in which treatment decisions are driven by objective assessment of key treatable mechanistic traits.

### Severe asthma in children [^111TkqLq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Severe asthma in children is characterized by sustained symptoms despite treatment with high doses of inhaled corticosteroids or oral corticosteroids. Children with severe asthma may fall into 2 categories, difficult-to-treat asthma or severe therapy-resistant asthma. Difficult-to-treat asthma is defined as poor control due to an incorrect diagnosis or comorbidities, or poor adherence due to adverse psychological or environmental factors. In contrast, treatment resistant is defined as difficult asthma despite management of these factors. It is increasingly recognized that severe asthma is a highly heterogeneous disorder associated with a number of clinical and inflammatory phenotypes that have been described in children with severe asthma. Guideline-based drug therapy of severe childhood asthma is based primarily on extrapolated data from adult studies. The recommendation is that children with severe asthma be treated with higher-dose inhaled or oral corticosteroids combined with long-acting β-agonists and other add-on therapies, such as antileukotrienes and methylxanthines. It is important to identify and address the influences that make asthma difficult to control, including reviewing the diagnosis and removing causal or aggravating factors. Better definition of the phenotypes and better targeting of therapy based upon individual patient phenotypes is likely to improve asthma treatment in the future.

### The effect of a systematic multi-dimensional assessment in severe uncontrolled asthma: a literature review and protocol for an investigator-initiated, open-label, randomized-controlled trial (EXACT @ home study) [^114C79rN]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a common multifactorial disease characterized by chronic inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness to direct or indirect stimuli, resulting in intermittent symptoms like cough, wheezing, shortness of breath and/or chest tightness.

In the Netherlands, more than 500,000 patients have been diagnosed with asthma. Of these patients 17% have difficult-to-treat asthma that is uncontrolled despite optimal use of inhaled medication and/or maintenance therapy with oral corticosteroids (mOCS). This is often due to the presence of treatable traits, which are factors that contribute to the disease severity. Within the field of difficult-to-treat asthma, severe asthma is a distinct subpopulation, affecting 3.6% of the total asthma population. Severe asthma is defined as asthma that remains uncontrolled despite adherence to optimised high-intensity therapy and optimal treatment of treatable traits. Treatable traits can be categorized into pulmonary factors (e.g. eosinophilia, allergies, airway obstruction and infections), non-pulmonary factors such as comorbidities (e.g. obesity, depression, vocal cord dysfunction, rhinosinusitis, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and gastroesophageal reflux), behavioral aspects (e.g. adherence, inhaler technique, physical activity, dysfunctional breathing, symptom perception, smoking) and environmental influences (e.g. social network, pollution). Patients with difficult-to-treat asthma have similar clinical presentation, but possess unique compositions of underlying treatable traits.

### Clinical characteristics and possible phenotypes of an adult severe asthma population [^112GPAr9]. Respiratory Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Currently, there are no studies of well-characterized severe asthmatics in Brazil. We aimed to study a population of severe treated asthmatics still uncontrolled to characterize them and define possible phenotypes.

Methods

Descriptive cross-sectional outpatient study of severe asthmatics, evaluating functional and inflammatory markers, health-related quality of life, anxiety and depression symptoms, clinical control status, and characteristics related to atopy, age of asthma onset, induced sputum eosinophil levels, and airflow limitation. We also grouped the subgroups characteristics to identify phenotypes. The study is registered on ClinicalTrial.gov NCT 01089322.

Results

From 128 eligible patients with severe/uncontrolled asthma, 74 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The cohort was comprised of 85% women, frequently with a body mass index higher than 31 kg m⁻², atopy (60%), early-onset disease (50%), sputum eosinophilia (80%), comorbidities, and reduced quality of life. Nonatopics had significant higher asthma onset (19 y.a.) and twice level of induced sputum eosinophil. Late-onset patients had significantly less atopy (57%) and higher levels of induced sputum eosinophils. Non-eosinophilics had lower levels of inflammatory markers. Patients with airflow limitation had more intensive care unit admissions (56%) and 1.5 times more airway resistance. Subgroups characteristics identified a priori four well-characterized phenotypes, with 55% presenting sputum eosinophilia.

Conclusion

Our data emphasize the high burden of disease, the persistence of inflammation and the existence of clinical possible phenotypes population sharing common features with published cohorts. Despite the necessity of further investigation into pathogenic mechanisms, this study with clinically difficult patient group may help to improve future asthma care.

### Novel potential treatable traits in asthma: where is the research taking us? [^113W68zQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a complex, heterogeneous disease in which the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Patients are often grouped into phenotypes (based on clinical, biologic, and physiologic characteristics) and endotypes (based on distinct genetic or molecular mechanisms). Recently, patients with asthma have been broadly split into 2 phenotypes based on their levels of type 2 inflammation: type 2 and non–type 2 asthma. However, this approach is likely oversimplified, and our understanding of the non–type 2 mechanisms in asthma remains extremely limited. A better understanding of asthma phenotypes and endotypes may assist in development of drugs for new therapeutic targets in asthma. One approach is to identify "treatable traits", which are specific patient characteristics related to phenotypes and endotypes that can be targeted by therapies. This review will focus on emerging treatable traits in asthma and aim to describe novel patient subgroups and endotypes that may represent the next step in the search for new therapeutic approaches.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^116X6fog]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Definition of mild asthma — current knowledge and challenges emphasize that the lack of a standardized definition has been a major challenge for clinical research; the current ATS/European Respiratory Society task force definition, published in 2008 and 2009, defines severity by difficulty in controlling asthma with treatment and considers mild asthma as asthma that can be controlled with low-intensity treatment; both symptoms and exacerbations were included in control assessment, exacerbations can occur even in patients with mild asthma, and severity could be assessed only once patients had been taking controller treatment for several months. In alignment with this framework, GINA defines mild asthma as asthma that is well controlled on steps 1 and 2 of treatment (with both steps containing ICS), while the 2020 focused update of the NAEPP guidelines retains the NAEPP 2007 division of mild asthma before controller treatment is started (in treatment-naive patients or in patients receiving SABAs alone) into "intermittent" versus "persistent" based on symptoms and exacerbations with normal lung function; before controller treatment GINA (unlike NAEPP) does not distinguish between intermittent and persistent asthma, and after controller treatment is started, NAEPP continues to distinguish between these categories.

### Defining and investigating difficult asthma: developing quality indicators [^1174svB5]. Respiratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

There is no agreed definition of 'difficult asthma' or what investigations should be available to investigate these patients. Patients with difficult asthma remain symptomatic on high levels of treatment and are high users of medical resources.

Aim

To develop a set of quality indicators for the definition and investigation of difficult asthma.

Method

Modified RAND Appropriateness Method was used. An expert panel composed of nine hospital asthma specialists who run 'difficult' asthma clinics and were identified from a short list of key workers in the field. Indicators were rated as necessary to define and investigate difficult asthma.

Results

Difficult asthma was defined as 'symptoms persisting beyond therapy consistent with step 4 of the British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines' (high dose inhaled corticosteroids and long acting beta(2)-agonists). Eighty-three indicators were identified (40 relating to definition and 43 relating to investigations). Of these 32 (39%) were rated as necessary: 7 out of 40 (18%) for defining difficult asthma and 23 out of 43 (53%) for investigations. Indicators of high medical resource usage were characteristic of the 'difficult' nature of the management of patient with difficult asthma. A framework for the investigation of these patients was created.

Conclusion

The listed performance indicators identify a range of requirements that are necessary to define difficult asthma. Targeting of real needs in this group of patients will lead to better patient care and reduction of 'waste' in provision of healthcare.

### Comparison of guideline-based control definitions and associations with outcomes in severe or difficult-to-treat asthma [^116Yr9Wa]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program put forth guidance on how to measure asthma control. This guidance is flexible regarding how the impairment component of control is assessed.

Objectives

To evaluate and compare 3 different National Asthma Education and Prevention Program-informed definitions of asthma control and to explore the strength of association between levels of asthma control and future control, asthma-related costs, and health-related quality-of-life utilities.

Methods

We used descriptive statistics, the weighted K statistic, and regression methods to compare 3 definitions in a large registry cohort and to explore associations with clinical and health economic outcomes.

Results

We followed up 3,061 patients (≥ 12 years old) in a representative sample of severe or difficult-to-treat asthma. At baseline, 9.1%, 17.1%, or 33.5% of patients were considered well controlled depending on the definition. Lung function was not a component of the definition where 33.5% of patients were well controlled. Weighted K statistics comparing the baseline control definitions ranged from 0.36 to 0.67. The adjusted R2 statistic from the models predicting the future odds of being well controlled, mean asthma-related costs, and mean utilities did not yield consistent results for ranking the definitions of control.

Conclusions

Although all 3 control definitions were correlated with future control and health economic outcomes, there were striking differences in the descriptive results across the definitions, including the proportion of patients in each category of control. Differences among definitions of asthma control may lead to divergent research conclusions or treatment practices. We do not advocate for one particular definition, but we call for standardization of control definitions for specific uses.

### Optimizing care for children with difficult-to-treat and severe asthma through specialist paediatric asthma centres: expert practical experience and advice [^113jbNME]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Specialist asthma centres are valuable for treating children with severe asthma, and the threshold for referral from primary to specialist care should be low, to optimize their diagnosis, treatment and quality of care. Especially, children who may need biologics should be managed by these specialist centres, for which we have defined facilities, staff and responsibilities. Lastly, shared decision-making and inter-setting communication is vital at all stages of the patient journey, up to and including transition to adult services.

This consensus reflects optimal care in an 'ideal world', and we encourage clinicians and policymakers in each country to consider how they could implement our suggestions to bring the reality closer to the ideal. We propose that investing in specialist nurses could overcome many difficulties resulting from poor cross-specialty and cross-setting communication, and could ease the burden on overstretched settings without necessitating unattainable structural changes.

### Can severe asthmatic patients achieve asthma control? A systematic approach in patients with difficult to control asthma followed in a specialized clinic [^114gSkSV]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Summary at a glance

There is still debate if severe asthma (SA) patients may acquire symptoms control with available treatment. Our findings support that the application of a systematic, low-cost, easy to conduct protocol can prevent up to 25% of uncontrolled SA patients from up titrating their treatments to new and complex therapies.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113y545t]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Definitions — uncontrolled, difficult-to-treat, and severe asthma: Uncontrolled asthma includes one or both of poor symptom control and frequent exacerbations, specifically frequent exacerbations (≥ 2/year) requiring oral corticosteroids (OCS), or serious exacerbations (≥ 1/year) requiring hospitalization. Difficult-to-treat asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite prescribing of medium- or high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with a second controller (usually a long-acting beta agonist [LABA]) or with maintenance OCS, or that requires high-dose treatment to maintain good symptom control and reduce the risk of exacerbations; in many cases it may reflect modifiable factors such as incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence, smoking, comorbidities, or an incorrect diagnosis. Severe asthma is a subset of difficult-to-treat asthma defined as asthma that is uncontrolled despite adherence with maximal optimized high-dose ICS-LABA treatment and management of contributory factors, or that worsens when high-dose treatment is decreased, and asthma is not classified as severe if it markedly improves when contributory factors such as inhaler technique and adherence are addressed.

Definition of Mild Asthma

Current Knowledge and Challenges

The lack of a standardized definition of mild asthma has been a major challenge for clinical research (Table 1 and Figure 1). In the current ATS definition, published in 2008 and 2009 by an ATS/European Respiratory Society (ERS) task force, asthma severity is defined by difficulty in controlling asthma with treatment; mild asthma is considered as asthma that can be controlled with low-intensity treatment. The task force included both symptoms and exacerbations in the assessment of control but recognized that exacerbations could be experienced even by patients with mild asthma. It emphasized that severity could be assessed only once patients had been taking controller treatment for several months, as uncontrolled asthma before starting treatment could turn out to be mild, moderate, or severe depending on the response to ICS.

GINA, following the ATS/ERS definition, defines mild asthma as asthma that is well controlled on steps 1 and 2 of treatment (with both steps containing ICS). However, the 2020 focused update of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines retains the NAEPP 2007 division of mild asthma before controller treatment is started (i.e. in treatment-naive patients or in patients receiving SABAs alone), into "intermittent" versus "persistent" on the basis of daytime symptoms, nighttime awakenings, interference with daily activity, and exacerbations in the setting of normal lung function. Before controller treatment is started, GINA (unlike NAEPP) does not distinguish between intermittent and persistent asthma because, as noted above, severity can be assessed only after the patient is on controller treatment, because of a lack of evidence to support specific symptom frequency criteria, and because both groups experience similarly large reductions in exacerbations with ICS treatment. After controller treatment is started, NAEPP continues to distinguish between intermittent and persistent asthma: intermittent if it can be controlled by SABA-only treatment and persistent if step 2 treatment or higher is required.

### Difficult-to-treat asthma management in school-age children [^11246qvZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

The World Health Organization divides severe asthma into three categories: untreated severe asthma; difficult-to-treat severe asthma; and severe, therapy-resistant asthma. The apparent frequency of severe asthma in the general population of asthmatic children is probably around 5%. Upon referral of these children, it is important to evaluate the diagnosis of asthma carefully before modifying management and applying a long-term monitoring plan. Identification of pathophysiologic phenotypes using objective biomarkers is essential in our routine assessments of severe asthma. Although conventional pharmacologic approaches should be attempted first, there is growing recognition that children with difficult-to-treat asthma may have unique clinical phenotypes that may necessitate alternative treatment approaches including asthma biologics. These new medications, especially those with effects on multiple pathologic features of asthma, raise the hope that new treatment strategies could induce remission. Besides introducing new medications, the opportunity for closer monitoring is feasible with advances in digital health. Therefore, we have the opportunity to improve response to medications, individualize treatment, and monitor response along with potential steps to prevent severe asthma.

Difficult-to-treat and severe asthma — assessment and referral: Patients with poor symptom control and/or exacerbations despite medium- or high-dose ICS-LABA should be assessed for contributing factors and have asthma treatment optimized; if problems continue or diagnosis is uncertain, refer to a specialist center for phenotypic assessment and consideration of add-on therapy including biologics.

Diagnosis and initial treatment in adults with features of asthma, COPD or both — Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are described as heterogeneous and overlapping, with umbrella labels and with similar symptoms and overlapping diagnostic criteria, and distinguishing them can be difficult, particularly in smokers and older adults; the terms 'asthma-COPD overlap' or 'asthma+COPD' are simple descriptors that do not refer to a single disease entity, and safety of pharmacologic treatment is a high priority. The labels remain important because there are extremely important differences in evidence-based treatment recommendations; specifically, treatment with a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA) and/or long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) alone without inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is recommended as initial treatment in COPD but contraindicated in asthma due to the risk of severe exacerbations and death. These risks are also seen in patients who have diagnoses of both asthma and COPD, and ICS reduce mortality and hospitalizations in patients with asthma, including in those with concomitant COPD.

### Severe asthma: from characteristics to phenotypes to endotypes [^115modJg]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Asthma, and severe asthma, in particular, is increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous disease. While traditional views of asthma have centered around a childhood onset disease with an allergic component, several large scale network studies are now confirming that severe asthma can present in multiple different ways, only 30–50% of which meet traditional childhood onset allergic criteria. To understand the different groups better, initial studies have attempted to define phenotypes of severe asthma. A phenotype is defined as the integration of different characteristics that are the product of the interaction of the patient's genes with the environment. Both clinical and statistical approaches have identified at least 3–5 phenotypes of severe asthma. However, these phenotypes, in isolation, do not identify the immunopathology that makes these clinical phenotypes distinct or identifies a target population for a specific approach to therapy. As biological characteristics are identified, phenotypes should continue to evolve towards asthma endotypes. The identification of these endotypes, either by matching biology, genetics and therapeutic responses to therapy with clinically or statistically defined phenotypes or through unbiased genetic and genomic approaches, remains limited. Moving forward, this integration of genetics, biology and clinical characteristics should substantially enhance our ability to effectively treat complex heterogeneous diseases, such as severe asthma.

### Adaptation of a difficult-to-manage asthma programme for implementation in the Dutch context: a modified e-Delphi [^111VFk1j]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a common respiratory condition, accounting for serious morbidity for patients and an important negative impact on society and economy owing to high costs of medication, hospitalisation and loss of productivity. Even now, 60% of the asthmatics are poorly controlled, which is related to a significant reduction in quality of life.

Mortality remains high despite the availability of effective therapies. Recently, major preventable factors were found in 67% of asthma deaths, and only a small portion of patients had such severe asthma that mortality could not have been prevented. Therefore, it is of vital importance to differentiate between patients with truly severe asthma (estimated as 3.6% of people with asthma in the Netherlands) from persons with difficult-to-manage asthma (estimated as 17.4% of people with asthma). Difficult-to-manage asthma is asthma that either the person affected or the clinician finds difficult to manage, which may or may not be driven by the severity of the disease. It requires identification and management of treatable traits, predominantly beyond pharmacotherapy. By doing so, the potentially life-saving but thus far very costly new types of treatment can be reserved for the patients with truly severe asthma. International guidelines define severe asthma as asthma that requires treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus a second controller and/or systemic corticosteroids to prevent it from becoming 'uncontrolled', or that remains 'uncontrolled' despite this therapy, when supervised by a specialised multidisciplinary team for at least 3 months.

### Severe asthma: an expanding and mounting clinical challenge [^11552Zna]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Although all patients with asthma have variable airflow obstruction, airway inflammation, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, some have disease that is severe in many aspects: persistent airflow obstruction, ongoing symptoms, increased frequency of exacerbations, and, most importantly, a diminished response to medications. A number of definitions have emerged to characterize the clinical features of severe asthma, but a central feature of this phenotype is the need for high doses of medications, especially corticosteroids, in attempts to achieve disease control. The prevalence of severe asthma is also undergoing reevaluation from the usual estimate of 10% to larger numbers on the basis of medication needs and the lack of disease control achieved. At present, the underlying mechanisms of severe asthma are not established but likely reflect a heterogeneous pattern, rather than a single unifying process. Guideline-directed treatment for severe asthma has limits with usual approaches centered on high doses of inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting β-agonists, and trials with omalizumab, the monoclonal antibody to IgE. With the development of approaches to recognize asthma phenotypes with distinct pathogenesis and hence unique therapeutic targets, it is hoped that a personalized strategy in treatment directed toward disease-specific features will improve outcomes for this high-risk, severely affected population of patients.

### Phenotypes of severe asthma among children and adolescents in Brazil: a prospective study [^116zYHbG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Severe uncontrolled asthma comprises three categories: untreated severe asthma; difficult-to-treat severe asthma; and treatment-resistant severe asthma. Those categories differ in terms of their connotation in the context of public health, as well as in terms of the challenges they pose. Failure to achieve and maintain asthma control can increase the risk and frequency of exacerbations, as well as increasing the risk of asthma-related death. Individuals with uncontrolled asthma are also more likely to have adverse reactions to asthma medications and to develop chronic morbidity, such as impaired pulmonary function. In children with uncontrolled asthma, lung growth can also be impaired.

Patients with severe uncontrolled asthma should be evaluated carefully. The evaluation of such patients should include the differential diagnosis of their symptoms, the determination of their access to medications, and the identification of potentially reversible risk factors (comorbidities, inefficient inhaler technique, poor adherence to the treatment regimen, and asthma triggers in the environment). In addition, attempts should be made to determine whether the use of maintenance medications is optimal. The objective of such evaluations is to distinguish patients with treatment-resistant severe asthma, in whom the symptoms remain uncontrolled despite the highest level of recommended treatment or control can be maintained only with the highest level of recommended treatment, from those with difficult-to-treat severe asthma, in whom control can be achieved after the removal of reversible risk factors. It is important to make the distinction between treatment-resistant severe asthma and difficult-to-treat severe asthma, in order to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures, minimize adverse effects of asthma medications, and hold down health care costs, given that asthma control is possible in patients with difficult-to-treat severe asthma, whereas those with treatment-resistant severe asthma are candidates for clinical trials of other treatment strategies.

### Monoclonal antibodies in type 2 asthma: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^117WE4BJ]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Global Initiative of Asthma (GINA), defines asthma as a disorder of lower airways, usually associated with chronic airway inflammation characterized by episodic respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough, together with variable expiratory airflow obstruction. Asthma is an overarching term for a heterogeneous disease including multiple underlying disease mechanisms with common clinical symptoms. The estimated global prevalence of clinical asthma in adults is 4.5%, translating into over 300 million people worldwide with asthma. The prevalence is higher in developed countries, up to 21.5%.

The severity of the asthma symptoms and airflow limitation typically varies over time. Symptoms often worsen at night or early in the morning. Fluctuations can be caused by specific triggers such as allergens, as well as non-specific triggers such as exercise, laughter, irritant exposure, cold air and viral infections. Conversely, asthma symptoms can disappear spontaneously for weeks or months. Life-threatening exacerbations, defined as acute episodic flare-ups are the most important complications of the disease, affecting morbidity and mortality.

Asthma-phenotypes can be categorized based on clinical characteristics or environmental triggers. This approach evolved towards defining subtypes by different underlying biology, also called 'endotypes'. Based on this pathobiology-stratified approach, asthma patients can be subdivided into two main categories: patients with type 2 asthma and patients with non-type 2 asthma. Eosinophilic inflammation is the hallmark symptom of type 2 asthma. Blood or sputum eosinophilia are associated with a higher risk of severe asthma exacerbations. The most important differentiating factors between the different subendotypes are age at disease onset and atopy.

Treatment goals in asthma include symptom control and reducing risk of future exacerbations. However, approximately 3 to 5% of asthmatic patients have severe asthma where either symptoms persist or numerous exacerbations occur despite maximal treatment, an estimate that varies by country and may reach ≥ 10% in the United States. Therefore, an alternative approach is required, guided by the underlying inflammatory pathway or endotype. According to the GINA pocket guide for the management of difficult-to-treat and severe asthma, type 2 inflammation should be considered if any of the following are found in a patient taking high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS): elevated blood eosinophils (≥ 150/μL), elevated sputum eosinophils (≥ 2%), elevated FeNO (≥ 20 ppb) or asthma that is clinically allergen-driven.

Referral thresholds for difficult-to-treat asthma — specialist or severe asthma clinic: Consider referral to a specialist or severe asthma clinic at any stage, particularly if there is difficulty confirming the diagnosis of asthma; patient has frequent urgent healthcare utilization; patient needs frequent or maintenance OCS; occupational asthma is suspected; food allergy or anaphylaxis, as this increases the risk of death; symptoms are suggestive of infective or cardiac cause; symptoms are suggestive of complications such as bronchiectasis; or patient has multimorbidity.

### Key findings and clinical implications from the epidemiology and natural history of asthma: outcomes and treatment regimens (TENOR) study [^113bJgJm]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma are an understudied population but account for considerable asthma morbidity, mortality, and costs. The Epidemiology and Natural History of Asthma: Outcomes and Treatment Regimens (TENOR) study was a large, 3-year, multicenter, observational cohort study of 4756 patients (n = 3489 adults ≥ 18 years of age, n = 497 adolescents 13–17 years of age, and n = 770 children 6–12 years of age) with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma. TENOR's primary objective was to characterize the natural history of disease in this cohort. Data assessed semiannually and annually included demographics, medical history, comorbidities, asthma control, asthma-related health care use, medication use, lung function, IgE levels, self-reported asthma triggers, and asthma-related quality of life. We highlight the key findings and clinical implications from more than 25 peer-reviewed TENOR publications. Regardless of age, patients with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma demonstrated high rates of health care use and substantial asthma burden despite receiving multiple long-term controller medications. Recent exacerbation history was the strongest predictor of future asthma exacerbations. Uncontrolled asthma, as defined by the 2007 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guidelines' impairment domain, was highly prevalent and predictive of future asthma exacerbations; this assessment can be used to identify high-risk patients. IgE and allergen sensitization played a role in the majority of severe or difficult-to-treat asthmatic patients.

Patient perspective on mild asthma highlights needs and definitional features: patients and caregivers agreed more research is needed; symptom thresholds were viewed as important to defining mild disease; there was consensus that mild asthma should not involve high healthcare use, high symptom burden, or high medication need; and daily maintenance medication use was generally seen as indicating moderate or severe asthma. Patients also noted challenges defining mild asthma when background inhaler use is present and difficulty comparing patients on maintenance therapy with those who are treatment naive.

Key Points for Practice
- As-needed SABA therapy alone is not recommended because of severe exacerbations and mortality risks.
- As-needed use of a low-dose ICS/formoterol combination is preferred in adolescents and adults with mild asthma.
- As-needed use of a low-dose ICS and a SABA is preferred in children six to 11 years of age with mild asthma. Treatment Asthma severity is defined by the treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations. Well-controlled asthma involves daytime symptoms or as-needed medication use twice a week or less, no activity limitation, and no waking with symptoms. Severity is assessed after several months of regular controller treatment. Mild: Asthma is well controlled with step 1 or 2 treatment. Moderate: Asthma is well controlled with step 3 treatment. Severe: Step 4 or 5 treatment is required to control symptoms, or symptoms are uncontrolled despite this treatment.

GINA recommends that a SABA not be prescribed as sole therapy because short-acting medications increase the risk of severe exacerbations and death. Adding an ICS daily or as needed reduces this risk. GINA also recommends using the lowest dose of ICS tolerated, including reducing the corticosteroid dose after symptoms are controlled. Clinicians should check inhaler adherence and treat any modifiable risk factors before considering a step up in treatment. A step down should be considered if asthma has been controlled for three months. STEP 5 Patients with persistent and severe symptoms despite optimal use of step 4 treatments should be referred for allergist evaluation and consideration of add-on treatments. These additional treatments include high-dose ICS/LABA, tiotropium, azithromycin, anti-immunoglobulin E, anti-interleukin-5/5R, anti-interleukin-4R alpha, sputum-guided treatment, bronchial thermoplasty, and low-dose oral corticosteroids.

Adverse effects and the risk of antibiotic resistance should be taken into account when considering these treatments. A subsequent study demonstrated that as-needed combination therapy reduced severe exacerbations in mild and moderate asthma, which was highlighted as a POEM in AFP. These data, with evidence of increased severe exacerbations and mortality with as-needed albuterol alone, resulted in these dramatic changes in treatment recommendations for mild to moderate asthma. — Michael J.

### Traditional therapies for severe asthma [^117Pc8FZ]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Severe asthma is a complex and heterogeneous disease. The European Respiratory Society and American Thoracic Society guidelines define severe asthma for patients 6 years or older as "asthma which requires treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids… plus a second controller or systemic corticosteroids to prevent it from becoming 'uncontrolled' or which remains 'uncontrolled' despite this therapy". This article reviews available traditional therapies, data behind their uses in severe asthma, and varying recommendations. As various asthma endotypes and phenotypes are better understood and characterized, targeted therapies should help improve disease outcomes, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness.

### Novel potential treatable traits in asthma: where is the research taking us? [^111hpxsR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2022). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a complex, heterogeneous disease with variable clinical manifestations. Patients with common clinical, biologic, and physiologic characteristics (phenotypes) are grouped together to guide diagnosis, therapy, and management of asthma. However, patients within a given phenotype can show heterogeneity of disease severity and response to therapy, prompting the need for more specific disease classifications. Recently, the term endotype has been introduced to define patients with asthma by distinct genetic or molecular mechanisms underlying asthma pathology. Approaches based on endotypes and phenotypes have been proposed to optimally manage patients with asthma.

Classifying patients into phenotypes and endotypes can direct treatment toward targeting specific pathophysiologic pathways that may be dysregulated in a given phenotype or endotype. For example, asthma has been broadly split into 2 distinct phenotypes according to the degree of type 2 inflammation: type 2 and non–type 2 asthma. Of these 2 phenotypes, type 2 asthma is the better understood and more easily identifiable in patients: eosinophilic inflammation and IgE synthesis both play a key role. Non–type 2 asthma is less easily defined and may comprise several subpopulations (distinct phenotypes and endotypes) of patients with non–type 2 asthma. However, because of the heterogeneity found in asthma, there are also likely to be patients whose asthma is driven by both type 2 and non–type 2 inflammatory mechanisms. Specific mechanisms may contribute to severe asthma in certain patients who do not respond to therapies targeting type 2 asthma alone. A greater understanding of the phenotypes and endotypes involved in asthma pathology will help to identify patients who are more to likely benefit from established or novel or emerging targeted therapies.

### Optimizing care for children with difficult-to-treat and severe asthma through specialist paediatric asthma centres: expert practical experience and advice [^112p2xuQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This project convened northern European specialists in managing children with severe and difficult-to-treat asthma. While rare, these patients carry a substantial treatment burden. The advent of biologic treatment has provided much-needed treatment, but questions remain unanswered about the practicalities of optimal clinical management. As a result of this project, we have agreed a framework of practical advice to optimize the care of children with difficult-to-treat and severe asthma. We encourage clinicians and policymakers to implement this practical advice to enhance patient care.

Key suggestions

Our experts' key recommendations centre on three facets, which are summarized in Fig. 10 for quick reference: 1) early detection of asthma in children presenting with wheezing and/or dyspnoea is vital and the threshold for referral from primary to specialist care should be low; 2) children who may need biologics should be managed by specialist paediatric asthma centres, for which we have defined facilities, staff and responsibilities; and 3) shared decision-making and inter-setting communication is vital at all stages of the patient journey, up to and including transition to adult services.
