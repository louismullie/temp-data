## Question

H Pylori treatment and dosing and supportive care and plan

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a step-by-step plan for H. pylori treatment, including dosing and supportive care, aligned with ACG 2024, AGA 2021, and the Toronto Consensus guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming active infection and the timing/method of testing. Then, I should verify antibiotic exposure, allergy history, and local resistance patterns. Next, I will select an appropriate first-line regimen with correct dosing and duration, followed by adherence support and drug–drug interaction checks. After that, I must ensure test-of-cure timing and modality. If eradication fails, I will review adherence, avoid reusing resistance-prone antibiotics, consider susceptibility testing, and choose a rational second-line option. Finally, I will address refractory scenarios and special populations, and close with systems-based documentation and key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis approach and avoid premature treatment decisions. Active H. pylori infection should be verified by urea breath test or monoclonal fecal antigen testing in nonendoscopic settings, or by biopsy-based methods when endoscopy is performed, and serology alone should not be used to confirm active infection; for post-treatment confirmation, a test-of-cure is required at least 4 weeks after antibiotics and after withholding PPIs/PCABs for at least 2 weeks to reduce false negatives, with urea breath test preferred or fecal antigen as an alternative, and biopsy-based tests reserved if endoscopy is done for other reasons [^115gTief] [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the key history elements before I pick a regimen. I need to check for a true penicillin allergy, document prior macrolide, fluoroquinolone, and nitroimidazole exposures because they predict resistance and failure, and capture any prior H. pylori regimens and adherence challenges that could drive selection and optimization of therapy, noting that prior macrolide use strongly predicts clarithromycin resistance and treatment failure with clarithromycin triple therapy, and that structured adherence support improves success rates during therapy [^114XKMpk] [^114v7RjY].

> Hold on, I should verify local resistance patterns to avoid obsolete empiric choices. Clarithromycin resistance exceeds the 15% threshold in most US/European regions, with a large contemporary dataset showing 22.2% clarithromycin and 69.2% metronidazole resistance, while amoxicillin resistance remains low, so empiric clarithromycin-based triple therapy should generally be avoided unless susceptibility is proven [^113GGqFZ] [^112jtYX7].

> Now, for first-line therapy, let me consider the preferred options and confirm dosing and duration. Vonoprazan–amoxicillin dual therapy for 14 days is recommended for treatment-naïve patients without penicillin allergy, with vonoprazan 20 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1,000 mg three times daily, offering high efficacy with a simpler regimen and avoiding clarithromycin and metronidazole in high-resistance settings [^111qHmtk].

> Next, I should review bismuth quadruple therapy as a robust alternative, especially with penicillin allergy or prior macrolide/fluoroquinolone exposure. Optimized bismuth quadruple therapy for 14 days includes a standard-dose PPI twice daily, bismuth subcitrate 120–300 mg four times daily or subsalicylate 300 mg four times daily, tetracycline 500 mg four times daily, and metronidazole 500 mg three to four times daily, with higher divided metronidazole dosing when used with bismuth improving outcomes even in the setting of in vitro metronidazole resistance [^114qTnSw] [^115Y1miA].

> Let me think about rifabutin-based triple therapy as an additional first-line option and make sure I get the formulation right. I initially noted "omeprazole 10 mg TID, amoxicillin 250 mg TID, rifabutin 12.5 mg TID", but wait, let me verify the actual dosing used in the fixed-dose combination: the approved regimen is a fixed-dose product taken as 4 capsules three times daily, which equals omeprazole 40 mg, amoxicillin 1,000 mg, and rifabutin 50 mg per dose for 14 days; this aligns with ACG 2024 acknowledging rifabutin triple therapy as a first-line consideration in select patients, with hematologic monitoring as clinically indicated [^1123Scvr].

> But hold on, I should not jump to recommending any clarithromycin regimen empirically. Clarithromycin triple therapy should only be used when there is documented clarithromycin susceptibility and no prior macrolide exposure; although PCAB-based clarithromycin triple therapy outperforms PPI-based triple when such a triple is chosen, ACG 2024 still recommends avoiding clarithromycin and levofloxacin regimens empirically unless susceptibility is demonstrated, given high resistance prevalence in many regions [^112jtYX7] [^116Yecyq] [^112ALcFZ].

> I need to ensure adherence optimization and supportive care are addressed up front. Let me review side-effect counseling, pill burden strategies, and interaction precautions, including avoiding alcohol with metronidazole, using reminders or smartphone tools to bolster adherence, and maintaining potent acid suppression to optimize amoxicillin time over MIC; these steps materially improve eradication odds and reduce early discontinuation [^114v7RjY] [^11555XqZ].

> Next, I should review the test-of-cure plan and the timing carefully. I will confirm eradication at least 4 weeks after completing antibiotics and at least 2 weeks off PPIs/PCABs, using a urea breath test as first choice or a monoclonal fecal antigen test if breath testing is unavailable, documenting cure in the medical record for all treated patients per ACG 2024 [^115gTief].

> If eradication fails, I need to double-check adherence and prior antibiotics before choosing a second-line regimen. I should avoid reusing clarithromycin or levofloxacin if already used, consider culture or molecular susceptibility testing when available, and then choose among rifabutin triple therapy, levofloxacin triple therapy only if susceptibility is known and local resistance is low, high-dose dual PPI–amoxicillin therapy, or validated tetracycline–levofloxacin bismuth quadruple rescue, tailoring to prior exposures and regional patterns to keep per-protocol eradication rates above 85–90% when possible [^1123Scvr] [^113MogdL] [^117YDZDr] [^115e74Cq].

> For refractory disease after two or more failures, I should verify that susceptibility-guided strategies are considered. Culture-based susceptibility-guided therapy achieves high eradication in refractory cohorts and should be pursued when feasible, and when not feasible, high-dose dual therapy can be noninferior to susceptibility-guided approaches in selected settings; I need to balance practicality, access, and patient preference through shared decision-making [^1174FczJ] [^111HEmN4] [^115x3zho].

> Let me reconsider special populations and constraints so I do not overlook safety. In true penicillin anaphylaxis, optimized bismuth quadruple therapy is the principal option; in pregnancy, treatment is often deferred postpartum when possible, and bismuth, tetracycline, and fluoroquinolones should be avoided, with any urgent treatment individualized around safety constraints and shared decision-making using guideline-concordant regimens [^114qTnSw] [^111BpyUH].

> Finally, I should confirm systems-based steps and documentation, since resistance surveillance and practice feedback loops matter. I will record eradication outcomes, contribute to local resistance monitoring when possible, and align empiric choices with contemporary regional data to avoid clarithromycin or levofloxacin exposure that drives resistance amplification and retreatment, consistent with cross-guideline reconciliations in the era of rising antimicrobial resistance [^115e74Cq] [^111qHmtk].

> To synthesize, I need to ensure 14-day regimens, avoid empiric clarithromycin or levofloxacin in high-resistance settings, prefer vonoprazan–amoxicillin dual therapy or optimized bismuth quadruple first-line, require test-of-cure in all patients, and escalate to rifabutin-based, susceptibility-informed, or validated rescue regimens if needed, always rechecking adherence and prior exposures before committing to the next course to maintain cure rates above 90% whenever feasible [^111qHmtk] [^114qTnSw] [^113GGqFZ] [^115gTief].

For H. pylori, use **bismuth quadruple therapy** [^114qTnSw] (PPI BID, bismuth 120–300 mg QID, tetracycline 500 mg QID, metronidazole 500 mg TID/QID) for 14 days as first-line, or **vonoprazan-based regimens** [^111qHmtk] if available. Avoid **clarithromycin or levofloxacin regimens** without confirmed susceptibility [^113GGqFZ] [^112jtYX7]. Confirm eradication with **urea breath or stool antigen testing** [^115gTief] ≥ 4 weeks after therapy. Provide supportive care with PPIs, probiotics [^111Ywfqj], and adherence counseling [^114v7RjY]; if first-line fails, use rifabutin triple [^1123Scvr] or levofloxacin triple [^113MogdL] based on susceptibility.

### Update on the first-line treatment of infection in areas with high and low clarithromycin resistances [^112cwqnv]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022).

International consensuses on Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy recommend that only regimens that reliably produce eradication rates of ⩾90% should be used for empirical treatment. The Real-World Practice & Expectation of Asia-Pacific Physicians and Patients in Helicobacter Pylori Eradication Survey also showed that the accepted minimal eradication rate in H. pylori-infected patients was 91%.

According to efficacy prediction models, the per-protocol eradication rates of 7-day and 14-day standard triple therapies fall below 90% when clarithromycin resistance rate is ⩾5%. Several strategies, including bismuth-containing and non-bismuth-containing quadruple therapies (including sequential, concomitant, hybrid, and reverse hybrid therapies), high-dose dual therapy, and vonoprazan-based triple therapy, have been proposed to increase the eradication rate of H. pylori infection. According to efficacy prediction models, the eradication rates of 14-day concomitant therapy, 14-day hybrid therapy, and 7-day vonoprazan-based triple therapy are less than 90% if the frequency of clarithromycin-resistant strains is higher than 90%, 58%, and 23%, respectively.

To meet the recommendations of the consensus report and patients' expectations, local surveillance networks for resistance of H. pylori to clarithromycin are required to select appropriate eradication regimens in each geographic region. In areas with low (< 5%) clarithromycin resistance, such as Sweden, the Philippines, Myanmar, and Bhutan, 7-day and 14-day standard triple therapies can be adopted for the first-line treatment of H. pylori infection.

### Rates of antimicrobial resistance in Helicobacter pylori isolates from clinical trial patients across the US and Europe [^113GGqFZ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Guidelines recommend that proton pump inhibitor-based triple regimens with clarithromycin not be used for Helicobacter pylori infection in areas where clarithromycin resistance is ≥ 15%, or in patients with prior macrolide use. Up-to-date information on local resistance patterns is limited, especially in the US. Here, we report resistance rates to antibiotics commonly used to treat H. pylori from a large study conducted in the US and Europe (pHalcon-HP).

- **Methods**: Gastric mucosal biopsies were collected from adult participants with H. pylori infection during screening. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined via agar dilution for clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole, with breakpoints ≥ 1 μg/mL, > 0.125 μg/mL, and > 8 μg/mL, respectively. Resistance rates were obtained for the US and Europe and also for US subregions and participating European countries.

- **Results**: Resistance rates were established in isolates from 907 participants. Overall, 22.2% were resistant to clarithromycin, 1.2% to amoxicillin, and 69.2% to metronidazole. Resistance in the US and Europe was similar; metronidazole resistance was the most prevalent (50%-79%) and amoxicillin the least (≤ 5%). In all subregions, ≥ 15% of isolates were resistant to clarithromycin, except in the UK (0/8 isolates). Among clarithromycin-resistant isolates, 75% were also metronidazole-resistant. Two US isolates were resistant to clarithromycin and amoxicillin; one of these was also metronidazole-resistant.

- **Discussion**: The resistance rates observed in this study argue against the continued empiric use of certain regimens.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: Expert review [^116H3rrn]. Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

An algorithm for regimen considerations in refractory H. pylori cases is illustrated in Figure 2 and is based on the initial therapy used and the presence or absence of a true penicillin allergy. Of these regimens, only PBMT is FDA-approved for refractory H. pylori infection. If bismuth-based quadruple therapy failed as a first-line treatment, shared decision-making between providers and patients should guide selection between:

- **Levofloxacin- or rifabutin-based triple therapy regimens**: These should be used with a high-dose dual proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and amoxicillin.
- **An alternative bismuth-containing quadruple therapy**: This can serve as a second-line option.

Due to rising rates of levofloxacin resistance, levofloxacin should not be considered for treatment unless the H. pylori strain is known to be sensitive to it or if the population levofloxacin resistance rates are known to be less than 15%, analogous to the longstanding "rule" regarding clarithromycin usage in triple therapies. However, it is reasonable to consider rifabutin in a triple regimen without prior sensitivity testing since rifabutin and amoxicillin resistance is rare. A recent study demonstrated that the addition of rifabutin to the high-dose amoxicillin, PPI dual regimen improves eradication rates significantly. Although the referenced study used this regimen as first-line therapy, based on these data, it is reasonable to consider PAR usage with high-dose and/or high-potency PPI and amoxicillin 750mg TID over high-dose dual therapy alone.

### The Toronto consensus for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adults [^116JhQmM]. Gastroenterology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Helicobacter pylori infection, particularly in the context of treatment failure, the CAG 2016 guidelines recommend considering levofloxacin-containing therapy. This regimen consists of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), levofloxacin, and amoxicillin administered for 14 days as an option for patients who have not responded to previous H. pylori eradication therapy.

### Concomitant, bismuth quadruple, and 14-day triple therapy in the first-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori: A multicentre, open-label, randomised trial [^115ETLrT]. Lancet (2016). Low credibility.

Whether concomitant therapy is superior to bismuth quadruple therapy or 14-day triple therapy for the first-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection remains poorly understood. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of 10-day concomitant therapy, 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy, and 14-day triple therapy in the first-line treatment of H. pylori.

- **Methods**: In this multicentre, open-label, randomised trial, we recruited adult patients (aged > 20 years) with H. pylori infection from nine medical centres in Taiwan. Patients who had at least two positive tests from the rapid urease test, histology, culture, or serology or who had a single positive 13 C-urea breath test for gastric cancer screening were eligible for enrolment. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to either concomitant therapy (lansoprazole 30 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, clarithromycin 500 mg, and metronidazole 500 mg, all given twice daily) for 10 days; bismuth quadruple therapy (bismuth tripotassium dicitrate 300 mg four times a day, lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily, tetracycline 500 mg four times a day, and metronidazole 500 mg three times a day) for 10 days; or triple therapy (lansoprazole 30 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, and clarithromycin 500 mg, all given twice daily) for 14 days. A computer-generated permuted block randomisation sequence with a block size of 6 was used for randomisation, and the sequence was concealed in an opaque envelope until the intervention was assigned. Investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the eradication frequency of H. pylori with first-line therapy.

### The Toronto consensus for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adults [^116GgZ9o]. Gastroenterology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Helicobacter pylori infection, specifically concerning first-line regimens, the CAG 2016 guidelines recommend restricting the use of PPI triple therapies (proton pump inhibitor, amoxicillin/metronidazole, and clarithromycin) to areas with known low clarithromycin resistance (85%).

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: Expert review [^116ZBUFP]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

H. pylori management has become increasingly challenging due to declining eradication success rates coupled with increasing antibiotic resistance, resulting in more H. pylori infections that are now refractory to first-line therapies. Accordingly, this clinical practice update was developed to provide practitioners with practical advice on how to manage patients whose initial H. pylori treatment was unsuccessful.

When considering the major public health implications associated with persistent H. pylori infection concerning disease- and treatment-related complications and cost, there is a clear need to prioritize systematic approaches to improve rates of successful H. pylori eradication with the least number of therapeutic attempts.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: Expert review [^114HuxWv]. Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is recognized as one of the most common chronic bacterial infections worldwide, infecting approximately half of the global population. H. pylori is a World Health Organization (WHO)-designated carcinogen and the strongest known risk factor for noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma, the most prevalent form of gastric cancer. It is also causally linked to peptic ulcer disease. Even though only 1–3% of infected individuals will develop malignant complications, H. pylori accounts for 15% of the total cancer burden globally, with up to 89% of all gastric cancer attributable to H. pylori infection. Accordingly, all major gastroenterological societies recommend that H. pylori be eradicated in individuals who test positive.

Downstream consequences of failed treatment include clinical complications related to persistent H. pylori infection and repeated exposure to antibiotics and high-dose acid suppression, generation of antibiotic resistance in H. pylori and other organisms, as well as the associated direct and indirect costs to the healthcare system. Because the likelihood of successful eradication decreases with each subsequent therapeutic attempt, every effort should be made to address factors that might contribute to eradication failure.

Several guidelines exist to help providers choose regimens to eradicate H. pylori on the first attempt; they also include advice on management after initial treatments fail. However, these guidelines are backed by limited high-quality evidence. In general, they rely heavily on trials conducted.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: Expert review [^116Rqvzv]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Helicobacter pylori infection, particularly concerning the management of treatment failure and choice of regimen, AGA 2021 guidelines recommend avoiding clarithromycin- or levofloxacin-based regimens. This is especially important if there is a history of any treatment with macrolides or fluoroquinolones, given the high likelihood of resistance.

### Second-line rescue therapy of Helicobacter pylori infection [^115QYXQw]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection is the main known cause of gastritis, gastroduodenal ulcer disease, and gastric cancer. After more than 20 years of experience in H. pylori treatment, however, the ideal regimen to treat this infection has still to be found. Nowadays, apart from having to know well first-line eradication regimens, we must also be prepared to face treatment failures. Therefore, in designing a treatment strategy, we should not focus on the results of primary therapy alone, but also on the final (overall) eradication rate.

The choice of a 'rescue' treatment depends on which treatment is used initially. If a first-line clarithromycin-based regimen was used, a second-line metronidazole-based treatment (quadruple therapy) may be used afterwards, and then a levofloxacin-based combination would be a third-line 'rescue' option. Alternatively, it has recently been suggested that levofloxacin-based 'rescue' therapy constitutes an encouraging second-line strategy, representing an alternative to quadruple therapy in patients with previous PPI-clarithromycin-amoxicillin failure, with the advantage of efficacy, simplicity, and safety. In this case, the quadruple regimen may be reserved as a third-line 'rescue' option.

Finally, rifabutin-based 'rescue' therapy constitutes an encouraging empirical fourth-line strategy after multiple previous eradication failures with key antibiotics such as amoxicillin, clarithromycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, and levofloxacin. Even after two consecutive failures, several studies have demonstrated that H. pylori eradication can finally be achieved.

### Helicobacter pylori: Consensus and controversy [^116KLBsF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is uniquely adapted to colonize the human stomach. Infection leads to a range of subclinical and clinical outcomes that depend on the properties of the infecting strain, the host, and the environment. Eradication therapy is indicated for infected persons who develop peptic ulcer disease or gastric lymphoma or who are beginning long-term treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, treatment may worsen gastroesophageal reflux disease and increase the risk of esophageal cancer. H. pylori infections can be diagnosed noninvasively and can be eradicated with approximately 85% success by a variety of multidrug, 7–14-day regimens. Unfortunately, antibiotic resistance is affecting treatment effectiveness in the United States and abroad. A more complete understanding of the variation in H. pylori pathogenesis should lead to clearer recommendations about treatment for infected persons who have neither peptic ulcer disease nor gastric lymphoma.

### ACG clinical guideline: Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^1136Km5b]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for Helicobacter pylori infection, specifically in the context of managing treatment failure and regimen choice, the ACG 2024 guidelines recommend considering the administration of PPI or potassium-competitive acid blocker-clarithromycin triple therapy in treatment-experienced patients with persistent H. pylori infection confirmed to be clarithromycin-sensitive.

### Optimum duration of regimens for Helicobacter pylori eradication [^116VE7dV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

The optimal duration for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication therapy is controversial, with recommendations ranging from 7 to 14 days. Several systematic reviews have attempted to address this issue, but they have given conflicting results and limited their analysis to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and two antibiotic (PPI triple) therapies. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the optimal duration of multiple H. pylori eradication regimens.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to assess the relative effectiveness of different durations (7, 10, or 14 days) of a variety of regimens for eradicating H. pylori. The primary outcome was H. pylori persistence, and the secondary outcome was adverse events.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched up to December 2011 to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We also searched the proceedings of six conferences from 1995 to 2011, dissertations, theses, and grey literature. There were no language restrictions applied to any search.

- **Selection criteria**: Only parallel group RCTs assessing the efficacy of one to two weeks duration of first-line H. pylori eradication regimens in adults were eligible. Within each regimen, the same combinations of drugs at the same dose were compared over different durations. Studies with at least two arms comparing 7, 10, or 14 days were eligible. Enrolled participants needed to be diagnosed with at least one positive test for H. pylori on the basis of a rapid urease test (RUT), histology, culture, or urea breath test.

Nonadherence

The level of adherence to therapy above which there is negligible incremental benefit for eradication success in refractory H. pylori is not known; however, studies demonstrate that adherence to > 60% to > 90% of the prescribed course might be sufficient for successful eradication, at least in primary H. pylori infection. The threshold likely varies depending on individual factors and might plausibly be higher for refractory H. pylori. Before prescribing therapy, barriers to adherence should be explored and addressed, and the regimen thoroughly discussed. Common barriers include the complexity of eradication regimens, associated high pill burden, physical intolerance of medications, poor provider communication, and an overall lack of understanding of why therapy is indicated. Based on these considerations, providers who treat H. pylori infection should provide their patients with anticipatory guidance to help ensure maximum adherence. This specifically includes explaining the rationale for therapy, dosing instructions, expected adverse events, and the importance of completing the full therapeutic course.

Recently, two large RCTs from China demonstrated that the use of an interactive smartphone medical application and text-based reminders during treatment improved adherence to primary therapy. These adjunctive systems are worthy of further investigation in the US for refractory H. pylori infection. They could provide insights into which approaches might be more effective in certain populations compared to others, for example, based on characteristics such as age.

### Update on the second-line treatment of infection: a narrative review [^117YDZDr]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

A standard bismuth quadruple therapy, a fluoroquinolone-containing triple (or quadruple) therapy, or a proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-amoxicillin high-dose dual therapy has been recommended as a second-line treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection by the Maastricht VI/Florence Consensus Report. The major shortcoming of levofloxacin-amoxicillin triple therapy is the low cure rate for eradicating levofloxacin-resistant strains. With the rising prevalence of levofloxacin-resistant strains, levofloxacin-amoxicillin triple therapy cannot reliably achieve a high eradication rate for second-line treatment of H. pylori infection in most countries.

This article aims to review second-line eradication regimens with a per-protocol eradication rate exceeding 85% in most geographic areas. Recently, a novel tetracycline-levofloxacin quadruple therapy consisting of a PPI, bismuth, tetracycline, and levofloxacin for the rescue treatment of H. pylori infection has been developed. The new therapy achieved a higher per-protocol eradication rate than levofloxacin-amoxicillin triple treatment in a randomized controlled trial (98% versus 69%). Additionally, the tetracycline-levofloxacin quadruple therapy also exhibits a higher eradication rate than amoxicillin-levofloxacin quadruple therapy.

High-dose dual PPI-amoxicillin therapy is another novel second-line treatment for H. pylori infection. This new therapy can achieve an eradication rate of 89% by per-protocol analysis for the second-line treatment in Taiwan. Recently, levofloxacin-based sequential quadruple therapy and potassium-comp…

### Empiric quadruple vs. triple therapy for primary treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection: Systematic review and meta-analysis of efficacy and tolerability [^115bTJFm]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Recent treatment guidelines recommend two first-line therapies for Helicobacter pylori infection: proton pump inhibitor (PPI), bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole (quadruple therapy) or PPI, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin (triple therapy). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and tolerability of these regimens as first-line treatment of H. pylori.

A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ACP Journal Club, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness, Cochrane Methodology Register, Health Technology Assessment Database, and abstracts from prominent gastrointestinal scientific meetings was carried out. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing bismuth quadruple therapy to clarithromycin triple therapy were selected for meta-analysis. Two independent reviewers extracted data, using standardized data forms. Meta-analysis was carried out with the metan command in Stata 10.1. Funnel plots and subgroup analyses were carried out.

Nine RCTs (N = 1,679) were included. Although dosing regimens of clarithromycin triple therapy were quite consistent between trials, dosing regimens varied considerably for bismuth quadruple therapy. Bismuth quadruple therapy achieved eradication in 78.3% of patients, whereas clarithromycin triple therapy achieved an eradication rate of 77.0% (risk ratio (RR) = 1.002, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.936–1.073). There was moderate heterogeneity and no evidence for significant publication bias.

### Worldwide and regional efficacy estimates of first-line Helicobacter pylori treatments: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113CTA1D]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection is challenging. We aimed to determine the optimal first-line H. pylori treatments at global and regional levels.

- **Methods**: We searched Embase, PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, Scopus, WHO ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov, and ISRCTN registry for randomized controlled trials published during 2011–2020. Utilizing a network meta-analysis in a Bayesian framework, success rates of 23 regimens were compared. The effect size was standardized risk ratio (RR) with 95% credible interval (CrI). Pooled eradication rate (ER) with 95% CrI was also reported for top combinations. The reference regimen was 7-day clarithromycin-based triple therapy.

- **Results**: This review identified 121 trials comprising 34,759 participants. Globally, 14-day levofloxacin-based sequential therapy was the most efficient (RR: 1.43; 95% CrI, 1.26–1.59) with low certainty of evidence, followed by modified bismuth-containing quadruple therapy (proton pump inhibitor + bismuth compounds + clarithromycin + amoxicillin) for 10 days (RR: 1.35; 95% CrI, 1.22–1.48) and 14 days (RR: 1.27; 95% CrI, 1.12–1.42), and 14-day hybrid therapy (RR: 1.27; 95% CrI, 1.19–1.36). The corresponding ERs were 98.7% (95% CrI, 86.9–100.0), 93.2% (95% CrI, 84.2–100.0), 87.6% (95% CrI, 82.1–93.8), and 87.6% (95% CrI, 77.3–98.0), respectively.

Continentally, the most effective combinations were: 10-day clarithromycin-based sequential therapy [(RR: 1.21; 95% CrI, 1.02–1.42), (ER: 89.5%, 95% CrI, 75.5–100.0)] for Africa, 14-day levofloxacin-based sequential therapy [(RR: 1.41; 95%CrI, 1.27–1.5).

### High-dose dual therapy culture-based susceptibility-guided therapy as a rescue regimen for infection: a randomized controlled trial [^1174FczJ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is associated with various gastrointestinal diseases, including chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and gastric adenocarcinoma. Guidelines recommend eradication of H. pylori regardless of clinical symptoms. However, the prevalence of H. pylori antibiotic resistance has increased globally. In China, pooled primary resistance rates were reported as greater than 26% for clarithromycin, 60% for metronidazole, and 28% for levofloxacin, with broad variation among different regions. These increased antibiotic resistance rates complicate the eradication of H. pylori, especially after primary treatment failure.

In consideration of the increasing rates of antibiotic resistance, it is essential to obtain individual antibiotic susceptibility data before treatment for H. pylori infection. The Maastricht V/Florence Consensus Report recommends culture-based susceptibility-guided therapy (CB-SGT) as an evidence-based rescue treatment regimen whenever possible, especially in areas with high antibiotic resistance. Research has demonstrated the effectiveness of CB-SGT. A single-arm interventional trial by Yu et al. showed that CB-SGT achieved an eradication rate of 94.5% in intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Compared with empirical treatment, CB-SGT offers the advantages of providing personalized treatment, reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, and allowing continued use of triple therapy for antibiotic-sensitive patients in areas with high antibiotic resistance.

### Helicobacter pylori eradication following first-line treatment failure in Europe: What, how and when chose among different standard regimens? A systematic review [^116jq4D5]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Cure rates following standard first-line regimens for Helicobacter pylori eradication are decreasing, necessitating two or more treatments for several patients. Antibiotic susceptibility-based therapy, as advised in guidelines, is largely impractical in clinical practice. Some 'standard' regimens, such as triple therapies based on either levofloxacin or rifabutin, bismuth-based quadruple therapies, sequential, concomitant, and hybrid therapies, were empirically used as rescue therapies. We performed a systematic review on recent studies conducted in European countries dealing with these regimens. A total of 24 studies, encompassing 3804 patients, were identified.

- **Second-line therapy**: Pylera (89.2%) and sequential therapy (92.5%) achieved significantly higher cure rates compared to all other regimens.

- **Third-line therapy**: Levofloxacin-based therapy (84.1%) and Pylera (83.6%) achieved similarly high cure rates, whereas standard bismuth-based quadruple therapy (64.1%) achieved the lowest cure rate.

- **Rescue therapy**: The success rate was close to 75% across all therapies used, with data on the rifabutin-based regimen consolidated in the larger sample size.

Overall, levofloxacin-amoxicillin triple therapy achieved higher eradication rates with the 14-day regimen compared to the 10-day regimen (87.1% vs. 72.2%; P = 0.003). Among bismuth-based therapies, Pylera achieved a significantly higher eradication rate than standard quadruple therapy (88% vs. 67%; P < 0.0001). These data suggest that a wise 'therapeutic package' following first-line therapy could include Pylera, levofloxacin-, and rifabutin-based therapy.

### First-line therapies for eradication: A critical reappraisal of updated guidelines [^117195uG]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

According to the evidence-based medicine approach, guidelines represent an undeniable advantage for the management of H. pylori infection in clinical practice. However, several factors affect the efficacy of a specific therapy regimen, including particular host-bacteria interactions, which may be unique to different geographic areas. Indeed, European guidelines clearly highlighted that the results achieved by an eradication therapy are population-specific and not directly transferable. Therefore, therapeutic aspects are more appropriately addressed in national guidelines, provided that data from national trials are considered opportunely.

The role of primary resistance is undeniably relevant, yet antimicrobial resistance in vitro does not always correlate with poor outcomes from multi-drug treatment regimens. It should be noted that all therapy regimens include a combination of antibiotics with potentially synergistic effects, which can overcome resistance to a single molecule. Unfortunately, the infection is not cured in all cases, even with the use of antibiotics with proven susceptibility, as demonstrated in bacterial culture-based studies. A meta-analysis of 12 studies found an eradication rate of 89.2% (95% CI = 87.1–91.3) in 860 patients, despite the use of therapy tailored according to susceptibility testing results. Therefore, even if primary resistance status towards clarithromycin or levofloxacin could be assessed prior to first-line therapy, using novel stool tests based on the polymerase chain reaction.

### Comparison of azithromycin and clarithromycin in triple therapy regimens for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori [^1142XPCZ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

We sought to compare an azithromycin-based regimen with an already established clarithromycin-based regimen in the eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection.

- **Methods**: A prospective, randomized, blinded comparative analysis was performed on 56 patients with upper GI symptoms who presented to the Gastroenterology Department at the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth. All patients had documented H. pylori infection on endoscopy via rapid urease test and histopathology. Patients were randomized to a treatment arm, which consisted of bismuth, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and lansoprazole (B-LAC) or one consisting of bismuth, azithromycin, amoxicillin, and lansoprazole (B-LAA). To assess eradication, patients then received repeat endoscopy at 8 weeks from entrance into the study. Rapid urease test and histopathology were again used to evaluate infection. Patients recorded all side effects. Comparison between the two groups was made using the chi-square method.

- **Results**: Of the 56 patients included in the study, 27 went on to receive B-LAC, whereas 29 received B-LAA. The per-protocol eradication rate was 84.6% with B-LAC and 55.5% with B-LAA (p = 0.021). Under intention-to-treat analysis, the eradication rates for B-LAC and B-LAA were 81% and 52%, respectively (p = 0.019). There was a significant difference between the two groups in the number of subjects using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (p = 0.013) and a trend toward a difference in histamine-2 (H2) blocker use (p = 0.066). Taking these two variables into account, a logistical regression was performed and continued.

### The Toronto consensus for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adults [^1114UCd6]. Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The Helicobacter pylori infection has become increasingly difficult to treat. The purpose of these consensus statements is to provide a review of the literature and specific, updated recommendations for eradication therapy in adults.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search identified studies on H. pylori treatment. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Statements were developed through an online platform, finalized, and voted on by an international working group of specialists chosen by the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology.

- **Results**: Due to increasing therapeutic failures, the consensus group strongly recommends that all H. pylori eradication regimens now be given for 14 days. Recommended first-line strategies include concomitant nonbismuth quadruple therapy (proton pump inhibitor [PPI] + amoxicillin + metronidazole + clarithromycin [PAMC]) and traditional bismuth quadruple therapy (PPI + bismuth + metronidazole + tetracycline [PBMT]). PPI triple therapy (PPI + clarithromycin + either amoxicillin or metronidazole) is restricted to areas with known low clarithromycin resistance or high eradication success with these regimens. Recommended rescue therapies include PBMT and levofloxacin-containing therapy (PPI + amoxicillin + levofloxacin). Rifabutin regimens should be restricted to patients who have failed to respond to at least three prior options.

- **Conclusions**: Optimal treatment of H. pylori infection requires careful attention to local factors.

### The relationship among previous antimicrobial use, antimicrobial resistance, and treatment outcomes for Helicobacter pylori infections [^114XKMpk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The relationship between previous antimicrobial treatments and infection with drug-resistant Helicobacter pylori is unknown. This study aims to determine whether previous use of antimicrobial agents predicts subsequent antibiotic resistance of H. pylori and whether resistance affects treatment outcomes.

- **Design**: Retrospective cohort analysis of adults recruited sequentially from a clinical practice.

- **Setting**: A referral hospital in Anchorage, Alaska.

- **Patients**: 125 adults infected with H. pylori.

- **Measurements**: Medical records were reviewed for antimicrobial agents prescribed in the 10 years before diagnosis with H. pylori infection. Antimicrobial susceptibility of H. pylori isolates obtained from endoscopic gastric biopsy was determined using agar dilution. Cure was determined using the urea breath test 2 months after antimicrobial treatment.

Results showed that among the 125 patients, 37 (30%) had H. pylori isolates resistant to clarithromycin and 83 (66%) had isolates resistant to metronidazole. Resistance to clarithromycin was associated with previous use of any macrolide antibiotic (P < 0.001), and resistance to metronidazole was associated with previous use of metronidazole (P < 0.001). The odds of isolates being resistant to clarithromycin increased with the number of courses of macrolides received (P < 0.001). Among 53 persons treated with clarithromycin-based regimens, treatment failed in 77% of those carrying clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori (10 of 13) and 13% of those with clarithromycin-susceptible strains.

### High-dose dual therapy is superior to standard first-line or rescue therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection [^11555XqZ]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). High credibility.

The efficacy of treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection has steadily decreased due to increasing resistance to clarithromycin, metronidazole, and levofloxacin. Resistance to amoxicillin remains generally low. A high intragastric pH enhances the efficacy of amoxicillin. Therefore, we studied whether a combination of a high-dose proton pump inhibitor and amoxicillin (dual therapy) is more effective than standard first-line or rescue therapies for eradicating H. pylori.

- **Methods**: We conducted a large-scale multihospital trial comparing the efficacy of high-dose dual therapy (HDDT) with standard therapies. The study involved treatment-naive (n = 450) and treatment-experienced (n = 168) patients with H. pylori infection. Treatment-naive patients were randomly assigned to receive HDDT (rabeprazole 20 mg and amoxicillin 750 mg four times/day for 14 days, group A1), sequential therapy for 10 days (group B1), or clarithromycin-containing triple therapy for 7 days (group C1). Treatment-experienced patients were randomly assigned to receive HDDT for 14 days (group A2), sequential therapy for 10 days (group B2), or levofloxacin-containing triple therapy for 7 days (group C2). H. pylori infection was detected using the (13)C-urea breath test, and factors associated with treatment outcomes were evaluated.

- **Results**: In the intention-to-treat analysis, H. pylori was eradicated in 95.3% of patients in group A1 (95% confidence interval, 91.9%-98.8%); 85.3% in group B1 (95% CI, 79.6%-91.1%); and 80.7% in group C1 (95% CI, 74.3%-87.1%). Infection was eradicated in 89.3% of patients in group.

### Optimized nonbismuth quadruple therapies cure most patients with Helicobacter pylori infection in populations with high rates of antibiotic resistance [^116AJvgv]. Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

Strategies to eradicate Helicobacter pylori infection could be improved by suppressing acid and extending the duration of therapy through optimization. This study compared the efficacy of two different optimized nonbismuth quadruple regimens in areas of high resistance to antimicrobial agents.

- **Methods**: We performed a prospective noninferiority multicenter trial in which 343 consecutive individuals with H. pylori infection were randomly assigned to groups. These groups received either hybrid therapy (40 mg omeprazole and 1 g amoxicillin, twice daily for 14 days; with 500 mg clarithromycin and 500 mg nitroimidazole added, twice daily for the final 7 days) or concomitant therapy (same four drugs taken concurrently, twice daily for 14 days). We assessed bacterial resistance to these drugs in a subset of patients using the E-test. Efficacy, side effects, and compliance were determined.

- **Results**: In per-protocol analysis, rates of eradication for hybrid and concomitant therapies were 92% (95% confidence interval, 87%-95%) and 96.1% (95% CI, 93%-99%), respectively (P = 0.07). In intention-to-treat analysis, the rates were 90% (95% CI, 86%-93%) and 91.7% (95% CI, 87%-95%), respectively (P = 0.35). Almost all patients (95.5%) were fully compliant. Resistance to clarithromycin was found in 23.5% of patients (Italy, 26%; Spain, 19.5%), resistance to metronidazole in 33% (Italy, 33%; Spain, 34%), and resistance to both drugs in 8.8% (Italy, 7.1%; Spain, 11.5%). Mild side effects were reported in 51.5% of patients (47% hybrid vs. 56% concomitant; p = 0.06). Compliance greater than 80% was achieved by nearly all patients.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: Expert review [^116dWfT8]. Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

There are numerous guidelines from international authorities regarding H. pylori management. Some of the most notable recent releases are listed in Table 1. Overall, the guidance for the management of refractory infection is relatively consistent among expert groups. However, it should be noted that the evidence underlying their conclusions often reflects the generally low quality and heterogeneity of clinical studies on refractory H. pylori infection.

Most trials included in meta-analyses of second-line treatment have focused on treatment after the failure of a first-line regimen with clarithromycin-based triple therapy. This regimen is now considered outdated in most regions, including the US. Despite the Maastricht expert consensus group advocating for antibiotic susceptibility testing since their first guidelines in 1997, the slow adoption of resistance testing continues globally, leading to the empiric selection of eradication therapy, particularly in the US.

Several important themes have emerged in guiding the treatment of refractory H. pylori infection. The high resistance rates to clarithromycin and levofloxacin mean that these antibiotics, or others in their classes (macrolides and fluoroquinolones, respectively), should not be used in subsequent treatment attempts. Based on the premise that secondary H. pylor

### Efficacy and safety of modified dual therapy as the first-line regimen for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113LZ16e]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is highly adapted for colonizing the human stomach and has infected nearly half of the world's population, including approximately 700 million individuals in China. H. pylori infection plays an important role in upper digestive diseases, such as gastritis, peptic ulcers, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and deadly gastric adenocarcinoma. Successful eradication of H. pylori could markedly improve the patient's symptoms, attenuate the course of these diseases, and prevent gastric cancer.

Traditional triple therapy, consisting of clarithromycin, amoxicillin (or metronidazole), and a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), has been used worldwide as the first-line regimen to eradicate H. pylori for decades, achieving eradication rates of over 90% in the 1990s. However, due to increasing resistance to antibiotics, especially clarithromycin, metronidazole, and levofloxacin, the success of clarithromycin triple therapy, as well as several alternative regimens, has rapidly declined. The Toronto Consensus has opposed the use of sequential and hybrid therapies and did not recommend levofloxacin therapy as first-line therapies.

At present, the Maastricht V/Florence Consensus, the Toronto Consensus, and the American College of Gastroenterology Clinical Guideline still all recommend clarithromycin triple therapy as one of the first-line regimens, but it is limited to areas where clarithromycin resistance is below 15%. For areas with high clarithromycin resistance, bismuth quadruple therapy and concomitant therapy (when bismuth is not available, such as in Taiwan) are favored. In China, resistance rates of…

### Update on the second-line treatment of infection: A narrative review [^113whzcP]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

A standard bismuth quadruple therapy, a fluoroquinolone-containing triple (or quadruple) therapy, or a proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-amoxicillin high-dose dual therapy has been recommended as a second-line treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection by the Maastricht VI/Florence Consensus Report. The major shortcoming of levofloxacin-amoxicillin triple therapy is its low cure rate for eradicating levofloxacin-resistant strains. With the rising prevalence of levofloxacin-resistant strains, levofloxacin-amoxicillin triple therapy cannot reliably achieve a high eradication rate for second-line treatment of H. pylori infection in most countries now.

The present article aims to review second-line eradication regimens with a per-protocol eradication rate exceeding 85% in most geographic areas. Recently, a novel tetracycline-levofloxacin quadruple therapy consisting of a PPI, bismuth, tetracycline, and levofloxacin for the rescue treatment of H. pylori infection has been developed. The new therapy achieved a higher per-protocol eradication rate than levofloxacin-amoxicillin triple treatment in a randomized controlled trial (98% versus 69%). Additionally, the tetracycline-levofloxacin quadruple therapy also exhibits a higher eradication rate than amoxicillin-levofloxacin quadruple therapy.

### Treatment of Helicobacter pylori [^1127FPYF]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

The article reviews reasons for treatment failure and introduces new concepts for Helicobacter pylori treatment.

- **Recent findings**: Several new treatment options or modifications of already established regimens have been introduced to overcome treatment failure. Antibiotic resistance to H. pylori is the key factor for treatment failure. Currently, standard triple therapy is the primary choice in regions with low clarithromycin resistance rates. In areas with high clarithromycin resistance, four drug treatment regimens, including quadruple and sequential therapy, have shown the best results as first-line regimens. The options for second-line treatment regimens are diverse, and such regimens need to be accurately adapted to local resistance rates.

- **Summary**: Treatment of H. pylori infection faces a dramatic fall in eradication rates globally. Newer regimens, including sequential and quadruple therapies, provide promising results. However, understanding local resistance rates remains crucial for effective therapy.

### Helicobacter pylori: diagnosis and treatment [^111HNDXs]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Multiple diagnostic methods and treatment strategies have been developed to detect and treat the Helicobacter pylori infection. Many of them have stood the test of time; others lost their value with the introduction of new test and treatment modalities. This review focuses on the diagnostic methods and their clinical implications, as well as on established and novel treatment strategies.

- **Recent findings**: The increasing antimicrobial resistance has resulted in a decline in the success rate of recommended eradication regimens. The guidelines recommend as first-line treatment clarithromycin, amoxicillin or metronidazole, and proton pump inhibitor twice daily, but recent studies have demonstrated an increasing eradication failure with these regimens. Several treatment modifications have been adopted regarding duration and combination of substances.

- **Summary**: The currently recommended first-line treatments are effective and well tolerated. In areas with high antimicrobial resistance rates, new antibiotic combinations and modifications in the sequence of drug administration are proposed as alternative treatment options to standard triple therapy. Future treatment strategies have to focus on regional antimicrobial resistance-adopted treatment selection and the development of new antibiotics.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: Expert review [^117BMfs9]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Failure to eradicate *H. pylori* results from the complex interaction of host-, microbial-, and systems-related factors. Antibiotic resistance (microbial and systems) and patient nonadherence (host and systems) are the two most commonly cited reasons for eradication failure. However, primary eradication failure still occurs despite confirmed antibiotic sensitivity and patient adherence, potentially with higher frequency in refractory *H. pylori*, specifically. Additional factors are likely also relevant.

Providers should attempt to identify all contributing etiologies before simply prescribing alternative antibiotics. These factors, along with antibiotic resistance and nonadherence, are described herein.

### Reconciliation of recent Helicobacter pylori treatment guidelines in a time of increasing resistance to antibiotics [^115e74Cq]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Increasing resistance to antibiotics worldwide adversely affects the effectiveness of standard therapies to eradicate Helicobacter pylori infection. We reviewed guidelines developed by expert groups in Europe, Canada, and the United States for the treatment of H. pylori infection. We compared and reconciled the recommendations of these guidelines, addressing the increasing resistance of H. pylori to antibiotic therapy regimens.

- **Guidelines recommendations**: The guidelines recommend bismuth quadruple therapy for first-line treatment, replacing clarithromycin-based triple therapy. There is consensus for concomitant 4-drug therapy as an alternative, especially when bismuth is not available.

- **Therapy failure and resistance**: When therapy is unsuccessful, it is likely due to resistance to clarithromycin, levofloxacin, and/or metronidazole; these drugs, if used previously, should be avoided in subsequent eradication attempts. Second-line therapies should be bismuth quadruple therapy or levofloxacin triple therapy, depending on suspected resistance, reserving rifabutin-based triple and high-dose dual amoxicillin proton pump inhibitor therapy for subsequent treatment attempts.

- **Need for susceptibility tests**: The increasing resistance of H. pylori to antibiotic therapy necessitates the local availability of susceptibility tests for individuals and the establishment of regional and national monitoring programs. This would help develop evidence-based, locally relevant eradication strategies. Further studies into the development of more easily accessible methods of resistance testing, such as biomarker analysis of stool samples, are required. Options under investigation include substituting von…

The best treatment approach to H. pylori appears to be moving rapidly towards treatments based on national consensus, tailored for each country. In cases where local information is inadequate, the guidelines of a neighboring country or a continental consensus could serve as a tutorial guide, providing essential information on effective strategies in relation to antibiotic resistance.

### Update on the second-line treatment of infection: a narrative review [^113CHRYF]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Treatment algorithms for the second-line therapy of H. pylori infection are crucial in understanding the approach to eradication. With the rising prevalence of levofloxacin resistance, the eradication rate of levofloxacin-amoxicillin triple therapy cannot reliably exceed an eradication rate of 85% for second-line treatment of H. pylori infection in most countries. Approaches such as standard bismuth quadruple therapy, tetracycline-levofloxacin quadruple therapy, levofloxacin-based sequential quadruple therapy, amoxicillin-levofloxacin quadruple therapy, and high-dose dual therapy can maintain a high eradication rate, even in the era of high levofloxacin resistance. Therefore, it is reasonable to recommend these five rescue treatments after the failure of clarithromycin-containing triple therapy or non-bismuth quadruple therapy. For patients with H. pylori infection who experience treatment failure with bismuth quadruple therapy, the use of tetracycline-levofloxacin quadruple therapy, levofloxacin-based sequential quadruple therapy, amoxicillin-levofloxacin quadruple therapy, and high-dose dual therapy can be recommended as rescue treatments for H. pylori infection.

### Non-antibiotic therapies for Helicobacter pylori infection [^111Ywfqj]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Despite years of experience with Helicobacter pylori treatment, the ideal regimen for treating the infection has not been found. The most effective eradication treatment is the combination of a proton pump inhibitor with antibiotics, but 10–20% of the patients fail to obtain eradication of the infection. Antibiotic resistance is a major factor affecting the outcome of treatment. Non-antibiotic therapies, including phytomedicines, probiotics, and antioxidants, have been increasingly investigated as potential alternatives for the treatment of H. pylori. In this article, we review the non-antibiotic therapies for H. pylori infection.

### Helicobacter pylori infection: Treatment [^116PwBdL]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Standard treatment regimens for Helicobacter pylori infection provide eradication rates of 80 to 90%. These rates have been achieved with various 1-week triple therapies using two antibiotics and an acid suppressant.

Antibiotic resistance, which may develop during failed treatment, is becoming increasingly common and has led to studies of new regimens for primary therapy and new strategies for the salvage of failed therapy. Other regimens have been designed and tested to decrease the cost of initial therapy or improve compliance; however, abbreviated regimens have a high incidence of failure and may contribute to the problem of resistance.

Increasing attention has been paid to the need for, and timing of, the determination of antibiotic resistance of H. pylori isolates, either at the time of initial diagnosis or after treatment failure. New, simpler, and noninvasive methods are offered for follow-up to determine if eradication has been successful.

Treatment regimens should be chosen based on local drug susceptibility patterns and the availability of approved therapeutic agents in each country. Established indications for testing for H. pylori and administering therapy include active or inactive peptic ulcer disease, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, hyperplastic polyps, hyperplastic gastropathy, postendoscopic resection for gastric malignancy, and acute H. pylori gastritis. It is now largely accepted that non-investigated dyspepsia is an indication for testing for and treating H. pylori, although dyspeptic symptoms shown not to be associated remain a subject of debate.

### The Toronto consensus for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adults [^112ALcFZ]. Gastroenterology (2016). High credibility.

In the context of medical management for Helicobacter pylori infection and specifically regarding first-line regimens, the CAG 2016 guidelines recommend avoiding the following regimens as first-line therapy:

- **Sequential non-bismuth quadruple therapy**: PPI and amoxicillin followed by PPI, metronidazole, and clarithromycin.

- **Levofloxacin triple therapy**: PPI, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin.

### Best treatment approach: Should a national consensus be the best consensus [^114F7fTP]? Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

A significant number of national and international consensuses have been published in the literature during recent years concerning the treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). These guidelines are aimed toward achieving an extremely high cure rate (≥ 90%), which seems to be unachievable in real-world settings, especially in areas with high clarithromycin resistance, such as southern Europe. Times change quickly and, as with other infectious diseases, we are moving inevitably from a trial-and-error therapeutic approach to a susceptibility-based one. Empirical first-line treatments should be based on what works best in each geographical and/or national area and must take into account the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in each region.

We have reviewed the basic conclusive suggestions from the existing guidelines and consensuses worldwide concerning the best anti-H. pylori treatment approach in relation to antibiotic resistance. According to this global plethora of recommendations, it is worth remembering that the determinants of successful H. pylori eradication could be divided into host-related (e.g. previous antibiotic exposure, patient's adherence to a multi-drug regimen and/or genetic factors) and H. pylori-related factors, with antibiotic sensitivity appearing to be the most important and consistent predictor of success, both in clinical trials and in population-based studies of H. pylori eradication. Thus, it is of major importance for a country's clinical practitioners to know the local pattern of resistance.

### Update on the diagnosis and management of Helicobacter pylori infection in adults [^115QVTSa]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection is becoming increasingly challenging due largely to the rising rates of antimicrobial resistance and the relative complexity of treatment regimens. If a reliable test to assess the antimicrobial sensitivity/resistance of H. pylori were readily available, treatment would be more focused and, presumably, more effective. However, antimicrobial sensitivity testing is difficult to obtain in most parts of the United States. Therefore, physicians must rely on clinical judgment in selecting treatment regimens for their infected patients. The aims of this review are to summarize recent treatment recommendations and to examine available evidence for how we might improve our treatment selections. Information in this review is directed primarily toward physicians practicing in the United States.

### American College of Gastroenterology guideline on the management of Helicobacter pylori infection [^1163U1jf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) remains a prevalent, worldwide, chronic infection. Though the prevalence of this infection appears to be decreasing in many parts of the world, H. pylori remains an important factor linked to the development of peptic ulcer disease, gastric malignancy, and dyspeptic symptoms. Whether to test for H. pylori in patients with functional dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), those taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with iron deficiency anemia, or who are at greater risk of developing gastric cancer remains controversial.

H. pylori can be diagnosed by endoscopic or nonendoscopic methods. A variety of factors including the need for endoscopy, pretest probability of infection, local availability, and an understanding of the performance characteristics and cost of the individual tests influences choice of evaluation in a given patient. Testing to prove eradication should be performed in patients who receive treatment of H. pylori for peptic ulcer disease, individuals with persistent dyspeptic symptoms despite the test-and-treat strategy, those with H. pylori-associated MALT lymphoma, and individuals who have undergone resection of early gastric cancer.

Recent studies suggest that eradication rates achieved by first-line treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), clarithromycin, and amoxicillin have decreased to 70–85%, in part due to increasing clarithromycin resistance. Eradication rates may also be lower with 7 versus 14-day regimens. Bismuth-containing quadruple regimens for 7–14 days are another first-line treatment option.

### High-dose dual therapy culture-based susceptibility-guided therapy as a rescue regimen for infection: A randomized controlled trial [^111HEmN4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Although the Maastricht VI/Florence consensus report recommended high-dose proton pump inhibitor-amoxicillin dual therapy as a possible rescue therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection, clinical evidence of its efficacy was lacking.

- **Objectives**: To compare the efficacy, safety, patient compliance, and cost between high-dose dual therapy (HDDT) and culture-based susceptibility-guided therapy (CB-SGT) as a rescue regimen for H. pylori infection.

- **Design**: A single-center, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial.

- **Methods**: In all, 146 patients with a history of eradication failure were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive HDDT or CB-SGT. HDDT consisted of esomeprazole 20 mg and amoxicillin 750 mg, both given four times per day (qid). CB-SGT consisted of esomeprazole 20 mg twice daily (bid), amoxicillin 1000 mg bid plus clarithromycin 500 mg bid, metronidazole 400 mg bid, or levofloxacin 500 mg daily (qd) for sensitive patients, in that order. For patients with triple resistance, a bismuth-containing regimen with a high dose of metronidazole was chosen, including esomeprazole 20 mg bid, bismuth 220 mg bid, amoxicillin 1000 mg bid, and metronidazole 400 mg qid. All regimens were given for 14 days.

- **Results**: The eradication rates of H. pylori achieved with HDDT in the intention-to-treat (ITT), per-protocol, and modified ITT analyses were all 84.9% [62/73, 95% confidence interval (CI): 76.5–93.9%], compared with 83.6% (61/73, 95% CI: 74.9–92.3%), 84.7% (61/72, 95% CI: 76.2–93.2%), and 84.7% (61/72, 95% CI: 76.2–93.2%) with CB-SGT, respectively.

### High-dose dual therapy culture-based susceptibility-guided therapy as a rescue regimen for infection: A randomized controlled trial [^116kYy48]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Although the Maastricht VI/Florence consensus report recommended high-dose proton pump inhibitor–amoxicillin dual therapy as a possible rescue therapy for *Helicobacter pylori* infection, clinical evidence of its efficacy was lacking.

- **Objectives**: To compare the efficacy, safety, patient compliance, and cost between high-dose dual therapy (HDDT) and culture-based susceptibility-guided therapy (CB-SGT) as a rescue regimen for *H. pylori* infection.

- **Design**: A single-center, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial.

- **Methods**: In all, 146 patients with a history of eradication failure were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive HDDT or CB-SGT. HDDT consisted of esomeprazole 20 mg and amoxicillin 750 mg, both given four times per day (qid). CB-SGT consisted of esomeprazole 20 mg twice daily (bid), amoxicillin 1000 mg bid plus clarithromycin 500 mg bid, metronidazole 400 mg bid, or levofloxacin 500 mg daily (qd) for sensitive patients, in that order. For patients with triple resistance, a bismuth-containing regimen with a high dose of metronidazole was chosen, including esomeprazole 20 mg bid, bismuth 220 mg bid, amoxicillin 1000 mg bid, and metronidazole 400 mg qid. All regimens were given for 14 days.

### Treatment of Helicobacter pylori [^113ib2dw]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori causes several gastroduodenal diseases. Various antibiotic regimens are available that eradicate H. pylori in 80 to 90% of patients, but no regimen cures all patients. Dual therapy is now obsolete. Triple therapy, consisting of two antibiotics and either a proton pump inhibitor or bismuth, is the regimen of choice. Metronidazole and clarithromycin are the two key antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance against these two drugs is becoming more problematic and should be taken into consideration when choosing a regimen. Antibiotic resistance is usually induced after failure.

Quadruple therapy has been used as a salvage regimen in failed cases, but it is also the most complicated regimen. Several new agents are being studied, including a single capsule that contains bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline.

### Update on the second-line treatment of infection: a narrative review [^1125kEax]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Second-line therapies for H. pylori infection have been explored to improve patient outcomes. A standard bismuth quadruple therapy, a fluoroquinolone-containing quadruple (or triple) therapy, or a PPI-amoxicillin high-dose dual therapy have been recommended as second-line treatments by the Maastricht VI/Florence Consensus Report. Recently, tetracycline-levofloxacin quadruple therapy and vonoprazan-based therapy have been proposed to increase the eradication rate.

- **Regimens for second-line anti-H. pylori therapy**:
	- To investigate the efficacies of second-line eradication regimens, randomized controlled trials published in English were considered eligible for the literature search. These trials reported the eradication rates of second-line anti-H. pylori therapy. The status of H. pylori infection before and after treatment should be verified by at least one of the following tests: urea breath test, rapid urease test, histology, or culture. The post-treatment H. pylori status should be assessed at least four weeks after eradication therapies. Medical literature was searched on PubMed from 1 March 2013 to 1 March 2023. Eligible literature was identified using keywords such as 'Helicobacter pylori', 'H. pylori', 'H pylori', 'therapy', or 'treatment', with 'clinical trial' set as a filter. The titles and abstracts were screened to exclude irrelevant studies. The full articles of potentially eligible studies were further reviewed. Literature published in abstract form only was excluded.

### First-line therapies for eradication: A critical reappraisal of updated guidelines [^115wTran]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Since the 1990s, different national and international guidelines for managing patients with H. pylori infection have been introduced and periodically updated. Undeniably, recommendations on some issues are universally applicable to different geographic areas, such as those concerning the indications for treatment or diagnostic procedures. For instance, H. pylori infection should be searched for in all patients with a peptic ulcer, irrespective of the country where they are living. Likewise, the accuracy of noninvasive or invasive tests does not change among patients of different geographic areas. Therefore, guidelines on diagnosis and clinical issues may be applicable in all countries. In contrast, the efficacy of a therapy regimen may be affected by local or regional host/bacterial peculiarities. Consequently, recommendations on therapeutic approaches are more appropriately addressed in national rather than international guidelines, provided that data from national studies are considered.

Based on all these considerations, we aimed to examine the most recently updated guidelines worldwide, focusing our attention on first-line therapy recommendations for H. pylori eradication. Specifically, we considered European, NICE, Italian, Spanish, American, and Canadian guidelines for Western countries, and Asian, Australian, Japanese, and Chinese guidelines for Eastern countries.

### Retreatment of Helicobacter pylori infection after initial treatment failure [^11771wdY]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori treatment regimens fail to cure the infection in at least 10–20% of patients undergoing initial treatment. Retreatment strategies for patients who have failed initial treatment for H. pylori infection remain poorly described.

- **Objectives**: The literature describing the frequency of H. pylori treatment failure and factors leading to failure is reviewed. The role of antibiotic resistance is discussed, and clinical studies assessing success rates according to antibiotic resistance are described. Clinical trials evaluating the treatment success rates for a second episode of treatment are discussed.

- **Results**: The literature describing retreatment of failed H. pylori infection remains limited. The existing data support the use of bismuth-based quadruple therapy or ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC)-based triple therapy as the preferred agents after initial treatment failure.

- **Conclusion**: Further studies are needed to better define the optimal second treatment regimen after failed H. pylori treatment.

### Efficacy and safety of modified dual therapy as the first-line regimen for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1177MbQ8]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

In an era of antibiotic resistance, modified dual therapy has garnered significant attention due to its simple drug composition and the low resistance of amoxicillin. However, its eradication rate as a first-line regimen remains controversial. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of modified dual therapy for the initial treatment of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection compared with mainstream first-line therapies.

- **Methods**: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase were searched for randomized clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of modified dual therapy as the initial treatment for H. pylori eradication compared with guideline-recommended first-line therapies. A meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.3, estimating dichotomous data by the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup analysis was performed according to control groups and studies with antibiotic susceptibility tests.

- **Results**: Eight studies, including 1672 patients with H. pylori infection, met the selection criteria and were assessed. The meta-analysis demonstrated that modified dual therapy achieved similar efficacy [85.83% vs. 86.77%, RR 0.99 (95% CI, 0.95–1.03), intention-to-treat analysis; 89.53% vs. 90.45%, RR 0.99 (95% CI, 0.96–1.02), per-protocol analysis] and compliance [95.77% vs. 95.56%, RR 1.00 (95% CI, 0.98–1.02)] compared with recommended first-line regimens. Additionally, there were no significant differences in the eradication rate when comparing modified dual therapy with clarithromycin triple therapy or bismuth quadruple therapy.
