## Question

How do you manage hyponatremia in the setting of decompensated cirrhosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage hyponatremia in decompensated cirrhosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and classifying severity. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology to guide therapy. Next, I will outline general principles and then tailor management by severity and volume status. After that, I need to check special scenarios like imminent transplantation and hypovolemic hyponatremia. Finally, I will integrate monitoring, safety thresholds, and a practical algorithm, while double-checking areas where evidence is mixed or evolving.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework and severity cutoffs, because management hinges on both. In cirrhosis, hyponatremia is typically defined as serum sodium ≤ 135 mEq/L, with severity stratified as mild 126–135, moderate 120–125, and severe < 120 mEq/L, and this stratification aligns with AASLD and AGA guidance and is reflected in MELD-Na risk modeling [^10eb8fb2] [^3df1d582] [^b6abcbb2]. Wait, let me verify the prevalence so I don't overstate it: AASLD notes hyponatremia in nearly half of patients with cirrhosis and ascites, with about 22% having sodium ≤ 130 mEq/L, which underscores prognostic significance and the need for a structured approach [^3df1d582].

> I need to check the pathophysiology next, because it dictates why standard measures often fail and why we must be cautious. The dominant mechanism is hypervolemic, dilutional hyponatremia driven by splanchnic vasodilation and effective arterial underfilling, triggering non-osmotic vasopressin release, impaired free water clearance, and secondary neurohormonal activation; this explains why fluid restriction alone is frequently insufficient and why overcorrection risks osmotic demyelination [^64254812] [^3c9f048c] [^9d15ca6d]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with outcomes data: hyponatremia correlates with higher risks of encephalopathy, HRS, SBP, and mortality, reinforcing the need to treat both the number and the syndrome [^10eb8fb2] [^46c6af11].

> Next, I should review general principles that apply across severities. First, do no harm: avoid rapid correction and cap daily sodium rise at 4–6 mEq/L, never exceeding 8 mEq/L in 24 hours, with a plan to relower if overcorrection occurs; this is especially critical in chronic hyponatremia and in those facing transplantation [^47d93a6c] [^70d9be5e] [^bf06d4bc]. Second, address precipitating factors such as infection, GI bleeding, over-diuresis, and nephrotoxins, and reassess volume status carefully because hypovolemia can masquerade as hypervolemia in advanced cirrhosis [^001c8295] [^3df1d582]. Third, coordinate care early with hepatology and transplant teams given the prognostic weight of hyponatremia and its impact on peri-transplant risk [^fc5eb57d] [^a7fa7f5e].

> For mild hypervolemic hyponatremia (126–135 mEq/L) without symptoms, I should confirm that overtreatment is avoided. Management is conservative: monitor sodium every 2–3 days, counsel on modest fluid restriction to about 1–1.5 L/day if tolerated, and continue standard ascites care with sodium restriction and diuretics as indicated; routine fluid restriction solely for ascites without hyponatremia is not recommended, so I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing restriction [^1aa33601] [^241cc494] [^68c8aa6f]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with AGA: yes, AGA similarly advises restriction only when hyponatremia is present and emphasizes education and dietitian support to sustain adherence [^8284624f].

> For moderate hypervolemic hyponatremia (120–125 mEq/L), I should double-check that diuretic modification is prioritized. The standard approach is stricter fluid restriction to ≤ 1,000 mL/day and holding or reducing diuretics, with close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes; if sodium fails to improve or declines, consider albumin infusion, recognizing that evidence is mixed and not mortality-changing in randomized data, so I should frame albumin as adjunctive rather than definitive [^233d418b] [^5622a83c] [^93e7bf9d]. Wait, let me verify the albumin signal: observational and proof-of-concept data suggest modest sodium improvement, but ATTIRE did not show outcome benefit, so shared decision-making and careful selection are key if albumin is used [^d0c30877] [^93e7bf9d].

> For severe hypervolemic hyponatremia (< 120 mEq/L) or any symptomatic presentation, I need to ensure a more aggressive, monitored strategy. Beyond strict fluid restriction and stopping diuretics/laxatives, albumin can be considered, and in life-threatening neurologic symptoms or imminent transplantation, short-course hypertonic saline (3%) may be used with a hard cap of 8 mEq/L per 24 hours and readiness to relower with desmopressin and free water if overcorrection occurs; vasopressin receptor antagonists (vaptans) can be used short-term (≤ 30 days) with caution given overcorrection risk and limited outcome data, and should be initiated in hospital when possible [^753ea5b1] [^b9da9d16] [^43983942] [^bf06d4bc]. Hold on, I should verify vaptan efficacy and safety: randomized trials show meaningful sodium rises but increased rapid correction risk and uncertain survival benefit, so patient selection and monitoring are non-negotiable [^9de04996] [^c53ce89f].

> I will now examine hypovolemic hyponatremia, because misclassification is common. If there is true hypovolemia from over-diuresis or GI losses, the correct treatment is isotonic saline to restore effective arterial volume and suppress vasopressin, with cessation of diuretics; I should confirm that this is distinct from hypervolemic cases where saline would worsen ascites and hyponatremia, so volume assessment is essential before choosing fluids [^314d397d] [^3f4a8613]. But wait, what if the patient appears "wet" yet is intravascularly depleted? In that scenario, cautious albumin may be more appropriate than saline to expand plasma volume without aggravating edema, reinforcing the need for careful bedside and laboratory integration [^d0c30877].

> Next, I should review special scenarios, starting with imminent liver transplantation. Severe hyponatremia at transplant increases the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome, so perioperative planning should include slow correction targets, avoidance of rapid shifts, and coordination with anesthesia and hepatology; hypertonic saline may be reserved for severe symptoms or bridging to transplant, with vigilant monitoring to prevent overcorrection [^a7fa7f5e] [^bf06d4bc] [^da27b5c4]. Hold on, I should verify the ODS risk estimate: contemporary LT series place ODS around 0.5–1.5%, which, while low, is devastating and justifies conservative correction cadence [^bf06d4bc].

> For refractory or recurrent hyponatremia, I need to ensure a multidisciplinary plan. Options include repeating or escalating fluid restriction, short-course vaptans, albumin in selected cases, and consideration of TIPS for refractory ascites with hyponatremia, recognizing that TIPS can improve renal hemodynamics and sodium handling but must be balanced against encephalopathy risk and candidacy for transplant [^001c8295] [^72c60a97] [^f7969daf]. Let me reconsider the strength of TIPS data: while not randomized for hyponatremia per se, TIPS improves effective arterial blood flow and can indirectly improve sodium, so it is reasonable in carefully selected, non-encephalopathic patients with refractory ascites and hyponatremia [^a2e968be].

> I should confirm monitoring and safety guardrails. Daily weights, strict intake-output, and frequent sodium checks (every 6–12 hours initially in severe cases) are essential, with a written plan to detect and treat overcorrection using desmopressin and free water if sodium rises too fast; I need to ensure the team knows the 8 mEq/L per 24-hour limit and the need to slow correction in high-risk patients such as those with alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, or very low starting sodium [^47d93a6c] [^70d9be5e] [^bf06d4bc]. Hold on, I should verify that these thresholds are consistent across guidelines: yes, AASLD and AGA converge on 4–6 mEq/L per day with an absolute cap of 8 mEq/L in cirrhosis, with allowance to relower if exceeded [^47d93a6c] [^bf06d4bc].

> Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against the evidence. Confirm diagnosis and severity, classify volume status, and remove precipitating factors; for mild asymptomatic cases, monitor and consider modest fluid restriction; for moderate, restrict to 1,000 mL/day and stop or reduce diuretics, adding albumin if no improvement; for severe or symptomatic cases, add hypertonic saline only if emergent, consider short-term vaptans with close monitoring, and involve transplant early; throughout, cap correction at 8 mEq/L per 24 hours and be ready to relower if overcorrection occurs, with multidisciplinary oversight for refractory disease and transplant candidates [^10eb8fb2] [^001c8295] [^47d93a6c]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to include routine urea for chronic hyponatremia here, but I should correct that: while urea is promising in SIADH and some chronic hyponatremia, evidence in cirrhosis is limited and not guideline-endorsed, so I will not recommend it routinely outside trials or select cases [^02a35807] [^9de04996].

Hyponatremia in decompensated cirrhosis is common and carries **high morbidity and mortality** [^10eb8fb2]; management should be individualized by severity and volume status, with a strict limit of **≤ 8 mmol/L per 24 hours** to avoid osmotic demyelination [^47d93a6c]. For mild cases (130–135 mmol/L), monitor and restrict fluids to 1–1.5 L/day [^1aa33601] [^8580f7a7]; for moderate (120–129 mmol/L), restrict to 1 L/day and stop diuretics [^233d418b]; for severe (< 120 mmol/L) or symptomatic cases, use hypertonic saline with close monitoring, and consider albumin or short-term vaptans in refractory cases [^b9da9d16] [^43983942]. Always address precipitating factors (infection, bleeding, over-diuresis) and coordinate transplant evaluation for persistent hyponatremia [^fc5eb57d].

---

## Pathophysiology

Hyponatremia in decompensated cirrhosis is primarily **hypervolemic and dilutional**, driven by splanchnic vasodilation and effective arterial underfilling, which trigger non-osmotic vasopressin release and impaired free water excretion [^64254812] [^3c9f048c]. Hypovolemic hyponatremia can occur with over-diuresis or GI losses and requires different management [^3df1d582].

---

## Clinical significance

Hyponatremia in cirrhosis is associated with:

- **Increased mortality**: Independent of MELD, especially when sodium < 130 mmol/L [^10eb8fb2].
- **Complications**: Higher risk of hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^10eb8fb2].
- **Transplant risk**: Severe hyponatremia increases osmotic demyelination risk peri-transplant [^a7fa7f5e].

---

## Classification by severity

| **Severity** | **Serum sodium** | **Clinical implications** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild | 130–135 mmol/L | Monitor; fluid restriction 1–1.5 L/day [^1aa33601] [^8580f7a7] |
| Moderate | 120–129 mmol/L | Restrict to 1 L/day; stop diuretics [^233d418b] [^5622a83c] |
| Severe | < 120 mmol/L | Hypertonic saline; albumin; vaptans; close monitoring [^b9da9d16] [^43983942] |

---

## General management principles

- **Identify and treat precipitating factors**: infection, GI bleeding, over-diuresis, or nephrotoxins [^001c8295].
- **Correct slowly**: ≤ 8 mmol/L per 24 hours to avoid osmotic demyelination [^47d93a6c] [^70d9be5e].
- **Monitor closely**: frequent sodium checks and neurologic assessments during correction [^ffe69762].

---

## Specific management strategies

### Mild hyponatremia (130–135 mmol/L)

Management is **conservative**, with monitoring and fluid restriction to 1–1.5 L/day [^1aa33601] [^8580f7a7]; diuretics may be continued if clinically indicated, with caution [^notfound].

---

### Moderate hyponatremia (120–129 mmol/L)

- **Fluid restriction**: ≤ 1 L/day [^233d418b] [^5622a83c].
- **Diuretics**: stop or reduce dose [^233d418b] [^5622a83c].
- **Albumin**: consider if no improvement or if hypoalbuminemia is present [^notfound].

---

### Severe hyponatremia (< 120 mmol/L) or symptomatic cases

- **Hypertonic saline**: 3% saline for severe symptoms or Na < 120 mmol/L; monitor closely [^b9da9d16] [^c9cde040].
- **Albumin**: 40 g IV for severe cases, especially with hypoalbuminemia or HRS risk [^notfound].
- **Vaptans**: short-term use (≤ 30 days) in refractory cases; monitor for rapid correction and liver injury [^43983942] [^ed556e2a] [^d256080a].
- **Renal replacement therapy**: consider in life-threatening cases or when other measures fail [^1f3a3d45].

---

## Role of albumin infusion

Albumin can improve effective arterial volume and natriuresis, and may raise sodium in some patients, but **evidence for hard outcomes is mixed** [^d0c30877]. Use is reasonable in severe hyponatremia, particularly with hypoalbuminemia or HRS risk, and is guideline-supported in select scenarios [^753ea5b1] [^e75a2a93].

---

## Role of vasopressin receptor antagonists (vaptans)

Vaptans (e.g. tolvaptan) promote aquaresis and can raise sodium, but carry risks of **rapid correction and liver injury** [^9de04996] [^d256080a]. Reserve for short-term use in refractory cases with close monitoring, and avoid in severe liver impairment [^43983942] [^ed556e2a].

---

## Monitoring and prevention of complications

- **Frequent monitoring**: sodium every 6–12 hours during active correction.
- **Neurologic assessment**: watch for osmotic demyelination signs [^bf06d4bc].
- **Prevent overcorrection**: use desmopressin and free water if sodium rises too fast [^bf06d4bc].

---

## Liver transplantation considerations

Persistent hyponatremia warrants **early transplant evaluation** given its prognostic weight [^fc5eb57d]. Severe hyponatremia increases osmotic demyelination risk peri-transplant, so correction must be slow and coordinated [^a7fa7f5e] [^bf06d4bc].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Mild (130–135 mmol/L)**: fluid restriction 1–1.5 L/day; monitor [^1aa33601] [^8580f7a7].
- **Moderate (120–129 mmol/L)**: restrict to 1 L/day; stop diuretics; consider albumin [^233d418b] [^5622a83c].
- **Severe (< 120 mmol/L)**: hypertonic saline; albumin; short-term vaptans; close monitoring [^b9da9d16] [^43983942].
- **All cases**: correct ≤ 8 mmol/L per 24 hours; address precipitating factors; consider transplant evaluation [^47d93a6c] [^fc5eb57d].

---

Hyponatremia in decompensated cirrhosis requires a **stepwise, safety-focused approach** that balances correction with the risk of osmotic demyelination, addresses precipitating factors, and coordinates transplant care for persistent cases.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of ascites, volume overload, and hyponatremia in cirrhosis: expert review [^001c8295]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update (CPU) is to summarize the available evidence and offer expert Best Practice Advice (BPA) on the management of ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, volume overload, and hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board and Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. This CPU expert review underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through the standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These BPA statements were developed based on review of the published literature and expert opinion and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board. Because formal systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Patients with cirrhosis with ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, or volume overload should be managed with dietary sodium restriction and diuretics at the lowest effective dose, with dose escalation guided by symptoms, weight, urine output, and electrolyte/renal monitoring. Education and referral to a dietitian should be provided for dietary management. Triggers of liver decompensation should be identified and addressed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Patients with cirrhosis with new-onset ascites, or those admitted to the hospital for symptoms related to ascites or encephalopathy should receive diagnostic paracentesis as soon as possible. Testing should include serum ascites albumin gradient and cell count, Gram stain, and culture. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Patients with hepatic hydrothorax with dyspnea and/or hypoxemia should undergo a therapeutic thoracentesis for both symptom relief and expansion of the underlying lung. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: All patients with refractory ascites and/or hepatic hydrothorax should be considered for liver transplantation evaluation, regardless of their Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Refractory ascites and/or hydrothorax should be managed with therapeutic paracentesis and/or thoracentesis, respectively, with the frequency guided by recurrence. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: When the volume of ascites removed is > 5 L, 20%-25% intravenous albumin 6–8 g per every total liter removed should be administered. For patients with hypotension, renal insufficiency, or electrolyte abnormalities, albumin should also be considered for removal of smaller volumes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Well-selected patients with refractory ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, volume overload, or hyponatremia should be referred for to transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Diagnostic workup for the etiology of hyponatremia in cirrhosis should include dietary and medication history (diuretics, bowel regimen); review of electrolyte and kidney function; gastrointestinal bleeding assessment; infectious workup, including diagnostic paracentesis, and evaluation of secondary causes (thyroid or adrenal dysfunction). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Outpatient management of asymptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis entails both sodium and water restriction (aiming for 1–1.5 L of daily fluid intake), modification of diuretics and laxatives, and monitoring of electrolytes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Inpatient management of severe or symptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis includes both sodium and water restriction; modification or discontinuation of diuretics and laxatives; and additional measures, such as intravenous albumin based on volume assessment or oral vasoconstriction therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Recurrent or refractory hyponatremia management should involve a multidisciplinary approach (including the liver transplantation team when appropriate) and can consider several therapeutic options, including intravenous vasoconstrictor therapy, infusion of hypertonic saline, use of vasopressin receptor antagonist (vaptans), or use of renal replacement therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Inpatient management of volume overload includes escalation or trial of intravenous loop diuretics (furosemide or bumetanide) in bolus (2–3 times per day) or continuous fashion. Cautious escalation can be done every 2–3 days with monitoring of volume status, kidney function, daily weights, and symptoms. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Advanced strategies in refractory anasarca should be coordinated with nephrology for consideration of diuretics in the setting of contraction alkalosis (eg, addition of acetazolamide), second agent with alternate mechanism of actions (eg, thiazide diuretics, such as metolazone), or need for ultrafiltration.

### Managing hyponatremia in cirrhosis [^a084e055]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The development of hyponatremia represents an ominous event in the progression of cirrhosis to end-stage liver disease. It usually develops in those with refractory ascites and is a manifestation of the non-osmotic release of arginine vasopressin (AVP). In the hospitalized cirrhotic patient, hyponatremia is associated with increased disease severity and mortality. In this article, we review the pathophysiology of hyponatremia, its clinical implications, evaluation, and treatment.

### Hyponatremia in cirrhosis: an update [^64254812]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is frequently seen in patients with ascites secondary to advanced cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Although not apparent in the early stages of cirrhosis, the progression of cirrhosis and portal hypertension leads to splanchnic vasodilation, and this leads to the activation of compensatory mechanisms such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), sympathetic nervous system, and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) to ameliorate low circulatory volume. The net effect is the avid retention of sodium and water to compensate for the low effective circulatory volume, resulting in the development of ascites. These compensatory mechanisms lead to impairment of the kidneys to eliminate solute-free water in decompensated cirrhosis. Nonosmotic secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as arginine vasopressin, further worsens excess water retention and thereby hyponatremia. The management of hyponatremia in this setting is a challenge as conventional therapies for hyponatremia including fluid restriction and correction of hypokalemia are frequently inefficacious. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology, complications, and various treatment modalities, including albumin infusion, selective vasopressin receptor antagonists, or hypertonic saline for patients with severe hyponatremia and those awaiting liver transplantation.

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^d0c30877]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia

As shown in Figure 2, hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis and ascites is also the result of inflammation and the hemodynamic abnormalities that lead not only to the secretion of kidney vasoconstrictive factors (eg, renin and angiotensin) but also to the secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Therefore, albumin administration has a rationale in the management of hyponatremia in decompensated cirrhosis.

In a proof-of-concept study, i.v. albumin led to resolution of hyponatremia in 3 patients with cirrhosis and hyponatremia while it was unsuccessful in one patient with acute liver failure. In a large cohort study of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis enrolled prospectively in the North American Consortium for the Study of End-Stage Liver Disease (NACSELD) database, patients who had received i.v. albumin had a higher sodium level and a small, albeit statistically significantly, rate of hyponatremia resolution (69% vs. 61%, p = 0.008) compared with those who did not.

There are no fully published randomized controlled studies analyzing the effect of albumin on hyponatremia (as primary outcome) and therefore a recommendation to use albumin in this setting cannot be made. New or ongoing well-designed studies (eg, ALBUCAT NCT03941405) should address the topic of hyponatremia since it is an important predictor of mortality in patients on the waitlist for liver transplantation.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^da27b5c4]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to management of hyponatremia, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to limit the use of hypertonic saline in the management of hypervolemic hyponatremia to the rare cases presenting with life-threatening complications. Consider administering hypertonic saline in patients with severe hyponatremia expected to get liver transplantation within a few days. Correct the serum sodium concentration slowly (≤ 8 mmol/L per day), once an attenuation of symptoms has been obtained, to avoid irreversible neurological sequelae, such as osmotic demyelination.

Hyponatraemia

Recent guidelines define hyponatraemia as a serum sodium < 135 mmol/L, with 130–135 mmol/L, 125–129 mmol/L and < 125 mmol/L, constituting mild, moderate and severe hyponatraemia, respectively. A prospective population survey among patients with cirrhosis found serum sodium < 130 mmol/L in 21.6%. Hyponatraemia has been associated with higher prevalence of refractory ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, SBP, HRS and mortality. Acknowledging this, the Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score now incorporates serum sodium (MELD-Na). Those with cirrhosis and chronic hyponatraemia are often asymptomatic and seldom need treatment.

Both hypovolaemic and hypervolaemic hyponatraemia is observed in cirrhosis. Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia results from overzealous diuretic therapy, being characterised by a prolonged negative sodium balance with marked loss of extracellular fluid. Its management requires expansion of plasma volume with normal saline and cessation of diuretics. Most hepatologists would discontinue diuretics if serum sodium is < 125 mmol/L.

### Targeted albumin therapy does not improve short-term outcome in hyponatremic patients hospitalized with complications of cirrhosis: data from the ATTIRE trial [^93e7bf9d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with decompensated cirrhosis and hyponatremia have a poor prognosis. We investigated Albumin to Prevent Infection in Chronic Liver Failure trial data to determine whether targeted albumin infusions improved outcome in patients with hyponatremia at baseline.

Methods

We examined the interaction between targeted albumin and standard care for the composite primary end point, stratifying by baseline sodium ≥ and < 130 mmol/L.

Results

Randomization to albumin was associated with a significant increase in sodium; however, there was no interaction between sodium category and treatment for the trial primary end point.

Discussion

Targeted intravenous albumin infusions increased serum sodium level in hospitalized hyponatremic patients with cirrhosis, but this did not improve outcome.

Monitoring response to therapy in patients with decompensated cirrhosis

Treatment of decompensation events is essential to cirrhosis management. Equally important is monitoring responses to treatment, which enables clinicians to adjust treatment duration and strategy, as well as evaluate treatment success. Furthermore, there is an unmet need to develop and validate predictive biomarkers that can identify patients who are most likely to benefit from treatments and those who are most likely to experience adverse events.

Monitoring response to diuretics in the treatment of ascites and edema

Ascites and edema develop with cirrhosis because of a marked alteration in the regulation of extracellular fluid volume. Sodium and associated water retention cause accumulation of extracellular fluid, which results in ascites and leg edema, leading to discomfort, impaired walking, and decreased quality of life. Pharmacotherapy with aldosterone antagonists, alone or combined with loop diuretics, can increase sodium excretion. The goal of this treatment is to achieve a negative sodium balance, which results in a negative fluid balance because water is eliminated with sodium. A low-sodium diet should also be implemented.

The ideal test for monitoring the efficacy of the treatment of ascites and edema would be an NIT to quantify fluid in extracellular spaces. Diuretics would be administered until fluid volume in the extracellular spaces had returned to normal. Unfortunately, such a tool does not exist. Instead, patients are monitored with less sophisticated tools that estimate the effect of treatment on total fluid (eg, by monitoring body weight). Alternatively, the biological effect of diuretics can be monitored easily by measuring changes in urinary sodium excretion (in mEq/day, measured accurately by 24 h urine collection). An effective treatment of ascites is associated with a reduction in body weight of no more than 0.5–1 kg per day (1 kg if peripheral edema is also present). Effective diuretic treatment should increase sodium excretion compared to baseline, with 24 h sodium excretion exceeding the presumed sodium intake (90–100 mEq/day with a low-sodium diet). The major risks associated with such treatment include diuretic-induced AKI and hypovolemia (Table 3).

### Hyponatremia in cirrhosis [^a1bcbffa]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is common in patients with cirrhosis. Portal hypertension, diuretics, large volume paracentesis without albumin, infection, and multiple medications are connected with the development or worsening of hyponatremia. Hyponatremia in cirrhosis, particularly advanced cirrhosis, is a common development.(1) In a population survey of 997 patients with cirrhosis, 486 (49.4%) and 211 (21.6%) had a serum sodium concentration ([Na(+)]) < 135 mEq/L and ≤ 130 mEq/L, respectively.(2) Hyponatremia and its severity correlate with the presence of severe complications of cirrhosis such as hepatorenal syndrome, encephalopathy, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The presence of hyponatremia frequently complicates the management of the cirrhotic patient.

Box 3
Diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome

Cirrhosis with ascites
Serum creatinine > 133 µmol/L
No improvement of serum creatinine to < 133 µmol/L after at least 2 days with diuretic withdrawal and volume expansion with albumin (1 g/kg up to a maximum of 100 g/day)
Absence of shock
No current treatment with nephrotoxic drugs
Absence of parenchymal kidney disease as indicated by proteinuria (> 500 mg/day) or microhaematuria (> 50 red blood cells per high-power field) and/or a normal renal ultrasonography

Early intervention in patients with AKI can prevent further deterioration in renal function leading to renal failure. Initial management of AKI should include suspension of all diuretics and nephrotoxic drugs. Patients should be fluid-resuscitated with 0.9% saline or 5% albumin, giving boluses of 250 mL with regular volume status reassessment aiming to achieve euvolaemia with a urine output of > 0.5 mL/kg/h based on dry weight. Accurate fluid balance monitoring and daily weight charts should be commenced. Usually 1–2 L of intravenous fluid will correct most losses and render the patient euvolaemic. If after 6 h the target urine output is not achieved, or the patient's clinical parameters are worsening, then escalation to high-dependency care for more invasive monitoring, inotropic support or renal support should be considered.

Hyponatraemia is common in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and can be caused by multiple factors including: hormonal dysregulation of salt and water balance in response to portal hypertension, dehydration, treatment with diuretics, infections and excessive use of hypotonic fluids, such as 5% dextrose. Patients with serum sodium levels < 125 mmol/L are at risk of seizures. A careful history, clinical examination, medication review and review of other biochemistry are essential to determine the cause of hyponatraemia. Assessment of the patient's volume status is fundamental, and subjects who are hypovolaemic should be fluid-resuscitated. Patients with hypervolaemic hyponatraemia should be treated with fluid restriction. However, it should be noted that some patients with significant ascites, peripheral oedema and low serum albumin levels who appear hypervolaemic are actually intravascularly deplete, and treatment with intravenous albumin can correct the hyponatraemia. Correction of hyponatraemia should be slow (< 10 mmol/L increase per 24 h), as rapid changes in serum sodium can precipitate osmotic demyelination syndrome.

Renal impairment

Renal impairment and hyponatraemia are common complications of DC and are associated with poor outcome. Circulatory changes mean that patients with DC are more susceptible to prerenal acute kidney injury (AKI), for example due to hypovolaemia secondary to diuretics, bleeding or infection. They may also suffer from renal causes of AKI (such as acute tubular necrosis) and postrenal causes, as in patients without cirrhosis. Patients with metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and diabetes are more likely to have underlying chronic kidney disease.

Hepatorenal syndrome refers to renal failure in patients with cirrhosis and ascites in the absence of any other identifiable cause and can develop acutely or more chronically. Management of HRS is outside the remit of this guideline. However, if patients develop renal impairment in an outpatient setting, the priority should be cessation/reduction of diuretic therapy and suspension of nephrotoxic medications. Arrangements should be made for frequent monitoring of renal function, to see whether admission for plasma expansion with fluids and/or terlipressin is required.

Special considerations for prescribing in DC

The pathophysiological changes in decompensated liver disease may significantly change the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of many medicines, altering pharmacological and toxicological responses (online supplemental table 1). In addition, many medications can exacerbate fluid overload and/or HE in patients with DC. Table 2 provides a summary of prescribing adjustments to consider in some commonly used medications.

Table 2
Summary of prescribing commonly used medicines in patients with DC

Careful consideration should be given to the potential risk–benefit of treatment in each individual with advanced liver disease. Polypharmacy should be avoided, and medicines regularly reviewed to ensure all are still required. Concordance should be addressed regularly; if suboptimal, medications should be rationalised in partnership with patients to optimise concordance with the most important treatments.

Medicines should be titrated slowly, closely monitored and suspended or withdrawn if there are signs of toxicity or patient deterioration. Therapeutic drug monitoring should be employed where available.

Fluid resuscitation and vasopressors

What fluids and vasopressors should be used in patients with DC in the ICU?

Recommendation

Balanced salt solutions should be used over normal saline. Norepinephrine is the vasopressor of choice. Albumin is useful in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and PPCD.

Discussion

Fluid management and vasopressor use in patients with DC require an understanding of several pathophysiological parameters and neurohumoral mediators. Recent evidence supports the use of balanced salt solutions such as lactated Ringer's or PlasmaLyte over normal saline, driven by the lower incidence of hyperchloremic acidosis and concomitant renal injury. For patients who require vasopressors to maintain MAP > 60 mm Hg, norepinephrine is the first-line choice. Epinephrine should be avoided to reduce the risk of ischemia.

Literature supports the use of albumin in some patients with DC. Specifically, albumin has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with SBP (although not in other forms of infection/sepsis) and hepatorenal syndrome, and to prevent PPCD. In the setting of SBP, the patient should be given 1.5 g/kg of albumin on the day of diagnosis (day 1) followed by 1 g/kg on day 3.PPCD is a syndrome after large volume paracentesis (LVP) resulting in splanchnic vasodilation, with resultant rapid reaccumulation of ascites, hyponatremia, and renal injury. As discussed in the next section, peri-paracentesis albumin administration can help prevent PPCD.

There is mixed data on long-term albumin use as therapy in DC to prevent complications and improve survival. The human Albumin for the treatmeNt of aScites in patients With hEpatic ciRrhosis (ANSWER) trial demonstrated improvement in 18-month survival as well as improvement in management of ascites and decrease in cirrhosis complications including SBP, non-SBP bacterial infections, episodes of renal dysfunction, and severe HE. However, the Effect of Midodrine and Albumin in the Prevention of Complications in Cirrhotic Patients Awaiting Liver Transplantation (MACHT) study, which compared standard therapy with standard therapy plus albumin and midodrine, showed no difference in 1-year mortality or complications of cirrhosis. These conflicting findings may be related to dose differences of albumin in the trials with higher doses being given in ANSWER, and further studies are needed to determine the appropriate patients with DC who should receive long-term albumin therapy.

Recommendations

In patients with the first presentation of moderate ascites spironolactone monotherapy (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) is reasonable. In those with recurrent severe ascites, and if faster diuresis is needed (for example, if the patient is hospitalised), combination therapy with spironolactone (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) and furosemide (starting dose 40 mg, increased to 160 mg) is recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
All patients initiating diuretics should be monitored for adverse events. Almost half of those with adverse events require diuretic discontinuation or dose reduction. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia during diuretic therapy should be managed by discontinuation of diuretics and expansion of plasma volume with normal saline. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Fluid restriction to 1–1.5 L/day should be reserved for those who are clinically hypervolaemic with severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium < 125 mmol/day). (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Hypertonic sodium chloride (3%) administration should be reserved for those who are severely symptomatic with acute hyponatraemia. Serum sodium should be slowly corrected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
It may be appropriate to consider use of midodrine in refractory ascites on a case-by-case basis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)

### Hyponatremia in cirrhosis: pathogenesis, clinical significance, and management [^3c9f048c]. Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a frequent complication of advanced cirrhosis related to an impairment in the renal capacity to eliminate solute-free water that causes a retention of water that is disproportionate to the retention of sodium, thus causing a reduction in serum sodium concentration and hypo-osmolality. The main pathogenic factor responsible for hyponatremia is a nonosmotic hypersecretion of arginine vasopressin (or antidiuretic hormone) from the neurohypophysis related to circulatory dysfunction. Hyponatremia in cirrhosis is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. There is evidence suggesting that hyponatremia may affect brain function and predispose to hepatic encephalopathy. Hyponatremia also represents a risk factor for liver transplantation as it is associated with increased frequency of complications and impaired short-term survival after transplantation. The current standard of care based on fluid restriction is unsatisfactory. Currently, a new family of drugs, known as vaptans, which act by antagonizing specifically the effects of arginine vasopressin on the V2 receptors located in the kidney tubules, is being evaluated for their role in the management of hyponatremia. The short-term treatment with vaptans is associated with a marked increase in renal solute-free water excretion and improvement of hyponatremia. Long-term administration of vaptans seems to be effective in maintaining the improvement of serum sodium concentration, but the available information is still limited. Treatment with vaptans represents a novel approach to improving serum sodium concentration in cirrhosis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^cc2b8ddc]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical medicine; it represents an excess of water relative to total body solute. Hyponatremia usually results from the intake and subsequent retention of electrolyte-free water in response to true hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal solute loss or malnutrition; decreased effective circulating volume due to heart failure or liver cirrhosis; or non-osmotic vasopressin activity due to malignancies, infections, medications, pain, or stress. When defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L, hyponatremia occurs in up to 8% of the general population and in up to 60% of hospitalized patients. Acute profound hyponatremia can cause brain edema, but also chronic mild hyponatremia is associated with poor health outcomes. Even when comorbid conditions are taken into account, people with a mildly decreased serum sodium concentration have a 30% higher risk of death and are hospitalized 14% longer relative to those without hyponatremia.

Despite the frequency and severity of some of the associated complications, research suggests hyponatremia is often neglected by clinicians. If acquired in hospital, it may take days before the electrolyte disorder is investigated, potentially allowing a further decrease in serum sodium concentration and exposing patients to the dangers of profound hyponatremia. When efforts are made to explore the underlying cause, clinicians use widely different strategies for differential diagnosis, testing is often inadequate and misclassification of the hyponatremia frequently occurs.

Hyponatremia may be managed clinically by different specialists, such as endocrinologists, nephrologists, geriatricians, or intensivists, and, accordingly, management strategies often vary. Although probably related to variation in awareness, differences in expert opinion on whom and how to treat only add to the confusion over optimal management. For instance, although experts agree that acute symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated with hypertonic saline, the optimal concentrations and methods for determining initial infusion speeds are debated. In addition, the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome after rapid correction of hyponatremia has fuelled intense debate among experts on whether complications of untreated hyponatremia or complications of treatment pose the greatest risk. As different specialist physicians deal with hyponatremia, consultation of different information and guidance sources may add to the variability in treatment seen in clinical practice today.

### Hyponatremia in cirrhosis: implications for liver transplantation [^b6abcbb2]. Liver Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia in cirrhosis is defined as a serum sodium level ≤ 130 mEq/L and occurs in approximately 22% of patients with cirrhosis. The appearance of hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis portends a poor prognosis before liver transplantation (LT), independent of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. With the development of the MELD-sodium score, the management of hyponatremia has become more relevant than ever before. Overcorrection of hyponatremia before LT or perioperatively can lead to the devastating neurologic condition known as osmotic demyelination syndrome, which is often irreversible and fatal. Therefore, the most important tenet of hyponatremia is to avoid correcting the serum sodium by ≥ 8 mEq/L in a 24-hour period. Treatment of hyponatremia is highly challenging. The vast majority of patients with cirrhosis have chronic hypervolemic hyponatremia. Fluid restriction increases serum sodium levels, but tolerance and compliance are significant barriers. Diuretic withdrawal is helpful but contributes to worsening fluid overload. There are limited data to support use of intravenous concentrated albumin solutions. The use of the arginine vasopressin antagonists ("vaptans") is contentious; however, they may have a limited role. Risk factors for intraoperative overcorrection of serum sodium include increased utilization of packed red blood cell and fresh frozen plasma transfusions, which are often unavoidable. Intraoperative management is evolving, and more data are needed in regard to the use of sodium-reduced continuous venovenous hemofiltration and the use of trishydroxymethylaminomethane (Tris) to avoid excess sodium rebound. A thorough discussion of the current treatment options before and during LT is given in this review.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^9d15ca6d]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypervolaemic hyponatraemia is more common in cirrhosis, occurring owing to non-osmotic hypersecretion of vasopressin and enhanced proximal nephron sodium reabsorption with impaired free water clearance, both being caused by effective hypovolaemia. Impaired free water clearance is observed in about 60% of patients with cirrhosis.

Hypervolaemic hyponatraemia requires a negative water balance. Many hepatologists do recommend fluid restriction of between 1 and 1.5 L/day in presence of severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium < 125 mmol/L). However, there are few data to support the level of serum sodium at which to initiate fluid restriction and how much fluid to restrict. It is sodium restriction and not fluid restriction that results in weight loss as fluid passively follows the sodium. Although fluid restriction may be helpful in preventing further decrease in serum sodium, it only rarely improves it. This is because on a practical level, fluid restriction to < 1 L /day is not tolerated. Water restriction should be reserved for those who are clinically hypervolaemic with severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium < 125 mmol/L) with normal serum creatinine and not currently receiving diuretics. These recommendations are based on our consensus and consistent with our earlier guidelines. It is also our consensus that fluid restriction is unnecessary in absence of hyponatraemia.

Hypertonic sodium chloride (3%) administration may improve hyponatraemia at the cost of worsening fluid overload. It is best reserved for those with severely symptomatic acute hyponatraemia, especially if a transplant is imminent. To prevent rapid increase in serum sodium and the risk of developing central pontine myelinolysis, guidelines recommend a serum sodium increase of up to 5 mmol/L in the first hour with a limit of 8–10 mmol/L every 24 hours thereafter until the serum sodium concentration reaches 130 mmol/L.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^7eb9cd53]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Criteria for selection of studies

We included evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements on the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia. We defined clinical practice guidelines as statements that included recommendations intended to optimize patient care informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options. We defined consensus statements as documents containing clinically relevant suggestions or recommendations based on the collective opinion of an expert panel. We included all publications independent of language. We excluded guidelines related to the prevention of hyponatremia as well as guidelines relevant to conditions associated with hyponatremia if they were not specifically designed to address hyponatremia. Hence, we excluded guidelines targeting treatment of heart failure, cirrhosis, and cancer unless they were developed with a focus on hyponatremia as a complication. Finally, we also excluded draft unpublished guidelines, conference or discussion papers, personal opinions, and obsolete guidelines replaced by updated recommendations from the same organization.

Search methods for guidelines and consensus statements

We searched MEDLINE (1946 to September Week 1, 2014) and EMBASE (1980 to September 2014), combining vocabulary terms and text words for hyponatremia with terms related to clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements. We also searched guideline databases and websites of organizations as well as of selected professional specialist societies in nephrology, endocrinology, and intensive care medicine. A list of the databases and websites along with the full search strategies are outlined in Additional file 1. EN and JV independently screened the titles and abstracts and discarded those that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Full texts for potentially relevant guidelines or consensus statements were retrieved and examined for eligibility. Both the initial screening and subsequent full-paper assessment stage were completed using Early Review Organizing Software.

Data collection process and data items

We developed a draft data extraction form which was piloted and modified as necessary. The extracted data included document characteristics (e.g. year of publication, country/region, development team, funding organization), recommendations related to the diagnosis and assessment of hyponatremia, and recommendations related to the treatment of hyponatremia. EN and JV extracted all data using the standardized data extraction form (Additional file 2) and resolved discrepancies by consensus.

### Optimal management of the inpatient with decompensated cirrhosis [^f0f53177]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Over the past several years, there has been a wealth of new data pertaining to the management of complications of cirrhosis, resulting in several important updates to best practices and consensus guidelines. Despite these advancements and numerous recent targeted quality initiatives, hospitalizations resulting from complications of cirrhosis remain frequent, costly and associated with poor patient outcomes. An emphasis on evidence-based management of hospitalized patients with decompensated cirrhosis has the potential to decrease readmission rates and length of stay while improving overall patient outcomes. Herein, we provide an updated, evidence-based overview of the optimal inpatient management of the most frequently encountered complications associated with cirrhosis.

### Hyponatremia: diagnosis, complications, and management including V2 receptor antagonists [^9cc27b01]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent studies have consistently demonstrated the common prevalence of hyponatremia in the hospital and intensive care settings, and how it correlates with untoward outcomes. This review discusses the classification, diagnosis, and pathophysiology of hyponatremia and how these agents may influence its management, and also examines the available treatment options and their weaknesses and strengths.

Recent Findings

This review is timely and relevant, as mild degrees of serum sodium lowering may be associated with adverse neurologic and musculoskeletal effects. These findings have the potential to transform our approach to managing hyponatremia. A major advance in our ability to treat hyponatremia was the introduction and approval of aquaretics (vaptans). Emerging data on vaptans and their potential role to treat hyponatremia in the settings of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, congestive heart failure, and liver cirrhosis are presented.

Summary

Vaptans will likely play an important role in treating hyponatremia, given their clinical effectiveness and tolerability. Cost remains a hindrance for vaptans, and more studies are needed to further define their best utilization in hyponatremic patients.

Outpatient management of ascites

The onset of ascites signifies an important stage in cirrhosis evolution: the 2-year and 5-year cumulative mortality after ascites development is 38% and 78%, respectively.

Ascites is a clinical manifestation of portal hypertension related renal dysfunction, leading to sodium and water retention and impaired free water clearance. This presents progressively as ascites, refractory ascites, hyponatraemia and ultimately hepatorenal syndrome.

New-onset ascites should be evaluated to ensure it is related to portal hypertension, including calculating serum albumin gradient (SAAG) where SAAG > 11 g/L is consistent with portal hypertension. In the absence of another clear cause of decompensation, CT scan of the liver to rule out hepatocellular carcinoma or portomesenteric vein thrombosis should be considered. Any significant increase in the volume of ascites, abdominal pain or fever should prompt an ascitic tap with fluid sent for white cell count to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and ascitic fluid culture. A neutrophil count of > 250/mm 3 confirms SBP requiring prompt treatment with antibiotics.

### Hyponatremia influences the outcome of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure: an analysis of the CANONIC study [^211d27b9]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Study population and data collection

This report represents an analysis of patients enroled in the Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) in Cirrhosis (CANONIC) study from the CLIF consortium, which defined specific criteria for ACLF in cirrhosis. ACLF was defined as an acute hepatic decompensation resulting in liver failure (jaundice and prolongation of the INR) and one or more extrahepatic organ failures in patients with chronic liver disease with or without previously diagnosed cirrhosis. In the CANONIC study, patients with cirrhosis hospitalized with an acute decompensation (AD) (ascites, gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, or bacterial infections, or any combination of these) were screened and enroled from February to September 2011 in twenty-nine University Hospitals from eight European countries. A separate Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from the original study sites (see link available at the end of the manuscript, which includes all the International Review Boards that approved the study at the various centers involved). Written informed consent was obtained from patients or their legal surrogates before inclusion. Data regarding history (including previous episodes of AD), physical examination, laboratory tests, and potential precipitating factors of ACLF were recorded. Potential precipitating factors included active alcoholism, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, bacterial infection, therapeutic paracentesis without use of intravenous albumin, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting, major surgery, and acute hepatitis.

Patients with cirrhosis admitted to the hospital with an AD were enroled in the CANONIC study according to the definition criteria of ACLF. Patients with two or more organ/system failures or those with a single renal failure (serum creatinin ≥ 2 mg/dL) or one or other organ/system failure in combination with renal insufficiency (serum creatinine between 1.5 and 1.9 mg/dL) or a 1 to 2 hepatic encephalopathy grade (West Haven scale) were found to have a poor short-term prognosis and were consequently assumed to present an ACLF episode.

Although hyponatremia in the general population is defined as a serum sodium ≤ 135 mEq/L, in cirrhosis current guidelines and consensus define it as a serum sodium level < 130 mEq/L. Thus, in this analysis hyponatremia was defined as a serum sodium level < 130 mEq/L. Patients with hyponatremia at inclusion or who developed it during hospitalization were managed with fluid restriction between 1 to 1.5 liters per day according to current guidelines.

### Current management of hyponatremia in acute heart failure: a report from the hyponatremia registry for patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia (HN registry) [^7fe1406f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

The Hyponatremia Registry for Patients With Euvolemic and Hypervolemic Hyponatremia (HN Registry) (NCT01240668) is a prospective, observational, multicenter study of patients hospitalized with euvolemic or hypervolemic HN in the United States (146 sites) and with euvolemic HN in Europe (79 sites). A detailed description of the study design has been published previously, 20 and the results for the overall cohort and the euvolemic cohort have been published. 21 The present analysis focuses on the hypervolemic HF subset of patients with HN in the United States. Hypervolemic patients with cirrhosis were not included in this analysis.

In brief, observational chart data were collected retrospectively by investigators at each site throughout the duration of a patient's hospitalization. No prospective diagnostic or treatment algorithm or protocol was imposed, nor was consecutive enrollment required for entry. Hospitalized patients aged ≥ 18 years were eligible if they had hypervolemic HN characterized by serum sodium concentration ([Na +]) ≤ 130 mEq/L, a current diagnosis of HF documented in the medical record, and hypervolemia as determined by the site investigative team based on medical record review. A cutoff of [Na +] ≤ 130 mEq/L was chosen to focus on patients more likely to be receiving therapy specifically for HN. Patients were excluded if they were hypovolemic, had a random blood glucose level > 250 mg/dL, or 180–250 mg/dL together with a [Na +] of 127–130 mEq/L at entry, or received renal replacement therapy while they had HN. Patients were also excluded if they were receiving an investigational drug or device for any reason in a clinical trial setting.

### Management of decompensated cirrhosis in the surgical ICU: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^53d338b5]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The presence of significant ascites and its abrupt drainage at the time of surgery can lead to PPCD, which is a rapid decompression of the splanchnic vasculature resulting in splanchnic vasodilatation, decrease in SVR with a decrease in intravascular volume, and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system. This in turn results in a more rapid re-accumulation of ascites, hyponatremia, renal insufficiency, and encephalopathy. Albumin administration is the main treatment. Intraoperative fluid management can be challenging and there is limited available evidence regarding whether albumin or crystalloid is preferred.

The accumulation of ascites in the postoperative period increases the risk of intra-abdominal infection, fluid leak from surgical sites, and wound dehiscence. The approach to the management of ascites in the postoperative cirrhotic patient is similar to preoperative strategies. However, hemodynamic status may preclude the use of salt restriction and diuretics. Paracentesis may be used in the setting of significant ascites not amenable to medical management or in the setting of fluid leak from surgical sites. In patients with refractory ascites, TIPS can be considered. However, since outcome data are limited, a multidisciplinary decision should be individualized to the clinical setting and type of surgical procedure. Of note, patients who already have an indication for primary or secondary SBP prophylaxis should have that continued in the postoperative setting; if patients cannot take oral medications, a third-generation cephalosporin can be given intravenously.

Placement of intra-abdominal drains at the time of surgery can allow drainage of ascites in order to reduce the risk of wound complications such as fluid leak and dehiscence. Some studies have shown no difference in ascites-related complications or major complications and the need for postoperative paracentesis. Others have demonstrated decreased ascites leakage and reduced hospital stay. Liu et al randomized 104 patients undergoing elective hepatic resection to drains versus no drains and demonstrated an increased morbidity due to wound complications from routine drainage. Notably, this was in elective patients and therefore may not translate to patients with DC. There is limited available evidence on surgical outcomes to recommend for or against the use of routine intra-abdominal drains. The decision should be individualized based on the clinical setting and the type of procedure. If used, drains should be removed as soon as possible. If not used, frequent LVP with albumin supplementation should be performed in the immediate postoperative setting while diuretics are being titrated.

Hyponatremia in cirrhosis — guidance statements by severity indicate that mild hyponatremia (Na 126–135 mEq/L) without symptoms does not require specific management apart from monitoring and water restriction, whereas water restriction to 1,000 mL/day and cessation of diuretics is recommended for moderate hyponatremia (120–125 mEq/L), and a more severe restriction of water intake with albumin infusion is recommended for severe hyponatremia (< 120 mEq/L).

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^10eb8fb2]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Hyponatremia in cirrhosis — severity and risks — is graded as mild (126–135 mEq/L), moderate (120–125 mEq/L), and severe (< 120 mEq/L). Patients with cirrhosis and serum Na ≤ 130 mEq/L are at increased risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy (odds ratio, 3.4), hepatorenal syndrome (HRS; odds ratio, 3.5), and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP; odds ratio, 2.4), with higher in-hospital and waitlist mortality; even patients with modest hyponatremia (serum Na 131–135 mEq/L) may be at increased risk. Mild hyponatremia often does not require specific management apart from monitoring and water restriction, whereas symptomatic hyponatremia, moderate or severe hyponatremia, and imminent liver transplantation (LT) may require specific management.

### The nutritional management of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis: international society for hepatic encephalopathy and nitrogen metabolism consensus [^0349406a]. Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Nitrogen metabolism plays a major role in the development of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in patients with cirrhosis. Modulation of this relationship is key to the management of HE, but is not the only nutritional issue that needs to be addressed. The assessment of nutritional status in patients with cirrhosis is problematic. In addition, there are significant sex-related differences in body composition and in the characteristics of tissue loss, which limit the usefulness of techniques based on measures of muscle mass and function in women. Techniques that combine subjective and objective variables provide reasonably accurate information and are recommended. Energy and nitrogen requirements in patients with HE are unlikely to differ substantially from those recommended in patients with cirrhosis per se viz. 35–45 kcal/g and 1.2–1.5g/kg protein daily. Small meals evenly distributed throughout the day and a late-night snack of complex carbohydrates will help minimize protein utilization. Compliance is, however, likely to be a problem. Diets rich in vegetables and dairy protein may be beneficial and are therefore recommended, but tolerance varies considerably in relation to the nature of the staple diet. Branched chain amino acid supplements may be of value in the occasional patient intolerant of dietary protein. Increasing dietary fiber may be of value, but the utility of probiotics is, as yet, unclear. Short-term multivitamin supplementation should be considered in patients admitted with decompensated cirrhosis. Hyponatremia may worsen HE; it should be prevented as far as possible and should always be corrected slowly.

Conclusion

Effective management of these patients requires an integrated multidimensional approach. However, further research is needed to fill the gaps in the current evidence base to optimize the nutritional management of patients with cirrhosis and HE.

### Recent developments in the management of acute and chronic hyponatremia [^02a35807]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of the study is to review recent studies on the management of acute and chronic hyponatremia.

Recent Findings

In acute symptomatic hyponatremia, bolus infusion of hypertonic saline improves hyponatremia and neurological status more quickly than continuous infusion. In chronic hyponatremia, newly identified predictors of nonresponse to fluid restriction include a high urine osmolality (> 500mOsm/kg) and high urine sodium (> 133mmol/l). Vasopressin-receptor antagonists effectively raise the serum sodium concentration in patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia but have a risk of overcorrection, even at low doses. Several observational studies now support the use of urea for a more gradual correction of hyponatremia without a risk of overcorrection. Recently identified risk factors for overcorrection include lower serum sodium at presentation, polydipsia, hypovolemia, and early urine output during treatment. Specific treatments with potential efficacy are the use of intravenous albumin for hyponatremia because of liver cirrhosis, and fludrocortisone for hyponatremia in tuberculous meningitis.

Summary

The recent data will help to further optimize and personalize the management of patients with acute and chronic hyponatremia. However, most data are still observational and retrospective. Therefore, the field is in need of prospective studies comparing interventions for chronic hyponatremia and focusing on patient-relevant outcomes.

### Vaptans: a promising therapy in the management of advanced cirrhosis [^c53ce89f]. Journal of Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Hyponatremia (serum sodium concentration, < 135 mmol/L) is a predictor of death among patients with chronic heart failure and cirrhosis. At present, therapy for acute and chronic hyponatremia is often ineffective and poorly tolerated. We investigated whether tolvaptan, an orally active vasopressin V(2)-receptor antagonist that promotes aquaresis — excretion of electrolyte-free water — might be of benefit in hyponatremia.

Methods

In two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, the efficacy of tolvaptan was evaluated in patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Patients were randomly assigned to oral placebo (223 patients) or oral tolvaptan (225) at a dose of 15mg daily. The dose of tolvaptan was increased to 30 mg daily and then to 60 mg daily, if necessary, on the basis of serum sodium concentrations. The two primary end points for all patients were the change in the average daily area under the curve for the serum sodium concentration from baseline to day 4 and the change from baseline to day 30.

Results

Serum sodium concentrations increased more in the tolvaptan group than in the placebo group during the first 4 days (P < 0.001) and after the full 30 days of therapy (P < 0.001). The condition of patients with mild or marked hyponatremia improved (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). During the week after discontinuation of tolvaptan on day 30, hyponatremia recurred. Side effects associated with tolvaptan included increased thirst, dry mouth, and increased urination. A planned analysis that combined the two trials showed significant improvement from baseline to day 30 in the tolvaptan group according to scores on the Mental Component of the Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short-Form General Health Survey.

Conclusions

In patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia, tolvaptan, an oral vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist, was effective in increasing serum sodium concentrations at day 4 and day 30. [Abstract reproduced by permission of N Engl J Med 2006;355:2099–2112].

### Vasopressin V2-receptor antagonists in patients with cirrhosis, ascites and hyponatremia [^25cf74a6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common problem in patients with advanced cirrhosis. It develops slowly (paralleling the rate of progression of the liver disease) and usually produces no neurological symptoms, although it may exacerbate hepatic encephalopathy. For patients awaiting liver transplantation a low serum sodium level is a strong predictor of pretransplant mortality, independent of the Model for End-stage Liver Disease score (MELD). The pathogenesis of hyponatremia is related to the hemodynamic changes and secondary neurohormonal adaptations that occur in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. The nonosmotic release of arginine vasopressin is the principle cause of the hyponatremia and vasopressin-receptor antagonists are a new class of drugs recently approved for treatment of cirrhotic hyponatremia. In this article we review the safety and efficacy of V2-receptor antagonists in patients with cirrhosis, ascites and hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^1438df03]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.

### Tolvaptan treatment improves survival of cirrhotic patients with ascites and hyponatremia [^7d48258d]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Although tolvaptan treatment improves hyponatremia, only few studies have investigated whether tolvaptan actually benefits the survival of cirrhotic patients. This study evaluated the impact of tolvaptan on six-month survival of decompensated cirrhotic patients with and without hyponatremia.

Methods

Two hundred forty-nine decompensated cirrhotic patients with or without hyponatremia were enrolled in a multicenter cohort study. Patients were divided into two groups according to receiving either tolvaptan or placebo treatment for 7-day. Subsequently, the patients were followed up for 6 months.

Results

Two hundred thirty patients, including 98 with hyponatremia (tolvaptan vs. placebo: 69 vs. 29) finished the study. Tolvaptan did not alter serum sodium levels and survival outcome of decompensated cirrhotic patients without hyponatremia. However, tolvaptan treatment remarkably improved serum sodium levels and six-month survival in patients with hyponatremia. Following tolvaptan treatment, serum sodium levels were restored to normal in 63.8% of patients, whereas in patients receiving placebo, only 36.2% showed the same effect (P < 0.05). Compared to a six-month survival rate of 68.97% in patients receiving placebo, the survival rate in tolvapatan-treated patients was 89.94% (P < 0.05). Furthermore, six-month survival rate in the tolvaptan-treated hyponatremia patients with resolved serum sodium was 81.32%, whereas the survival in those with unresolved serum sodium was only 24% (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Tolvaptan improves short term survival in most decompensated cirrhotic hyponatremia patients with resolved serum sodium.

Nonselective beta blockers (NSBBs) in decompensated cirrhosis with refractory ascites or after spontaneous bacterial peritonitis — current observational evidence does not support a harmful effect in most patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and in these patients the dose should be carefully titrated; in refractory ascites or SBP, high doses should be avoided and the dose should be reduced or discontinued with severe circulatory dysfunction such as severe hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg), hyponatremia (serum sodium < 130 mEq/L), or unexplained deterioration in renal function. NSBBs might be reintroduced after correction of renal function/ circulatory state, and refractory ascites and SBP are not absolute contraindications for treatment with NSBBs; in these patients, high doses of NSBBs (over 160 mg/day of propranolol or over 80 mg/day of nadolol) should be avoided, given that they might be associated with worse outcomes.

### Role of vaptans in the management of hyponatremia [^b4b1ae94]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia, the most commonly encountered electrolyte abnormality, affects as many as 30% of hospitalized patients. It is a powerful predictor of poor outcomes, especially in patients with congestive heart failure or cirrhosis. The failure to excrete electrolyte-free water that results from persistent secretion of antidiuretic hormone despite low serum osmolality usually underlies the development of hyponatremia. Treatment depends on several factors, including the cause, overall volume status of the patient, severity of hyponatremic symptoms, and duration of hyponatremia at presentation. This review focuses on the role of the vasopressin receptor antagonists, or vaptans, in the treatment of hyponatremia. These recently introduced agents have the unique ability to induce an aquaresis, the excretion of electrolyte-free water without accompanying solutes. After a brief historical perspective and discussion of pharmacologic characteristics of vaptans, we review the accumulated experience with vaptans for the treatment of hyponatremia. Vaptans have been shown to increase serum sodium concentrations in patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia in a reproducible manner, but their safe use requires full understanding of their indications and contraindications.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^f6859d27]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Nonselective beta-blockers (NSBBs) in patients with RA — evidence and guidance: Nonselective beta-blockers (NSBBs) are the standard of care for the prevention of variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, yet reports describe a higher likelihood of PPCD and shorter survival in decompensated cirrhosis, including patients with RA and SBP, while other publications found no impact on AKI development or on mortality even in severe liver dysfunction or acute-on-chronic liver failure. These results led to a "window period" hypothesis and it is noted that none of the cited studies are randomized controlled trials; in the only randomized controlled trial in compensated cirrhosis, NSBB use was associated with a reduced incidence of ascites. For now, we can only caution the use of NSBB in patients with RA, especially in those with hemodynamic abnormalities as indicated by low systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg, hyponatremia with serum sodium < 130 mmol/L, or serum creatinine of > 1.5 mg/dL; NSBBs might be reintroduced if circulatory dysfunction improves. Based on currently available data, NSBBs are not necessarily contraindicated in patients with RA, and caution is recommended in patients with hypotension, hyponatremia, or AKI.

Search results

We identified 1,402 citations, of which we excluded 1,367 after screening titles and abstracts because they did not meet our eligibility criteria (Figure 1). We assessed the full text of the remaining 39 citations and excluded 29 because they were not related to the diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia, were not clinical practice guidelines or consensus statements, or were guidelines replaced by an updated version (Additional file 4). Ultimately, we included five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Six of these documents were retrieved through searching the medical databases, the other four through the search of guideline databases and professional society websites.

Figure 1
Flow diagram of the identification process for clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements on hyponatremia.

Table 1 shows the general characteristics of the included clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements. Eight national or regional organizations from the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, Spain, United States, Australia, and two international groups published these guidance documents between 2004 and 2014. One document specifically covered children, the others primarily targeted adults. Six groups reported undertaking a systematic review and appraisal of the evidence. Only three were explicit about the level of evidence that underpinned their recommendations, and only two graded the strength of the guidance recommendations themselves. Five guidance documents covered hyponatremia broadly; one specifically covered it in the setting of primary care, one in liver cirrhosis, one in neurosurgery, and one in exercise-associated hyponatremia. Three included treatment only, the seven others covered diagnosis as well. Two groups reported funding by a governmental institution, one by the professional societies they represented; the others did not report their funding sources.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^e75a2a93]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for select patient populations have been published in some jurisdictions, particularly in patients with cirrhosis. The British Society for Gastroenterology published guidelines on the management of patients with cirrhosis and ascites. They recommend albumin for patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis or with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The French Society of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine and the French Association for the Study of the Liver jointly released guidelines for the management of liver failure in critical care. They recommend the use of albumin for hepatorenal syndrome (with terlipressin), large-volume paracentesis (> 5 L), and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The American Association for the Study of Liver Disease guidelines from 2021recommend the use of albumin for large-volume paracentesis, severe muscle cramps, severe hyponatremia (sodium < 120 mEq/L), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and hepatorenal syndrome. The Italian Association for the Study of Liver Disease and the Italian Society for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology guidelines update from 2020 include the use of albumin for ascites requiring moderate doses of diuretics as an outpatient treatment. This was an update from their 2016 guidelines that also recommended the use of albumin in patients requiring large-volume paracentesis, with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or with hepatorenal syndrome. Similarly, the European Association for the Study of the Liver 2018 guidelines detailing the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis recommended albumin for patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis, with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, with acute kidney injury without known cause, or with hepatorenal syndrome. The ICTMG guidelines are concordant with these guidelines for recommending albumin for large-volume paracentesis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, but report insufficient evidence to support its use in other settings. The use of albumin for hepatorenal syndrome, in conjunction with terlipressin, was recommended commonly in prior guidelines, likely based on both expert opinion and the fact that randomized trials used albumin in both treatment arms (albumin vs albumin plus terlipressin). We elected to refrain from making a recommendation without clinical trial evidence to support its use and highlight that this indication needs further study.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^bf06d4bc]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Hyponatremia in cirrhosis — osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) risk, correction limits, and short‑term therapies are specified, including that ODS is rare in liver transplantation (LT), occurring in an estimated 0.5%-1.5% of recipients, and the prototypical course has an onset 2 to 7 days after rapid serum sodium correction. For correction, a U.S. expert panel recommends a goal rate of change of serum sodium of 4–8 mEq/L per day, not to exceed 10–12 mEq in a 24-hour period, with average ODS risk, and a lower goal of 4–6 mEq/L per day, not to exceed 8 mEq per 24-hour period in patients at high risk, and if overcorrection occurs, relowering with dextrose-free water or desmopressin may be considered. Additional guidance states that when correction of chronic hyponatremia is indicated in cirrhosis, the goal rate of increase of serum Na is 4–6 mEq/L per 24-hour period, not to exceed 8 mEq/L per 24-hour period to ameliorate ODS risk; vasopressin receptor antagonists in cirrhosis can raise serum sodium but should be used with caution only for a short term (≤ 30 days); the use of hypertonic saline is reserved for short‑term treatment of symptomatic or severe hyponatremia or imminent LT; and severe hyponatremia (< 120 mEq/L) at time of LT increases the risk of ODS with LT.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^3df1d582]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Hyponatremia in cirrhosis with ascites — definition, prevalence, and evaluation: Hyponatremia, defined as a serum Na concentration ≤ 135 mEq/L, is present in nearly half (49%) of patients with cirrhosis and ascites, with over a fifth (22%) having serum Na levels ≤ 130 mEq/L. Most patients with cirrhosis, ascites, and hyponatremia have hypervolemic hyponatremia; however, hypovolemic and euvolemic hyponatremia should be considered. Hypovolemic hyponatremia can occur because of poor oral intake or from urinary or gastrointestinal losses related to an excess of diuretic or laxative treatments, respectively. Euvolemic hyponatremia is uncommon among patients with cirrhosis unless there is a specific cause, such as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, medications (e.g., sertraline, carbamazepine), and severe hypothyroidism or adrenal insufficiency. Symptoms of hyponatremia, although infrequent in patients with cirrhosis, range from nausea, muscle cramps, gait instability, lethargy, headache, and dizziness to confusion and seizure.

### An evidence-based approach to studies in cirrhosis and portal hypertension: medical management of mild to moderate ascites [^9b2a6ec9]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Previous articles in this series have examined the critical appraisal of isolated structured clinical questions using the framework of evidence-based medicine. When patients are identified with a disease-specific process, however, an integrated approach for addressing multiple questions is required. This article, the sixth in the evidence-based medicine series for this journal, integrates critical appraisal techniques to examine the decision-making process used when evaluating a patient with cirrhosis and new-onset mild to moderate ascites. In the following clinical scenario, an approach is described for determining prognosis after the development of ascites and whether salt restriction and oral diuretics are effective therapies. The format is similar to other evidence-based medicine articles published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The evidence-based medicine concepts have been expanded from previous articles, and examples from the hepatology literature have been used.

### Tolvaptan versus other interventions for hyponatraemia in people with cirrhosis [^1e3b0c4d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Solute‐free water excess in people with advanced cirrhosis can cause ascites or oedema and lead to electrolyte abnormalities. Using diuretics to treat ascites or oedema might make hyponatraemia (a low serum sodium level) worse, and hyponatraemia is the most common electrolyte problem in chronic liver disease (CLD). Hyponatraemia is an independent risk factor for hepatic encephalopathy and other adverse outcomes, including mortality. Literature has reported that the one‐year mortality rate in hyponatraemic people with cirrhosis can range between 30% and 60%, depending on the severity of hyponatraemia and associated complications. Reduction or discontinuation of diuretics and laxatives, along with the administration of hyperoncotic albumin, are considered key management strategies for the management of hyponatraemia in people with cirrhosis. Hypertonic saline is not recommended, as it may worsen the ascites, aggravate circulatory load, and even cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. A pharmacological strategy facilitates free‐water loss using vasopressin receptor antagonists, such as vaptans.

### Tolvaptan treatment improves survival of cirrhotic patients with ascites and hyponatremia [^efb02433]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

In contrast to its efficacy of tolvaptan in cirrhotic patients with hyponatremia, tolvaptan did not significantly alter serum sodium concentration and improve survival in cirrhotic patients without hyponatremia. Interestingly, placebo-treated patients who recovered from hyponatremia had significantly higher survival outcome than those who didn't. These results argue a crucial role of restoring hyponatremia for cirrhosis recovery. More than 80% hyponatremic patients who did not respond to tolvaptan treatment died of hepatorenal syndrome (data not shown). Therefore, it is very important to predicte the therapeutic response to tolvaptan in clinical practice. Several recent clinical studies showed that serum BUN/Cr ratio ≥ 17.5, urine Na/K ratio < 3.09, and decreased urinary aquaporin 2 levels were predictive of being non-responsiveness to tolvaptan. It is not totally clear why a short tolvaptan administration can improve survival in cirrhotic patients. Based on current knowledge, hyponatremia is the most important factors affecting the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis and ascites. Resolved hyponatremia may directly reduce the risk of hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome and spontaneous peritonitis in decompensated cirrhotic patients, which may directly improve survival in patients who respond to tolvaptan treatment. This might partially explain why the survival is significantly improved in resolved hyponatremia patients following tolvaptan treatment.

Considering the safety of patients, this clinical trial adopted low dosages of tolvaptan. These dosages are safe. No tolvaptan-associated side effects were reported in this study. Notably, whether increasing dosage can improve the efficacy of tolvaptan and thus increase response rate or survival rates in responders should be further investigated in the future clinical studies.

### Tolvaptan versus other interventions for hyponatraemia in people with cirrhosis [^6b3791c5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Hyponatraemia is a common and serious complication in cirrhosis, associated with poor outcomes such as hepatic encephalopathy, increased morbidity, and reduced quality of life. Management options include fluid restriction, albumin infusion, hypertonic saline, and vaptans, with tolvaptan being the most extensively studied. However, there are very few trials evaluating other vaptans (e.g. lixivaptan, satavaptan) for this condition, which limits comparative data across available pharmacologic options.

Tolvaptan is approved for hyponatraemia in people with cirrhosis in Japan and China, and for broader indications in hypervolaemic and euvolaemic hyponatraemia in the USA. Its use in cirrhosis, however, is constrained in many countries due to concerns about hepatotoxicity and regulatory limitations, particularly in Europe, where it is generally restricted to clinical trials or considered off‐label.

Although multiple trials and systematic reviews have assessed the efficacy of tolvaptan, most have focused on placebo‐controlled comparisons or single‐arm outcomes. A comprehensive and up‐to‐date synthesis comparing tolvaptan with other available interventions for hyponatraemia in cirrhosis is lacking. Treatment practices vary widely across regions, and clinical guidelines remain inconsistent. Furthermore, existing reviews are now outdated, and more recent trials have not been fully integrated into comparative analyses. Some reviews also lack a robust evaluation of alternative strategies such as albumin, hypertonic saline, or other vaptans. The SALT (Study of Ascending Levels of Tolvaptan in Hyponatraemia) trials, which were pivotal in the regulatory approval of tolvaptan, demonstrated significant short‐term improvements in serum sodium levels compared with placebo.

Given the ongoing unmet need for effective and safe management of hyponatraemia in cirrhosis, and the heterogeneity in vaptan use across countries, a comprehensive and up‐to‐date synthesis of all available vaptan data, including optimal dosing, duration, and safety, is essential to inform clinical practice and health policy.

Importantly, the clinical presentation and outcomes of cirrhosis and hyponatraemia may vary across ethnic groups, healthcare settings, and genetic backgrounds. Ethnic and genetic differences can influence disease progression and treatment response, while access to care and regional practice variation may impact prognosis.

### ACG clinical guideline: malnutrition and nutritional recommendations in liver disease [^68c8aa6f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Cirrhosis with ascites — dietary sodium and fluid restriction guidance: In patients with cirrhosis and ascites on diuretics, the guideline states it "cannot recommend for or against strict sodium restricted diets (Insufficient evidence, no recommendation)". The page notes that the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases "recommends moderate dietary sodium restriction to 2,000 mg/d (88 mEq of sodium per day) for clinically evident ascites in patients with cirrhosis". For fluid restriction, it reports "there are no high-quality randomized studies" and that "Fluid restriction is not required in the management of ascites"; however, "when the serum sodium falls below 125 mEq/L due to dilutional or isotonic hyponatremia, fluid restriction is recommended by most organizations including the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases".

### Interventions for chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia [^9de04996]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic (present > 48 hours) non-hypovolaemic hyponatraemia occurs frequently, can be caused by various conditions, and is associated with shorter survival and longer hospital stays. Many treatments, such as fluid restriction or vasopressin receptor antagonists can be used to improve the hyponatraemia, but whether that translates into improved patient-important outcomes is less certain.

Objectives

This review aimed to 1) look at the benefits and harms of interventions for chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia when compared with placebo, no treatment or head-to-head; and 2) determine if benefits and harms vary in absolute or relative terms dependent on the specific compound within a drug class, on the dosage used, or the underlying disorder causing the hyponatraemia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 1 December 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also screened the reference lists of potentially relevant studies, contacted authors, and screened the websites of regulatory agencies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared the effects of any intervention with placebo, no treatment, standard care, or any other intervention in patients with chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia. We also included subgroups with hyponatraemia from studies with broader inclusion criteria (e.g. people with chronic heart failure or people with cirrhosis with or without hyponatraemia), provided we could obtain outcomes for participants with hyponatraemia from the report or the study authors.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We expressed treatment effects as mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes (health-related quality of life, length of hospital stay, change from baseline in serum sodium concentration, cognitive function), and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes (death, response and rapid increase in serum sodium concentration, hypernatraemia, polyuria, hypotension, acute kidney injury, liver function abnormalities) together with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We identified 35 studies, enrolling 3429 participants. Twenty-eight studies (3189 participants) compared a vasopressin receptor antagonist versus placebo, usual care, no treatment, or fluid restriction. In adults with chronic, non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia, vasopressin receptor antagonists have uncertain effects on death at six months (15 studies, 2330 participants: RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.33) due to risk of selective reporting and serious imprecision; and on health-related quality of life because results are at serious risk of performance, selective reporting and attrition bias, and suffer from indirectness related to the validity of the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) in the setting of hyponatraemia. Vasopressin receptor antagonists may reduce hospital stay (low certainty evidence due to risk of performance bias and imprecision) (3 studies, 610 participants: MD -1.63 days, 95% CI -2.96 to -0.30), and may make little or no difference to cognitive function (low certainty evidence due to indirectness and imprecision). Vasopressin receptor antagonists probably increase the intermediate outcome of serum sodium concentration (21 studies, 2641 participants: MD 4.17 mmol/L, 95% CI 3.18 to 5.16), corresponding to two and a half as many people having a 5 to 6 mmol/L increase in sodium concentration compared with placebo at 4 to 180 days (moderate certainty evidence due to risk of attrition bias) (18 studies, 2014 participants: RR 2.49, 95% CI 1.95 to 3.18). But they probably also increase the risk of rapid serum sodium correction - most commonly defined as > 12 mmol/L/d (moderate certainty evidence due to indirectness) (14 studies, 2058 participants: RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.40) and commonly cause side-effects such as thirst (13 studies, 1666 participants: OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.80 to 4.27) and polyuria (6 studies, 1272 participants): RR 4.69, 95% CI 1.59 to 13.85) (high certainty evidence). The potential for liver toxicity remains uncertain due to large imprecision. Effects were generally consistent across the different agents, suggesting class effect. Data for other interventions such as fluid restriction, urea, mannitol, loop diuretics, corticosteroids, demeclocycline, lithium and phenytoin were largely absent.

Authors' Conclusions

In people with chronic hyponatraemia, vasopressin receptor antagonists modestly raise serum sodium concentration at the cost of a 3% increased risk of it being rapid. To date there is very low certainty evidence for patient-important outcomes; the effects on mortality and health-related quality of life are unclear and do not rule out appreciable benefit or harm; there does not appear to be an important effect on cognitive function, but hospital stay may be slightly shorter, although available data are limited. Treatment decisions must weigh the value of an increase in serum sodium concentration against its short-term risks and unknown effects on patient-important outcomes. Evidence for other treatments is largely absent. Further studies assessing standard treatments such as fluid restriction or urea against placebo and one-another would inform practice and are warranted. Given the limited available evidence for patient-important outcomes, any study should include these outcomes in a standardised manner.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^d256080a]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Current international hyponatremia guidelines differ in their recommendations regarding the use of tolvaptan. US expert panel recommendations, while acknowledging insufficient evidence for tolvaptan use with serum sodium less than 120 mmol/L, endorse its use as a second-line treatment, with appropriate monitoring and prompt intervention if the recommended rate of serum sodium increase is exceeded, and even raise the possibility that it may be a potential first-line therapy option in the future. European guidelines, however, recommend against the use of tolvaptan in moderate-profound hyponatremia, primarily out of concern regarding the potential risk of excessively rapid serum sodium correction. Other potential concerns raised about tolvaptan include cost and risk of liver function derangement seen with sustained higher-dose tolvaptan therapy used for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (up to 120 mg daily). A US FDA safety notice was issued in 2013 limiting the use of tolvaptan in hyponatremia to less than 30 days' duration, and removing the indication for patients with cirrhosis. Safe long-term tolvaptan use for up to 4 years has been reported in 111 participants in the SALTWATER trial (the SALT trial extension study), though 1 patient with cirrhosis developed hepatorenal syndrome and died, which was considered "possibly related" to tolvaptan use. So far, there are no reported cases of liver dysfunction directly attributed to the lower doses and typically short durations of tolvaptan in SIAD.

We use tolvaptan as a second-line therapy in selected inpatients and occasional outpatients with SIAD, typically when refractory to FR. Safety information recommends initiation and reinitiation in the hospital to allow monitoring. Careful patient selection is important, plus close monitoring of serum sodium and urine output, readiness to administer IV dextrose if correction targets are exceeded, and daily reevaluation of each dose. Based on existing evidence and clinical experience, we have developed the following recommendations for tolvaptan use (Table 8), which form the basis of an inpatient RCT protocol that is currently underway (ACTRN12619001683123), aiming to provide a prospective evidence base to evaluate these recommendations. We use tolvaptan less frequently in outpatients because of the product information recommending against long-term use, high cost, and limited monitoring capacity — in this situation we prefer oral urea.

### Management of hyponatremia [^18e583f0]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is an important electrolyte abnormality with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Common causes include medications and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Hyponatremia can be classified according to the volume status of the patient as hypovolemic, hypervolemic, or euvolemic. Hypervolemic hyponatremia may be caused by congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease. Differentiating between euvolemia and hypovolemia can be clinically difficult, but a useful investigative aid is measurement of plasma osmolality. Hyponatremia with a high plasma osmolality is caused by hyperglycemia, while a normal plasma osmolality indicates pseudohyponatremia or the post-transurethral prostatic resection syndrome. The urinary sodium concentration helps in diagnosing patients with low plasma osmolality. High urinary sodium concentration in the presence of low plasma osmolality can be caused by renal disorders, endocrine deficiencies, reset osmostat syndrome, SIADH, and medications. Low urinary sodium concentration is caused by severe burns, gastrointestinal losses, and acute water overload. Management includes instituting immediate treatment in patients with acute severe hyponatremia because of the risk of cerebral edema and hyponatremic encephalopathy. In patients with chronic hyponatremia, fluid restriction is the mainstay of treatment, with demeclocycline therapy reserved for use in persistent cases. Rapid correction should be avoided to reduce the risk of central pontine myelinolysis. Loop diuretics are useful in managing edematous hyponatremic states and chronic SIADH. In all instances, identifying the cause of hyponatremia remains an integral part of the treatment plan.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^49b760b9]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) in cirrhosis — unmet needs and research gaps span prevention, diagnostics, renal replacement therapy (RRT), and transplantation. The text notes that "AKI has a negative impact on survival; therefore, measures are required to avoid situations that lead to kidney injury", and that "kidney protective agents need to be developed", because "The uncertainty about efficacy and costs and logistics involved make weekly albumin administration an unattractive kidney-protective approach", with a call that "Orally administered drugs that can reverse the splanchnic vasodilation and restore effective arterial blood volume need to be developed". Diagnostic limitations include reliance on serum creatinine, "which is not an ideal measure of glomerular filtration, especially in women and children", alongside "Accurate measures of glomerular filtration using iothalamate clearance are expensive and have limited availability". Differentiating "HRS-AKI and ATN is difficult in many situations and may require a kidney biopsy", yet "The strategy of kidney biopsy is also problematic", and although "Biomarkers such as NGAL may differentiate between HRS-AKI and ATN [they] are currently not available for clinical use", so "there is the need for easily available biomarkers" to stage AKI and assess reversibility. The therapeutic field requires clarification because "The role of RRT and dose needs to be better defined. Specifically, the type and duration of RRT need to be studied further such that rules for initiation of RRT as well as discontinuation of RRT can be developed". Additional gaps include that "Hyponatremia is almost universal in patients with HRS-AKI, but optimal treatment measures are yet unclear and need to be defined". For advanced care, "LT is the definitive treatment for HRS-AKI", yet selection between LT alone and simultaneous liver–kidney transplant remains unclear and "the current MELD-based allocation system for LT lowers priority for LT for patients with HRS-AKI who respond to pharmacological treatment", suggesting the need to preserve LT priority even after creatinine improvement. Finally, evidence generation should incorporate endpoints beyond survival because "No studies have been conducted using patient-reported outcomes, an important and direct endpoint".

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^bde7f294]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Abdominal distension attributable to refractory ascites — palliative options and outcomes include the following: Large volume paracentesis (LVP) requires multiple visits to the hospital and can be burdensome, and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an option but many patients with refractory ascites are not candidates because of encephalopathy, cardiac contraindications, or high MELD scores. Indwelling peritoneal drains or catheters have been evaluated for palliation, and a systematic review including 176 patients reported patients' MELD scores ranged from 10 to 22, technical success was 100% with noninfectious complications generally low (< 12%), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis occurred in 0%–42% with an overall combined rate of 17%, and other complications included cellulitis at the catheter insertion site (6%), transient hyponatremia (11%), and increased serum creatinine (8%). A 12-week, small feasibility, unblinded randomized controlled trial compared LVP to long-term abdominal drains in 36 transplant-ineligible patients with refractory ascites, noted no drain-related serious adverse events or drain removals attributable to complications, found patients in the LVP group had more than double the ascites-related hospital time than the drain group, observed self-limiting cellulitis/leakage 41% versus 11% and peritonitis 6% versus 11%, and reported overall attrition 42% with deaths 7 of 16 and 5 of 18; at study end, all surviving drain participants elected to retain the drains.

### The management of ascites in cirrhosis: report on the consensus conference of the international ascites club [^a2e968be]. Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Ascites is a common complication of cirrhosis, and heralds a new phase of hepatic decompensation in the progression of the cirrhotic process. The development of ascites carries a significant worsening of the prognosis. It is important to diagnose noncirrhotic causes of ascites such as malignancy, tuberculosis, and pancreatic ascites since these occur with increased frequency in patients with liver disease. The International Ascites Club, representing the spectrum of clinical practice from North America to Europe, have developed guidelines by consensus in the management of cirrhotic ascites from the early ascitic stage to the stage of refractory ascites. Mild to moderate ascites should be managed by modest salt restriction and diuretic therapy with spironolactone or an equivalent in the first instance. Diuretics should be added in a stepwise fashion while maintaining sodium restriction. Gross ascites should be treated with therapeutic paracentesis followed by colloid volume expansion, and diuretic therapy. Refractory ascites is managed by repeated large volume paracentesis or insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPS). Successful placement of TIPS results in improved renal function, sodium excretion, and general well-being of the patient but without proven survival benefits. Clinicians caring for these patients should be aware of the potential complications of each treatment modality and be prepared to discontinue diuretics or not proceed with TIPS placement should complications or contraindications develop. Liver transplantation should be considered for all ascitic patients, and this should preferably be performed prior to the development of renal dysfunction to prevent further compromise of their prognosis.

### The management of acute and chronic hyponatraemia [^82a9279c]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment of hypervolemic hyponatraemia

A combination of fluid and salt restriction and loop diuretics, plus neurohormonal antagonism is the recommended first-line approach for hyponatraemia in the settings of heart and liver failure. Vaptans offer an attractive alternative or adjunct to loop diuretics, as they are potassium neutral and cause less neuro-hormonal activation from intravascular volume depletion compared with diuretics, and tolvaptan is an FDA-approved treatment for hypervolaemic hyponatraemia. Forty-three percent of patients recruited into the SALT RCTs of tolvaptan mentioned earlier had hypervolemic hyponatraemia, and although subgroup analyses of this group were not published separately, tolvaptan was shown to produce a significantly greater rise in pNa compared with placebo in the overall group. Several large RCTs have subsequently confirmed tolvaptan's beneficial effect on plasma sodium, weight and dyspnoea in heart failure patients, while in patients with hyponatraemia and ascites, short term tolvaptan use has been shown to normalise plasma sodium in 27–50% of patients. The routine use of tolvaptan is not recommended in patients with cirrhosis, based on the liver injury seen in higher doses used in the TEMPO trial.

Treatment of hypovolaemic hyponatraemia

Volume replacement with isotonic saline, and specific management of the underlying cause, form the approach to management of hypovolaemic hyponatraemia. Correction of hypovolaemia eliminates the stimulus for AVP secretion resulting in a rapid aquaresis which can potentially lead to overcorrection, and thus careful monitoring is required. Treatment of thiazide diuretic induced hyponatraemia requires particular caution as withdrawal of the drug combined with correction of hypovolaemia may result in a rapid aquaresis
