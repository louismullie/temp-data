## Question

Types of breathing

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the types of breathing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational normal breathing pattern and its neural control. Then, I should categorize spontaneous breathing variations and their clinical relevance. Next, I will examine therapeutic or trained breathing techniques and their evidence base. After that, I need to review disordered breathing patterns and their pathophysiology. Finally, I will consider special contexts like mechanical ventilation, perinatal transitions, and neuroimaging confounders, and close with a concise synthesis that preserves the hierarchy and evidence strength.

> Let me first confirm the baseline: normal breathing at rest is eupnea, a subconscious, rhythmic pattern generated by brainstem circuits including the preBötzinger Complex, with tidal volume and rate matched to metabolic needs and modulated by chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors. This is the reference against which all other patterns are defined [^fa6099f8] [^c2c7ee11].

> Wait, let me verify the common spontaneous variations that deviate from eupnea. Sighs are periodic larger breaths that reinflate collapsed alveoli and are universal in healthy individuals. Yawns are deep, prolonged inspirations often associated with arousal or sleepiness. Hyperpnea reflects increased depth and/or rate with exercise or metabolic demand. Hypopnea is shallow breathing, and apnea is cessation of airflow, with these patterns often studied in sleep-disordered breathing contexts and in neuroimaging where they can confound resting-state fMRI signals via CO2-mediated cerebrovascular effects [^de86ebf5] [^75d1af92].

> Hold on, I should verify the neuroimaging-specific patterns because they are often overlooked clinically. In large resting-state fMRI datasets, two prevalent non-eupneic patterns are described: single deep breaths and burst patterns (serial taperings of respiratory depth over minutes). These have distinct cardiovascular correlates, timescales, and sex distributions, and they materially alter functional connectivity, which means they can masquerade as neural effects if not accounted for in preprocessing and interpretation [^10ee62e5] [^3ef9c179].

> Next, I will examine therapeutic or trained breathing techniques. Slow deep breathing, diaphragmatic breathing, and pursed-lips breathing are commonly used to modulate autonomic tone, reduce dynamic hyperinflation, and alleviate dyspnea. Evidence spans pulmonary rehabilitation, COPD symptom control, and palliative care, though study sizes are often modest and heterogeneity is substantial, so I need to be cautious about overgeneralization [^b7b2e254] [^7d9cfdf3] [^54c6e11a].

> I should double-check the evidence base for specific conditions. In asthma, breathing exercises show improvements in quality of life and some symptom domains, but effects on lung function are inconsistent and certainty varies by outcome. In COPD, pursed-lips breathing and strategies that slow respiratory rate can reduce dyspnea and dynamic hyperinflation. In dysfunctional breathing, breathing retraining is first-line, though pediatric evidence remains sparse. And in long COVID, dysfunctional breathing patterns are common and responsive to targeted physiotherapy, which aligns with clinical observations and expert guidance [^5172450c] [^b7b2e254] [^0a427f71] [^e654ad64].

> Let me consider disordered breathing patterns and their mechanisms. Hyperventilation syndrome features increased minute ventilation with low PaCO2 and symptoms like dizziness and paresthesias. Cheyne-Stokes respiration reflects periodic crescendo–decrescendo ventilation with apneas, typically in heart failure or stroke due to feedback-control instability. Obstructive sleep apnea entails repeated upper airway collapse despite effort, whereas central sleep apnea reflects absent ventilatory drive; both carry cardiovascular consequences and require phenotype-aware management rather than a one-size-fits-all approach [^0a427f71] [^20d4c858] [^af794e86] [^3f1b7176].

> But wait, what if the "type" of breathing is defined by the ventilatory context rather than the pattern itself. In mechanical ventilation, modes are classified by control variable, breath sequence, and targeting scheme; spontaneous breaths can coexist with mandatory breaths in IMV variants, and newer modes like PAV or NAVA aim to preserve physiologic variability and improve synchrony, which can influence gas exchange and diaphragmatic function in critical illness [^049a926b] [^982b192d] [^8620a35e].

> I need to check special transitional states. In very preterm infants, the fetal-to-neonatal transition features distinct breath types — tidal breathing, braking, and holding — with holding breaths facilitating early lung aeration via pendelluft redistribution; this mechanistic insight helps explain why some neonates require little intervention while others need sustained support [^703f5275].

> Hold on, I should verify the neurobiological control distinctions that underpin these patterns. Automatic breathing is governed by brainstem rhythm generators, while voluntary breathing engages cortical and subcortical circuits. State-dependent control from pontine regions can abruptly shift breathing patterns in awake animals, highlighting how higher-order brain states modulate the respiratory rhythm beyond simple chemoreflex loops [^fa6099f8] [^d890f548].

> Let me reconsider the clinical implications so I don't jump to conclusions. Recognizing whether a patient's breathing pattern reflects eupnea, a benign variation, a therapeutic technique, or a pathophysiologic disorder guides management: screen for dysfunctional breathing in unexplained dyspnea, tailor breathing retraining to the phenotype, and in sleep-disordered breathing, phenotype and endotype-directed therapy outperform AHI-only strategies. In critical care, preserve spontaneous effort and variability when safe to do so, and in neuroimaging, regress out respiratory artifacts to avoid false inferences [^0a427f71] [^3f1b7176] [^8620a35e] [^10ee62e5].

> In summary, I should confirm the hierarchy clearly: start with eupnea as the normal baseline. Then consider spontaneous variations like sighs, yawns, hyperpnea, hypopnea, and apnea. Next, review trained techniques such as slow deep, diaphragmatic, and pursed-lips breathing. After that, classify disordered patterns including hyperventilation, Cheyne-Stokes, obstructive and central sleep apnea. Finally, account for context-specific types in mechanical ventilation, perinatal transition, and neuroimaging confounders, ensuring each claim aligns with the strength of evidence and clinical relevance [^fa6099f8] [^de86ebf5] [^b7b2e254] [^af794e86] [^049a926b] [^703f5275] [^10ee62e5].

Breathing types can be categorized by **mechanism** and **clinical context**. Mechanistically, breathing is either **automatic (eupnea)** — the default, unconscious rhythm generated by the brainstem [^fa6099f8] — or **voluntary/controlle**d, initiated by the cortex for tasks like speech or exercise [^dee4b819]. Clinically, **normal breathing** is eupnea at rest, whereas **disordered breathing** includes obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, hyperventilation, and hypoventilation, each with distinct pathophysiology and consequences [^af794e86] [^20d4c858]. Therapeutic breathing (e.g. pursed-lip, diaphragmatic, box breathing) is used to improve symptoms in COPD, anxiety, and other conditions [^b7b2e254] [^c4856a6d]. Mechanical ventilation modes (e.g. CMV, SIMV, PSV) are classified by control variables and breath sequences to support patients with respiratory failure [^982b192d] [^049a926b].

## Mechanistic classification

Breathing can be classified by **mechanism** into two main types:

| **Type** | **Description** | **Control center** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Automatic breathing | Unconscious, rhythmic respiration maintained by the brainstem | Pre-Bötzinger complex in the medulla | - Eupnea (normal breathing) <br/> - Periodic breathing in infants [^fa6099f8] [^88ea10b6] |
| Voluntary/controlled breathing | Conscious, intentional control of respiration | Cerebral cortex | - Speech <br/> - Singing <br/> - Breath-holding <br/> - Meditation breathing [^dee4b819] |

---

## Clinical classification

Clinically, breathing is classified as **normal or disordered** based on pattern and underlying pathology:

| **Category** | **Type** | **Description** | **Clinical examples** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Normal breathing | Eupnea | Regular, rhythmic breathing at rest | Healthy individuals [^de86ebf5] |
| Disordered breathing | Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) | Repeated upper airway collapse during sleep despite effort | - Loud snoring <br/> - Daytime sleepiness <br/> - Cardiovascular risk [^af794e86] [^aaca2b90] |
| Disordered breathing | Central sleep apnea (CSA) | Lack of respiratory drive causing repeated apneas | - Heart failure <br/> - Stroke <br/> - Opioid use [^3204ace5] [^7f7f3000] |
| Disordered breathing | Cheyne-Stokes respiration | Cyclic crescendo-decrescendo pattern with apneas | Heart failure and stroke [^20d4c858] |
| Disordered breathing | Hyperventilation | Excessive ventilation lowering CO2 | - Anxiety <br/> - Panic attacks <br/> - Metabolic acidosis [^0a427f71] |
| Disordered breathing | Hypoventilation | Inadequate ventilation raising CO2 | - Obesity hypoventilation <br/> - Sedative overdose <br/> - Neuromuscular disease [^notfound] |

---

## Therapeutic breathing techniques

Several **breathing techniques** are used therapeutically to manage symptoms and improve function:

- **Pursed-lip breathing**: Prolongs expiration, reduces dynamic hyperinflation, and improves dyspnea in COPD [^b7b2e254].
- **Diaphragmatic breathing**: Encourages abdominal excursion, reduces respiratory rate, and improves efficiency [^5172450c].
- **Box breathing**: Equal-duration inhale, hold, exhale, and pause; used for stress and anxiety management [^notfound].
- **Buteyko method**: Focuses on nasal breathing and reduced ventilation; studied in asthma management [^5172450c].

---

## Mechanical ventilation modes

In critical care, **mechanical ventilation** is classified by control variables and breath sequences:

- **Controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV)**: Ventilator controls rate and tidal volume; no spontaneous effort [^notfound].
- **Assist-control ventilation (ACV)**: Ventilator triggers with patient effort; delivers full breaths [^notfound].
- **Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV)**: Mix of mandatory and spontaneous breaths [^049a926b].
- **Pressure support ventilation (PSV)**: Patient-triggered breaths with pressure assistance [^8620a35e].
- **Proportional assist ventilation (PAV)**: Pressure support proportional to patient effort [^8620a35e].

---

Breathing types span automatic and voluntary control, normal and disordered patterns, and therapeutic and ventilatory modes; **recognizing these categories** supports accurate diagnosis and targeted interventions across clinical scenarios.

Key messages

• In pigs with different types of experimental acute lung injury, spontaneous breathing during airway pressure release ventilation leads to an improvement in oxygenation by a reduction in shunt fraction.

• Spontaneous breathing during pressure-controlled ventilation restores aeration in previously non-aerated lung regions, independently of the type of lung injury.

• The cardiac output during pressure-controlled ventilation with suppressed spontaneous breathing is higher than with maintained spontaneous breathing, and oxygen delivery is unaffected.

### Breathing interventions for spinal pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c4856a6d]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

ObjectiveIndividuals with spinal pain often show breathing dysfunctions. Although the effects of breathing interventions in general have been studied, no distinctions regarding types of breathing interventions were made. Therefore, we summarized the effects of different types of breathing interventions on spinal pain and disability.Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, PEDro, Cochrane, PsycArticles, and Embase were systematically searched till September 2, 2025.Review methodsStudies that described therapies using active instructions to modulate breathing or increase breathing awareness in adults with spinal pain were eligible. Breathing interventions were categorized into slow deep breathing, respiratory resistive breathing, and breathing awareness. Effects were subdivided into additional (breathing intervention+other intervention vs. other intervention) and comparative effects (breathing intervention vs. other intervention). The Downs and Black checklist was used to assess methodological quality. Meta-analyses were performed with standardized mean differences, and certainty of evidence was evaluated based on the GRADE assessment.ResultsTwenty studies involving 814 participants were included. Seventeen were of fair to good quality, three of poor quality. Meta-analyses revealed that slow deep breathing positively affected spinal pain ( n =223; SMD=-1.03; low certainty of evidence) and disability ( n =132; SMD=-1.34; very low certainty of evidence) when added to other interventions. Moreover, respiratory resistive breathing decreased spinal pain compared to other interventions ( n =75; SMD=-1.31; low certainty of evidence).ConclusionBreathing interventions may be valuable for the management of patients with spinal pain. Clinicians should be aware of, and consider, the various types of breathing interventions and their underlying mechanisms to tailor them to the treatment goals of their patients.

### Pain and respiration: a systematic review [^f676ba25]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

Breathing techniques are commonly used to alleviate pain. Despite their frequent use, surprisingly little is known about their efficacy as well as their underlying physiological mechanisms. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize and critically appraise the results of existing studies on the association between respiration and pain, and to highlight a potential physiological mechanism underlying the respiration-pain connection. A total of 31 publications from between 1984 and 2015 were retrieved and analyzed. These articles were classified into 4 groups: experimental and clinical studies of the effect of pain on respiration, clinical studies of the effects of breathing techniques on pain, and experimental studies of the influence of various forms of respiration on laboratory-induced pain. The findings suggest that pain influences respiration by increasing its flow, frequency, and volume. Furthermore, paced slow breathing is associated with pain reduction in some of the studies, but evidence elucidating the underlying physiological mechanisms of this effect is lacking. Here, we focus on the potential role of the cardiovascular system on the respiratory modulation of pain. Further research is definitely warranted.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^20914ae2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society statement—conclusions on dyspnea indicate progress in understanding mechanisms but persistent gaps in treatment: since the original consensus statement in 1999 there has been substantial progress in research into mechanisms of dyspnea, but there has been little progress in treatment; despite advances in therapy for cardiopulmonary disorders, there are millions of patients who are severely disabled by breathlessness; the duty to alleviate suffering must remain a top priority, and the document aims to summarize what has been achieved and what remains to allow patients to enjoy breathing.

### Breathing matters [^fa6099f8]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2018). Medium credibility.

Breathing is a well-described, vital and surprisingly complex behaviour, with behavioural and physiological outputs that are easy to directly measure. Key neural elements for generating breathing pattern are distinct, compact and form a network amenable to detailed interrogation, promising the imminent discovery of molecular, cellular, synaptic and network mechanisms that give rise to the behaviour. Coupled oscillatory microcircuits make up the rhythmic core of the breathing network. Primary among these is the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC), which is composed of excitatory rhythmogenic interneurons and excitatory and inhibitory pattern-forming interneurons that together produce the essential periodic drive for inspiration. The preBötC coordinates all phases of the breathing cycle, coordinates breathing with orofacial behaviours and strongly influences, and is influenced by, emotion and cognition. Here, we review progress towards cracking the inner workings of this vital core.

### The evolution of intermittent mandatory ventilation [^049a926b]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) is one kind of breath sequence used to classify a mode of ventilation. IMV is defined as the ability for spontaneous breaths (patient triggered and patient cycled) to exist between mandatory breaths (machine triggered or machine cycled). Over the course of more than a century, IMV has evolved into 4 distinct varieties, each with its own advantages and disadvantages in serving the goals of mechanical ventilation (ie, safety, comfort, and liberation). The purpose of this paper is to describe the evolution of IMV, review relevant supporting evidence, and discuss the rationales for each of the 4 varieties. Also included is a brief overview of the background information required for a proper perspective of the purpose and design of the innovations. Understanding these different forms of IMV is essential to recognizing the similarities and differences among many dozens of different modes of ventilation. This recognition is important for clinical application, education of caregivers, and research in mechanical ventilation.

### Apneas, hypopneas, and respiratory effort-related arousals: moving closer to a standard [^75d1af92]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The spectrum of sleep disordered breathing ranges from intermittent snoring to the obesity hypoventilation syndrome with the obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome fitting somewhere in between. Recently, improved definitions and monitoring techniques are allowing for clearer differentiation of the syndromes within this spectrum. These new standards have also produced better understanding of the prognosis and treatment options for patients fitting into different points within this spectrum. Furthermore, effective communication of current definitions and techniques has resulted in improved reimbursement for the treatments of patients with sleep disordered breathing.

### The active cycle of breathing technique: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7c8aa8f6]. Respiratory Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Question

What is the best available research evidence (volume, quality, consistency, generalisability) for the active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT)?

Design

Systematic review with meta-analysis.

Participants

Participants with respiratory conditions characterised by chronic sputum production.

Intervention

The active cycle of breathing or forced expiratory technique. COMPARATOR: All comparators including control conditions.

Outcome Measures

All outcomes providing continuous data.

Results

Twenty-four studies were included. Ten comparators were identified with the most common being conventional chest physiotherapy, positive expiratory pressure and a control. The outcomes most frequently assessed were sputum wet weight (n = 17), forced vital capacity (n = 12) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (n = 12). Meta-analysis was completed on the primary outcome of sputum wet weight. The standardised mean difference (SMD, random effects) showed an increase in sputum wet weight during and up to 1 h post ACBT compared to conventional physiotherapy (SMD 0.32, 95%CI 0.05-0.59), external oscillatory devices (0.75, 0.48-1.02), and control (0.24, 0.02-0.46).

Conclusion

The overall body of evidence was classified as good (good volume, quality and consistency, excellent generalisability). High level, variable risk of bias research evidence favours ACBT over most alternatives for short-term improvements in secretion clearance.

### Sleep apnea: types, mechanisms, and clinical cardiovascular consequences [^aaca2b90]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Sleep apnea is highly prevalent in patients with cardiovascular disease. These disordered breathing events are associated with a profile of perturbations that include intermittent hypoxia, oxidative stress, sympathetic activation, and endothelial dysfunction, all of which are critical mediators of cardiovascular disease. Evidence supports a causal association of sleep apnea with the incidence and morbidity of hypertension, coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, heart failure, and stroke. Several discoveries in the pathogenesis, along with developments in the treatment of sleep apnea, have accumulated in recent years. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of sleep apnea, the evidence that addresses the links between sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease, and research that has addressed the effect of sleep apnea treatment on cardiovascular disease and clinical endpoints. Finally, we review the recent development in sleep apnea treatment options, with special consideration of treating patients with heart disease. Future directions for selective areas are suggested.

### Treatment of depression and poor quality of life through breathing training in hemodialysis patients [^b56b9808]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

A breathing training program that includes different types of deep-breathing exercises is considered the first step in learning relaxation skills. A breathing training program successfully helps solve issues related to anxiety, stress, fatigue, and sleep [,,–]. Many studies have found that breathing training programs successfully reduce some depression symptoms associated with lower quality of life. Studies have used different types of relaxation and breathing exercises and reported their benefits for hemodialysis patients. In the current study, the three types of breathing exercises used: alternating nostril breathing exercise, 4-7-8 breathing exercise, and diaphragmatic breathing. The application of some of these exercises appears to be easier than others. One could argue that using the three types may be burdensome for patients. As part of this preliminary investigation, there was a need to assess the viability of the application of this bundle of exercises in a single program. Future longitudinal studies are needed to compare the efficacy of different types of breathing exercises.

### Take a deep, resisted, breath [^bf6a8362]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The cardiovascular and respiratory systems exist in series with the lungs, situated between the right and left sides of the circulation. Thus, breathing directly effects the cardiovascular system. How the circulation and respiration became separated into different “systems,” disciplines of study, and specialties in clinical medicine is an interesting epistemological and historical question, but the separation aside, one of the main symptoms of congestive heart failure is shortness of breath. Likewise, patients with structural lung disease frequently develop pulmonary hypertension and subsequent right‐sided heart failure. In addition, the outcome of a simple cardiopulmonary exercise test is a remarkable predictor of all‐cause mortality, and exercise is one of the best things an individual can do to promote cardiovascular health.

The pressure generated with a breath and the expansion of the lungs influence the volumes and pressures in the chambers of the heart and blood vessels. These changes, in turn, stimulate sensory nerves that influence the autonomic nervous system and the rate and depth of breathing.The pattern generators in the brainstem that drive and regulate heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing are also closely aligned.With exercise, a “central command” from higher brain centers accelerates the activity of “both” systems and sends feed‐forward signals to the brain stem in preparation for the increased metabolic demands of exercise.

Breathing can also be therapeutic. This ranges from the simple advice to “take a deep breath,” to ancient meditative and religious traditions, to studies showing that structured deep breathing programs can reduce anxiety,help manage pain,improve blood glucose,and lower blood pressure.Patients with lung disease and sleep apnea can also benefit from respiratory muscle training.Respiratory frequency is a key component of perceived exertion, and anecdotal reports indicate that elite athletes sometimes attempt to control or regulate their breathing during competition to maximize their focus and relaxation during peak competitive efforts.

During whole body exercise, minute ventilation can exceed 100 L/min in healthy young subjects during high‐intensity exercise, and values exceeding 250 L/min have been reported in large male rowers.Minute ventilations of this magnitude require substantial muscular work and oxygen consumption by the respiratory muscles.They also require, like all skeletal muscles, blood flow to sustain the contractions without fatigue.

### Prevalent and sex-biased breathing patterns modify functional connectivity MRI in young adults [^04c12d44]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Results

Two distinct breathing patterns in subjects at rest

We begin by presenting individual instances of respiratory patterns, then group descriptions, then demographic differences in pattern prevalence, and then the spatiotemporal effects of the breathing patterns and their distinct consequences for fMRI signal covariance. We focus initially on visual presentations, for these were how we first recognized the patterns.

To detect influences of respiration on resting-state fMRI signals, we created and viewed plots of 1760 scans representing 440 h of scanning in 440 young adults. In addition to eupnea, we came to recognize two common patterns of respiration. One pattern was known to us, which we term a single deep breath, a lone breath considerably larger than the surrounding breaths. The other pattern was unfamiliar to us, and is undescribed in the neuroimaging literature to our knowledge; we call it a burst pattern.

### Understanding dyspnoea by its language [^9b7ca0db]. The European Respiratory Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Dyspnoea is a general term used to characterise a range of qualitatively distinct descriptors that vary in intensity. Based on the hypothesis that various qualities of respiratory discomfort result from different pathophysiological abnormalities, language could help to define one or more of the abnormalities responsible for breathing discomfort. The use of descriptors of dyspnoea may contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of dyspnoea, and assist in identifying or predicting a specific diagnosis. Symptoms that can be reliably discriminated imply different pathophysiological mechanisms, whereas symptoms that cannot be reliably discriminated imply similar pathophysiological mechanisms. Since dyspnoea is a fundamental part of patient's clinical history, physicians should become more fluent in the language of dyspnoea.

### Prevalent and sex-biased breathing patterns modify functional connectivity MRI in young adults [^de86ebf5]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning of subjects at rest has become a major neuroimaging paradigm, termed functional connectivity or resting state MRI. In these scans, subjects lie quietly, often staring at a crosshair, for 5–15 min or more, performing no particular instructed task while fMRI data are acquired. Correlations in task-free fMRI signals are thought to reflect the functional relatedness of the tissues producing those signals, and the spatial topography of signal correlations has been leveraged to yield new and increasingly refined macro-scale maps of the human brain –. These scans have the potential to deliver diagnostic and prognostic information, and large studies are now underway that use resting-state fMRI scans as cornerstones of the datasets, e.g. the ABCD study scanning 10,000 children for biomarkers of developmental trajectories.

Breathing modifies the concentration of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, which is a potent modulator of cerebral blood flow, and thus the fMRI signal,. When subjects breathe deeply or quickly (i.e. hyperpnea) they exhale more CO 2, arterial pCO 2 drops, cerebral blood flow decreases, and fMRI signals decrease; conversely, if breathing is shallow or slow (or stopped) (i.e. hypopnea or apnea), less CO 2 is released, arterial pCO 2 rises, cerebral blood flow increases, and fMRI signals increase. In this manner, breathing patterns can influence resting-state fMRI scans.

Breathing occurs in multiple forms. The basic respiratory rhythm is a cyclic rhythm termed eupnea, which moves a tidal volume of air into and out of the lungs in each breath. But a variety of deviations from eupnea exist, from the sighs exhibited by all humans that reinflate collapsed portions of the lung, to yawns of boredom or sleepiness, to more marked forms of disordered breathing, including cluster breathing, ataxic breathing, or periodic breathing (e.g. Hunter–Cheyne–Stokes), forms of respiration often associated with heart disease or neurological injury. Beyond having different generative neural mechanisms, different kinds of breathing may have distinct biophysical correlates and consequences for neuroimaging.

### Classification of ventilator modes: update and proposal for implementation [^5b2184c3]. Respiratory Care (2007). Low credibility.

Ventilator manufacturers and the respiratory care academic community have not yet adopted a standardized system for classifying and describing ventilation modes. As a result, there is enough confusion that potential sales, education, and patient care are all put at risk. This proposal summarizes a ventilator-mode classification scheme and complete lexicon that has been extensively published over the last 15 years. Specifically, the classification system has 3 components: (1) a description of the breathing pattern and control variables within breaths, (2) a description of control type used within and between breaths, (3) a detailed description of adjunctive operational algorithms. This 3-level specification provides scalability of detail to make the mode description appropriate for the particular need. At the bedside we need only refer to a mode briefly using the first component. To distinguish between similar modes and brand names we would need to use at least the first and second components. For a complete and unique mode specification (as in an operator's manual) we would use all 3 components. The classification system proposed in this article uses the equation of motion for the respiratory system as the underlying theoretical framework. All terms relevant to describing ventilation modes are defined in an extensive glossary.

### Trials directly comparing alternative spontaneous breathing trial techniques: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^caf7d531]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Data synthesis

We pooled data across studies using random effects models. We derived summary estimates of RR and mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for binary and continuous outcomes, respectively, using Review Manager 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). We pooled ‘initial SBT success’ in trials that conducted more than one SBT. We evaluated statistical heterogeneity for each outcome using the I 2 measure with thresholds of 0–40% (might not be important), 30–60% (moderate), 50–90% (substantial), and > 75% (considerable). We summarized trials based on the techniques compared (e.g. T-piece vs other) (Additional file 1).

We planned subgroup analyses to compare the effects of different techniques on primary outcomes in perioperative vs nonperioperative trials and based on: duration of ventilation at randomization (nonperioperative trials); the support provided during SBTs; the type of lung disease; and methodologic quality (low/moderate vs high RoB). We assessed for subgroup differences using the chi-square test.

We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to assess the quality of the body of evidence associated with the primary outcomes and significant secondary outcomes. We assessed for publication bias when at least 10 trials were identified. A written protocol was used to guide the review process.

### Control of ventilation in health and disease [^c2c7ee11]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Control of ventilation occurs at different levels of the respiratory system through a negative feedback system that allows precise regulation of levels of arterial carbon dioxide and oxygen. Mechanisms for ventilatory instability leading to sleep-disordered breathing include changes in the genesis of respiratory rhythm and chemoresponsiveness to hypoxia and hypercapnia, cerebrovascular reactivity, abnormal chest wall and airway reflexes, and sleep state oscillations. One can potentially stabilize breathing during sleep and treat sleep-disordered breathing by identifying one or more of these pathophysiological mechanisms. This review describes the current concepts in ventilatory control that pertain to breathing instability during wakefulness and sleep, delineates potential avenues for alternative therapies to stabilize breathing during sleep, and proposes recommendations for future research.

### Sex differences in sleep and sleep-disordered breathing [^4700fb07]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Looking at the different groups of sleep disorders – particularly insomnia, sleep-related breathing disorders, and sleep-related movement disorders – there are consistent findings on sex differences for these sleep disorders in terms of prevalence, symptom presentation and, in some cases, treatment outcomes. Increasing attention is being paid to sex differences in sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), particularly obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), central sleep apnoea (CSA) syndromes, and obesity-related hypoventilation. This difference is partly explained by differences in upper airway collapsibility, respiratory control and comorbidities, but for the most part, it is incompletely understood and often insufficiently systematically investigated, particularly in SDB other than OSA. In addition, there are sex differences in the consequences of sleep disorders, particularly the cardiovascular and metabolic consequences. However, women are generally underrepresented in most randomized controlled intervention studies on SDB, which makes it difficult to assess potential differences in treatment outcomes. This review briefly highlights known sex differences in sleep and control of ventilation, and then discusses the evidence base and recent findings on sex differences in SDB.

### Monitoring breathing frequency, pattern, and effort [^bac79d8e]. Respiratory Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Monitoring respiratory values such as breathing frequency, minute ventilation, breathing effort, and dyspnea are common in acute care. There is evidence that accurate monitoring and interpretation of these values leads to early identification and treatment of impending respiratory failure. Despite this evidence, some values, such as breathing frequency, are largely undervalued in the clinical setting. The undervaluation of breathing frequency is complex and will require a multifaceted approach, including education and improved technology, to reestablish its clinical potential. Many questions remain regarding how to most efficiently and effectively monitor other respiratory values, like noninvasive minute volume and breathing effort, as well. As technology continues to improve alongside the understanding of respiratory physiology, clinicians are able to apply basic clinical assessment skills and technology together to improve patient safety and outcomes.

### Modulatory dynamics of periodic and aperiodic activity in respiration-brain coupling [^126b5bb8]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Since CO 2 levels do not differ between nasal and oral breathing, the two mechanisms are clearly functionally distinct from one another: CO 2 fluctuations alone cannot account for neural or behavioural differences between nasal and oral breathing. Hence, there are (at least) two different ways in which neural activity could be coupled to the act of breathing. It may be the case that the differential coupling of respiration to periodic and aperiodic activity reflects these distinct mechanisms. However, the evidence so far (including present data from the control study) neither precludes the possibility that both types of modulation could be rooted in the same underlying mechanism. Therefore, critical future work is needed to further elucidate the functional and anatomical underpinnings of respiratory modulations in brain dynamics.

The present findings open multiple avenues for future research, of which we want to briefly sketch three main directions. First, mechanistic advances could be made in a replicative study which includes a contrast of nasal vs oral respiration. The absence of phase-amplitude coupling driven by nasal airstreams during oral breathing could conceivably reveal to what extent aperiodic changes rely on and/or interact with oscillatory changes. While we speculate that respective changes in 1/f slope and oscillatory power could point to distinct modulatory pathways, targeted follow-up studies with sufficient statistical power are of critical importance to extend our initial results. Second, as outlined above, it would further be highly instructive to complement existing evidence of task-related 1/f slope changes, by investigating their link to respiration in behavioural cognitive or perceptual paradigms. Timed breathing (in healthy participants or ventilated patients) or contexts involving different brain states, e.g. resting-state vs task, during attentional or arousal manipulation (including hyperventilation), or during sleep stages, could potentially unravel the link between breathing and fluctuations of (non-)oscillatory brain activity.

Finally, a third line of research should focus on potential translational applications of respiration-brain coupling. While others have made a convincing case for studying respiratory involvement in clinical contexts before (for a recent review, see), the results presented here demonstrate a link between bodily signals and aperiodic neural activity. Importantly, changes in 1/f slope itself - an indicator of E:I imbalance - have been implicated in neurological and psychiatric disorders like Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, and epilepsy. Linking these known neural alterations to peripheral signals could provide substantial insight into body-brain interactions in health and disease.

### Breathing exercises for adults with asthma [^e1c6985a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Breathing exercises have been widely used worldwide as a complementary therapy to the pharmacological treatment of people with asthma.

Objectives

To evaluate the evidence for the efficacy of breathing exercises in the management of patients with asthma.

Search Methods

The search for trials led review authors to review the literature available in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and AMED and to perform handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. Trial registers and reference lists of included articles were also consulted.The literature search has been updated to January 2013.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of breathing exercises in adults with asthma compared with a control group receiving asthma education or, alternatively, with no active control group.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. RevMan software was used for data analysis based on the fixed-effect model. Continuous outcomes were expressed as mean differences (MDs) with confidence intervals (CIs) of 95%. Heterogeneity was assessed by inspecting the forest plots. The Chi(2) test was applied, with a P value of 0.10 indicating statistical significance. The I(2) statistic was implemented, with a value greater than 50% representing a substantial level of heterogeneity.

Main Results

A total of 13 studies involving 906 participants are included in the review. The trials were different from one another in terms of type of breathing exercise performed, number of participants enrolled, number and duration of sessions completed, outcomes reported and statistical presentation of data. Asthma severity in participants from the included studies ranged from mild to moderate, and the samples consisted solely of outpatients. The following outcomes were measured: quality of life, asthma symptoms, number of acute exacerbations and lung function. Eleven studies compared breathing exercise with inactive control, and two with asthma education control groups. All eight studies that assessed quality of life reported an improvement in this outcome. An improvement in the number of acute exacerbations was observed by the only study that assessed this outcome. Six of seven included studies showed significant differences favouring breathing exercises for asthma symptoms. Effects on lung function were more variable, with no difference reported in five of the eleven studies that assessed this outcome, while the other six showed a significant difference for this outcome, which favoured breathing exercises. As a result of substantial heterogeneity among the studies, meta-analysis was possible only for asthma symptoms and changes in the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ). Each meta-analysis included only two studies and showed a significant difference favouring breathing exercises (MD -3.22, 95% CI -6.31 to -0.13 for asthma symptoms; MD 0.79, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.08 for change in AQLQ). Assessment of risk of bias was impaired by incomplete reporting of methodological aspects of most of the included trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Even though individual trials reported positive effects of breathing exercises, no reliable conclusions could be drawn concerning the use of breathing exercises for asthma in clinical practice. This was a result of methodological differences among the included studies and poor reporting of methodological aspects in most of the included studies. However, trends for improvement are encouraging, and further studies including full descriptions of treatment methods and outcome measurements are required.

Disorders of Control of Breathing and the Neuromuscular Breathing Apparatus

For many patients with COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure, invasive mechanical ventilation is required to prevent further deterioration in gas exchange, respiratory muscle fatigue, organ failure, and death. Prolonged periods of invasive mechanical ventilation (up to several weeks) have been reported.The effects of SARS-CoV-2 and prolonged mechanical ventilation on respiratory muscle structure and function are yet unknown but might be potentially detrimental and clinically important. The diaphragm is the main inspiratory muscle, and, compared with peripheral muscles, appears to be more affected by critical illness and mechanical ventilation. Diaphragm function may further deteriorate in ventilator-bound ICU patients. This is associated with difficult ventilator liberation, increased risks of ICU and hospital readmission, and increased risk for death.

### The breathing, thinking, functioning clinical model: a proposal to facilitate evidence-based breathlessness management in chronic respiratory disease [^6396eb11]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Refractory breathlessness is a highly prevalent and distressing symptom in advanced chronic respiratory disease. Its intensity is not reliably predicted by the severity of lung pathology, with unhelpful emotions and behaviours inadvertently exacerbating and perpetuating the problem. Improved symptom management is possible if clinicians choose appropriate non-pharmacological approaches, but these require engagement and commitment from both patients and clinicians. The Breathing Thinking Functioning clinical model is a proposal, developed from current evidence, that has the potential to facilitate effective symptom control, by providing a rationale and focus for treatment.

### Dysfunctional breathing symptoms, functional impact and quality of life in patients with long COVID-19: a prospective case series [^e654ad64]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Dyspnoea frequently persists after SARS-CoV-2 infection, independent of abnormalities on chest imaging or pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and initial disease severity.Deconditioning and respiratory limitation (RL) evaluated by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) are the main exercise-limiting factors after severe SARS-CoV-2 necessitating hospitalisation.However, the mechanisms of persisting dyspnoea after uncomplicated mild SARS-CoV-2 infection are poorly understood. One possible mechanism could be dysfunctional breathing (DB), defined as dyspnoea associated with an abnormal breathing pattern after exclusion of a significant cardiopulmonary disease that could cause dyspnoea, or dyspnoea occurring out of proportion with an underlying cause (eg, cardiopulmonary or metabolic diseases and deconditioning) and associated with an abnormal breathing pattern.DB may cause symptoms at rest and during various daily life situations, including exercise. Different types have been described with hyperventilation syndrome (HVS) and periodic deep sighing (PDS) identified as the most common subtypes.In the classification by Boulding et al, PDS encompasses frequent sighs as well as erratic breathing (EB). Here, we use the term EB/PDS to describe this combination of abnormal breathing patterns.Given its complex features, there is currently no gold standard for the diagnosis of DB.

### Positive expiratory pressure-common clinical applications and physiological effects [^519d0d33]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Breathing out against resistance, in order to achieve positive expiratory pressure (PEP), is applied by many patient groups. Pursed lips breathing and a variety of devices can be used to create the resistance giving the increased expiratory pressure. Effects on pulmonary outcomes have been discussed in several publications, but the expected underlying physiology of the effect is seldom discussed. The aim of this article is to describe the purpose, performance, clinical application and underlying physiology of PEP when it is used to increase lung volumes, decrease hyperinflation or improve airway clearance. In clinical practice, the instruction how to use an expiratory resistance is of major importance since it varies. Different breathing patterns during PEP increase or reduce expiratory flow, result in movement of EPP centrally or peripherally and can increase or decrease lung volume. It is therefore necessary to give the right instructions to obtain the desired effects. As the different PEP techniques are being used by diverse patient groups it is not possible to give standard instructions. Based on the information given in this article the instructions have to be adjusted to give the optimal effect. There is no consensus regarding optimal treatment frequency and number of cycles included in each treatment session and must also be individualized. In future research, more precise descriptions are needed about physiological aims and specific instructions of how the treatments have been performed to assure as good treatment quality as possible and to be able to evaluate and compare treatment effects.

### Deciphering mechanisms of respiratory fetal-to-neonatal transition in very preterm infants [^703f5275]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale: The respiratory mechanisms of a successful transition of preterm infants after birth are largely unknown. Objectives: To describe intrapulmonary gas flows during different breathing patterns directly after birth. Methods: Analysis of electrical impedance tomography data from a previous randomized trial in preterm infants at 26-32weeks gestational age. Electrical impedance tomography data for individual breaths were extracted, and lung volumes as well as ventilation distribution were calculated for end of inspiration, end of expiratory braking and/or holding maneuver, and end of expiration. Measurements and Main Results: Overall, 10,348 breaths from 33 infants were analyzed. We identified three distinct breath types within the first 10minutes after birth: tidal breathing (44% of all breaths; sinusoidal breathing without expiratory disruption), braking (50%; expiratory brake with a short duration), and holding (6%; expiratory brake with a long duration). Only after holding breaths did end-expiratory lung volume increase: Median (interquartile range [IQR])=2.0AU/kg (0.6 to 4.3), 0.0 (-1.0 to 1.1), and 0.0 (-1.1 to 0.4), respectively; P <0.001]. This was mediated by intrathoracic air redistribution to the left and non-gravity-dependent parts of the lung through pendelluft gas flows during braking and/or holding maneuvers. Conclusions: Respiratory transition in preterm infants is characterized by unique breathing patterns. Holding breaths contribute to early lung aeration after birth in preterm infants. This is facilitated by air redistribution during braking / holding maneuvers through pendelluft flow, which may prevent lung liquid reflux in this highly adaptive situation. This study deciphers mechanisms for a successful fetal-to-neonatal transition and increases our pathophysiological understanding of this unique moment in life. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04315636).

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^df167d4e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea definition and prognostic associations—dyspnea is defined as a “subjective experience of breathing discomfort that consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity,” and evidence indicates prognostic value: “dyspnea is a predictor of hospitalization and mortality in patients with chronic lung disease,” and “in some cases is more closely correlated with 5-year survival than forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1),” with dyspnea “more closely associated with cardiac mortality than angina.” Advances also support that “different sensations may reflect different pathways associated with different sensory qualities (notably work/effort, tightness, and air hunger/unsatisfied inspiration).”

### Pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnea [^64f69db7]. Anesthesiology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

This article explores the physiologic basis and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea--a general term encompassing central sleep apnea and obstructive sleep apnea. The former is relatively uncommon while the latter is much more common. Episodic collapse and blockage of the upper airway occur during sleep despite continuous respiratory effort. Three types of sleep obstructive breathing--apnea, hypopnea, and airway resistance--are associated with respiratory-related arousals from sleep.

### The breathing, thinking, functioning clinical model: a proposal to facilitate evidence-based breathlessness management in chronic respiratory disease [^5f6d3a0e]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Understanding the complexity

Relationship between disease and breathlessness severity

Breathlessness severity is not reliably predicted by the severity of airflow limitation in COPD. Multiple studies have shown marked variation in the perception of breathlessness, for a given level of lung function. An observational study of almost 50,000 patients with COPD in the UK revealed that a third of those with stage 1 disease described moderate to severe breathlessness, whereas over 20% of those with stage 4 disease did not have clinically significant breathlessness.In a recent controlled trial, bronchoscopic lung volume reduction significantly improved FEV1 by 25%, without relief of breathlessness.

The inconsistent relationship between pathology and breathlessness perception explains why optimising disease management alone does not guarantee good symptom control. This discrepancy has led to a number of terms suggesting exaggerated symptom perception, such as ‘disproportionate breathlessness’, ‘breathlessness out of keeping with pathology’ and ‘medically unexplained breathlessness’. It is apparent that there must be factors influencing breathlessness beyond that expected due to the underlying disease.

Graphical examples of type of breaths. Different graphical examples of type of breaths and its relationship with phase angle, breathing interval and coefficient of variation (CoV). CoV calculations are based upon multiple breathing cycles. Due to the schematic examples these cycles are not shown in the figure. Purple rectangle: ventilator pressurization, orange rectangle: patient effort, blue line: start of ventilator breath, red line: start of patient effort, gray arrow: patient breathing interval (TTOTNEU), green arrow: ventilator cycle (TTOTMECH), Φ: phase angle. A : Time triggered mandatory breath and no patient effort. Ventilator cycle (TTOTMECH) remains stable without variabilty. CoV calculations of the interval between mandatory breaths will be < 15%. Due to no patient efforts no phase angle calculations could be made. B : Spontaneous breathing pattern with changing timing in breathing interval (TTOTNEU) and different phase angles for each breath. Phase angles remain positive. CoV calculations for phase angle and breathing interval are showing no sign of respiratory entrainment and will be > 15%. C : Reverse triggering as a direct response to a time triggered breath. Both breathing interval (TTOTNEU) and phase angle are showing no variation. Phase angles will a be negative. CoV calculations of the breathing interval and phase angles are < 15%. D : Reverse triggering as part of respiratory entrainment. Patient triggered breaths and reverse triggering breaths are showing an alternating pattern. Phase angles will be positive, zero or negative. Breathing interval is showing little variabilty. CoV calculations for the breathing interval will be < 15% and for phase angle 10–15%. E : Double triggering during spontaneous breathing. Double triggering is patient triggered. CoV calculations of the breathing interval and phase angle are > 15%. F : Reverse triggering with double triggering during spontaneous breathing without respiratory entrainment. During double triggering the patient effort followed a time triggered mandatory breath. CoV calculations from both breathing interval and phase angle are > 15%. Hence, showing no relation with respiratory entrainment

### Reply to philip: aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2: inhalation as well as exhalation matters for COVID-19 [^edf2afb4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

From the Authors :

In the comment by Philip and colleagues, the authors state that the special inhalation patterns are also important in the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We absolutely agree that every part of the transmission pathway, specifically 1) the absolute aerosol production during singing and speaking, 2) the special aerosol impulse dispersion and expansion, 3) the accumulation and convectional spreading of aerosols in rooms, and 4) the special inhalation patterns during singing contribute to person-to-person transmission of the COVID-19 virus.

Although our understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic has grown recently, to the best of our knowledge, the main question remains unclarified: How high a virus dose is needed to infect a person? Whereas the transmission factors (1–3) contribute to the necessary infectious dose, factor 4 represents the rate of admission by a receiving person. In agreement with Philip and colleagues, we do believe that it is very important to understand phonation-related differences in breathing patterns. With regard to this, it has been shown that ventilation patterns differ between types of phonation, showing higherfor singing in contrast to breathing. However, many open questions remain with regard to ventilation. For example, to the best of our knowledge, it has not yet been clarified in detail if an infection is more likely if a virus cloud has been inhaled more deeply, thereby reaching deeper parts of the breathing apparatus, nor if there is any difference between transoral and transnasal breathing. With deep breath inhalation used, for example, for louder speaking, typically the fraction of transoral inhalation increases, which does not have the same immune competence as the nose. However, as far as we know, most virus dose at the beginning of the infection is found in the nasopharynx, a part of the breathing system that is only encountered by transnasal breathing patterns.

### Breathing pattern disorder: introduction and diagnostics [^c7eb3dca]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Breathing pattern disorder (BPD) refers to a heterogenous condition, which features altered normal respiratory functioning that cannot be fully attributed to organic causes at the current time. Characteristic symptoms of this condition include dyspnea, and irregular ventilation. The diagnosis of BPD is made utilizing a combination of patient-reported experiences in the form of validated questionnaires, direct observation by experienced clinicians, and objective testing in the form of cardiopulmonary exercise testing.

### Cardiopulmonary syndromes-NCI (...) [^b2244225]. NCI (2004). Low credibility.

- Superior vena cava syndrome.
- Carcinomatous lymphangitis.
- Pneumonia and other chest infections.
- Pneumonitis.
- Blood clots or tumor cells break loose and block a blood vessel in the lungs. There are different ways to treat the causes of dyspnea in people with cancer. Treatment may include: . Pleural effusion is extra fluid in the pleural cavity. The pleural cavity is the space between the pleura that covers the outer surface of each lung and lines the inner wall of the chest cavity. Pleural tissue usually makes a small amount of fluid that helps the lungs move smoothly in the chest while a person is breathing. A pleural effusion is extra fluid in the pleural cavity. The fluid presses on the lungs and makes it hard to breathe.

Malignant Pericardial Effusion Key Points
- Pericardial effusion is extra fluid inside the sac around the heart.
- Pericardial effusion may be caused by cancer or other conditions.
- Signs and symptoms of pericardial effusion include dyspnea and cough.
- Pericardial effusion usually occurs in advanced cancer.
- Treatment may be to control the symptoms of pericardial effusion and improve quality of life.
- The superior vena cava returns blood from the upper body to the heart.
- The inferior vena cava returns blood from the lower body to the heart. Common signs and symptoms of SVCS include breathing problems and coughing. The signs and symptoms of SVCS are more severe if the vein becomes blocked quickly. This is because the other veins in the area do not have time to widen and take over the blood flow that cannot pass through the superior vena cava. The most common signs are: .

Superior vena cava syndrome is rare in children, but when it occurs, it can be life-threatening. In adults, the windpipe is stiff, but in children, it is softer and can more easily be squeezed shut or blocked. A child's windpipe is narrow, so any amount of swelling can cause breathing problems. Squeezing of the trachea is called superior mediastinal syndrome. Because SVCS and SMS usually happen together in children, the two syndromes are considered to be the same.

### Understanding sleep-disordered breathing through mathematical modelling [^3ae98090]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Recent studies have uncovered high prevalence of undiagnosed sleep-disordered breathing, and its linkage to metabolic or cardiovascular disorders which represent increasing health hazard. However, the mechanistic links behind these disorders as well as their contribution to the experimental observations and treatment responses remain poorly understood. Therefore, the screening of clinical measurements still relies upon relatively simple diagnostic features, such as signal averages or event frequencies, which may represent suboptimal or surrogate markers of the underlying abnormality. Consequently, most patients are being treated with general therapies regardless of the cause of their key dysfunction. Combining experimental measurements with mathematical modelling has the potential to provide mechanistic insights into the individual factors underlying the disease progression, which may finally enable tailored treatment alternatives for each patient. This review depicts a number of modelling approaches to elucidate sleep-related dysfunctions of the human respiratory system, and how these models are being used to translate the measurements first into new ideas and then into testable hypotheses. Such model-based investigations can provide systematic strategies towards better understanding, predicting or even preventing these dysfunctions. Along with the brief description of the modelling approaches, we discuss their relative merits and potential implications especially for clinical research.

### Sex differences in sleep and sleep-disordered breathing [^8f09b7f4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The prevalence, underlying pathophysiology and symptoms of SDB, particularly OSA, differ between genders and change after menopause. While men with OSA are more likely to report snoring and daytime sleepiness, women may present with a history of sleep disturbances and insomnia. Due to the different symptom presentation, the lower sensitivity of OSA screening questionnaires and some specific types of OSA more common in women (e.g. REM-OSA, nondesaturator or upper airway resistance syndrome), women with clinically relevant OSA are underdiagnosed and undertreated. The prevalence and severity of OSA increase after the menopause. Men have a higher risk of high-loop CSA such as Cheyne Stokes respiration and treatment-emergent CSA. A better understanding of sex-typical phenotypes with the aim of a more targeted treatment approach to SDB should be a research priority.

What to know
- Personal protective equipment is a main source of protection for emergency response and recovery workers.
- PPE is necessary to protect emergency response and recovery workers from physical, chemical, and biological hazards.
- Examples of PPE include eye protection, hearing protection, gloves, protective clothing, and respirators. Overview There are many different types of emergencies, such as flooding, fires, disease outbreaks, and structural collapse. Emergency response and recovery workers can be exposed to hazards through:
- Breathing
- Eating
- Drinking
- Skin contact
- Contact through mucous membranes PPE often includes eye protection, hearing protection, protective clothing, and respirators, but recommended PPE depends on the types of hazards present.

Types Eye protection Eyes are always at risk of exposure to different hazards, including contact with:
- Bloodborne pathogens
- Chemicals
- Dust and debris
- Gas
- Glass or metal particles
- Thermal hazards Exposure to these hazards may harm eyesight, including eyeball scratches, corneal abrasions, conjunctivitis, and burns. Examples of protective eyewear include goggles, face shields, safety glasses, and full-face respirators. Hearing protection Hazardous noise levels and chemicals can affect emergency response and recovery workers' hearing. NIOSH has recommended exposure limits for occupational noise exposure and provides recommendations for choosing hearing protectors. Examples include earplugs and earmuffs. Protective clothing Protective clothing protects users from unintended exposures through skin contact. Examples include coveralls or fluid-resistant garments.

Consider the following when selecting the appropriate protective clothing:
- Hazard
- Material
- Design
- Durability
- Comfort
- Functionality. Respirators Respirators are one of the most important pieces of PPE for workers. They are especially critical when other control systems are not feasible to protect workers' safety and health.

### Breathing exercises for dysfunctional breathing / hyperventilation syndrome in children [^0281d06b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Dysfunctional breathing is described as chronic or recurrent changes in breathing pattern causing respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms. It is an umbrella term that encompasses hyperventilation syndrome and vocal cord dysfunction. Dysfunctional breathing affects 10% of the general population. Symptoms include dyspnoea, chest tightness, sighing and chest pain which arise secondary to alterations in respiratory pattern and rate. Little is known about dysfunctional breathing in children. Preliminary data suggest 5.3% or more of children with asthma have dysfunctional breathing and that, unlike in adults, it is associated with poorer asthma control. It is not known what proportion of the general paediatric population is affected. Breathing training is recommended as a first-line treatment for adults with dysfunctional breathing (with or without asthma) but no similar recommendations are available for the management of children. As such, breathing retraining is adapted from adult regimens based on the age and ability of the child.

Objectives

To determine whether breathing retraining in children with dysfunctional breathing has beneficial effects as measured by quality of life indices.To determine whether there are any adverse effects of breathing retraining in young people with dysfunctional breathing.

Search Methods

We identified trials for consideration using both electronic and manual search strategies. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE. We searched the National Research Register (NRR) Archive, Health Services Research Projects in Progress (HSRProj), Current Controlled Trials register (incorporating the metaRegister of Controlled Trials and the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) to identify research in progress and unpublished research. The latest search was undertaken in October 2013.

Selection Criteria

We planned to include randomised, quasi-randomised or cluster-randomised controlled trials. We excluded observational studies, case studies and studies utilising a cross-over design. The cross-over design was considered inappropriate due to the purported long-lasting effects of breathing retraining. Children up to the age of 18 years with a clinical diagnosis of dysfunctional breathing were eligible for inclusion. We planned to include children with a primary diagnosis of asthma with the intention of undertaking a subgroup analysis. Children with symptoms secondary to cardiac or metabolic disease were excluded.We considered any type of breathing retraining exercise for inclusion in this review, such as breathing control, diaphragmatic breathing, yoga breathing, Buteyko breathing, biofeedback-guided breathing modification and yawn/sigh suppression. We considered programmes where exercises were either supervised (by parents or a health professional, or both) or unsupervised. We also considered relaxation techniques and acute episode management as long as it was clear that breathing exercises were a component of the intervention.Any intervention without breathing exercises or where breathing exercises were not key to the intervention were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

We planned that two authors (NJB and MJ) would extract data independently using a standardised form. Any discrepancies would be resolved by consensus. Where agreement could not be reached a third review author (MLE) would have considered the paper.

Main Results

We identified 264 potential trials and reviews from the search. Following removal of duplicates, we screened 224 papers based on title and abstract. We retrieved six full-text papers and further evaluated them but they did not meet the inclusion criteria. There were, therefore, no studies suitable for inclusion in this review.

Authors' Conclusions

The results of this systematic review cannot inform clinical practice as no suitable trials were identified for inclusion. Therefore, it is currently unknown whether these interventions offer any added value in this patient group or whether specific types of breathing exercise demonstrate superiority over others. Given that breathing exercises are frequently used to treat dysfunctional breathing/hyperventilation syndrome, there is an urgent need for well-designed clinical trials in this area. Future trials should conform to the CONSORT statement for standards of reporting and use validated outcome measures. Trial reports should also ensure full disclosure of data for all important clinical outcomes.

### Breathing exercises for adults with asthma [^5172450c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Breathing exercises have been widely used worldwide as a non-pharmacological therapy to treat people with asthma. Breathing exercises aim to control the symptoms of asthma and can be performed as the Papworth Method, the Buteyko breathing technique, yogic breathing, deep diaphragmatic breathing or any other similar intervention that manipulates the breathing pattern. The training of breathing usually focuses on tidal and minute volume and encourages relaxation, exercise at home, the modification of breathing pattern, nasal breathing, holding of breath, lower rib cage and abdominal breathing.

Objectives

To evaluate the evidence for the efficacy of breathing exercises in the management of people with asthma.

Search Methods

To identify relevant studies we searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and AMED and performed handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. We also consulted trials registers and reference lists of included articles. The most recent literature search was on 4 April 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of breathing exercises in adults with asthma compared with a control group receiving asthma education or, alternatively, with no active control group.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. We used Review Manager 5 software for data analysis based on the random-effects model. We expressed continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs) with confidence intervals (CIs) of 95%. We assessed heterogeneity by inspecting the forest plots. We applied the Chi 2 test, with a P value of 0.10 indicating statistical significance, and the I 2 statistic, with a value greater than 50% representing a substantial level of heterogeneity. The primary outcome was quality of life.

Main Results

We included nine new studies (1910 participants) in this update, resulting in a total of 22 studies involving 2880 participants in the review. Fourteen studies used Yoga as the intervention, four studies involved breathing retraining, one the Buteyko method, one the Buteyko method and pranayama, one the Papworth method and one deep diaphragmatic breathing. The studies were different from one another in terms of type of breathing exercise performed, number of participants enrolled, number of sessions completed, period of follow-up, outcomes reported and statistical presentation of data. Asthma severity in participants from the included studies ranged from mild to moderate, and the samples consisted solely of outpatients. Twenty studies compared breathing exercise with inactive control, and two with asthma education control groups. Meta-analysis was possible for the primary outcome quality of life and the secondary outcomes asthma symptoms, hyperventilation symptoms, and some lung function variables. Assessment of risk of bias was impaired by incomplete reporting of methodological aspects of most of the included studies. We did not include adverse effects as an outcome in the review. Breathing exercises versus inactive control For quality of life, measured by the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), meta-analysis showed improvement favouring the breathing exercises group at three months (MD 0.42, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.68; 4 studies, 974 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and at six months the OR was 1.34 for the proportion of people with at least 0.5 unit improvement in AQLQ, (95% CI 0.97 to 1.86; 1 study, 655 participants). For asthma symptoms, measured by the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), meta-analysis at up to three months was inconclusive, MD of -0.15 units (95% CI -2.32 to 2.02; 1 study, 115 participants; low-certainty evidence), and was similar over six months (MD -0.08 units, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.07; 1 study, 449 participants). For hyperventilation symptoms, measured by the Nijmegen Questionnaire (from four to six months), meta-analysis showed less symptoms with breathing exercises (MD -3.22, 95% CI -6.31 to -0.13; 2 studies, 118 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), but this was not shown at six months (MD 0.63, 95% CI -0.90 to 2.17; 2 studies, 521 participants). Meta-analyses for forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) measured at up to three months was inconclusive, MD -0.10 L, (95% CI -0.32 to 0.12; 4 studies, 252 participants; very low-certainty evidence). However, for FEV 1 % of predicted, an improvement was observed in favour of the breathing exercise group (MD 6.88%, 95% CI 5.03 to 8.73; five studies, 618 participants). Breathing exercises versus asthma education For quality of life, one study measuring AQLQ was inconclusive up to three months (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.34; 1 study, 183 participants). When assessed from four to six months, the results favoured breathing exercises (MD 0.38, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.68; 1 study, 183 participants). Hyperventilation symptoms measured by the Nijmegen Questionnaire were inconclusive up to three months (MD -1.24, 95% CI -3.23 to 0.75; 1 study, 183 participants), but favoured breathing exercises from four to six months (MD -3.16, 95% CI -5.35 to -0.97; 1 study, 183 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

Breathing exercises may have some positive effects on quality of life, hyperventilation symptoms, and lung function. Due to some methodological differences among included studies and studies with poor methodology, the quality of evidence for the measured outcomes ranged from moderate to very low certainty according to GRADE criteria. In addition, further studies including full descriptions of treatment methods and outcome measurements are required.

### Physiological basis of respiratory signs and symptoms [^c167da26]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

An understanding of the physiological processes underlying respiratory function in the healthy individual is essential in recognising and understanding disease processes. Departure from the normal pattern of tidal breathing is an early and reliable sign of respiratory disease. Understanding the normal distributions of pressures within the thoracic cage, airways and lungs allows one to predict the site of airway obstruction. Respiratory signs and symptoms are based on alterations of normal physiology by the disease process. Unfortunately, these basic principals are rarely emphasised in current teaching programs.

### Breathing pattern disorder: translating breathing at rest to exercise [^17e1b85d]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Breathing pattern disorder (BPD) is an abnormal pattern of ventilation and movements of the upper and lower ribcage and abdomen that results in a constellation of symptoms. This paper discusses the management of BPD from a technical standpoint. Since there is not a one-size-fits-all model for practice, we offer a toolbox approach to care with quick reference tables and diagrams that allow the practitioner to easily find treatement approaches that may suite their athlete. While this article uses the athlete as a reference for treatment, there is also a consideration for how to approach the co-morbid patient as well.

### Single cell RNA analysis identifies cellular heterogeneity and adaptive responses of the lung at birth [^403c0627]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The respiratory system undergoes a diversity of structural, biochemical, and functional changes necessary for adaptation to air breathing at birth. To identify the heterogeneity of pulmonary cell types and dynamic changes in gene expression mediating adaptation to respiration, here we perform single cell RNA analyses of mouse lung on postnatal day 1. Using an iterative cell type identification strategy we unbiasedly identify the heterogeneity of murine pulmonary cell types. We identify distinct populations of epithelial, endothelial, mesenchymal, and immune cells, each containing distinct subpopulations. Furthermore we compare temporal changes in RNA expression patterns before and after birth to identify signaling pathways selectively activated in specific pulmonary cell types, including activation of cell stress and the unfolded protein response during perinatal adaptation of the lung. The present data provide a single cell view of the adaptation to air breathing after birth.

### Prevalent and sex-biased breathing patterns modify functional connectivity MRI in young adults [^10ee62e5]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a tool for investigating human brain organization. Here we identify, visually and algorithmically, two prevalent influences on fMRI signals during 440h of resting state scans in 440 healthy young adults, both caused by deviations from normal breathing which we term deep breaths and bursts. The two respiratory patterns have distinct influences on fMRI signals and signal covariance, distinct timescales, distinct cardiovascular correlates, and distinct tendencies to manifest by sex. Deep breaths are not sex-biased. Bursts, which are serial taperings of respiratory depth typically spanning minutes at a time, are more common in males. Bursts share features of chemoreflex-driven clinical breathing patterns that also occur primarily in males, with notable neurological, psychiatric, medical, and lifespan associations. These results identify common breathing patterns in healthy young adults with distinct influences on functional connectivity and an ability to differentially influence resting state fMRI studies.

### What is a tracheostomy? [^0b2550ff]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. A tracheostomy is an artificial airway that allows passage of air directly into the trachea to the lungs, bypassing the mouth and pharynx. Air is normally inhaled through the nose and mouth and passes through the trachea, which branches into the main bronchi and enters the lungs. Patients who are ill and not able to breathe on their own or who have head and neck cancer obstructing their airway may require a breathing tube. There are 2 main types of breathing tubes: an endotracheal tube and a tracheostomy tube. An endotracheal tube is typically inserted through the mouth or nose, and the tip sits within the trachea. Patients who receive this type are connected to a machine called a ventilator that helps them breathe. Prolonged intubation with an endotracheal tube predisposes patients to complications such as pneumonia and narrowing of the trachea.

A tracheostomy tube is considered when intubation is expected to last more than 1 or 2 weeks. A tracheostomy tube is very short and wide and is surgically placed directly into the trachea. It can be connected to a ventilator to assist with breathing or may be open to air to bypass an obstruction. This avoids having a tube in the nose or mouth, which makes patients more comfortable and decreases risk of pneumonia. The risk of tracheal stenosis is lower with a trach compared with an endotracheal tube. Most importantly, patients can be weaned from a ventilator faster with a trach than with an endotracheal tube. As the ability to breathe improves, patients may be disconnected from the ventilator while the trach remains in place. If they need help breathing again, they may be reconnected at any time. A trach that is open to air can be very discreet and can be hidden under clothing. Tracheostomy Tube Placement. The trach is then secured in place while the wound heals.

As a patient’s breathing improves, the trach tube may be exchanged for smaller sizes until it is eventually capped, allowing patients to breathe through the mouth and nose. When the trach is no longer needed, it can be removed, and the hole will heal by itself or can be closed surgically.

### Physiotherapy assessment of breathing pattern disorder: a qualitative evaluation [^a8fa7ce8]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

In health, and at rest, human respiration is largely achieved through the subconscious rhythm of breathing at a comfortable tidal volume. Increases in both the rate and depth of breathing are triggered by temporary, physiological responses to stimuli, including sympathetic activity, exertion or anxiety.Disorders in breathing pattern are known most commonly as breathing pattern disorder (BPD) or dysfunctional breathing. Individuals with BPD tend to breathe in a manner that is disconnected from their respiratory or metabolic requirements,in some cases leading to decreased arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide through hyperventilation.They mayalso experience breathlessness, air hunger and limitations in function.Its pathogenesis remains unclear, but probably comprises an interplay between biomechanical and biochemical stimuli and psychopathological cognitive factors.The condition may be present in the absence of respiratory disease (‘primary’ BPD) or it may accompany another respiratory disorder, commonly asthma(‘secondary’ BPD) or, more recently, as a cardinal feature of long COVID-19.

The manifestations of BPD are readily misinterpreted—by both patients and clinicians—as those of asthma or similar obstructive and restrictive conditions.This leads to prescriptions of medications that are neither required nor effective, including inhaled or oral steroids.Furthermore, BPD frequently amplifies other respiratory conditions, increasing the likelihood of excess prescriptions and associated misuse of prescribing budgets.In COVID-19 follow-up clinics, a high proportion of patients reported of disproportionate breathlessness, alongside symptoms of fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance.While most post-COVID-19 clinics request a physiotherapy assessment of BPD as a key management step, diagnosis is hampered by the absence of universally accepted terminology or method of assessment.Moreover, BPD does not always present in the same way, a heterogeneity that may further lead to inconsistent assessment.Various assessment tools can be used to assess BPD but many do not capture the core components across all types of presentation.

Due to the apparent complexity of BPD, it is essential to increase our understanding of how to approach assessment. A consistent assessment will help to recognise the disorder and ensure appropriate treatments are offered to patients. This paper aims to further our understanding of BPD by exploreing expert physiotherapists’ perspectives on BPD assessment.

### Sleep-disordered breathing and heart failure: focus on obstructive sleep apnea and treatment with continuous positive airway pressure [^6a1d8d36]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Among patients with heart failure, sleep-disordered breathing is a common problem, with a prevalence ranging from 24% to 76%. Encompassed within the general category of sleep-disordered breathing are 2 types of sleep apnea: obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) occurs when the oropharyngeal musculature relaxes, causing a collapse of the upper airway, and central sleep apnea occurs when the brain stem fails to stimulate breathing.

Methods and Results

This article focuses on the relationship between heart failure and OSA, the treatment of OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and the role of CPAP in improving such effects of heart failure as ejection fraction, blood pressure, sympathetic activity, sleepiness, heart rate, and mortality.

Conclusions

It is important to distinguish the type of sleep-disordered breathing a patient may have. Further studies are needed to elucidate the effects of CPAP and other therapies.

Exhaled breath contains an extensive reservoir of biomolecules. The collection of exhaled breath is noninvasive and low risk. Therefore, its testing is an appealing strategy for the discovery of biomarkers of respiratory diseases. In this concise review, we summarize the evidence of exhaled breath tests for airways diseases and respiratory infections. An overview of breath collection methods in both individuals who are spontaneously breathing and those receiving mechanical ventilation is outlined. We also highlight the challenges in exhaled breath testing and areas for future research.

### 'The body says it': the difficulty of measuring and communicating sensations of breathlessness [^84b72b1d]. Medical Humanities (2022). Medium credibility.

“when exercising, my breathing requires muscle effort or work”, I don’t, it just [mimics] “gasps gasps”, is that me? my muscles working or my brain telling my lungs to start working, that’s not muscle effort, I don’t think so, to me my lungs haven’t got any muscles, have they? your diaphragm, if you breathe in, deeply from your tummy up, that pushes your lungs up but thats your diaphragm working not your lungs working isn’t it? (BeCR)

For another participant the idea of muscle effort and work only made sense when seen as related to the sensation of tightness and effort needed to support the exhale:

“Breathing requires muscle work or effort.” Oh right, yes, a bit like tight chest…When [my mother] was wheezy…one thing she would do is, as she breathed out, she would put her hands on the side of her rib cage and push downwards, pushing the rib cage in at the base to help with her breathing out. So that’s muscle work and effort. (BE-CL)

‘My breathing requires mental effort or concentration’

Similar to the previous questionnaire item this caused some difficulty in comprehension and was interpreted in a variety of ways. Participants responded more easily to the word ‘concentration’ than ‘mental effort’. Mental effort was interpreted to mean three different types of thinking: the thinking involved in avoiding becoming breathless, the thinking involved in pacing oneself or persevering in an activity that makes one breathless, and the thinking involved in applying certain breathing techniques or the effort it takes to relax or distract oneself during a breathless episode. For others the terms just caused confusion or were interpreted to mean ‘mental health’. Confusion for some was linked to viewing the breath (and breathlessness) as an automatic bodily process, beyond conscious thought. A range of emotions were associated with the phrase ‘mental concentration’, including worry, fear, stoicism, frustration, courage and perseverance. Again comparisons were made between the mental effort involved when at rest compared with when active or when ‘it gets out of hand’. Participants associated the all absorbing nature of being concentrated on their breath with a poor quality of life.

### Mechanisms of apnea [^af794e86]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

This paper focuses on the underlying mechanisms contributing to sleep-disordered breathing. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder and is characterized by repetitive narrowing or collapse of the pharyngeal airway during sleep. Conversely, central sleep apnea (CSA), highly prevalent in congestive heart failure, is distinguished by a lack of drive to breathe during sleep, resulting in repetitive periods of insufficient ventilation. Both lead to compromised gas exchange, impaired sleep continuity, and catecholamine surges and are associated with major comorbidities including excessive daytime sleepiness and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Although OSA and CSA exist on a spectrum of sleep-disordered breathing, the 2 entities may overlap in their underlying pathophysiologies. This brief review summarizes the etiology and current understanding of OSA and CSA pathophysiology and the role that the cardiovascular system may play in contributing to disease pathology and highlights the likely substantial overlap that exists between the various forms of sleep-disordered breathing.

### Endotyping sleep apnea one breath at a time: an automated approach for separating obstructive from central sleep-disordered breathing [^0d25dd21]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Upper airway resistance quantified using invasive esophageal manometry is the gold standard for deducing the type of sleep apnea as obstructive or central and is key in determining the appropriate course of treatment. However, esophageal manometry is not well tolerated during sleep, and a lack of consensus on events with combined obstructive and central components can make characterizing the type of sleep apnea difficult. It has been long known that respiratory disturbances are associated with distinctive patterns observed during routine nocturnal polysomnograms. In most clinical scoring schemes these patterns influence, either directly or subliminally, the visual characterization of respiratory events. In this study, we develop, validate, and test a probabilistic approach that amalgamates known physiologic features of respiratory disturbances into a breath-by-breath probability of obstruction. We show that the probability of obstruction is a reliable noninvasive surrogate for the invasive gold-standard measurement of upper airway resistance and can aid in identifying a subject’s type of sleep apnea within a matter of minutes from a standard clinical sleep study.

### More than the sum of the respiratory events: personalized medicine approaches for obstructive sleep apnea [^69ae47d9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Traditionally, the presence and severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have been defined by the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Continuous positive airway pressure is generally first-line therapy despite low adherence, because it reliably reduces the AHI when used, and the response to other therapies is variable. However, there is growing appreciation that the underlying etiology (i.e., endotype) and clinical manifestation (i.e., phenotype) of OSA in an individual are not well described by the AHI. We define and review the important progress made in understanding and measuring physiological mechanisms (or endotypes) that help define subtypes of OSA and identify the potential use of genetics to further refine disease classification. This more detailed understanding of OSA pathogenesis should influence clinical treatment decisions as well as help inform research priorities and clinical study design. In short, treatments could be individualized on the basis of the underlying cause of OSA; patients could better understand which symptoms and outcomes will respond to OSA treatment and by how much; and researchers could select populations most likely to benefit from specific treatment approaches for OSA.

### Causes of Cheyne-Stokes respiration [^20d4c858]. Neurocritical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) is one of several types of unusual breathing with recurrent apneas (dysrhythmias). Reported initially in patients with heart failure or stroke, it was then recognized both in other diseases and as a component of the sleep apnea syndrome. CSR is potentiated and perpetuated by changing states of arousal that occur during sleep. The recurrent hypoxia and surges of sympathetic activity that often occur during the apneas may have serious health consequences. Heart failure and stroke are risk factors for sleep apnea. The recurrent apneas and intermittent hypoxia occurring with sleep apnea further damage the heart and brain. Although all breathing dysrhythmias do not have the same cause, instability in the feedback control involved in the chemical regulation of breathing is the leading cause of CSR. Mathematical models have helped greatly in the understanding of the causes of recurrent apneas.

The purpose of this article is to identify (by brand name) and then classify the modes available on contemporary portable ventilators used for noninvasive ventilation in the United States. We propose a formal taxonomy that identifies the modes by their control variable, breath sequence, and targeting scheme, therefore describing what the mode does. Use of this taxonomy should be helpful in finding modes with comparable functionality that cater to the specific goal of mechanical ventilation and effective ventilatory strategies for each disease state.

### Disrupted breath, songlines of breathlessness: an interdisciplinary response [^dd30bf36]. Medical Humanities (2019). Medium credibility.

Philosophy response

From a philosophical–phenomenological perspective, illness changes the lived experience of the ill person. It disrupts routines and habits and draws attention to bodily phenomena that are otherwise tacit. 25 The body’s transparency, to use Sartre’s term, is replaced by an opaque, troubling presence. The body can no longer be taken for granted and bodily functions require attention, thus occluding the previous transparency. Within this framework, the interview excerpt reads like a lament for that lost transparency, accompanied by a sense of confusion, perhaps disorientation, as the interviewee tries to make sense of his disrupted embodiment. In this commentary, I’d like to point to the series of rifts that characterise breathlessness, which I have also analysed recently elsewhere. 26

The first is the gap pointed out by the interviewee between normal (resting) breathing and pathological (on exertion) breathing. The interviewee states “I could do two sheets [questionnaires] of that, one when I’m exercising and one when I’m not”. This expresses the duality of his breathing experience: when resting, it is restful, easy, automatic, effortless, but becomes restless, stressful, difficult, explicit, on exertion. While normal breathlessness feels controlled, willed and often pleasurable, pathological breathlessness is felt as loss of control, frightening and distressing. I believe that pathological bodily experiences are not simply extreme forms of normal bodily experience but are underpinned by different qualitative and interpretative elements. Healthy breathlessness is temporary, normal and expected. Pathological breathlessness is chronic, abnormal (disproportionate to the task, eg, walking eight metres) and unexpected. It is out of the ordinary. I think that is what the interviewee means when he speaks of ‘two sheets’.

### Basic life support. dispatcher / telecommunicator-assisted CPR [^9725a466]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Dispatcher/telecommunicator-assisted out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) recognition—scoping review findings indicate that trials (RCTs) compared strategies to improve dispatcher-assisted recognition of OHCA, and only a single study addressed pediatric recognition; studies were grouped by factors and interventions with categories including communication between the caller and dispatcher, symptoms and patient characteristics, new technology, and quality improvement or protocols. The scoping review noted that the most pertinent challenge to dispatcher-assisted recognition of OHCA appears to be determining whether the patient is breathing normally, and although various breathing assessment strategies were studied, none were shown to have better results than a two-question strategy (“Is the patient conscious?” and “Is the patient breathing normally?”), and no RCTs compared alternative strategies. The review concluded that there is insufficient evidence to pursue a systematic review at this time. Insights and implications state that current Red Cross guidelines support the use of standardized and evidence-based protocols for recognition of cardiac arrest, that different protocols and strategies need to be compared with each other in randomized trials with evaluation of sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values, and that additional studies are needed to optimize recognition of pediatric OHCA and to improve layperson identification of normal breathing.

### A taxonomy for mechanical ventilation: 10 fundamental maxims [^be0c1c1e]. Respiratory Care (2014). Low credibility.

The American Association for Respiratory Care has declared a benchmark for competency in mechanical ventilation that includes the ability to "apply to practice all ventilation modes currently available on all invasive and noninvasive mechanical ventilators." This level of competency presupposes the ability to identify, classify, compare, and contrast all modes of ventilation. Unfortunately, current educational paradigms do not supply the tools to achieve such goals. To fill this gap, we expand and refine a previously described taxonomy for classifying modes of ventilation and explain how it can be understood in terms of 10 fundamental constructs of ventilator technology: (1) defining a breath, (2) defining an assisted breath, (3) specifying the means of assisting breaths based on control variables specified by the equation of motion, (4) classifying breaths in terms of how inspiration is started and stopped, (5) identifying ventilator-initiated versus patient-initiated start and stop events, (6) defining spontaneous and mandatory breaths, (7) defining breath sequences (8), combining control variables and breath sequences into ventilatory patterns, (9) describing targeting schemes, and (10) constructing a formal taxonomy for modes of ventilation composed of control variable, breath sequence, and targeting schemes. Having established the theoretical basis of the taxonomy, we demonstrate a step-by-step procedure to classify any mode on any mechanical ventilator.

### Central sleep apnea: pathophysiology and treatment [^3204ace5]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Central sleep apnea (CSA) is characterized by a lack of drive to breathe during sleep, resulting in repetitive periods of insufficient ventilation and compromised gas exchange. These nighttime breathing disturbances can lead to important comorbidity and increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. There are several manifestations of CSA, including high altitude-induced periodic breathing, idiopathic CSA, narcotic-induced central apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and Cheyne-Stokes breathing. While unstable ventilatory control during sleep is the hallmark of CSA, the pathophysiology and the prevalence of the various forms of CSA vary greatly. This brief review summarizes the underlying physiology and modulating components influencing ventilatory control in CSA, describes the etiology of each of the various forms of CSA, and examines the key factors that may exacerbate apnea severity. The clinical implications of improved CSA pathophysiology knowledge and the potential for novel therapeutic treatment approaches are also discussed.

### Comparative effectiveness of alternative spontaneous breathing trial techniques: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized trials [^19091395]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessing certainty of the evidence

We rated the certainty of evidence for each network estimate using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) framework, which classifies evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low certainty. Two experienced reviewers (KEAB, JOF), familiar with GRADE assessments, rated the certainty of evidence for each direct comparison considering risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias. We rated the certainty in none-zero (null) effect and when the point estimate was close to zero, we changed our target to trivial or no effect. We considered a minimally important difference of 3–4% to be important in network estimates.

Indirect effect estimates were calculated from available loops of evidence, which included first order loops (based on a single common comparator treatment—that is the difference between treatment A and B is based on comparisons of A and C as well as B and C) or higher order loops (more than one intervening treatment connecting the two interventions). We assessed the evidence for indirect estimates focusing on the dominant first order loop or, in the absence of a first order loop, a higher order loop and rating certainty of indirect evidence as the lowest certainty of the contributing direct comparisons informing that dominant loop. We considered further rating down each indirect comparison for intransitivity if the distribution of effect modifiers differed in the contributing direct comparisons.

For the network estimate, we started with the certainty of evidence from the direct or indirect evidence that dominated the evidence and, subsequently, considered rating down our certainty in the network estimate for incoherence between the indirect and direct estimates, and for imprecision (wide credible intervals) around the treatment effect estimates. When serious incoherence was present, we used, as the best estimate, that with the higher certainty of the direct and indirect evidence.

2 DEVELOPMENTAL ASPECTS OF BREATHING CONTROL

2.1 Respiratory drive

Breathing activity starts with sporadic diaphragmatic movements toward the end of the first trimester and gains stability during gestation, but remains unstable in utero, with breathing activity occurring 30% to 60% of the time at term. Fetal breathing is important for fetal lung growth,and breathing activity is already influenced in utero by the partial pressures of CO 2 and O 2 (pCO 2 and pO 2)—increasing pCO 2 and energy supply stimulate fetal breathing while hypoxia depresses diaphragmatic activity.

At term, chemoreceptor pCO 2 sensitivity and its characteristics are almost mature, but minute ventilation at any pCO 2 is higher in neonates and infants compared with adults.This is in contrast to prematurely born infants who show an attenuated sensitivity to increasing pCO 2.In contrast, peripheral pO 2 receptors require re‐adjustment to the higher oxygen levels ex utero, gaining sensitivity during the first days of life.

In summary, three distinct properties characterize the vulnerability of the newborn's ventilatory responses: (1) a hypoxic ventilatory depression which quickly reverts the initial hypoxic ventilatory stimulus to a level of ventilation below the normoxic level,(2) a slower response rate to hypercapnia in preterm born babies,and (3) a virtual absence of the potentiating, “more‐than‐additional” effect of concomitant hypercarbia on the hypoxic ventilatory response, which develops only during the first two months of life.Hypoxic ventilatory depression persists up to 6 months postnatally.A key point is that the arousal and ventilatory response to hypoxemia or airway obstruction is heterogenous and hardly predictable for the individual infant.

Furthermore, breathing stability is influenced by the immaturity of respiratory cycling and the protective reflexes. Immature breathing control manifests as apneas, either as a single event or in series as periodic breathing. Both events are primarily considered a physiological phenomenon awaiting stabilization with evolving maturation. Concerns of possible associations with sudden infant deaths have so far remained unproven.

### Comparison between breathing and aerobic exercise on clinical control in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma: protocol of a randomized trial [^38d6b075]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways that involves many cells and cellular elements. The disease severity can be classified as intermittent or persistent (mild, moderate or severe), and this classification considers the presence of diurnal and nocturnal symptoms, necessity of medication, frequency of exacerbation, physical activity limitations and pulmonary function. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyperresponsiveness and airflow obstruction, which lead to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing, particularly at night or in the early morning. All of these symptoms deteriorate in the patient’s quality of life and psychological well-being and restrict daily living physical activities (DLPA).

The asthma symptoms experienced during DLPA or the fear of triggering symptoms may keep asthmatic subjects from engaging in physical exercise, and the patients tend to be less physically active and less conditioned than healthy individuals. In addition, asthmatic patients have higher levels of anxiety and depression that have been shown to be associated with an increased number of exacerbations and the diagnosis of severe asthma. These psychosocial disorders can modify the respiratory breathing pattern, which leads to irregular breathing, frequent sighing, and predominant thoracic breathing. These irregular breathing patterns increase the number of respiratory (breathlessness, chest tightness and pain) and non-respiratory symptoms (anxiety, dizziness and fatigue).

Asthma does not have a cure but its clinical manifestations can be controlled with the appropriate treatment. The goal for asthma treatment is to achieve and maintain asthma control, and the treatment is based on medication (controllers and relievers). Clinical control is defined as an effective management of the characteristics of the disease, which include control of the following symptoms: nocturnal awakening, reliever use and activity limitation. However, recent studies have also shown that non-medicinal treatments are important adjuvants in asthma treatment, and the main techniques used worldwide are aerobic and breathing exercises.

There is evidence suggesting that aerobic training improves fitness and health related quality of life (HRQoL). Additionally, aerobic training reduces psychosocial distress, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and corticosteroid consumption, exacerbation episodes and asthma symptoms. Moreover, breathing exercises have been shown to improve HRQoL and expiratory peak flow values. Breathing exercises also reduce the levels of anxiety and depression, asthma symptoms, the use of relief medication, exacerbation episodes and airway hyperresponsiveness.

The research questions were:
Which exercise intervention is more effective to improve clinical control in patients with moderate and severe asthma?
Which are the mechanisms involved to improve clinical control in both interventions?

### Validity and reliability of outcome measures to assess dysfunctional breathing: a systematic review [^0a427f71]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The normal breathing pattern consists of thoracic and abdominal cavity expansion during inhalation and retraction during exhalation.Dysfunctional breathing (DB) deviates from the typical biomechanical pattern.Barker and Everard (2015) proposed a definition for DB as ‘an alteration in the normal biomechanical patterns of breathing that results in intermittent or chronic symptoms that may be respiratory and/or non-respiratory’.The DB subtypes include thoracic and extrathoracic patterns.Thoracic DB is often observed in hyperventilation and extrathoracic DB in patients with paradoxical vocal cord dysfunction.A DB has historically been identified under a variety of nomenclature; a few examples include thoracoabdominal asynchrony, breathing pattern dysfunction, breathing pattern disorder, unexplained breathlessness, psychological breathlessness, panic breathing, apical breathing, periodic deep sighing, hyperventilation and paradoxical breathing.DB has an estimated prevalence of 29% and 8% in people with and without asthma, respectively.This signifies that the general adult population and those with lung disease may experience DB with symptoms that may improve with treatment, contributing to improved quality of life (QoL).

### Sex differences in sleep and sleep-disordered breathing [^022afee9]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE AND RESEARCH

Sex-specific aspects and menopausal status should be taken into account when assessing the symptom presentation of SDB and selecting the type of sleep study, as well as when recommending treatment. Currently used screening questionnaires for OSA such as STOP-BANG or NoSAS are less sensitive in women than in men, especially as they rely on symptoms and characteristics of the classic male obese OSA patient. As hypopnoea associated with significant desaturations may underestimate the AHI in women, polysomnography should be performed more frequently in women instead of polygraphy. In addition, the REM-AHI should be considered specifically in women, as the total AHI based on the non-REM and REM-AHI could mask the prevalence of OSA of clinical significance in women. A low AHI in connection with OSA symptoms should not prevent a CPAP trial or other OSA therapy, especially in women. However, there are still no specific recommendations or practice guidelines for women or for sex-specific phenotypes of SDB.

Simple investigations into differences between men and women are likely to be as simplistic as asking about differences between AHI-based OSA severity categories and are unlikely to lead to consistent conclusions. Patients need to be more accurately characterized and differences between phenotypes based on multiple markers, including endotypes, need to be sought to support targeted treatment - and some phenotypes are likely to be characterized by female gender.

3 OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP‐DISORDERED BREATHING: A FUTURE PERSPECTIVE IS NEEDED

It is acknowledged that nocturnal PSG provides crucial information in challenging cases, such as in children with comorbidities, those younger than 2 years, or when the diagnosis of oSDB is uncertain. An increasing number of experts, however, are questioning the value of the AHI, which, according to current official guidelines, is used to guide treatment decisions for children with oSDB. Notably, leading experts on oSDB in adults have argued for several years that the AHI is “ neither adequate nor sufficient to diagnose and characterize oSDB severity.”

An important publication by Solano‐Pérez E et al. in 2023 echoes these concerns in children.There are several reasons for questioning the relevance of the AHI to diagnose the presence and severity of oSDB in children. First, computing the AHI is challenging: while identifying obstructive apneas on PSG recordings is usually straightforward, distinguishing central from obstructive hypo pneas remains difficult, as emphasized again recently.This distinction is crucial for accurately calculating the obstructive AHI, especially in children, where obstructive hypo pneas are more frequent than obstructive apneas, unlike in adults. Furthermore, the AHI ignores the duration of breathing cessations and the severity of associated desaturations or arousals, which are critical in determining the long‐term consequences of pediatric OSA, such as cardiovascular disease.As a result, children with similar AHIs may experience different harmful consequences, and conversely, children with primary snoring and normal AHIs may still require treatment. Therefore, there is a pressing need to better phenotype pediatric oSDB to personalize management strategies more effectively.

Risk of bias assessment

Two reviewers (KEAB, JOF) independently assessed the risk of bias (RoB) (including allocation concealment, randomization, blinded outcomes assessment, selective outcomes reporting, completeness of follow-up, stopping early for benefit). We judged each criterion for each trial as yes, no, unclear and assigned an overall RoB rating (high, unclear, low). As almost no trials had blinded outcome assessment, we focused on allocation concealment and incomplete outcome reporting in assessing each trial’s risk of bias. Reviewers resolved disagreements through discussion.

### A rational framework for selecting modes of ventilation [^982b192d]. Respiratory Care (2013). Low credibility.

Mechanical ventilation is a life-saving intervention for respiratory failure and thus has become the cornerstone of the practice of critical care medicine. A mechanical ventilation mode describes the predetermined pattern of patient-ventilator interaction. In recent years there has been a dizzying proliferation of mechanical ventilation modes, driven by technological advances and market pressures, rather than clinical data. The comparison of these modes is hampered by the sheer number of combinations that need to be tested against one another, as well as the lack of a coherent, logical nomenclature that accurately describes a mode. In this paper we propose a logical nomenclature for mechanical ventilation modes, akin to biological taxonomy. Accordingly, the control variable, breath sequence, and targeting schemes for the primary and secondary breaths represent the order, family, genus, and species, respectively, for the described mode. To distinguish unique operational algorithms, a fifth level of distinction, termed variety, is utilized. We posit that such coherent ordering would facilitate comparison and understanding of modes. Next we suggest that the clinical goals of mechanical ventilation may be simplified into 3 broad categories: provision of safe gas exchange; provision of comfort; and promotion of liberation from mechanical ventilation. Safety is achieved via optimization of ventilation-perfusion matching and pressure-volume relationship of the lungs. Comfort is provided by fostering patient-ventilator synchrony. Liberation is promoted by optimization of the weaning experience. Then we follow a paradigm that matches the technological capacity of a particular mode to achieving a specific clinical goal. Finally, we provide the reader with a comparison of existing modes based on these principles. The status quo in mechanical ventilation mode nomenclature impedes communication and comparison of existing mechanical ventilation modes. The proposed model, utilizing a systematic nomenclature, provides a useful framework to address this unmet need.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^6f4c59af]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea measurement domains—sensory–perceptual experience, affective distress, and symptom impact or burden—are defined and exemplified as follows: sensory–perceptual measures assess what breathing feels like to the patient or research subject and include single item ratings of intensity (e.g., Borg scale, visual analog scale [VAS]) and descriptors of specific sensations; affective distress measures assess how distressing breathing feels with focus that can be immediate (unpleasantness) or evaluative (judgments of meaning or consequences) and include single-item ratings of severity of distress or unpleasantness and multi-item scales of emotional response such as anxiety; symptom impact or burden measures assess how dyspnea/breathlessness affects functional ability, employment (disability), quality of life, or health status, including unidimensional rating of disability or activity limitation (e.g., Medical Research Council [MRC] scale) and multidimensional scales of quality of life/health status. Impact measures, although very important, do not directly assess what breathing feels like; time-frames for sensory–perceptual or affective ratings may be present, immediate past, or short-term recall, whereas impact measures commonly refer to designated intervals or unspecified implicit comparisons and may scale frequency rather than intensity. Instrument reporting should specify what was rated and the direction and verbal anchors (e.g., 0 = none; 10 = most imaginable), and measures should be chosen based on alignment of questionnaire content with the dyspnea aspects most relevant to clinical or research objectives.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: key concepts and advances in pulmonary rehabilitation [^b7b2e254]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD—breathing strategies: Dynamic hyperinflation limits exercise capacity in COPD, and breathing retraining that slows respiratory rate via prolonged expiration may reduce dyspnea by reducing exercise-induced dynamic hyperinflation. Adaptive strategies including yoga breathing, pursed-lips breathing, and computer-aided breathing feedback enable a slower, deeper breathing pattern; pursed-lips breathing reduced dyspnea after a 6-minute walk and computer-aided feedback reduced dynamic hyperinflation. Evidence remains limited because studies are small (n = 64, 40, and 11), so more evidence is needed to make definitive recommendations for pulmonary rehabilitation use.

### Rationale and design of the SERVE-HF study: treatment of sleep-disordered breathing with predominant central sleep apnoea with adaptive servo-ventilation in patients with chronic heart failure [^8471847d]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Up to 2–3% of the populations in many industrialized countries have chronic heart failure (HF). Despite recent advances in pharmacological treatment, HF continues to cause debilitating symptoms, frequent hospital admissions, and high mortality. Although guidelines recommend therapy with beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and other pharmacological agents, as well as device-based management such as CRT,many patients with HF have persistent symptoms and most will eventually die from cardiovascular causes, often from progressive HF.

Therefore, there is a need for new interventions that reduce symptoms, increase quality of life, and reduce hospital admissions and mortality in patients with chronic HF. It is likely that these new interventions will be targeted at specific subgroups of HF patients rather than the entire population. Treatment of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) may be one such intervention.

Sleep-disordered breathing is very common in patients with HF, with reported prevalence rates of 50–75%. The presence of SDB is associated with decreased survival in HF patients, while effective treatment of SDB could have beneficial effects.Two types of abnormal breathing during sleep predominate in SDB: obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and central sleep apnoea (CSA), which may manifest as Cheyne–Stokes respiration (CSR). There are several mechanisms by which SDB may be detrimental to cardiac function. These include tissue hypoxia and repetitive arousal from sleep with increased sympathetic nervous system activity.

Obstructive sleep apnoea is caused by obstruction of the upper airway and is the most common type of sleep apnoea. The main features are repetitive pauses in breathing during sleep (despite breathing efforts) and reduced blood oxygen saturation. OSA is present in 20–45% of chronic HF patients, a proportion that is considerably higher than that in the general population.

### Recognition and management of complex sleep-disordered breathing [^0c0a4418]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The recent rapid evolution of our understanding of the mechanisms involved in control of respiration during sleep has yielded new insights to guide our care of difficult-to-treat sleep apnea patients with complex sleep-disordered breathing. This review will describe these recent advances in the literature and suggest a model for their incorporation into clinical practice.

Recent Findings

Control of respiration during sleep shows amplified instability relative to that seen during wake in these difficult patients. Baseline (eupneic) carbon dioxide levels as well as the responsiveness of the ventilatory system to changes in carbon dioxide are all-important in this relative instability. Furthermore, the instability seen during sleep varies widely across sleep states. A further refinement of our definition of stable and unstable sleep has been developed that directly informs our understanding of the control of respiration across a night of sleep.

Summary

Complex sleep-disordered breathing is a distinct form of sleep apnea. It has recognizable characteristics that are present without, and often worsened during, positive airway pressure treatment. Both sleep state stability and the behavior of the respiratory control system contribute to this complexity. It is only with a clear understanding of the factors contributing to complex sleep-disordered breathing that implementation of truly effective clinical therapy can be achieved for this disorder, which to date is poorly controlled.

### Endotyping sleep apnea one breath at a time: an automated approach for separating obstructive from central sleep-disordered breathing [^b7c54e58]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Effective treatment of sleep apnea requires characterization of the disorder by establishing the presence, type, and severity of the sleep apnea. Currently, the presence of sleep apnea is documented through the observation of apneas and hypopneas on routine nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG). Severity is assessed by the frequency of apneas and hypopneas, constituting the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI), as well as the physiological consequences associated with respiratory events (e.g. oxygen desaturation). Establishing the type of sleep apnea as obstructive (OSA) or central (CSA) sleep apnea largely involves characterizing the type of apneas and hypopneas using an assessment of inspiratory effort; together with flow, effort determines whether upper airway resistance is elevated (likely obstructive) or not (likely central). For characterizing apneas, ventilatory effort visible on any of the noninvasive measurement modalities is considered sufficient. On the other hand, definitive hypopnea classification requires invasive measurement using esophageal manometry to determine inspiratory effort. Noninvasive surrogates of effort, such as respiratory inductance plethysmography, do not quantify ventilatory effort, but rather qualify potential consequences of obstruction (e.g. paradoxical motion of the chest and abdomen) and thus incompletely characterize hypopneas. Esophageal manometry is not acquired during routing NPSGs as it is not well tolerated and may affect overall sleep. As such, alternative noninvasive methods that separate OSA from CSA are needed.

### Sleep apnoea and hypoventilation in patients with five major types of muscular dystrophy [^70ecee5d]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Sleep-disordered breathing (sleep apnoea and hypoventilation) is common in patients with muscular dystrophy.Sleep apnoea occurs when normal breathing during sleep is interrupted.Sleep-related hypoventilation refers to breathing that is too slow or shallow during sleep resulting in impaired gas exchange as evidenced by an increase in partial arterial carbon dioxide (CO 2) pressure.Possible differences in characteristics of sleep-disordered breathing among patients with the five major types are less well understood. Moreover, little is known about the relationship between sleep apnoea and hypoventilation in those patients. In this report, we analysed baseline and sleep variables obtained from 104 in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG) studies on 73 patients diagnosed with one of the five major types of muscular dystrophy. Our goals were: (1) to compare average values of selected clinical variables among muscular dystrophy types; (2) to examine the association of hypoventilation and sleep apnoea with clinical variables and types; and (3) to characterise the association between hypoventilation and sleep apnoea in these patients.

### Effect of altering breathing frequency on maximum voluntary ventilation in healthy adults [^4c83f886]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Formerly referred to as maximum breathing capacity, maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) is a pulmonary function test (PFT) that measures the maximum amount of air a person can inhale and then exhale with voluntary effort. The test is measured in liters per minute (L·min − 1), but data is only collected for 12–15 s and then extrapolated to 1 m in order avoid prolonged hyperventilation by the participant. While the test has been used less over the recent decades due to its fewer applications than the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1), MVV still possesses clinical utility. Performing the maneuver is contingent on several factors, including respiratory system mechanics (obstructive or restrictive) and ventilatory muscle endurance. Therefore, the test provides a broad assessment of respiratory system function. Abnormal MVV results are valuable in evaluating various neuromuscular disorders and predicting the risk for postoperative complications. MVV also remains useful in cardiopulmonary exercise testing as a measure of ventilatory capacity, especially in determining an individual’s ventilatory reserve—the difference between MVV and maximal exercise ventilation —which aids in the diagnosis and differentiation of pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases.

What primarily distinguishes MVV from other PFTs, however, is the lack of standardization regarding how the maneuver is performed. A major component of the test is breathing frequency (f R), but little consensus exists on precisely what f R or range of f R values yield optimal results. The majority of both past and current research that employed MVV does not provide the frequency at which participants ventilated as part of the methodology. Moreover, the few studies that do provide this information offer diverging suggestions. One of the earliest investigations on this matter concluded that ventilating at 70 breaths·min − 1 maximized MVV. A later study utilized an f R range of 60–120 breaths·min − 1 while another argued against accepting results obtained with a frequency of less than 65 breaths·min − 1. A third investigation suggested a narrower window of 70–110 breaths·min − 1. The American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) Task Force offered perhaps the most widely accepted range of 90–110 breaths·min − 1 with an ideal rate of approximately 90 breaths·min − 1, but also declared that no specific f R can be mandated due to a lack of research on the topic.

Airway remodeling (AR) protocols and techniques—there is a lack of standardization in fundamental experimental and technical design across studies, and comparability is confounded by variability in the means, mode, intensity, and duration of effector for AR, the age of initiation, the sex of the animal, the techniques of assessing AR, and the features examined. In noninvasive imaging, questions concern standardization of the volume at which measurements are made, whether subjects are anesthetized, paralyzed, or mechanically ventilated versus spontaneously breathing, and the position during measurements; even then, differences in the sizes of airways assessed cause confusion about AR extent or intervention effects, and the imaging modality substantially influences sensitivity and specificity for assessing AR.

### Endotyping sleep apnea one breath at a time: an automated approach for separating obstructive from central sleep-disordered breathing [^52a58f83]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Implications

Developing validated tools to better characterize CSA, especially in patients with heart failure, is one of the research priorities of the American Thoracic Society. A recent international taskforce report advised that the principal step in the approach to treating CSA is establishing the presence of an underlying CSA pathophysiology in an individual; establishing the presence of CSA is fundamental to its treatment. As such, the primary step toward effective treatment of CSA is establishing presence of CSA, or absence thereof, which the proposed P obs achieves reliably within a matter of minutes from a routine clinical NPSG. Further, identifying presence of a central ventilatory disturbance that is not based on the presence of central apneas alone is clinically meaningful as it could predict failure to respond to therapies that target upper airway obstruction.

Current AASM rules and practices do not adequately operationalize classifying respiratory events (apnea/hypopneas). Although some events may be clearly central (or obstructive), many events have a combined etiology, and a lack of consensus on their identification and reporting makes it difficult for labs to operationalize any event-based rules. As recently reported, the classification performance based on these rules is relatively low. Here, we have shown how our breath-by-breath probability may overcome these limitations. Breaths are the smallest division using which one can measure an individual’s primary type of sleep apnea. With each sleep study containing several thousand breaths, breath-by-breath analyses are robust to both physiological and nonphysiological noise. In addition, breath-by-breath analyses, such as P obs, can break down and effectively characterize mixed events for which there is no consensus currently. Furthermore, rudimentary techniques can be put in place that can effectively combine P obs to generate an event-level probability, or as we have shown here, to a subject-level probability. Our results of near-perfect agreement of the probability scores on a subject level, when compared with gold-standard resistance, further indicate the clinical utility of breath-by-breath analyses and P obs in deducing subject-level outcomes.

Chronic opioid therapy—sleep-disordered breathing risks and testing: Chronic use of opioid therapy is known to disrupt sleep architecture and sleep stage distribution, and another adverse effect of opioid use is respiratory depression. It is important for medical providers to be aware of the risk of sleep-disordered breathing in chronic opioid therapy patients, with types that can be associated with chronic opioid use including both isolated symptoms (eg, snoring), as well as sleep-related breathing disorders characterized by abnormalities of respiration during sleep, including sleep-related hypoventilation, central sleep apnea (CSA), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Effective testing is available for sleep-disordered breathing associated with opioid therapy, and treatment can improve patients’ health and well-being.

### Parabrachial tachykinin1-expressing neurons involved in state-dependent breathing control [^d890f548]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Extensive research has focused on unraveling the neural circuits that control breathing, and much is known regarding the brainstem, spinal, and peripheral mechanisms that automatically produce respiratory rhythmic activity, adjust breathing to changes in chemo- and mechano-feedback, and allow it to adapt to chronic changes in metabolic or environmental demands (e.g.,–). Yet, how breathing is integrated with higher-order brain functions, how these neural substrates produce rhythmicity that can transition from being extremely robust and reliable to highly dynamic and labile, and how very rapid breathing patterns are produced have remained significant gaps in our knowledge. Here, we implemented an intersectional genetic approach to identify a subset of PBN neurons characterized by the expression of Tac1 but not CGRP that, when activated in the awake state, drive an abrupt transition to rapid breathing patterns that are distinct from chemo-reflex-driven breathing and exemplify state-dependent respiratory control in mice. Using cell-type- and projection-specific, circuit-dissection strategies to map and manipulate these neurons, we find that their respiratory effects are primarily mediated by direct projections to the vIRt of the medulla, which exert non-canonical, state-dependent, and respiratory phase-independent control of the respiratory rhythm.

The pons in general has a long history as an important region for respiratory control. Early decerebrate and in vitro experiments suggested that the pons contained a “pneumotaxic” center based on surgical transections or more specific lesions of its dorsolateral regions that resulted in elongated inspiratory durations known as apneusis –. These and many subsequent studies using similar approaches shaped the current view that the primary respiratory functions of the PBN region, including its Kölliker-Fuse subdivision in particular, are regulation of the inspiratory to expiratory phase transition, modulation of expiratory airflow patterns via the control of upper airway patency, and control of respiratory reflexes,. However, these functional roles have been largely characterized using anesthetized, in situ, or in vitro preparations, which are highly effective for investigating mechanisms of automatic respiratory control, but cannot identify anatomical regions, cell types, or mechanisms that may be conditionally activated in the awake state to regulate breathing.

### Phenotypes in obstructive sleep apnea: a definition, examples and evolution of approaches [^3cd3bfe9]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a complex and heterogeneous disorder and the apnea hypopnea index alone can not capture the diverse spectrum of the condition. Enhanced phenotyping can improve prognostication, patient selection for clinical trials, understanding of mechanisms, and personalized treatments. In OSA, multiple condition characteristics have been termed "phenotypes." To help classify patients into relevant prognostic and therapeutic categories, an OSA phenotype can be operationally defined as: "A category of patients with OSA distinguished from others by a single or combination of disease features, in relation to clinically meaningful attributes (symptoms, response to therapy, health outcomes, quality of life)." We review approaches to clinical phenotyping in OSA, citing examples of increasing analytic complexity. Although clinical feature based OSA phenotypes with significant prognostic and treatment implications have been identified (e.g., excessive daytime sleepiness OSA), many current categorizations lack association with meaningful outcomes. Recent work focused on pathophysiologic risk factors for OSA (e.g., arousal threshold, craniofacial morphology, chemoreflex sensitivity) appears to capture heterogeneity in OSA, but requires clinical validation. Lastly, we discuss the use of machine learning as a promising phenotyping strategy that can integrate multiple types of data (genomic, molecular, cellular, clinical) to identify unique, meaningful OSA phenotypes.

American Thoracic Society dyspnea—major conclusions on mechanisms highlight sensory sources and specific percepts. “A wide range of information arising from numerous sensory afferent sources (Table 2) contributes to multiple sensations of dyspnea (Table 3). Specific physiological processes may be linked to corresponding sensory descriptors, the best characterized of which are sensations of work or effort, tightness, and air hunger/unsatisfied inspiration.” Additional conclusions state, “Sensory–perceptual mechanisms underlying sensations of work or effort and of breathing are similar to those underlying similar sensations in exercising muscle,” “Tightness is relatively specific to stimulation of airway receptors in conjunction with bronchoconstriction,” and “Intensity of air hunger/unsatisfied inspiration is magnified by imbalances among inspiratory drive, efferent activation (outgoing motor command from the brain), and feedback from afferent receptors throughout the respiratory system.”

### Role of precision medicine in obstructive sleep apnoea [^3f1b7176]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnoea is a substantial clinical and public health problem because it contributes to harmful effects on quality of life, daytime symptoms, road traffic incidents, and cardiometabolic disease. Increasingly, obstructive sleep apnoea is recognised as a heterogeneous disease, and patients have varied susceptibility to long term complications and different responses to treatment. This narrative review summarises the current knowledge of precision medicine in obstructive sleep apnoea, particularly the role of symptom clusters, polysomnogram phenotypes, physiological endotypes, and circulating biomarkers in defining subtypes. In the near future, the prognostic accuracy of these measures in predicting long term complications in obstructive sleep apnoea will likely be improved, together with better matching of treatments to disease subtypes.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^dee4b819]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Neurophysiological mechanisms of dyspnea—sensory sources and qualities: The report notes that dyspnea involves multiple distinguishable sensations and likely arises from different sensory mechanisms, stating, “Dyspnea comprises several different uncomfortable respiratory sensations that are distinct in the sense that subjects describe them differently, and they can be varied independently with physiological interventions. Thus, we infer that they arise from different sensory mechanisms.” Beyond peripheral afferents, central motor signals also inform perception: “In addition to traditionally defined sensory afferents, information on the state of respiration is available from respiratory motor areas of the brain, which can send an ascending copy of their descending motor activity to perceptual areas (corollary discharge),” and “The respiratory motor system, however, is unusual in having both automatic (brainstem) and voluntary (cortical) sources of motor command; corollary discharge from these different sources probably gives rise to different sensations.”

### Breath in the technoscientific imaginary [^36d7573c]. Medical Humanities (2016). Low credibility.

Fahrenheit 451 retains traces of this breath motif, but with some critical differences. The rebels are also heard ‘breathing fast, then slower, then slow…’, but ‘the slowness of normality’ has been replaced with an ellipsis (p. 155).The rebels are not returning to normal; they are performing a strange form of Cheynes-Stokes breathing (fast, slow, cease). The implications of this relation between ‘death’ and ‘breath’ are evident early in the novel, when Montag returns home for the first time. The room he shares with Mildred is described as ‘cold but nonetheless he felt he could not breathe […] with the feeling of a man who will die in the next hour for lack of air, he felt his way toward his open, separate, and therefore cold bed’ (p. 19).Mildred herself is introduced as someone whose only signs of life are ‘the breath coming out of the nostrils’ (p. 20).In each instance, breath is immanent to the body that breathes, rather than normative and prescriptive: unlike The Fireman, Fahrenheit 451 does not make the metaphysical connection between the pathologies of individual breathing patterns and the collapse of civilisation explicit. The ‘Cheyne-Stokes respiration of civilization’ is performed, rather than referenced.

### Phenotypic approaches to obstructive sleep apnoea-new pathways for targeted therapy [^d79fbe5d]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

People develop obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) for different reasons. The ability to understand these reasons, easily identify them in individual patients, and develop therapies that target one or more of these reasons are the keys to unlocking new approaches for the treatment of OSA. In line with this approach, recent advances in OSA pathogenesis using upper airway and respiratory phenotyping techniques have identified four key causes of OSA. A narrow or collapsible upper airway ('impaired anatomy') is the primary cause. However, the anatomical contribution to OSA varies substantially. Indeed, impairment in pharyngeal anatomy can be modest and in many patients (∼20%), pharyngeal collapsibility asleep is not different to people without OSA. Thus, non-anatomical factors or 'phenotypes' that modulate pharyngeal patency are crucial determinants of OSA for many people. These include impairment in pharyngeal dilator muscle control and function during sleep, increased propensity for awakening during airway narrowing (low respiratory arousal threshold) and respiratory control instability (high loop gain). Each phenotype is a potential therapeutic target. This review summarises the recent advances in the understanding of OSA pathogenesis according to a phenotypic approach, emerging tools to identify the phenotypes, and potential new therapeutic pathways and interventions to treat this common disorder.

### Response of automatic continuous positive airway pressure devices to different sleep breathing patterns: a bench study [^57a02504]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Evaluating the usefulness of automatic continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in treating the sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) is not easy because the algorithms for automatic CPAP implemented in the devices available are not well known and are probably dependent on the device. In addition, at present it is not possible to test the behavior of automatic CPAP devices in response to well-defined breathing patterns. Our aim was to implement a bench test to characterize the responses of automatic CPAP devices by subjecting them to breathing patterns of patients with SAHS. To this end, a variety of typical breathing patterns (normal, apneas, hypopneas, flow limitation, snoring) previously recorded in patients with SAHS during sleep were reproduced by a breathing waveform generator. Five commercially available automatic CPAP devices were tested. The responses of the devices to apneas, hypopneas, flow limitation, and snoring were considerably different. In some devices, the response was modified by air leaks similar to the ones found in patients. Consequently, the effectiveness of automatic CPAP assessed in clinical tests performed by using particular devices has no general validity. Testing automatic CPAP devices in a bench study is a useful first step in evaluating the performance of this new type of device in adjusting nasal pressure for each patient.

### Should we breathe quiet or noisy? [^8620a35e]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Although introduced as weaning techniques, modes providing mechanical support of spontaneous breathing have become standard in primary mechanical ventilator support in critically ill patients. In Critical Care, Spieth and colleagues report for the first time the use of noisy pressure support ventilation (PSV) in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Normal breathing shows considerable variation in tidal volume (V T), flow rate, and respiratory rate, which is lost during mechanical ventilation (MV). In addition to elevation of intrathoracic and intrapulmonary pressures, MV causes a non-physiological uniform breathing pattern. Based on the concept that MV should mimic physiologically noisy breathing patterns, biologically variable or noisy MV was introduced, which attempted to mimic spontaneous breath-to-breath variability during volume-controlled MV. Experimental and small clinical trials suggest that biologically variable or noisy MV may improve pulmonary gas exchange, compliance and dead space by preventing de-recruitment when compared to conventional MV. These findings support the concept that alveolar recruitment achieved by large V T exceeds the de-recruitment by small V T. Other mechanisms claimed to explain improved lung function during biologically variable or noisy MV include stochastic resonance, increased respiratory sinus arrhythmia, endogenous surfactant release, and dynamic effects on the pressure-volume curve.

Nowadays, modes providing assisted support of spontaneous breathing should not only assure adequate gas exchange and unloading of the patient’s work of breathing but should provide patient-ventilator synchrony, optimized diaphragmatic unloading, lung-protective ventilation, and the preservation of physiological respiratory patterns and variability. To accomplish all these tasks ventilatory assistance can no longer be constant but has to continuously adapt to changes in ventilatory demand and respiratory mechanics. To adapt to the continuously changing respiratory demand, pressure assistance is proportional to the instantaneous flow and volume, reflecting the inspiratory muscles’ pressure during proportional assist ventilation (PAV) or proportional to the electrical activity of the diaphragm during neurally adjusted ventilator assist (NAVA). Thus, PAV and NAVA try to amplify the patient's respiratory center output. Several experimental investigations and clinical trials in small groups of critically ill patients have demonstrated that PAV and NAVA, when compared to conventional PSV, enhance patient-ventilator interaction and synchrony, which translates into better comfort and sleep quality and preserves V T variability, which has been associated with improvements in gas exchange and lung mechanics.

### Human exhaled breath analysis [^fb1cad30]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the fast-developing topic of assessment of exhaled breath components to improve the diagnosis and monitoring of respiratory and systemic diseases.

Data Sources

Review of the literature available in monographs and journals.

Study Selection

Articles and overviews on the broad spectrum of existing experimental and routinely applied methods to assess different aspects of human exhaled breath analysis were selected for presentation in this review.

Results

Exhaled breath constitutes more than 3,500 components, the bulk of which are volatile organic compounds in miniature quantities. Many of these characterize the functioning of the organism as a whole (systemic biomarkers), but some are related to processes taking place in the respiratory system and the airways in particular (lung biomarkers). Assessment of lung biomarkers has proven useful in airway inflammatory diseases. It involves direct measurement of gases such as nitric oxide and inflammatory indicators in exhaled breath condensate such as oxidative stress markers (eg, hydrogen peroxide and isoprostanes), nitric oxide derivatives (eg, nitrate and nitrates), arachidonic acid metabolites (eg, prostanoids, leukotrienes, and epoxides), adenosine, and cytokines. Integral approaches have also been suggested, such as exhaled breath temperature measurement and devices of the "electronic nose" type, which enable the capture of approaches have also been suggested, such as exhaled breath temperature measurementexhaled molecular fingerprints (breath prints). Technical factors related to standardization of the different techniques need to be resolved to reach the stage of routine applicability.

Conclusions

Examination of exhaled breath has the potential to change the existing routine approaches in human medicine. The rapidly developing new analytical and computer technologies along with novel, unorthodox ideas are prerequisites for future advances in this field.
