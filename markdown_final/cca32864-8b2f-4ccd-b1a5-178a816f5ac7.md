## Question

What strategies can be used to manage frontal lobe behaviors?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for strategies to manage "frontal lobe behaviors" and wants a clear stepwise plan with citations throughout [^116VpSWf] [^116z5ufd]. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the syndrome and symptom profile to ensure we're indeed addressing bvFTD/FTLD behaviors. Then, I should build a structured assessment framework integrating caregiver input, neuropsychology, and imaging. Next, I will prioritize non-pharmacological interventions, carefully verifying guideline scope and correcting any overgeneralizations. After that, I will outline cautious, symptom-targeted pharmacologic options with deprescribing plans. Then, I'll map targeted strategies to specific behavioral phenotypes. Finally, I'll emphasize interdisciplinary care and establish a monitoring and adjustment protocol with defined review intervals [^116VpSWf] [^116z5ufd].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and symptom profile, because jumping ahead without anchoring the syndrome risks misapplication of interventions; frontal lobe behaviors such as disinhibition, apathy, compulsivity, environmental dependency, and executive dysfunction are cardinal features of bvFTD within the FTLD spectrum, often presenting as socially inappropriate acts, impulsivity, loss of goal-directed behavior, repetitive behaviors, and impaired social cognition, with right-lateralized disease frequently linked to more socially undesirable behavior and aggression [^116VpSWf] [^112GUuMa] [^115Bsbxz] [^113koX2B]. Hold on, I should verify the broader BPSD framing: these behaviors fall under the BPSD umbrella, which spans agitation, aggression, wandering, and mood and psychotic symptoms across dementias, but in bvFTD the behavioral dyscontrol typically predominates over memory complaints early on, which is crucial for tailoring management and caregiver counseling [^115V3ARx] [^117WPx4s].

> Next, I should review a structured assessment framework, starting with collateral history because anosognosia is common and caregiver perspectives often carry diagnostic signal; structured caregiver interviews and scales like the NPI help quantify symptom burden and caregiver impact, while instruments sensitive to frontal features such as the Frontal Behavioral Battery can profile non-cognitive frontal syndromes, and targeted neuropsychological testing aids differential diagnosis from primary psychiatric disorders when combined with imaging and clinical examination [^115UEpNJ] [^115AdnSY] [^113koX2B] [^111oSaYD]. I need to ensure imaging is incorporated to increase diagnostic certainty and to appreciate lateralization effects that may influence behavioral risk profiles and management priorities, particularly right frontotemporal involvement, while recognizing staging tools can help monitor progression and evaluate interventions over time [^112GUuMa] [^116VpSWf].

> I will now examine first-line non-pharmacological interventions, but wait, let me verify the guideline scope before I overgeneralize; the CCSMH 2025 BPSD guidelines prioritize psychosocial and environmental strategies, individualized care plans, and meaningful activities as foundational, with pharmacology reserved for refractory or high-risk scenarios, which aligns with deprescribing principles and iterative plan adjustments on reassessment [^116iB7Hj] [^116z5ufd]. Initially, I thought AAFP autism and AAN tic guidelines strengthened the non-pharmacologic case here, but hold on, I should verify their applicability; those recommendations apply to ASD and Tourette syndromes, not dementia, so I should correct that assumption and anchor non-pharmacologic first-line status to CCSMH dementia-specific guidance instead [^113oWFC6] [^114zT276] [^116z5ufd]. Let me consider FTD-specific approaches: the Tailored Activity Program prescribes personalized, ability-matched activities with carer collaboration, showing feasibility and symptom reduction in FTD and providing a structured way to redirect repetitive/compulsive behaviors into constructive engagement, which is often more effective than confrontation in bvFTD [^111q8wnV] [^113K3pWa]. I should confirm additional psychosocial options: cognitive stimulation therapy and reminiscence therapy can help depressive symptoms in dementia, while adapted CBT is reasonable for anxiety in mild-to-moderate stages; caregiver education/training and environmental modifications to remove triggers, adjust settings, and use engagement/redirection strategies are core, with consideration of animal-assisted therapy or robotic pets for agitation and mood in selected cases [^117Wpqaj] [^114U7z7k] [^111kRAEE] [^111JVs7a] [^1118fFbP] [^113dyRYh] [^116pjA9a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about medication; I should confirm when pharmacologic strategies are appropriate and how to minimize harm, given mixed efficacy in FTD and potential cognitive worsening with some agents; SSRIs can be considered for disinhibition, impulsivity, or compulsions, with experimental evidence that a single citalopram dose can acutely enhance response inhibition circuitry in bvFTD, though data are limited and require cautious clinical translation with close monitoring [^113hXNZN]. I need to check antipsychotic use principles: if used for severe agitation or aggression posing risk, employ the lowest effective dose short-term and plan for deprescribing, tapering by 25–50% every 1–2 weeks after about 3 months if symptoms stabilize or no benefit is seen, in collaboration with caregivers and with vigilant monitoring of adverse effects and cognition [^116SvTBJ]. Let me verify cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine; these Alzheimer's drugs show no benefit in FTD and may worsen cognition, so they should be avoided in bvFTD unless there's compelling mixed pathology evidence, which is rarely demonstrable clinically [^113K3pWa].

> I will now target interventions to behavioral phenotypes, since aligning strategies with symptom clusters tends to improve effect sizes; for disinhibition and impulsivity, I should combine environmental controls and structured engagement with personalized activities and consider an SSRI trial in selected cases, acknowledging the modest and variable evidence base in FTD and the need for outcome tracking on NPI or similar scales [^111JVs7a] [^111q8wnV] [^113hXNZN]. For apathy, let me think about mechanisms linked to medial frontal systems; behavioral activation embedded within TAP and caregiver coaching on cueing, initiation, and routine-building are appropriate first-line approaches, with expectations set that apathy responds slowly and incompletely yet can be functionally mitigated with structure and carer strategies [^115Bsbxz] [^111q8wnV]. For compulsive and repetitive behaviors, I should double-check that redirection is prioritized over suppression; channeling fixed interests into safe, scheduled activities within TAP generally reduces disruption and may preserve dignity and engagement [^113K3pWa] [^111q8wnV]. For agitation or aggression, I need to ensure triggers are identified and removed, routines stabilized, and sensory/environmental adjustments attempted first, reserving short-term antipsychotics only when necessary and with a deprescribing plan from the outset [^111JVs7a] [^116SvTBJ]. For depressive or anxiety symptoms, reminiscence therapy, cognitive stimulation, and adapted CBT should be considered, tailoring to disease stage and caregiver capacity [^114U7z7k] [^117Wpqaj] [^111kRAEE].

> Next, I should review interdisciplinary care and caregiver support, because caregiver-mediated strategies are central to execution; an integrated team including neurology, psychiatry, occupational therapy, neuropsychology, and social work facilitates comprehensive assessment, behavioral plan design, safety management, and carer training, while caregiver burden is strongly driven by apathy and disinhibition in FTLD, necessitating early psychoeducation, skills training, respite, and support groups to prevent burnout and institutionalization [^116iB7Hj] [^111L9G77] [^115AdnSY]. Wait, let me verify that guideline emphasis; CCSMH explicitly endorses interdisciplinary, individualized care plans and provider education for BPSD, which dovetails with the FTD behavioral management approach here [^116iB7Hj].

> Finally, I need to ensure ongoing monitoring and adjustment protocols are explicit; routine reassessment at defined intervals to evaluate efficacy, tolerability, and caregiver stress is recommended, using structured measures such as the NPI for symptom burden and instruments like the FBB for frontal features, with disease staging to contextualize goals, and with mandated deprescribing reviews for antipsychotics every 3 months and periodic SSRI reviews to confirm continued indication and benefit [^116z5ufd] [^113koX2B] [^116VpSWf] [^116SvTBJ]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should verify that the plan remains dynamic; CCSMH stresses modifying, switching, or discontinuing strategies based on response, which is particularly important in bvFTD where symptom trajectories and caregiver capacity evolve, so explicit thresholds for change should be documented in the care plan and revisited regularly [^116z5ufd].

Effective management of frontal lobe behaviors centers on **structured environments** and **caregiver training** to reduce triggers and support daily function [^111JVs7a]. Non-pharmacologic strategies include environmental modifications, clear routines, and individualized activities such as the Tailored Activity Program (TAP) [^111q8wnV] and **cognitive stimulation therapy** [^117Wpqaj]. Pharmacologic options (SSRIs, antipsychotics) [^116VpSWf] are reserved for **severe symptoms** and require **careful monitoring** for side effects [^116SvTBJ] and regular reassessment. Multidisciplinary care, caregiver education, and ongoing evaluation [^116iB7Hj] are essential to maintain safety and quality of life [^116z5ufd].

---

## Non-pharmacological strategies

### Environmental modifications

- **Structured environment**: Establish clear routines [^1176Digt] and minimize distractions to reduce triggers for disinhibition and impulsivity.

- **Safety measures**: Remove hazardous objects, secure exits [^111JVs7a], and use visual cues to guide appropriate behavior.

- **Personalized activities**: Engage patients in meaningful, individualized activities [^111q8wnV] to reduce apathy and agitation [^113K3pWa].

---

### Behavioral interventions

- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Adapted CBT [^111kRAEE] can help manage anxiety and improve emotional regulation in mild-to-moderate dementia.

- **Cognitive stimulation therapy**: Effective for managing depressive symptoms and improving cognitive function in mild-to-moderate dementia [^117Wpqaj].

- **Reminiscence therapy**: Useful for managing depressive symptoms, particularly in long-term care settings [^114U7z7k].

---

### Caregiver education and support

Education programs [^1118fFbP] train caregivers to manage specific behaviors, reduce stress, and use effective coping strategies, and **support groups** should be offered to reduce isolation and caregiver burden [^111L9G77].

---

## Pharmacological interventions

Pharmacological treatments should be considered when non-pharmacological strategies are insufficient or when behaviors pose significant **safety risks** [^116VpSWf]. Medications require careful monitoring given potential side effects [^116SvTBJ] and limited evidence of efficacy [^113K3pWa].

| **Medication class** | **Indication** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| SSRIs (e.g. citalopram) [^116VpSWf] | - Disinhibition <br/> - Impulsivity | - May improve response inhibition [^113hXNZN] <br/> - Monitor for side effects |
| Antipsychotics (e.g. risperidone) | - Severe aggression <br/> - Psychosis | - Use cautiously [^116SvTBJ] <br/> - Monitor for extrapyramidal symptoms and metabolic side effects |
| Mood stabilizers (e.g. carbamazepine) [^117JeqFg] | - Aggression <br/> - Mood instability | - Limited evidence [^113K3pWa] <br/> - Monitor for side effects |

---

## Multidisciplinary approach

A multidisciplinary team — including neurologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, occupational therapists, and social workers — is essential for **comprehensive management** [^116iB7Hj]. Regular team meetings and coordinated care plans help ensure consistent, effective interventions.

---

## Monitoring and evaluation

Regular assessment of **behavioral symptoms** and **treatment effectiveness** is crucial [^116z5ufd]. Use standardized tools such as the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe) [^111Ro9Rr] and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) [^115UEpNJ] to track progress and adjust interventions as needed.

---

## Impact on caregivers and family members

Frontal lobe behaviors **significantly affect caregivers and family members** [^111L9G77], leading to increased stress, burden [^115AdnSY], and emotional distress. Providing education, support, and respite care [^1118fFbP] is essential to maintain caregiver well-being and prevent burnout.

---

## Emerging therapies and research directions

- **Neuromodulation techniques**: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are being explored for managing apathy and impulsivity.

- **Digital health interventions**: Mobile applications and telemedicine platforms are being developed to support caregivers and patients remotely [^115UEpNJ].

- **Personalized medicine**: Advances in biomarkers and genetic testing may enable tailored interventions based on individual patient profiles [^116sVR4R].

---

Effective management of frontal lobe behaviors requires a **combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological strategies**, caregiver support, and multidisciplinary care. Regular monitoring and emerging therapies offer promising avenues for improving patient outcomes and caregiver well-being [^116VpSWf].

### Improving response inhibition systems in frontotemporal dementia with citalopram [^113hXNZN]. Brain (2015). Low credibility.

Disinhibition is a cardinal feature of the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia, presenting as impulsive and impetuous behaviours that are often difficult to manage. The options for symptomatic treatments are limited, but a potential target for therapy is the restoration of serotonergic function, which is both deficient in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and closely associated with inhibitory control. Based on preclinical studies and psychopharmacological interventions in other disorders, we predicted that inhibition would be associated with the right inferior frontal gyrus and dependent on serotonin.

Using magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography of a Go-NoGo paradigm, we investigated the neural basis of behavioural disinhibition in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and the effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibition on the neural systems for response inhibition. In a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled crossover design study, 12 patients received either a single 30 mg dose of citalopram or a placebo. Twenty age-matched healthy controls underwent the same magnetoencephalography/electroencephalography protocol in one session without citalopram, providing normative data for this task.

In the control group, successful NoGo trials evoked two established indices of successful response inhibition: the NoGo-N2 and NoGo-P3. Both of these components were significantly attenuated by behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. Cortical sources associated with successful inhibition in control subjects were identified in the right.

### The tailored activity program (TAP) to address behavioral disturbances in frontotemporal dementia: A feasibility and pilot study [^111q8wnV]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2019). Low credibility.

To explore the feasibility of implementing the Tailored Activity Program (TAP) with a cohort of people with frontotemporal dementia and their carers, an occupational therapy-based intervention was utilized. This involves working collaboratively with family carers and prescribing personalized activities for behavioral management in people with dementia. Twenty dyads were randomized into the study (Tailored Activity Program: n = 9; Control: n = 11) and assessed at both baseline and 4-month intervals.

- **Methods**: Qualitative analyses evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of the program for the frontotemporal dementia cohort. Quantitative analyses, including linear mixed model analyses and Spearman's rho correlations, measured the impact of the program on the dyads.

- **Results**: The Tailored Activity Program was an acceptable intervention for the frontotemporal dementia dyads. Qualitative analyses identified five themes: "Carer perceived benefits", "Carer readiness to change", "Strategies used by carer to engage person with dementia", "Barriers to the Tailored Activity Program uptake/implementation", and "Person with dementia engagement". Quantitative outcomes showed an overall reduction of behavioral symptoms (F 18.34 = 8.073, p = 0.011) and maintenance of functional performance in the person with dementia (F 18.03 = 0.375, p = 0.548).

This study demonstrates the potential for using an activity-based intervention such as the Tailored Activity Program in frontotemporal dementia. Service providers should recognize that while people with frontotemporal dementia present with challenging behaviors, tailored activity programs can support behavioral management and functional performance.

### Selective effects of psychotherapy on frontopolar cortical function in PTSD [^116X5XPd]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Exposure therapy is an effective treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but a comprehensive, emotion-focused perspective on how psychotherapy affects brain function is lacking. The authors assessed changes in brain function after prolonged exposure therapy across three emotional reactivity and regulation paradigms. Individuals with PTSD underwent functional MRI (fMRI) at rest and while completing three tasks assessing emotional reactivity and regulation. They were then randomly assigned to either immediate prolonged exposure treatment (N = 36) or a waiting list condition (N = 30) and underwent a second scan approximately four weeks after the last treatment session or a comparable waiting period, respectively.

Treatment-specific changes were observed only during cognitive reappraisal of negative images. Psychotherapy increased lateral frontopolar cortex activity and connectivity with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex/ventral striatum. Greater increases in frontopolar activation were associated with improvements in hyperarousal symptoms and psychological well-being. The frontopolar cortex also displayed a greater variety of temporal resting-state signal pattern changes after treatment. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and fMRI in healthy participants demonstrated that the lateral frontopolar cortex exerts downstream influence on the ventromedial prefrontal cortex/ventral striatum.

Changes in frontopolar function during deliberate regulation of negative affect is one key mechanism of adaptive psychotherapeutic change.

### Advances and controversies in frontotemporal dementia: Diagnosis, biomarkers, and therapeutic considerations [^116sVR4R]. The Lancet Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia comprises a group of clinical syndromes characterized by progressive changes in behavior, executive function, or language. The term frontotemporal lobar degeneration encompasses the neurodegenerative diseases that give rise to these clinical syndromes and involve proteinopathies associated with frontotemporal network dysfunction. Improvements in clinical, genetic, and molecular characterization have provided new insights into frontotemporal dementia and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, revealing a much broader range of signs and symptoms at presentation than previously considered. Accurate and early diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia is now possible due to the development of neuropsychological measures with a special focus on social cognition. Advances in plasma and CSF biomarkers, along with innovations in structural and functional imaging, will prove useful for future clinical trials in individuals with frontotemporal dementia.

### The influence of right frontotemporal dysfunction on social behavior in frontotemporal dementia [^112GUuMa]. Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is associated with a variety of cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions. Symptoms may be influenced by the relative involvement of the right versus the left hemisphere, with left-sided FTD manifesting language changes and right-sided FTD presenting with aggressive, antisocial, and other socially undesirable behaviors.

- **Objective**: To test the hypothesis that right-sided FTD is associated with socially undesirable behavior.

- **Methods**: The authors assessed 41 patients with FTD diagnosed by the new research criteria for FTD, including behavioral, neuropsychologic, and neurologic testing as well as SPECT and MRI. Based on visual inspection of SPECT scans, 12 patients were classified as having predominantly right-sided and 19 patients were classified as having predominantly left-sided FTD. A clinician blinded to the imaging data reviewed medical records to tabulate the frequency of the following socially undesirable behaviors: criminal behavior, aggression, loss of job, alienation from family/friends, financial recklessness, sexually deviant behavior, and abnormal response to spousal crisis.

- **Results**: Eleven of 12 right-sided and 2 of 19 left-sided FTD patients had socially undesirable behavior as an early presenting symptom (chi = 23.3, p < 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: The authors conclude that right-sided frontotemporal degeneration is associated with socially undesirable behavior. The early presence of socially undesirable behavior in FTD differentiates right-sided from left-sided degeneration. The results highlight the importance of the right hemisphere in social behavior.

### Current concepts in the classification and diagnosis of frontotemporal lobar degenerations: A practical approach [^112NCx68]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Frontotemporal lobar degenerations are clinically, genetically, and molecularly heterogeneous diseases characterized by mainly frontal and temporal atrophy, affecting behavioral, language, cognitive, and motor functions. The term frontotemporal dementia incorporates three distinct clinical syndromes seen in frontotemporal degenerations: behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia, progressive nonfluent aphasia, and semantic dementia. Progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome, corticobasal syndrome, and motor neuron disease syndrome are also associated with frontotemporal lobar degenerations.

The neuropathologic hallmark of frontotemporal lobar degenerations is the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the cytoplasm and nuclei of neurons and glial cells. Proteins involved in these pathologic processes, which form the basis for the classification of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, include tau protein, transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa, and "fused in sarcoma" protein. The aim of this review is to provide a summary of practical approaches for the neuropathologic diagnostics of the rapidly evolving classifications of frontotemporal lobar degenerations.

### Criminal behavior in frontotemporal dementia: A multimodal MRI study [^116L9ecA]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Low credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), or frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), is a complex neurological disease affecting the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain — regions crucial for controlling behavior, emotion, and language. Unlike other forms of dementia, which typically affect memory first, the behavioral variant of FTD (bvFTD) manifests in changes in personality, behavior, and executive and socioemotional cognitive functions, combined with social and criminal transgressions. Among the behavioral changes, criminal behavior (CB) in individuals with bvFTD has emerged as a particularly challenging aspect for persons affected, families, and healthcare providers. CB may include shoplifting, physical aggression, sexual misconduct, or other actions that are out of character for the individual and can lead to legal issues. The loss of social norms and impulse control, common in bvFTD, contributes to these behaviors. Caregivers often find themselves in difficult positions, needing to navigate the legal system while advocating for their loved ones who do not fully comprehend the consequences of their actions due to frequent anosognosia. This situation underscores the importance of early diagnosis, tailored interventions, and support systems for both patients and their families to manage these complex challenges effectively. While not all individuals with bvFTD engage in CB, there is a notable prevalence of such actions compared to other forms of dementia.

### To what extent does frontal type executive impairment affect coping strategies in Parkinson's disease [^111khbTF]. European Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Given the frequency of executive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD), we wonder to what extent this fact might influence the coping strategies that are used.

- **Methods**: A total of 135 PD patients with no dementia were divided into two groups according to their cognitive status ('with frontal type executive impairment' or 'without frontal type executive impairment'). All patients were seen for a semi-structured interview to collect sociodemographic and clinical information and to assess their cognitive and mental states (DSM-IV-TR, frontal assessment battery, and Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale). Then, all patients completed two self-report questionnaires concerning their coping strategies (Ways of Coping Checklist and Coping with Health, Injuries and Problems Scale).

- **Results**: After controlling for depression, we noticed a significant effect of cognitive status on positive re-evaluation (P = 0.02). Interestingly, except for instrumental strategies, patients with frontal type executive impairment used significantly more coping strategies than did patients without frontal type executive impairment.

- **Conclusion**: Our results suggest that neither executive impairment nor depression prevents patients from using coping strategies extensively.

### The clinical and anatomical heterogeneity of environmental dependency phenomena [^115hjRYi]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Following damage to the frontal lobes, the observation of patients presenting with environmental dependency syndrome (EDS), particularly with its two main components — grasping and imitation behavior — provides a unique opportunity to gain new insights into the neural bases of human autonomy and free will. In the present study, thirty-nine patients with frontal lobe dysfunction, including 21 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and 18 with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), were tested for environmental dependency phenomena and underwent neuropsychological evaluation and T1-weighted 3D brain MRI.

We correlated scores obtained by assessing grasping, imitation, and utilization behaviors with both neuropsychological executive test performance and grey matter density on MRI using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). This study confirms the high frequency of two environmental dependency phenomena — grasping and imitation — in patients with frontal lobe syndrome (34/39 patients) and the rarity of utilization behavior (2/39). The grasping score was significantly and positively correlated with those obtained in all executive tests except the Stroop test, while the imitation score was not. In the VBM study, while the grasping score was correlated with grey matter density in the right superior frontal gyrus and both inferior temporal gyri, the imitation score was correlated with changes in the right insula, left medial frontal gyrus, and left precuneus.

Environmental dependency is associated with the dysfunction of a frontoparietal network. Within this large network, grasping behavior…

### The advantages of frontotemporal degeneration drug development (part 2 of frontotemporal degeneration: the next therapeutic frontier) [^111a1ErD]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2013). Low credibility.

Frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) encompasses a spectrum of related neurodegenerative disorders with behavioral, language, and motor phenotypes for which there are currently no effective therapies. This is the second of two articles summarizing the presentations and discussions from two symposia in 2011, sponsored by the Frontotemporal Degeneration Treatment Study Group — a collaborative group of academic and industry researchers devoted to developing treatments for FTD. This article discusses the status of FTD clinical research relevant to the conduct of clinical trials and explains why FTD research may be an attractive pathway for developing therapies for neurodegenerative disorders.

The clinical and molecular features of FTD, including rapid disease progression and relatively pure molecular pathology, suggest advantages in developing drugs for FTD compared to other dementias. FTD qualifies as an orphan indication, providing additional advantages for drug development. Two recent sets of consensus diagnostic criteria will facilitate identifying patients with FTD, and various neuropsychological, functional, and behavioral scales have been shown to be sensitive to disease progression. Moreover, quantitative neuroimaging measurements demonstrate progressive brain atrophy in FTD at rates that may surpass Alzheimer's disease. Finally, the similarities between FTD and other neurodegenerative diseases, with ongoing drug development efforts, suggest that FTD researchers will be able to draw on this experience for further progress.

### Associations between frontal lobe structure, parent-reported obstructive sleep disordered breathing and childhood behavior in the ABCD dataset [^112auhUc]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

The obstructive sleep disordered breathing (oSDB) factor score predicted the total problems Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) scale following adjustment for covariates (F (1, 35.96) = 334.14, Δ R² adjusted = 2.96, P < 10⁻¹⁶; Fig. 2a). Similar relationships were observed for both externalizing (F (1, 34.61) = 185.27, Δ R² adjusted = 1.68, P < 10⁻¹⁶; Fig. 2b) and internalizing problems (F (1, 34.37) = 243.18, Δ R² adjusted = 2.20, P < 10⁻¹⁶; Fig. 2c). These relationships were independent of sex (Fig. 1d–f) and are also shown for individual CBCL scales (Supplementary Fig. 1). Furthermore, for individual oSDB symptoms, the strongest association was identified between the frequency of snoring and higher CBCL scores (Fig. 1g). Higher household income partially mitigated the association between oSDB symptoms and CBCL scores (Fig. 2). The magnitudes of these interactions were similar across individual CBCL scales and for every oSDB symptom (Fig. 2k).

### Behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia: diagnosis, clinical staging, and management [^116VpSWf]. The Lancet Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) present with insidious changes in personality and interpersonal conduct, indicating a progressive disintegration of the neural circuits involved in social cognition, emotion regulation, motivation, and decision making. The underlying pathological changes are heterogeneous and characterized by various intraneuronal inclusions. Biomarkers to detect these histopathological changes in life are becoming increasingly important with the development of disease-modifying drugs. Gene mutations have been found that collectively account for around 10–20% of cases.

Recently, criteria proposed for bvFTD define three levels of diagnostic certainty: possible, probable, and definite. Detailed history taking from family members to elicit behavioral features underpins the diagnostic process, supported by neuropsychological testing designed to detect impairment in decision making, emotion processing, and social cognition. Brain imaging is important for increasing the level of diagnostic certainty. A recently developed staging instrument shows much promise for monitoring patients and evaluating therapies, which at present are aimed at symptom amelioration. Carer education and support remain of paramount importance.

### Brain mechanisms underlying apathy [^113mNwng]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

The past few decades have seen growing interest in the neuropsychiatric syndrome of apathy, conceptualized as a loss of motivation manifesting as a reduction of goal-directed behavior. Apathy occurs frequently and has a substantial impact on quality of life in a broad range of neurological and psychiatric conditions. It is consistently associated with neuroimaging changes in specific medial frontal cortex and subcortical structures, suggesting that disruption of a common systems-level mechanism may underlie its development, irrespective of the condition that causes it.

In parallel with this growing recognition of the clinical importance of apathy, significant advances have been made in understanding normal motivated behavior in humans and animals. These developments have occurred at several different conceptual levels, from work linking neural structures and neuromodulatory systems to specific aspects of motivated behavior, to higher order computational models that aim to unite these findings within frameworks for normal goal-directed behavior.

In this review, we develop a conceptual framework for understanding pathological apathy based on this understanding of normal motivated behavior. We first introduce prominent theories of motivated behavior, which often involve sequences of actions towards a goal that need to be maintained across time. Next, we outline the behavioral effects of disrupting these processes in animal models, highlighting the specific effects of these manipulations on different components of motivated behavior.

### Frontotemporal dementia: Correlations between psychiatric symptoms and pathology [^112SxhxB]. Annals of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The term frontotemporal dementia (FTD) defines a group of neurodegenerative syndromes with diverse clinical presentations, including the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and language-dominant syndromes such as primary progressive aphasia (PPA), including the nonfluent/agrammatic variant of PPA (nfPPA) and the semantic variant of PPA (svPPA). Other syndromes that are part of this group are characterized by prominent movement symptoms, such as corticobasal syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy, and FTD with motor neuron disease. Most patients present with mixed behavior, language, and motor symptoms, but are diagnosed based on their most pronounced and first onset of symptoms and/or behavior.

The past decade has seen a rapid evolution of knowledge on the clinical and genetic features of FTD. In 2011, diagnostic criteria for bvFTD and PPA were revised, which improved diagnostic accuracy. Mutations in genes such as chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72), progranulin (GRN), and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) have been identified in about 25% of patients with FTD. More recently, neuropsychiatric symptoms such as psychosis and depressed mood have been recognized as part of the early clinical presentation of FTD, both in C9orf72 repeat expansion carriers and noncarriers. Due to the clinical variability and overlap of symptoms with primary psychiatric diseases and other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, and given the lack of biomarkers, it remains challenging to diagnose FTD accurately in a clinical setting.

### Psychosis with frontal lobe epilepsy responds to carbamazepine [^113zCerM]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Frontal lobe epilepsy is an unusual form of complex partial seizures associated with behavioral changes, including fear, agitation, kicking, and screaming. The seizures are often missed or mistaken for psychiatric problems or sleep disorders. We report two unusual patients presenting with psychosis who were found to have frequent frontal lobe seizures. Treatment of the seizures with carbamazepine resulted in complete resolution of their psychiatric symptoms. The relationship between frontal lobe seizures and psychosis is explored.

### Frontal lobe-mediated behavioral changes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Are they independent of physical disabilities [^111Ro9Rr]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

Several studies have indicated that frontal cognitive impairment is present in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, it remains to be elucidated whether the behavioral change is a direct consequence of ALS pathology or if the measurements are confounded by the physical impairments. In this study, we examined frontal lobe-mediated behavioral dysfunction in daily living in patients with ALS by using the family- and self-rating forms of the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe). We also assessed the relationship between these scores with motor impairments or ventilatory status.

We examined 24 patients with sporadic ALS, who were aged 65.7 ± 10.5 years, with a mean disease duration of 2.3 ± 1.7 years. All participants had a Mini-Mental State Examination score of ≥ 24, normal Self-rating Depression Scale, no need of assistance in daily life, normal respiratory function, and normal arterial blood gas analytes. We analyzed the relationship between FrSBe scores and factors such as the ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS), respiratory function, and arterial blood gas analytes.

The scores from both family- and self-rating FrSBe were significantly higher after the onset of ALS than before, with apathy being the most notable. Importantly, the family-rating FrSBe scores after onset were not correlated with ALSFRS, respiratory function, or arterial blood gas analytes.

In conclusion, the frontal-lobe-related behavioral dysfunction is present after the onset of ALS, but it is independent of physical impairments.

### Key emerging issues in frontotemporal dementia [^111WYaDV]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) encompasses the syndromes of behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD) and primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and refers to those neurodegenerative diseases characterized by predominant pathological involvement of the frontal and temporal lobes. Recent years have witnessed major advances in the clinical characterization of FTD, reflected in the publication of updated diagnostic criteria for bvFTD and PPA. The discovery of new pathogenic mutations has added to the understanding of genotype-phenotype interactions and disease mechanisms. Emerging results from longitudinal studies of familial FTD show that imaging and cognitive changes occur years before symptom onset, and such studies may yield biomarkers of early disease that, in turn, will facilitate earlier diagnosis. The hope and guarded expectation is that these advances may together herald the beginning of the end of the chapter in which FTD is considered an inexorably progressive and untreatable condition.

### Frontal syndrome and disorders of executive functions [^112NGiGt]. Journal of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

The study of executive functions began with the early description of behavioral disorders induced by frontal damage. The development of experimental neuropsychology has led to the description of a large variety of cognitive disorders, which has generated numerous tests used in clinical practice. More recently, theoretical approaches have proposed an organization of executive processes and documented the diversity of executive functions and their related anatomy. These studies have profoundly influenced the clinical approach, assessment, and diagnosis of planning and executive disorders. In clinical practice, this data has favored specific assessments of key behavioral and cognitive deficits based on a battery of tests.

### Behavioural and cognitive profiles in frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease: a longitudinal study [^117WPx4s]. Journal of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) encompasses a heterogeneous spectrum of diseases involving degeneration of the brain's frontal and temporal lobes. Behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), semantic dementia (SD; also known as semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia), and progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA, also known as nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia) are the main clinical variants of FTD. BvFTD is the most common variant and is characterized by changes in behavior, personality, executive, and social cognition in the context of prefrontal and insular degeneration. SD is characterized by early and profound loss of semantic knowledge, attributable to progressive degeneration of the anterior temporal lobe (ATL), generally more pronounced on the left than the right hemisphere. In 30% of SD cases, the opposite pattern of brain atrophy is observed, with greater right than left ATL involvement. These patients tend to show early prosopagnosia and behavioral changes, in addition to language disturbances. Based on this differentiation, SD has often been divided into left-dominant SD (SDL) and right-dominant SD (SDR).

Importantly, many clinical symptoms overlap across FTD variants. Patients diagnosed with SD exhibit a degree of clinical, imaging, and pathological overlap with bvFTD. This is most notable for those diagnosed with SDR who tend to show socioemotional and behavioral disturbances comparable to that seen in bvFTD. Similarly, semantic and language deficits typical in SD are also observed in bvFTD.

### Cognitive profiles discriminate between genetic variants of behavioral frontotemporal dementia [^1132mDka]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) includes a large spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders with a variable clinical presentation of either progressive behavioral and executive deficits, known as behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), or language dysfunction, known as primary progressive aphasia (PPA). These disorders are associated with prominent frontal and/or anterior temporal lobe degeneration. BvFTD is the most common phenotype in the clinical spectrum, and its neuropsychological profile is generally characterized by impaired executive function, such as planning, set shifting, and working memory, and social cognition, such as theory of mind and emotional processing. In contrast, memory and visuoconstruction are relatively spared compared to executive dysfunction.

However, it is increasingly clear that these cognitive impairments vary in severity and progression. For example, executive dysfunction may be absent or overshadowed by behavioral dysfunctions, and/or significant episodic memory impairment can be present even at the earliest stages of the disease. The factors influencing the variety in cognitive impairments between patients with bvFTD are not yet understood.

### Redefining the multidimensional clinical phenotypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes [^115jhGXc]. Brain (2020). Low credibility.

The clinical disorders caused by frontotemporal lobar degeneration pathologies (FTLD) are highly heterogeneous in their pathology and phenotypes. Patients are typically diagnosed with one of several principal syndromes, including behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), primary progressive aphasia [with the non-fluent (nfvPPA) and semantic (svPPA) subtypes], progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), or corticobasal syndrome (CBS). The clinicopathological correlations of these syndromes are imprecise. For example, bvFTD can be associated with tau, TDP-43, FUS protein inclusions, or mixed neuropathology. Some clinical syndromes, such as PSP-Richardson's syndrome, have good correlation with the associated pathology; however, the corresponding pathology may have diverse phenotypic expressions. Recent revisions of diagnostic criteria recognize this heterogeneity, and there may be future improvements in clinicopathological correlations by imaging or fluid-based biomarkers, aiming to optimize patient selection for disease-modifying therapies.

Here, we propose that the effort to refine the diagnostic segregation of the disorders has fundamental limitations. These are not merely due to the limits of a given test or biomarker but are biologically real constraints that can, in turn, be informative about the nature of the disorders. We suggest that a better understanding of aetiology and pathophysiology, and more effective therapies, can be gained by examining the phenotypic patterns across the broad spectrum of all FTLD-associated diseases. Symptomatic approaches should be considered in conjunction with understanding the underlying biology.

### Associations between frontal lobe structure, parent-reported obstructive sleep disordered breathing and childhood behavior in the ABCD dataset [^116a7u3n]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Parents frequently report behavioral problems among children who snore. Our understanding of the relationship between symptoms of obstructive sleep disordered breathing (oSDB) and childhood behavioral problems associated with brain structural alterations is limited. Here, we examine the associations between oSDB symptoms, behavioral measures such as inattention, and brain morphometry in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study comprising 10,140 preadolescents.

We observe that parent-reported symptoms of oSDB are associated with composite and domain-specific problem behaviors measured by parent responses to the Child Behavior Checklist. Alterations of brain structure demonstrating the strongest negative associations with oSDB symptoms are within the frontal lobe. The relationships between oSDB symptoms and behavioral measures are mediated by significantly smaller volumes of multiple frontal lobe regions. These results provide population-level evidence for an association between regional structural alterations in cortical gray matter and problem behaviors reported in children with oSDB.

### Apathy and impulsivity in frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes [^111VAjsg]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

Apathy and impulsivity are common and disabling consequences of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, causing substantial distress to caregivers. However, their etiology remains elusive. Previous studies in this area have critical limitations, including: (i) the assessment of either apathy or impulsivity alone, despite their frequent co-existence; (ii) the assessment of behavioral changes within single diagnostic groups; and (iii) the use of limited sets of tasks or questions that relate to just one aspect of these multifactorial constructs.

We propose an alternative, dimensional approach that spans behavioral and language variants of frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal syndrome. This approach accommodates the commonalities of apathy and impulsivity across disorders and reveals their cognitive and anatomical bases. Measuring the components of apathy and impulsivity and their associated neural correlates across diagnostic groups would provide better novel targets for pharmacological manipulations, facilitate new treatment strategies, and strengthen translational models.

We determined the neurocognitive components of apathy and impulsivity in frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes. The frequency and characteristics of apathy and impulsivity were assessed through neuropsychological and behavioral assessments in 149 patients and 50 controls from the Pick's disease and Progressive supranuclear palsy Prevalence and Incidence study (PiPPIN). Dimensions of apathy and impulsivity were derived using principal component analysis.

### Changes in cognition and behaviour in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Nature of impairment and implications for assessment [^113SnF32]. The Lancet Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Increased awareness of cognitive and behavioural change in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has been driven by various clinic-based and population-based studies. A frontotemporal syndrome occurs in a substantial proportion of patients, a subgroup of whom present with frontotemporal dementia. Deficits are characterised by executive and working-memory impairments, extending to changes in language and social cognition. Behaviour and social cognition abnormalities are closely similar to those reported in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, implying a clinical spectrum linking amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia.

Cognitive impairment should be considered in clinical management, but few specialist assessment resources are available, and thus the cognitive status of most patients is unknown. Standard assessment procedures are not appropriate to detect dysfunction due to progressive physical disability; techniques that better measure the problems encountered by this group of patients are needed to further establish disease effects. Screening instruments are needed that are validated specifically for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, encompass the heterogeneity of impairment, and accommodate physical disability.

### Better without (lateral) frontal cortex? Insight problems solved by frontal patients [^114FD6i2]. Brain (2005). Low credibility.

A recently proposed theory on frontal lobe functions claims that the prefrontal cortex, particularly its dorsolateral aspect, is crucial in defining a set of responses suitable for a particular task and biasing these for selection. This activity is carried out for virtually any kind of non-routine tasks without distinction of content. The aim of this study is to test the prediction of Frith's 'sculpting the response space' hypothesis by means of an 'insight' problem-solving task, namely the matchstick arithmetic task.

Starting from Knoblich et al.'s interpretation for the failure of healthy controls to solve the matchstick problem and Frith's theory on the role of the dorsolateral frontal cortex, we derived the counterintuitive prediction that patients with focal damage to the lateral frontal cortex should perform better than a group of healthy participants on this rather difficult task. We administered the matchstick task to 35 patients (aged 26–65 years) with a single focal brain lesion as determined by a CT or an MRI scan, and to 23 healthy participants (aged 34–62 years).

The findings seemed in line with theoretical predictions. While only 43% of healthy participants could solve the most difficult matchstick problems ('type C'), 82% of lateral frontal patients did so (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.05). In conclusion, the combination of Frith's and Knoblich et al.'s theories was corroborated.

### Progress and challenges in frontotemporal dementia research: A 20-year review [^113K3pWa]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

- **Interventions and carer research in FTD**: One disappointment over the past 20 years is the lack of progress in developing effective pharmacological treatments for FTD. Disease-modifying treatments specific to this disease remain years away, as demonstrated by the recent negative findings of a recently completed double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of LMTM, a drug targeting tau protein aggregation, trialed in patients with bvFTD. Drugs used in AD, such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or NMDA receptor inhibitors, provide no benefits in FTD and may even negatively impact cognition. Similarly, symptomatic treatments of challenging behaviors (e.g. disinhibition, agitation, aggression) with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or antipsychotics have yielded mixed results.

On a more positive note, over the same time period, efforts have been dedicated to developing non-pharmacological interventions, particularly in the management of difficult or inappropriate behavior and language deficits. As has been well described previously, repetitive behaviors, such as lining up objects or engaging in repetitive activities like jigsaw puzzles, become increasingly common in a subset of bvFTD and SD patients as the disease progresses. Interventions, such as the Tailored Activities Program (TAP), that directly target specific behaviors and redirect them into personalized activities (selected in consultation with the carer) have demonstrated positive results, both in reducing the disruption associated with the behavior and in increasing meaningful engagement.

### Psychiatric symptoms of frontotemporal dementia and subcortical (co-)pathology burden: new insights [^1159HFs7]. Brain (2023). Low credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia is an early-onset neurodegenerative disease that is challenging to diagnose due to its heterogeneous clinical presentation and significant social impact. Frontotemporal dementia encompasses several clinical presentations, including neuropsychiatric (i.e. behavioural and psychiatric), language, and motor syndromes, which largely overlap after the early disease stages.

- **Behavioural symptoms**: These are the most common and shared features between different clinical presentations of frontotemporal dementia. Psychiatric symptoms have recently been recognized as a central feature of frontotemporal dementia: up to 50% of patients with the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia are initially misdiagnosed with a primary psychiatric disorder (PPD). Among the psychiatric symptoms of frontotemporal dementia, hallucinations have been reported in up to 17% of sporadic patients, although the lack of a formal inclusion criterion in the consensus clinical criteria may lead to an underestimate.

Not only is the clinical presentation of frontotemporal dementia complex, but so is the underlying pathology, known as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). It includes three main distinct subtypes of pathologically misfolded proteins: TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43), tau, and fused in sarcoma (FUS). Adding further to the complexity, FTLD pathological subtypes are scarcely predictable based on frontotemporal dementia clinical syndromes. On the other hand, it has been recently shown that single symptoms, rather than clinical syndromes, can be an important indicator.

### Frontal lobe seizures: Overview and update [^11153jRa]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Frontal lobe seizures (FLS) are debilitating for patients, highly diverse, and often challenging for clinicians to evaluate. Frontal lobe epilepsy is the second most common localization for focal epilepsy and, if pharmacoresistant, can be amenable to resective surgery. A detailed study of frontal seizure semiology, in conjunction with careful anatomical and electrophysiological correlation based on intracerebral recording with stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG), has demonstrated that ictal motor semiology reflects a hierarchical rostro-caudal axis of frontal lobe functional organization, thus helping with presurgical localization. Main semiological features allowing distinction between different frontal sublobar regions include motor signs and emotional signs. Frontal lobe seizure semiology also represents a valuable source of in vivo human behavioral data from a neuroscientific perspective.

Advances in defining underlying etiologies of FLE are likely to be crucial for the appropriate selection and exploration of potential surgical candidates, which could improve surgical outcomes. Future research on investigating the genetic basis of epilepsies and their relation to structural substrates (e.g. focal cortical dysplasia) and seizure organization and expression could permit a "genotype-phenotype" approach. This could be complementary to anatomical electroclinical correlations in better defining the spectrum of FLS, helping optimize patient selection and prognostication concerning therapeutic choices.

### The effects of behavioral and psychological symptoms on caregiver burden in frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, and Alzheimer's disease: Clinical experience in China [^115AdnSY]. Aging & Mental Health (2017). Low credibility.

Caregivers of individuals with neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Lewy body dementia (DLB), and Alzheimer's disease (AD), experience high levels of psychological and physical stress, likely due to behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). This study is the first to simultaneously evaluate the effects of BPSD on caregiver burden in these three types of dementia.

A total of 214 dementia patients, including probable FTD (n = 82), DLB (n = 22), and AD (n = 110), as well as their primary caregivers, were assessed using psychological inventories and cognitive evaluation. The FTD group was further divided into three established clinical variants: behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD, n = 51), non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA, n = 15), and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA, n = 16). Cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Clock Drawing Test, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), respectively. Caregiver burden was assessed using the Zarit Burden Inventory (ZBI).

FTD patients had higher NPI and ZBI scores than DLB and AD patients, whose scores were similar. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the factors influencing caregiver burden for each group were:

- **FTD**: Total NPI scores, agitation, and aberrant motor behavior.
- **bvFTD**: Total NPI scores.
- **DLB**: Total NPI scores.
- **AD**: Total NPI scores, onset age, apathy, and ADL.

Caregivers of bvFTD patients experienced significant stress related to behavioral symptoms.

### Frontotemporal dementia subtypes based on behavioral inhibition deficits [^113zsMYW]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2021). Low credibility.

Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is a neurodegenerative disease resulting from frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Due to high phenotypic diversity across patients and disease stages, understanding the underlying mechanisms is challenging. Precise characterization of the various clinical profiles within the bvFTD spectrum would enhance knowledge of the pathology and its progression, facilitating adaptation of treatments to patients' specific profiles.

Social disinhibition, impulsivity, and compulsivity are diagnostic criteria for bvFTD. Interestingly, as they are all "positive" (hyperactivity) symptoms, they are rapidly noticeable by observers. Social disinhibition, from a behavioral perspective, refers to the lack of control over emotional, social, and more generally "overt" behaviors in a social context. Impulsivity involves unplanned, premature actions with diminished regard for potential negative consequences, while compulsivity relates to persistent automatic actions with no apparent relationship to an overall goal, often resulting from an inability to adapt behavior flexibly to the situation.

These three interrelated concepts share underlying mechanisms of dysfunctional inhibition of thoughts and behavior, making them difficult to disentangle. Additionally, the tests currently used to assess these symptoms rely on reports from patients or caregivers, which can be biased by the reporter's subjectivity and lack ecological validity. The precise characterization of em…

### Identifying specific clinical symptoms of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia versus differential psychiatric disorders in patients presenting with a late-onset frontal lobe syndrome [^111oSaYD]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Early differentiation between psychiatric disorders and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is of paramount importance in patients with late-onset frontal lobe syndrome. While bvFTD leads to deterioration, psychiatric disorders are treatable. At the time of writing, misdiagnosis often occurs due to an overlap of symptoms and lack of specific biomarkers. The aim of our study was to investigate whether specific symptoms could separate bvFTD from psychiatric disorders.

In a naturalistic, prospective, multicenter study, 137 patients (aged 45–75 years, 72% male) with late-onset frontal lobe syndrome were included based on their scores on the Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI) and the Stereotypy Rating Inventory (SRI) from April 2011 to June 2013. In a multidisciplinary consensus meeting, diagnoses were established based on elaborate neuropsychological testing, magnetic resonance imaging, fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and clinical examination by a neurologist and a psychiatrist, according to the International bvFTD Criteria Consortium for bvFTD and DSM-IV-TR criteria for psychiatric disorders.

Forty-four subjects (32.8%) were diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder, 10 (7.3%) with possible bvFTD, and 45 (32.8%) with probable bvFTD. A logistic regression analysis was performed with "psychiatry or bvFTD" as the dependent variable and clinical variables (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS], SRI, FBI) and demographics as independent variables. A positive history of psychiatric illness was also considered.

### A meta-analysis of behavior therapy for Tourette syndrome [^111bDQJC]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2014). Low credibility.

Individual randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of habit reversal training and a comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics (collectively referred to as behavior therapy, BT) have demonstrated efficacy in reducing tic severity for individuals with Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders (collectively referred to as TS), with no examination of treatment moderators. The present meta-analysis synthesized the treatment effect sizes (ES) of BT relative to comparison conditions and examined moderators of treatment.

A comprehensive literature search identified eight RCTs that met inclusion criteria, producing a total sample of 438 participants. A random effects meta-analysis found a medium to large ES for BT relative to comparison conditions. Participant mean age, average number of therapy sessions, and the percentage of participants with co-occurring attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were found to moderate treatment effects. Participants receiving BT were more likely to exhibit a treatment response compared to control interventions, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of three. Sensitivity analyses failed to identify publication bias.

Overall, BT trials yield medium to large effects for TS that are comparable to treatment effects identified by meta-analyses of antipsychotic medication RCTs. Larger treatment effects may be observed among BT trials with older participants, more therapeutic contact, and less co-occurring ADHD.

### The frontal behavioral battery: A measure of frontal lobe symptoms in brain aging and neurodegenerative disease [^113koX2B]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Low credibility.

Approximately 90% of persons living with dementia experience behavioral symptoms, including frontal lobe features involving motivation, planning, social behavior, language, personality, mood, swallowing, and gait.

- **Objective**: We conducted a two-stage study with a development sample (n = 586) and validation sample (n = 274) to evaluate a brief informant-rated measure of non-cognitive features of frontal lobe dysfunction: the Frontal Behavioral Battery (FBB).

- **Methods**: In the development sample, internal consistency, principal factor analysis, and correlations between the FBB and outcomes were evaluated. In the validation sample, we examined (a) FBB scores by diagnosis, (b) known-group validity by demographics, subjective complaints, and dementia staging, and (c) correlation between FBB and MRI volumes. Receiver operator characteristic curves assessed the ability of the FBB to discriminate individuals with frontal lobe features due to a neurodegenerative disease.

- **Results**: The FBB characterized 11 distinct frontal lobe features. Individuals with dementia with Lewy bodies and frontotemporal degeneration had the greatest number of frontal lobe features. Premorbid personality traits of extroversion, agreeableness, and openness were associated with fewer frontal lobe behavioral symptoms, while subjective cognitive complaints were associated with greater symptoms. The FBB provided very good discrimination between individuals with and without cognitive impairment (diagnostic odds ratio: 13.1) and between individuals with and without prominent frontal lobe symptoms.

### Brain mechanisms underlying apathy [^115oyi2J]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

The past few decades have seen growing interest in the neuropsychiatric syndrome of apathy, conceptualized as a loss of motivation manifesting as a reduction of goal-directed behavior. Apathy occurs frequently and has a substantial impact on quality of life across a broad range of neurological and psychiatric conditions. It is consistently associated with neuroimaging changes in specific medial frontal cortex and subcortical structures, suggesting that disruption of a common systems-level mechanism may underlie its development, irrespective of the condition that causes it.

In parallel with this growing recognition of the clinical importance of apathy, significant advances have been made in understanding normal motivated behavior in humans and animals. These developments have occurred at several conceptual levels, from work linking neural structures and neuromodulatory systems to specific aspects of motivated behavior, to higher-order computational models that aim to unite these findings within frameworks for normal goal-directed behavior.

In this review, we develop a conceptual framework for understanding pathological apathy based on this understanding of normal motivated behavior. We first introduce prominent theories of motivated behavior, which often involves sequences of actions towards a goal that need to be maintained across time. Next, we outline the behavioral effects of disrupting these processes in animal models, highlighting the specific effects of these manipulations on different components of motivated behavior.

### Associations between frontal lobe structure, parent-reported obstructive sleep disordered breathing and childhood behavior in the ABCD dataset [^113dbhwA]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study is a long-term study of brain development and child health in the United States and comprises a diverse sample of typically developing children. Given the importance of obstructive sleep disordered breathing (oSDB) with a prevalence approaching 10%, we determined whether the observations from previous studies concerning the regional changes in the brain related to oSDB are replicable in the ABCD dataset. We hypothesized that the associations between parent-reported symptoms of oSDB and behavioral measures in children are mediated by alterations in brain morphometric characteristics.

Here, we show that the symptoms of oSDB, such as snoring, are associated with composite and domain-specific problem behaviors in children assessed using the child behavior checklist (CBCL). Multiple frontal lobe regions are smaller in volume among children with a greater symptom burden of oSDB. The regional frontal lobe volumes additionally mediate the relationship between parent-reported oSDB and problem behaviors measured in children using CBCL. These findings support a potential neural substrate at a population level for the previously observed behavioral morbidity in children with symptoms of upper airway obstruction.

### Caregiver perspectives enable accurate diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease [^115UEpNJ]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis is an essential step for the clinical care, management, and research of patients with neurodegenerative disorders. An ideal diagnostic test or tool would be cheap, safe, scalable, and accurate across multiple diseases. Commonly used technological approaches, based on magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid, meet some but not all of these criteria, while novel digital technologies and wearable devices are still in development. Here, we consider an alternative approach based on the detailed analysis of caregiver-reported behavioral and functional changes that frequently accompany neurodegenerative diseases.

A diagnosis of dementia is based not just on an affected person's symptoms or manifest signs of disease, but also often the account of a caregiver, relative, or other informant. This perspective from a third party (the informant) may differ from that of the person with the disease, especially when the illness affects insight into the effects of the illness, and may convey disease-specific information. A collateral history is recommended for clinical diagnosis of dementias and is useful for care planning. Clinical trials may also require an informant contribution to clinically meaningful endpoints.

Formalizing informant collateral information can be achieved with structured questionnaires. For example, many studies of dementia have used the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), which is completed by a clinician following a caregiver interview. Other scales measure the impact of dementia on a caregiver.

### Incidence of syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration in 9 European countries [^113qZV2E]. JAMA Neurology (2023). High credibility.

In light of recent developments in pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment approaches, and to promote appropriate public health service policies, it is essential to quantify the incidence and prevalence of FTLD-associated disorders. This observation prompted the formation of the Frontotemporal Dementia Incidence European Research Study (FRONTIERS), a collaborative European research initiative aimed at assessing FTLD incidence across Europe, aligning multinational population-based disease registries.

In the present retrospective analysis, FRONTIERS aimed to address six critical issues in the field:

- **To assess the incidence** of FTLD-related disorders across Europe.
- **To assess the geographic heterogeneity** of the disease presentations.
- **To define age- and sex-specific incidence rates** of FTLD.
- **To describe the distribution** of different FTLD phenotypes, related clinical features, and phenotype heterogeneity.
- **To assess the frequency** of a positive family history across phenotypes.
- **To estimate the numbers of new cases in Europe** on the basis of the data obtained.

### Disentangling clinical profiles of apathy in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia [^112vAGNF]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Because the frontal lobes are always affected, but not uniformly across bvFTD patients, we hypothesized that these patients could be clinical models to disentangle different apathy profiles characterized by different combinations of apathy mechanisms (or apathy subtypes). The bvFTD population is known to be very heterogeneous, and because of the high phenotype diversity across patients and disease stages, it can be challenging to understand the underlying mechanisms of bvFTD symptoms.

Several categorizations of bvFTD patients have already been suggested, either based on their clinical phenotype or their neuroanatomical features. For instance, exploratory classifications of bvFTD patients showed that distinct anatomical subtypes could be identified according to their degree of grey matter loss within frontal and temporal lobes or according to their gray matter loss in specific functional neural networks. Distinct behavioral phenotypes of bvFTD have also been disentangled, particularly according to the severity of disinhibition and apathy symptoms. However, bvFTD patients have never been stratified according to their apathy profiles.

According to Massimo and colleagues, the decrease in goal-directed behaviors observed in the syndrome of apathy may stem from any combination of deficits in initiation, planning, and motivation. Thus, apathy subtypes are not exclusive in a patient; they interact and form a specific combination resulting in an "apathy profile". Such a profile approach, which is no longer dimension-based, allows consideration of the phenotypic diversity of apathy in a more holistic manner.

### Rationale, design, and methodology of a prospective cohort study for coping with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia: The RECage project [^117JAQYW]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Low credibility.

As far as the neurocognitive diseases of other etiology are concerned, BPSD is also reported in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), especially in the behavioral type (bvFTD). The most frequent symptoms in bvFTD seem to be apathy, irritability, disinhibition, wandering, social inappropriateness, and agitation/aggression, while depression is also a common symptom, even if in lower percentages. Behavioral symptoms in FTD seem to cause a greater burden for FTD caregivers in comparison to AD caregivers. Similarly, regarding vascular dementia, which is the second most frequent type of dementia, sleep disturbances and depression seem to be the most common symptoms, with percentages of 63% and 59%, respectively. Apathy (56%), eating disorders (54%), and anxiety (49%) follow. Irritability (38%), aggression (33%), and aberrant motor activity (17%) are less frequent, while delusions (11%), hallucinations (9%), and euphoria (1%) are present in lower percentages. Finally, BPSD are also frequent in Lewy body dementia and can be very difficult to manage.

BPSD are more prominent in younger patients and are associated with loss of functioning. They cause significant caregiver distress, often leading to institutionalization, and increase the costs of dementia care.

To reduce psychological caregiver distress and avoid patient institutionalization, pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies are applied to treat BPSD. Regarding pharmacological treatment, antipsychotics are among the most frequently prescribed drugs for up to 60% of patients with BPSD.

### Staying on the job: The frontal lobes control individual performance variability [^115teHLv]. Brain (2003). Low credibility.

The causes of variability in performance by individual subjects have rarely been investigated, although excessive variability or inconsistency may be a functionally significant factor for many real-life activities. Our objective was to determine whether patients with focal frontal brain lesions exhibit excessive individual performance variability.

Thirty-six patients with focal frontal (n = 25) or non-frontal (n = 11) lesions were compared with 12 control subjects on different measures of intra-individual variability: dispersion within a testing session and consistency across testing sessions. Four reaction time tasks, varying in levels of complexity and based on a model of detection using feature integration, were administered. Following the first test session, 22 patients and 10 controls returned for two subsequent test sessions, which permitted the assessment of consistency of performance.

Measures of abnormal dispersion of performance on these tests were observed in frontal patients only, except those with exclusively inferior medial damage. Disturbances in consistency of performance were observed primarily in patients with frontal lesions. Damage to the frontal lobes impairs the stability of cognitive performance, and damage to different frontal regions causes different profiles of abnormal variability. Fluctuations in performance of a task may underlie some of the reported difficulties in daily tasks experienced by patients with frontal injuries.

### Non-pharmacological management for patients with frontotemporal dementia: A systematic review [^116ttPR8]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by changes in behavior and language caused by focal degeneration of the frontal and anterior temporal lobes. The behavioral symptoms are distressing to patients and their caregivers. Non-pharmacological management is important as no disease-specific pharmacological treatment for FTD is currently available. The primary objective is to review the literature on non-pharmacological management for FTD and to propose directions for future research, with reference to findings. A search was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. Search terms included "frontotemporal dementia" and words related to non-pharmacological management, and it identified a total of 858 articles.

Results revealed that very few randomized controlled trials exist on non-pharmacological management interventions for FTD. These interventions have been proposed by literature based on clinical experience. A small number of studies have supported behavioral management techniques that exploit disease-specific behaviors and preserved functions in patients with FTD, along with the management of caregivers' distress. These limitations warrant well-designed, large-scale research to examine the effects of non-pharmacological interventions on behavioral symptoms of FTD.

### The contribution of behavioral features to caregiver burden in FTLD spectrum disorders [^111L9G77]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2022). Low credibility.

Caregivers of patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) spectrum disorders experience tremendous burden, which has been associated with the neuropsychiatric and behavioral features of the disorders.

- **Methods**: In a sample of 558 participants with FTLD spectrum disorders, we performed multiple-variable regressions to identify the behavioral features that were most strongly associated with caregiver burden, as measured by the Zarit Burden Interview, at each stage of the disease.

- **Results**: Apathy and disinhibition, as rated by both clinicians and caregivers, as well as clinician-rated psychosis, showed the strongest associations with caregiver burden. This pattern was consistent when participants were separated cross-sectionally by disease stage. In addition, behavioral features appeared to contribute most to caregiver burden in patients with early dementia.

- **Discussion**: Caregivers should be provided with early education on the management of the behavioral features of FTLD spectrum disorders. Interventions targeting apathy, disinhibition, and psychosis may be most useful to reduce caregiver burden.

### The Canadian Coalition for Seniors' Mental Health Canadian clinical practice guidelines for assessing and managing behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) [^111JVs7a]. Canadian Geriatrics Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, specifically with respect to psychosocial interventions, the CCSMH 2025 guidelines recommend considering psychosocial approaches. These include patient and caregiver education, removal of environmental triggers, changes in the environment, and strategies to engage patients with dementia in other activities. The goal is to reduce sexual expressions of potential risk in dementia. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against pharmacologic interventions for reducing sexual expressions of potential risk in patients with dementia.

### Anxious individuals shift emotion control from lateral frontal pole to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [^117MWxjZ]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and difficult to treat. This difficulty primarily stems from excessive avoidance of feared situations, which prevents learning through exposure. The ability to override these strong avoidance tendencies in favor of alternative actions involves a flexible action-selection process, known to rely on a distributed circuit revolving around the lateral frontopolar cortex (FPl). This circuit interacts with the posterior parietal cortex, sensorimotor cortex (SMC), and amygdala. When people are faced with the challenge of overriding automatic emotional behaviors, such as social avoidance tendencies, the FPl coordinates that distributed circuit to guide emotionally adaptive behavior.

The FPl involvement is mechanistically causal as well as clinically consequential: emotional action selection fails after FPl interference, and variation in FPl recruitment predicts resilience against the development of emotional disorders later in life. Here, we build on those insights to identify functional, structural, and neurochemical properties of the FPl that explain variation in the implementation of neural control over emotional behavior between high-anxiety individuals and their non-anxious peers.

### Progress and challenges in frontotemporal dementia research: A 20-year review [^111p99nD]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

One of the most common questions patients with dementia and their families ask, along with the diagnosis, is regarding prognosis. The disease duration in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) averages about 7–9 years from the onset of clinical symptoms. However, this period is highly variable, ranging from 18 months to more than 20 years. The disease duration also varies across FTD subtypes, tending to be longer in the language syndromes compared to the behavioral syndromes.

- **Understanding disease progression in FTD**: In behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), disease progression is similarly variable. The diagnostic criteria for a diagnosis of 'probable' bvFTD offer high clinical certainty. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of individuals meeting the 'probable' criteria at baseline will continue to do so over time, or will transition to the 'certain' diagnostic category, either due to postmortem confirmation or results from genetic investigations. In essence, while the exact underlying pathology in these individuals may still be unclear, the likelihood of being frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is high.

	- The provision of 'possible' and 'probable' disease certainty classifications in the revision of the consensus criteria has enabled the identification and investigation of 'possible' cases. In these individuals, the initial clinical presentation is often unclear, sometimes due to a lack of supporting neuroimaging evidence or a limited constellation of clinical symptoms. Progression of these 'possible' bvFTD cases over time is becoming better understood, with findings indicating that half of these individuals will eventually meet the more stringent criteria.

### Behavioral syndromes in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease [^114ZSQq7]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Behavioral disturbances belong to the core symptoms of dementia and are also common in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The identification of sets of symptoms is clinically interesting, as interventions targeting syndromes may be more effective than the management of individual symptoms.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to identify, describe, measure, and compare the fundamental behavioral syndromes that underlie the observed behavioral symptoms in MCI and Alzheimer's disease (AD).

- **Methods**: A cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a prospective, longitudinal study on behavioral symptoms in MCI and dementia was performed. The study population consisted of 270 MCI and 402 AD patients. Behavioral assessment was performed by means of the Middelheim Frontality Score (MFS), Behave-AD, Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), and Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD). Principal components factor analysis with Direct Oblimin rotation was carried out on the MFS score ≥ 5, seven cluster scores of the Behave-AD, and the total scores of the CMAI and the CSDD.

- **Results**: We identified three factors explaining behavior in the MCI group: a depression, a psychosis, and an agitation syndrome. Similar factors were found in AD, but the order differed: an agitation, a depression, and a psychosis syndrome, respectively. The structure also differed slightly. Diurnal rhythm disturbances and frontal lobe symptoms loaded with the depression syndrome in MCI, whereas in AD, they loaded with the agitation syndrome. Behavioral syndromes correlated in AD, but not in MCI, and the prevalence and se.
