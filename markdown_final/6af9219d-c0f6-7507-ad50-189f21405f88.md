## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which observation correctly describes the titration of a weak base with a strong acid, specifically regarding the shape of the pH curve and the pH at the equivalence point. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial solution chemistry and why the pH starts high. Then, I should verify how the pH changes as strong acid is added before the equivalence point. Next, I will examine the behavior near the equivalence point and determine the expected pH there. After that, I need to check what happens past the equivalence point. Finally, I will compare each answer choice against this expected profile and select the best match, making sure I don't conflate weak base–strong acid with weak acid–strong base behavior.

> Let me first confirm the starting conditions. A weak base in water produces hydroxide ions and leaves its conjugate acid, so the initial pH is alkaline, typically above 7, and the solution exhibits buffering capacity due to the base–conjugate acid pair, which will shape the early titration curve [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the pre-equivalence behavior. As strong acid is added, it protonates the weak base, forming its conjugate acid and resisting large pH drops, so the pH decreases slowly at first. This is the buffering region characteristic of weak base–strong acid titrations, and it mirrors the analogous buffering region in weak acid–strong base titrations, just in the opposite pH direction [^notfound].

> I will now examine the equivalence point. At equivalence, the weak base has been fully converted to its conjugate acid, so the solution contains a weak acid and no remaining weak base. The pH at equivalence is therefore acidic, i.e., below 7, not neutral, because the conjugate acid donates protons to water. This is a key distinction from strong acid–strong base titrations, which are neutral at equivalence [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the slope near equivalence. I initially thought the drop might be gradual, but wait, I should double-check the derivative of the titration curve. Near the equivalence point, the buffer is exhausted and the pH falls rapidly, producing a steep inflection. This sharp descent is a hallmark of equivalence in weak base–strong acid titrations, even though the absolute pH is acidic rather than neutral [^notfound].

> Next, I should review post-equivalence behavior. After the equivalence point, excess strong acid dominates the proton balance, so the pH continues to decrease, but the slope becomes less steep again as the strong acid contribution overwhelms any residual weak acid effects, yielding a curve that is concave up in the final segment [^notfound].

> Let me consider the answer choices systematically. Option A matches the expected profile: an initial slow pH decrease in the buffering region, a rapid drop through equivalence, and a final pH below 7 at equivalence. Option B is too vague and misses the sharp inflection. Option C incorrectly claims pH 7 at equivalence, which would only occur in a strong acid–strong base titration. Option D misstates both the early slope and the equivalence condition, since pOH equals pKb at the half-equivalence point, not at equivalence, and the early decrease is slow, not quick [^notfound].

> I should confirm the half-equivalence nuance to avoid confusion. At half-equivalence, pOH equals pKb for a weak base, which is a different landmark than the equivalence point; this is why Option D's equivalence criterion is wrong even though it references a correct relationship at a different point on the curve, reinforcing that D is incorrect for the question asked [^notfound].

> Final answer: The correct observation is that the pH decreases slowly at first, then drops rapidly near the equivalence point, and the equivalence point pH is below 7, which corresponds to Option A [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **A**. Initially, the pH decreases slowly as the weak base buffers the added strong acid. Near the equivalence point, the buffer is exhausted and the pH drops rapidly, ending below 7 because the solution contains the conjugate acid of the weak base. Options B and C are incorrect because they do not capture the sharp inflection at equivalence, and option D is wrong because it misstates the early pH change and the equivalence condition (pOH ≠ pKb at equivalence).

## pH behavior during titration

### Initial phase: slow pH decrease

In the initial phase, the weak base **buffers the added acid**, so the pH decreases slowly. This buffering arises because the weak base and its conjugate acid form a buffer system that resists pH change until the base is significantly protonated.

---

### Equivalence point: rapid pH decrease and acidic pH

Near the equivalence point, the weak base is nearly exhausted, so the **buffering capacity collapses** and the pH drops rapidly. At equivalence, the solution contains the conjugate acid of the weak base, making the pH acidic (pH < 7).

---

### Post-equivalence phase: continued pH decrease

After the equivalence point, excess strong acid drives the pH **further downward**, though the rate of change slows as the strong acid dominates the proton balance.

---

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Option** | **Description** | **Correctness** |
|-|-|-|
| A | Initially, the pH slowly decreases, then there is a rapid decrease to give a pH below 7 at the equivalence point. | Correct |
| B | The pH of the solution gradually decreases throughout the experiment and the pH at the equivalence point is below 7. | Incorrect (misses the rapid drop) |
| C | Initially, the pH slowly decreases, then there is a rapid decrease to give a pH equal to 7 at the equivalence point. | Incorrect (pH is not 7) |
| D | Initially, the pH quickly decreases, then there is a gradual decrease to the equivalence point where the pOH equals the pKb of the base. | Incorrect (early pH change and equivalence condition are wrong) |

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **A**. The titration of a weak base with a strong acid shows a slow initial pH decrease followed by a rapid drop to pH < 7 at the equivalence point, reflecting the loss of buffering and the presence of the conjugate acid.

### Regulation of species metabolism in synthetic community systems by environmental pH oscillations [^f783df6b]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

For the typical oscillation period T 1 (Fig. 2b), CO 2 production dominated in the system and decreased the solution pH during the first half period (from point 1 of pH 6.63 to point 2 of pH 6.42). The dissipation of CO 2 to the air dominated in the system and increased the solution pH due to the inhibition of sucrose release from species A during the second half period (from point 2 of pH 6.42 to point 3 of pH 6.62). Multiple cycles of solution pH oscillations were observed. The solution pH did not oscillate in the absence of species B (Fig. 2b, black curve) or pH-responsive molecules in species A (Fig. 2b, blue curve), which confirmed that the feedback between these two species in the community caused environmental pH oscillations. Notably, the period gradually increased as the oscillation continued (Fig. 2b, red curve). The periods of T 1 and T 5 were 68 min and 109 min, respectively. This can be explained by the consumption of sucrose inside species A, which caused the concentration of solution components to differ at each equilibrium point in subsequent cycles. The decrease in the sucrose concentration difference between the inner and outer membranes slowed the production of H + and the release of CO 2, thereby generating a longer oscillation period in the subsequent cycles. The longest oscillation occurred for 960 min because sucrose in species A was completely consumed (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 7). The S. cerevisiae was confirmed to be alive during oscillations (Fig. 2e, Supplementary Figs. 8, 9).

### Feedback driven autonomous cycles of assembly and disassembly from minimal building blocks [^2980684c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Feedback from pH variation allows regelation (two cycles)

It was noted that the pH of the system had a remarkable impact on the lifetimes of gels, the extent of self-assembly, and the subsequent negative feedback from hydrolysis (Fig. 2e–g). We envisaged that if the system can itself register an autonomous gradual pH drop that is synchronized with the time delay in catalysis, it might be possible to realize additional cycles of (dis)assembly; an important observation in the literature thus far (Figs. 1 c and 3a). The slowly forming waste (B) generated via hydrolytic cleavage of BC can be the proton source to independently decrease the environmental pH that can consequently facilitate the regeneration of A'BC utilizing the remaining ester in the medium to restart the cycle (Fig. 3a). Hence, unbuffered medium (Milli Q water) was used to generate the pH gradient within the medium. The mixture of A' and BC (50: 50 mM, Sol1) in 60% v/v DMSO/water showed an initial pH of 7.35 due to the presence of A'. To monitor whether the in-situ generation of B was able to increase the acidity of the system, the pH was measured with time. Indeed, the pH of the system gradually declined from 7.35 to 6.1 in a span of ca. 48 h (Fig. 3d). The visible light scattering measurement of the unbuffered system showed an increase in turbidity till 2 h that was followed by an expected decline. Remarkably, a distinct increase of turbidity was observed after 15 h, which again peaked at 24 h followed by a substantial decline in intensity (Fig. 3e). This observation suggested that the phenomenon of the creation of catalytic microenvironment was registered twice as a function of time with a single batch of reactant addition (closed system). Further, visual observation reinforced the periodic change of (dis)assembly in unbuffered condition (Fig. 3b). Starting from the initial sol state (Sol1), a self-supporting gel (Gel1) was accessed at ~1.5–2 h which converted into sol (Sol2) approximately within 5 h (Fig. 3b). The regelation was observed at ca. 23–24 h (Gel2, Fig. 3b). This was followed by the formation of viscous solution (Sol3) in 60% of the samples while the rest 40% remained as weak gel after ca. 48 h (done in 10 different sets of vials under identical experimental conditions, Fig. 3b).

Despite significant decreases in bicarbonate and SID with chloride (Fig 3 d and e), pH remained constant because of compensatory hyperventilation and hypocapnia (Fig 4 a). Sodium and potassium concentrations stayed normal throughout (Fig 4 b and c). The arterial pH, however, rose markedly with acetate, despite a decrease in SID and no change in anion gap (Fig 3 f), but remained unchanged with lactate despite a decrease in SID. Of note, PaCO 2 remained similar between groups while the calculated anion gap only showed a late increase with lactate that was significantly different with respect to acetate but not bicarbonate.

With increasing haemodilution, there was a stepwise decrease in systemic blood pressure (Fig 5 c), however, stroke volume and heart rate remained constant because of the fluid replacement (Fig 5 a and b).

In terms of haemodynamics, there was no between-group difference in any variable measured.

### Regulation of species metabolism in synthetic community systems by environmental pH oscillations [^7e4de283]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Adjusting the oscillation parameters in the two-species community by changing the initial conditions

Four oscillation parameters were defined (Supplementary Fig. 10a), including the initial pH drop time (t 0), which was defined as the time from the beginning to the first lowest pH point, the steady median pH value, which was defined as the median of the highest and lowest pH value during the oscillation, amplitude (A) of the oscillation and period (T) of oscillation.

The solution pH oscillation behaviour was influenced by the concentration of sucrose in species A and the ratio between species A and B. Both of these factors affect the production speed of CO 2 by S. cerevisiae. When the population ratio of species A (2.76 × 10 6 /mL) to B (4.36 × 10 6 /mL) was maintained at 0.63:1, the initial concentration of sucrose in species A had a dramatic impact on the oscillation behaviours (Supplementary Fig. 10b and 10c). With the increase in the initial concentration of sucrose, the t 0 values almost linearly decreased from 206 min at 50 mM sucrose to 107 min at 250 mM sucrose (Supplementary Fig. 10d, blue plot), while the steady median pH values shifted from 6.96 at 50 mM sucrose to 6.62 at 250 mM sucrose with a linear decline (Supplementary Fig. 10d, pink plot). In addition, the amplitude of oscillation increased (Supplementary Fig. 10e, green plot), but the period of oscillation decreased (Supplementary Fig. 10e, purple plot). The higher sucrose in species A enabled a faster release rate to the solution, consequently resulting in a faster CO 2 production rate, which explained the shorter t 0 and the first lowest pH point. The balance between the CO 2 dissipation rate and CO 2 production rate caused a lower steady median pH value, larger amplitude and shorter period of oscillation at higher sucrose concentrations in species A. The CO 2 dissipation rate was faster at lower pH, since the slopes from the first lowest point to the first highest point were larger at higher sucrose concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 10b, purple dashed boxes) and the tangents of the points in the red curve ranging from 6.5 to 7.2 at low pH values (Fig. 2c, phase I) were larger. This results from the larger bias from the steady pH of the system (7.25). The faster CO 2 dissipation rate balanced the CO 2 production rate, which explained the lower steady median pH value, the larger amplitude and shorter average period at higher sucrose concentrations in species A. The gradual consumption of sucrose from species A caused pH oscillation to disappear since the CO 2 production rate was not enough to overcome the CO 2 dissipation rate. To confirm the necessity of pH-responsive release of sucrose from species A to the oscillation phenomenon, the solution pH variation of direct mixing sucrose with S. cerevisiae was measured (Supplementary Fig. 11). The sucrose concentrations leaking out from species A (containing 50 mM, 100 mM, 150 mM, 200 mM, 250 mM, 300 mM sucrose) for 30 min (Supplementary Fig. 11a) were chosen to mix with S. cerevisiae. No solution pH oscillations were observed (Supplementary Fig. 11b). The solution pH dropped in the first phase and gradually increased in the second phase.

We proposed that the formation of helical fibers or nanosheets at different pH values is influenced by the net charge present on the surface of the NGQDs. At pH values where a high net charge is expected on the assembly, the formation of helical fibers was observed in solution. Conversely, at pH values that partially neutralized the excess surface charge, nanosheets were obtained. Zeta potential (ζ) of the assemblies grown under the test pH conditions has been measured. The ζ value of the assemblies decreases for lower pH of the solution (Fig. 2c). To further trace the transition process, we prepared a series of aqueous solutions with pH gradient from 3.5 to 9.5 to treat the sheet or helical-fiber suspension (Supplementary Fig. 15). As the pH increased, the morphology of the assemblies gradually changed from 2D sheets into helical fibers. However, the transformation from fibers to sheets could not be achieved by adjusting the pH in the reverse direction.

### Regulating ion affinity and dehydration of metal-organic framework sub-nanochannels for high-precision ion separation [^6360d921]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Solution pH is an additional factor tuning the ion selectivity of UiO-66-(OH) 2 membrane via protonation and deprotonation. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 11, UiO-66-(OH) 2 exhibits an isoelectric point of approximately 3.8. With increasing the solution pH above the isoelectric point, -OH groups in MOF structure will become deprotonated, generating a strong binding affinity of cations to the channel. When the pH increases from 3 to 9, the conductance of K + and Mg 2+ ions shows a completely opposite trend: the conductance for K + ion increases from 0.11 mS to 0.25 mS, while the one for Mg 2+ ion shows a decrease from 2.4 μS to 0.59 μS (Supplementary Fig. 17). The K + /Mg 2+ selectivity is thus increased from 86.9 to 857.9. This result further confirms that a stronger binding energy can facilitate the transport of monovalent cations but hinder the transport of divalent cations through the MOF sub-nanochannels.

The electrolyte concentration exhibits a great influence on ion separation performance. For K + ion, as the concentration decreases, the conductance first linearly decreases, and then deviates from the bulk value when the concentration is lower than 10–4 M (Supplementary Fig. 18a, b). While for Mg 2+ ion, the conductance keeps almost constant when the concentration is lower than 1 M, and gradually increases when the concentration is larger than 1 M (Supplementary Fig. 18c, d). These results indicate that, in the concentration range of 10–4 to 1 M, the transport of monovalent cations is controlled by the bulk solution, while the transport of divalent cations is determined by the surface property of the MOF sub-nanochannel –. Therefore, the monovalent/divalent cation selectivity of UiO-66-(OH) 2 membrane increases with increasing the electrolyte concentration (Supplementary Fig. 18e), reaching a K + /Mg 2+ selectivity as high as 1051.3 at the concentration of 1 M. With the electrolyte concentration exceeding 1 M, the K + /Mg 2+ selectivity reaches a plateau because the transport of Mg 2+ ions in the high-concentration region gradually deviates from surface control (Supplementary Fig. 18e).

### Membraneless water filtration using CO [^625c26e2]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The presence of ion concentration gradients, responsible for driving the motion of particles, was confirmed by observing the response of liquid columns filled with pH indicator solution to gas exposure. We used Oregon Green fluorescent dye (0.1 mM) as the pH indicator due to its linear dependence of fluorescence intensity on pH over a broad pH range. As the water is exposed to CO 2 at = 136 kPa, the fluorescence intensity immediately decreases near the gas–liquid interfaces, and then the decreasing intensity propagates toward the middle of the column, indicating that pH decreases from the interfaces inward (Fig. 2a). The high intensity evident near the gas–liquid interface is due to the curvature of the meniscus. In contrast to CO 2, exposure to N 2 at the same pressure does not produce spatial variations in fluorescence intensity, but only a gradual decrease of fluorescence intensity due to photobleaching (Fig. 2b).

Solving coupled diffusion-reaction equations predicts the transient pH distribution under exposure to CO 2. The dissolved CO 2 and ion concentrations are coupled through the net forward rate of reaction (1) r = k f c c − k b, where c c (x, t) is the concentration of dissolved CO 2, and c i (x, t) gives the concentrations of both generated ions, H + and, which are effectively equal due to local charge neutrality. Then, solving the diffusion-reaction equations ∂c c / ∂t = D c ∇ 2 c c − r and ∂c i / ∂t = D i ∇ 2 c i + r yields the transient ion concentration distribution, where D c is the diffusivity of CO 2 and D i is the ambipolar diffusivity of the ions. The calculated pH distribution (Fig. 2d) shows reasonable agreement with the observed fluorescence intensity profile (Fig. 2c). As the pH decreases from 5.6 (the pH of water in equilibrium with the atmospheric CO 2 concentration, = 40 kPa) down to 3.8 for = 136 kPa, a nearly 100-fold difference in ion concentrations occurs within the column.

### Probing catalyst-free hydroxyl radical generation at microbubble interfaces [^b232d03f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

To further confirm that the generation of
- OH at the gas‒liquid interface is driven by a high concentration of hydroxide ions in strong electric fields, we examined the chemiluminescence intensity of N 2 bubbles across different pH values. Given that luminol molecules dissolve only in strongly alkaline solutions, we employed L-012, an alternative chemiluminescence probe, which operates effectively over a broader pH range. Notably, the chemiluminescence intensity significantly increased at pH 12.5 compared with that at pH 8.9 (Fig. 2d, e). Moreover, when microbubbles with high interfacial areas were injected into the solution, the overall pH of the solution decreased (Fig. S14). Additionally, to further validate the observed phenomenon and rule out potential experimental artifacts, we conducted a control experiment in which the solution pH was continuously monitored following the introduction of micro- and nanobubbles. This experiment consistently showed a gradual decrease in pH over time, supporting our conclusion that OH − are being adsorbed onto the microbubble interfaces. This pH dependency further highlights the role of the OH − concentration in ROS generation. When the bubbles were obstructed by particles, preventing OH − from accumulating on the bubble surface, a significant reduction in chemiluminescence was observed, further supporting the aforementioned mechanism (Fig. S15). To further explore the wavelength-dependent properties of this phenomenon, we shifted the light source to green light (545 nm) and other wavelengths, which yielded no chemiluminescence (Fig. 2f, g and Fig. S16).

### Cascade reaction networks within audible sound induced transient domains in a solution [^130ae259]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Following the previous ABTS pattern experiment, here we used the glucose/GOx reaction again because the reaction produces gluconic acid that lowers the pH of the solution. Firstly, TA-AuNP was mixed with glucose/GOx and the solution was exposed to air without applying sound. As the enzymatic reaction proceeds, the pH of the solution decreases and thus TA-AuNP aggregation occurs, resulting in randomly positioned blue regions in the red-colored solution as shown in Fig. 4b. The time-dependent UV–Vis spectra of this solution are given in Supplementary Fig. 14, which establishes the gradual self-assembly of the AuNPs. In contrast, the application of audible sound to the above solution produced a concentric ring pattern with blue and red concentric rings as shown in Fig. 4c. Such a ring pattern was evolved because of the enzymatic reaction, which proceeded preferentially at the antinodal regions transiently generated in the solution. In this pattern, small portions of the red and blue regions were extracted and analyzed by time-dependent TEM analysis. As shown in Fig. 4d, the TA-AuNPs in the red-colored nodal positions of the standing wave, mostly existed as individual particles, while the nanoparticles in the blue-colored concentric regions located at the antinodal positions exhibited the formation of larger nanoparticle aggregates and clusters with time as we expected. Since the color of the dispersed and aggregated nanoparticles was distinctly different, we could track the relative rates of TA-AuNP aggregation at the various antinodal regions through analysis of pattern images exhibited in Fig. 4c. The obtained results clearly corroborated that the TA-AuNP aggregation follows a much faster kinetics at the center and the rate of aggregation gradually decreases as one shifts to the antinodal regions (ring 1 to ring 3) towards the periphery (Supplementary Fig. 15) as observed in the case of the ABTS +• pattern (Fig. 1e). These results confirm that our audible sound method provides an innovative strategy to program the self-assembly of gold nanoparticles within transient domains generated in a solution.

### Electrochemical polymerization of pyrene derivatives on functionalized carbon nanotubes for pseudocapacitive electrodes [^5925998b]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

On subsequent potential cycling within the pyrene solution from 1.5 to 4.5 V versus Li/Li +, the oxidation current gradually increased and the onset potential of the oxidation feature gradually shifted to lower potentials, which is accompanied by the growth of reduction peaks (Fig. 2c). The oxidation currents can be ascribed to the oxidation of pyrene with simultaneous polymerization of the generated pyrene radical-cation intermediates on the GCE. The electropolymerization of pyrene is believed to proceed through the deprotonation of ipso carbon atoms, as shown in Fig. 3a, which is supported by the decrease in pH of the solution after the polymerization. The gradual decrease in the oxidation onset potential during the polymerization process can be related to the facilitated electrooxidation process due to the increased delocalization of π electrons in the longer π-motif, which is consistent with the trend in the electrooxidation of PAHs with increasing sizes, as shown in Fig. 1a. This hypothesis is further supported by the trend in calculated HOMO values of the pyrene dimer (0.15 eV versus HOMO of pyrene) and trimer (0.20 eV versus HOMO of pyrene) as the increase in the number of monomers correlates in an increase in the HOMO energy, resulting in a decrease in oxidation onset potential. On the other hand, the gradual appearance of peaks in the CV at 3.75 V versus Li/Li + can be attributed to progressive anion (PF 6 −) doping process into the polymerized pyrene (Fig. 3b). The reversible redox wave of the polymerized pyrene film formed during 10 CV cycles was steady during subsequent CVs when the film was transferred to fresh electrolyte without the pyrene monomer (green line in the inset of Fig. 2c, d, Supplementary Fig. 7). The steady-state redox wave of the polymerized pyrenecarboxylic acid was similar to that of the polymerized pyrene, whereas the polymerized aminopyrene exhibited a much smaller current feature owing to minimal film formation (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 8).

### Anomalous hydrogen evolution behavior in high-pH environment induced by locally generated hydronium ions [^d343b31b]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Heterogeneous electrocatalytic reduction reactions, e.g. water, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide reduction, are attracting more attention due to their importance for production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide/methane, and ammonia through simple electrochemical hydrogenation processes –. To carry out these reactions under mild and cost-effective conditions, water-based alkaline solutions are usually used as the hydrogen source. During these reactions, water is not only a solvent but is also usually dissociated into H* and OH* species (asterisk (*) represents an active site on the catalyst), which further interact with other reactive intermediates through proton-coupled electron transfer to generate the final products. As a result, it is important to reveal the local environments about the reactant, reaction intermediates, and catalyst surfaces. So far, the understanding of this complicated issue in electrocatalysis is mostly achieved based on the experimental and simulation studies for uniform single-/poly-crystal models –. These fundamental studies were always carried out for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as a simple model that involves both water dissociation and proton reduction processes. Most results showed that alkaline HER activity of a single-/poly-crystal material is dependent on the pH value of the electrolyte, i.e. the HER kinetics gradually decreases with increasing pH. This may be due to pH-dependent H adsorption energy and/or water dissociation energy barrier. More importantly, such mechanism suggests a sluggish HER kinetics on bulk materials in high-pH environments (e.g. 1 M KOH), largely limiting their practical applications in the aforementioned reduction reactions.

### Mapping in situ the assembly and dynamics in aqueous supramolecular polymers [^4404bc13]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Next, we monitored in situ the pH evolution during titration. The pH titration curves of the three PA polymerization systems reveal clear differences in their respective [NaOH]/[PA] ranges where the transformation of micelles into polymers occurs (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Figs. 26 and 27). An abrupt decrease in the slope of [OH −] curves accompanies the onset of polymerization, whereas [OH -] increases with a nearly constant rate after the completion of polymerization, as exemplified in PA-3 assemblies (Fig. 3e, f). These results suggest that a substantial fraction of titrated hydroxide ions is consumed by the deprotonation of monomers in micelles in the transformation into supramolecular polymers. Interestingly, as we switched from PA-1 to PA-2 and then PA-3, the "buffering" effect in the pH titration curves and therefore the consumption of titrated hydroxide ions becomes less pronounced even with the same amount of titrated NaOH. The complexity of these pH titration curves (Fig. 3e) prevents us from directly extracting pKa values from the plateau regions, as done in previous studies on supramolecular gel systems –. Instead, we define the apparent p K a for each polymerization as the pH value measured at = 0.5, corresponding to an equal fraction of protonated micelles and polymers consisting of deprotonated monomers. The pKa values at [PA] = 40 µM increase from 7.85 to 8.76 and 9.60 for PA-1, PA-2, and PA-3, respectively. All these values are substantially lower than that corresponding to free lysine (p K a = 10.5), implying that stronger cohesive hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic collapse of aliphatic segments can lead to more effective deprotonation of monomers. To model the deprotonation process of micelles during transformation, we introduced an allosteric binding model to fit the normalized CD titration curves (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Text 2), by analogy to the cooperative ligand-receptor binding in biological signaling processes. In this model, the micelles containing j monomers are considered as multivalent receptors with 3 j binding sites and the NaOH is regarded as a monovalent ligand. The sequential deprotonation process is assumed to undergo via the ligand-receptor binding governed by the apparent binding constant (K'). Interestingly, the resulting Hill plots, representingas a function of, display similar Hill coefficients (n H) of around 10, corresponding to the slope at the origin of axes for all the three PA systems (Fig. 3g and Supplementary Figs. 28 and 29). A Hill coefficient significantly greater than 1 indicates a cooperative deprotonation process of micelles. Such cooperativity is expected to result in extensive deprotonation of a subset of micelles to form polymers with a negligible amount of intermediate charged states, while the remaining micelles stay fully charged. This mechanism is expected to facilitate a binary assembly model rather than a multistep assembly process, consistent with our experimental observations described above. Additionally, depending on the assumed extent of final deprotonation of micelles, the Hill coefficient of 10 suggests an estimated micelle size ranging from approximately 3 to 10 monomers. Based on this model, the tendency for deprotonation decreases as the apparent binding constant (K') decreases from 5.510 −3 µM −1 in PA-1 to 4.910 −3 µM −1 in PA-2 and 4.110 −3 µM −1 in PA-3 at [PA] = 40 μM (Fig. 3h). These results suggest that despite the identical peptide sequence in the terminal charged domain of all three monomers, their differences in ability to form strongly bonded β-sheets directly affects deprotonation and polymerization propensity.

### Redefined ion association constants have consequences for calcium phosphate nucleation and biomineralization [^0ca72573]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Fig. 1
Two titrations of Ca 2+ ions into phosphate solution at pH 9.8 with strikingly different profiles.

The black curve uses the same experimental conditions as the dark grey curve, except that the calcium solution contains 0.05 M HCl (full data Supplementary Fig. 1). The dashed line represents the concentration of calcium expected if no binding occurs; both titration curves lie below this due to the ion association between Ca 2+ and phosphate ions. The acidified titration (black) shows a higher amount of free calcium ions in the solution and remains linear for a greater amount of added calcium ions (grey and light grey shading highlight the relevant areas under the curves). Additionally, the acidified experiment shows the expected nucleation profile, increasing up to a peak before dropping to a plateau determined by the solubility of the precipitated phase, i.e. with supersaturation. The non-acidified experiment (dark grey) bends early in the titration, and takes a non-linear path directly to the plateau, i.e. without apparent supersaturation. This is caused by a premature phase separation at the dosing tip due to a local overconcentration of calcium (Supplementary Section 1, Supplementary Fig. 2). Sequestration of calcium ions in a separated phase leads to perceived higher ion association.

### Antagonistic chemical coupling in self-reconfigurable host-guest protocells [^5cb8d85c]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

As the fatty acid vesicles remained encapsulated within the proteinosomes, the results suggested that the protein–polymer membrane was permeable to solubilized myristic acid molecules released from the disassembling micelle coacervate droplet at intermediate pH values. Control experiments performed by rapidly decreasing the pH to a value of 8.5 by addition of aqueous HCl (Supplementary Fig. 11) revealed an absence of vesicles inside the proteinosomes (Fig. 3t, u), while a stepwise decrease of the pH to 8.5 by gradual addition of HCl (Supplementary Fig. 11) resulted in the formation and accumulation of trapped vesicles. In all experiments, vesicles were observed only if the pH was decreased below a value of 8.9.

Taken together, the experiments indicated that accumulation of vesicles inside the proteinosomes was facilitated by the slow and sustained pH decrease associated with GOx activity, as well as the high local concentration of free fatty acid molecules generated during disassembly and transformation of the nested protocells. These criteria enabled the progressive diffusion of fatty acid monomers across the semipermeable proteinosome membrane, followed by in situ supramolecular assembly as the surfactant concentration increased to produce an ensemble of entrapped vesicles. As a consequence, antagonistic interactions in the parent host–guest protocells provided an internally driven pathway for self-reconfiguration into a nested protocell micro-architecture based on the spontaneous integration of fatty acid vesicles into single proteinosome microcapsules.

### The rule regulating pH changes during crystalloid infusion [^edaa77b0]. Intensive Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To define the rule according to which crystalloid solutions characterized by different strong ion difference (SID) modify the acid-base variables of human plasma.

Methods

With a previously validated software, we computed the effects of diluting human plasma with crystalloid solutions ([SID] 0–60, 10 mEq/l stepwise). An equation was derived to compute the diluent [SID] required to maintain the baseline pH unchanged, at constant PCO₂ and at every dilution fraction. The results were experimentally tested using fresh frozen plasma, re-warmed at 37°C, equilibrated at PCO₂ 35 and 78 mmHg, at baseline and after the infusion of crystalloid solutions with 0, 12, 24, 36, 48 mEq/l [SID].

Results

The mathematical analysis showed that the diluent [SID] required to maintain unmodified the baseline pH equals the baseline bicarbonate concentration, [HCO₃⁻], assuming constant PCO₂ throughout the process. The experimental data confirmed the theoretical analysis. In fact, at the baseline [HCO₃⁻] of 18.3 ± 0.3 mmol/l (PCO₂ 35 mmHg) the pH was 7.332 ± 0.004 and remained 7.333 ± 0.003 when the diluting [SID] was 18.5 ± 0.0 mEq/l. At baseline [HCO₃⁻] of 19.5 ± 0.3 mmol/l (PCO₂ 78 mmHg) the pH was 7.010 ± 0.003 and remained 7.004 ± 0.003 when the diluting [SID] was 19.1 ± 0.1 mEq/l. At both PCO₂ values infusion with [SID] lower or greater than baseline [HCO₃⁻] led pH to decrease or increase, respectively.

Conclusions

The baseline [HCO₃⁻] dictates the pH response to crystalloid infusion. If a crystalloid [SID] equals baseline [HCO₃⁻], pH remains unchanged at constant PCO₂, whereas it increases or decreases if the [SID] is greater or lower, respectively.

### 7.5% sodium bicarbonate [^1c9e434a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In general, it is unwise to attempt full correction of a low total CO2 content during the first 24 hours of therapy, since this may be accompanied by an unrecognized alkalosis because of a delay in the readjustment of ventilation to normal. Owing to this lag, the achievement of total CO2 content of about 20 mEq/liter at the end of the first day of therapy will usually be associated with a normal blood pH. Further modification of the acidosis to completely normal values usually occurs in the presence of normal kidney function when and if the cause of the acidosis can be controlled. Values for total CO2 which are brought to normal or above normal within the first day of therapy are very likely to be associated with grossly alkaline values for blood pH, with ensuing undesired side effects.

### Dynamic and programmable morphology and size evolution via a living hierarchical self-assembly strategy [^99b5eb68]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

pH-Switched morphology evolution with an on/off function

Once the thiol–disulfide exchange was interrupted at any moment by neutralizing the system pH, the thiolates of assemblies were deactivated to thiols, thus no further exchange reaction was conducted any more as well as the termination of hierarchical self-assembly behaviors. However, these stable inert thiols and trapped morphology evolution could be reactivated whenever needed. For instance, when the polymer solution was basified at pH 12 (Fig. 10), the short cylinders were formed around 30 min later and further transferred into vesicles after 2 h. By neutralizing solutions at pH 7, this transition could be interrupted and the cylindrical micelles were kept stable for a long time. However, after rebasification of system pH to 12, the morphology transition was restarted to evolve into the vesicles. Similarly, the stable worm-like micelles could also be yielded by interruption of morphology evolution in aqueous solutions. These neutralized self-assemblies had a good long-term stability and basically maintained their shapes and sizes at least 7 days in mild aqueous environments. These results indicated a simple method to differentiate and gain the complex and intermediate morphologies. Therefore, the conceivable self-assemblies with customized structures and properties can be easily tailored only by the control of system pH within a predetermined time.

Fig. 10
pH-Switched morphology evolution. TEM images showing in situ morphology evolution with termination and reactivation function under the control of system pH. Scale bars: 0.5 μm. During the whole morphology transition process, once the thiol–disulfide exchange reaction is interrupted by neutralization at any time, the self-assemblies, including cylinders, vesicles, worm-like micelles, hollow spheres, etc. at that moment are fixed and kept stable for more than 7 days, but this morphology and size evolution is easily restarted and returned back on its right track by reactivation of the exchange reaction at pH 12 solutions. This whole self-assembled evolution process can be easily activated, controllably terminated and interrupted, and reinitiated by the external pH stimuli whenever needed. The inset shows that the assembled solution in the quartz plate is changed from transparency to turbidity

### Hydrogen bond based smart polymer for highly selective and tunable capture of multiply phosphorylated peptides [^9226ac13]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

pH modulated MPP adsorption

Solution pH was also found to influence MPP adsorption process. Isoelectric focusing electrophoresis indicated that the isoelectric point of the copolymer was ∼5.8; thus, the ionization states of the ATBA units changed considerably at pH values below and above 5.8. Accordingly, alkaline solutions (pH 7.4–11) reduced the binding affinity of the copolymer towards MPPs because of electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged carboxyl groups of ATBA and the phosphates of MPPs. By contrast, weakly acidic solutions (pH 4–7) promoted the complexation due to the enhanced H-bonding interaction between the positively charged thiourea groups of ATBA and MPPs. When a strongly acidic solution (pH 2–3) was applied, the delicate copolymer H-bonding network would collapse, resulting in a sharp decrease in binding affinity with MPPs. Importantly, solution pH also affected the coil-to-globule transition of the copolymer chains. Under weakly acidic conditions (pH 4–7), the copolymer chains maintained a relaxed and extended conformation, providing abundant binding sites for MPPs. Under basic conditions (pH 7.5–10), the contracted conformation of the copolymer chains prevented the sufficient contact and efficient binding between ATBA units and MPPs. This presumption was consistent with the QCM experiments carried out under different pH conditions, as shown in Fig. 2d, e. Scanning the adsorption behaviours of 4pS over a broad pH range revealed two distinct adsorption conversion windows for different adsorption modes (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 26). The first window (pH 2.0–3.0) corresponded to the decomposition of copolymer H-bonding network under strongly acidic conditions, whereas the second window (pH 7.5–8.8) was attributed to the dramatic conformational transition of copolymer chains induced by altering solution pH. These data indicated that the tightly bound MPPs could be dissociated from the copolymer surfaces easily by increasing or decreasing the solution pH value.

### Sodium chloride, sodium citrate (Regiocit) [^be5791f8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.3 Laboratory Monitoring

Monitoring of the post-filter blood ionized calcium (iCa), systemic blood iCa, and total blood calcium levels in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical parameters such as acid-base balance and serum electrolytes are essential to guide appropriate REGIOCIT solution dosage based on the desired level of anticoagulation. Levels should be taken at baseline, 1 hour after initiation (or adjustment), and every 6 hours (See Table 2). Rapidly decreasing systemic ionized calcium levels are an early indicator of citrate accumulation.

Measurement of total calcium and assessment of total-to-ionized calcium ratio is necessary. Citrate accumulation causes systemic ionized calcium levels to drop and the ratio of total-to-ionized calcium increases (total-to-ionized calcium ratio > 2.5). In the presence of impaired citrate metabolism, a progressively higher calcium infusion rate is required to maintain the systemic ionized calcium concentration within the intended target. When a total-to-ionized-calcium ratio > 2.5 is recorded, any one of the following abnormalities reported concurrently increases the likelihood of citrate accumulation:

A rapid decline in systemic iCa concentration despite adequate calcium compensation
A rapid decrease in pH or a decrease in base excess
A rapid increase in anion gap

In order to avoid metabolic alkalosis, acid-base balance and systemic ionized calcium can be measured using blood gas analysis. If metabolic alkalosis or citrate accumulation is suspected, decrease the citrate dose while tolerating a post-filter ionized calcium of < 0.5 mmol/L. This can be achieved by either decreasing the blood flow rate to decrease the overall citrate load, increasing the dialysate/replacement flow rate (when applicable) to increase the citrate removal, or decreasing the citrate flow to decrease the citrate dose. Dialysate solutions contain bicarbonate below or above physiological range of 22 to 26 mmol/L, and increasing or decreasing the flow rates of the dialysate solutions can impact the acid-base status of the patient.

### Molecular basis of cooperativity in pH-triggered supramolecular self-assembly [^de3d9fb2]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

To verify the coexistence of protonated unimers and neutral micelles along the pH titration coordinate of PEO- b -PDPA block copolymers, we first applied a dialysis method to separate unimers (22 kD) from micelles (16,000 kD)at different protonation degrees (Fig. 3a). Two non-aggregating polybases with broad pH response (PEO- b -PDMA and PEI) were used for comparison. Neither PEO- b -PDMA nor PEI showed changes in size and scattering count rate along its entire titration course (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Fig. 9). Quantitative analysis showed that PEO- b -PDMA and PEI were distributed equally in the residual and filtrate layers (Fig. 3c, d). In contrast, higher amount of PEO- b -PDPA copolymers were retained in the residual layer (Fig. 3c; Supplementary Figs 10 and 11) due to the retention of micelles (16,000 kD, which is above the cutoff molecular weight (100 kD) of the dialysis membrane). pH titration of residual and filtrate samples showed that PEO- b -PDPA copolymers were highly charged with 90% of tertiary amines protonated in the filtrate sample whereas PEO- b -PDPA copolymers in the micelle state (after subtracting the protonated unimers) in the residual layer were almost neutral (Fig. 3e).

To further confirm the divergent charge state in unimers and micelles, we employed 1 H NMR to study the proton distribution of PEO- b -PDPA along the pH titration path. Data revealed a striking difference in the proton distribution of non-aggregating PEO- b -PDMA versus aggregating PEO- b -PDPA. The PEO- b -PDMA copolymer showed a continuous change of chemical shifts of methyl protons along the titration course (Fig. 4a, c; Supplementary Fig. 12). The peak area did not change at different protonation degree (Fig. 4c), suggesting a single phase solution deprotonation process (Fig. 4e). The water soluble small molecular base DPA showed similar results (Supplementary Fig. 13). In contrast, the PEO- b -PDPA copolymer displayed divergent proton distribution along the majority of the pH titration coordinate. The unimer peak did not change its chemical shift but only showed linear decrease in integration (Fig. 4b, d; Supplementary Fig. 14; proton peaks in micelle cores were not visible due to fast T 2 relaxation), in accordance with the linear increase in scattering count rate and decrease in fluorescence intensity shown previously.

### Porous organic polycarbene nanotrap for efficient and selective gold stripping from electronic waste [^b5f28707]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Given the initial promising results for the uptake of gold, Ptriaz-CN-A was investigated in detail for kinetic efficiency under various pH values. With 5 mg of the adsorbent in 10 mL of Au 3+ solution (100 ppm) under gradually increasing pH values from 2 to 9, the supernatant was collected at increasing time intervals. The filtrates were analysed by ICP‒OES to detect the remaining Au 3+ content in solution, and the concentration changes were measured over time. The adsorption behaviour of Ptriaz-CN-A exhibits a weak correlation with the pH value of treated solutions since Ptriaz-CN-A is a cationic adsorbent, and its properties (electrostatic interactions with AuCl 4 -) do not change in acidic or alkaline solutions. When the pH varied from acidic (pH = 2) to basic (pH = 9), the uptake activity of Ptriaz-CN-A declined, with a rapid adsorption rate at pH = 2, 4, and 7 (over 90% after 30 min) and a diminutive uptake (76.9%) at pH = 9 after 30 min (Fig. 2b). Nevertheless, the Au 3+ concentration decreased to low to none after 12 h under any arbitrary pH value.

### Rapid evaluation of bioactive Ti-based surfaces using an in vitro titration method [^2c2c7d88]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Results

Titration experiment without the presence of samples

The product from the titration experiment was first determined in the absence of a testing material. Figure 1 shows the profile of free calcium ion (Ca 2+), added calcium, complexed and precipitated calcium concentration (the difference between added Ca and measured free Ca 2+) and the evolution of pH. The initial phosphate concentration of 4 mM leads to a partial complexation of Ca 2+ ions mostly in the form of [CaHPO 4] 0 according to existing thermodynamic models. This can largely explain the gradual increase in the complexed and precipitated Ca before the onset point at ~180 min (reproducibly determined to be 185.6 ± 6.8 min from five independent experiments). From the curve, a clear two-step process can be observed, each corresponding to a sudden decrease of available free Ca 2+ and a distinct change of slope in the pH profile. The complexed and precipitated Ca continues to increase after these two events, indicating a continuous growth of the precipitated product. However, the consumption rate gradually slowed down probably due to a limited amount of phosphate counter ions. The evolution of the relative supersaturation during the titration experiment can be theoretically calculated (see below) and will be discussed in detail later.

### Control of intracellular pH and bicarbonate by COdiffusion into human sperm [^3781a45d]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Next, we examined the role of HCO 3 − in pH i regulation. Previous studies often used an open system in which the aqueous phase containing HCO 3 − and sperm is in contact with air (pCO 2 = 0.3 mmHg), whereas cells in the body reside in a quasi-closed system where pCO 2 is more than 100-fold higher (pCO 2 = 40 mmHg) (Fig. 4a). We emulated the transition from the epididymis to the oviduct by exposing sperm to low and high pH i /HCO 3 − solutions. Upon switching from ES/pH o 6.5/5% CO 2 /3 mM HCO 3 − to ES/pH o 7.5/5% CO 2 /30 mM HCO 3 − (quasi-closed system), the pH i increased slowly from 6.6 ± 0.1 to 7.0 ± 0.1 (Fig. 4b, c). In the absence of CO 2 /HCO 3 −, pH i was in general significantly higher than in the presence of CO 2 /HCO 3 −. However, the average magnitude and time course of ∆pH i and the final pH i in the presence or absence of CO 2 /HCO 3 − were largely similar (∆pH = 0.3 and 0.4; t ½ = 830 ± 510 and 680 ± 642 s, and final pH i = 7.1 and 7.0, respectively) (Fig. 4b–d). Thus, in the quasi-closed system, the presence of CO 2 /HCO 3 − does not significantly alter slow intracellular adjustment to alkaline pH o.

### Disorders of acid-base balance [^fc2f8510]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Intensivists spend much of their time managing problems related to fluids, electrolytes, and blood pH. Recent advances in the understanding of acid-base physiology have resulted from the application of basic physical-chemical principles of aqueous solutions to blood plasma. All changes in blood pH, in health and in disease, occur through changes in three variables: carbon dioxide, relative electrolyte concentrations, and total weak acid concentrations. However, while this quantitative approach has enjoyed widespread use among researchers, clinicians are reluctant to employ it. Recent advances have brought a measure of parity between the newer and the older, descriptive approach to acid-base physiology.

Data Synthesis

Case-based review of the literature.

Conclusion

Both quantitative and traditional approaches can be easily combined to result in a powerful tool for bedside acid-base analysis.

### Proton gradients and pH oscillations emerge from heat flow at the microscale [^a7414ed6]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our experimental and theoretical findings show that heat fluxes across confined solutions form and sustain stable pH gradients. The mechanism solely requires a dissolved acid–base reaction buffer that is given by prebiotically plausible biomolecules such as phosphate, amino acids, or RNA. Phosphate for example is assumed to play an important role in prebiotic chemistry because it functions as a nucleophilic catalyst, pH buffer, and chemical buffer. The formation of pH gradients is hereby achieved in a closed system that allows molecules to undergo repetitive pH oscillations without being washed away into an equilibrated reservoir.

The dissipation of free thermal energy, the sole form of energy necessary, is a geologically abundant scenario on early Earth. Although the formation of pH gradients depends on the thermal gradient that drives the accumulation mechanism, shallow thermal gradients can be compensated by longer flow chambers. The geometry of the flow chamber is realized to mimic the simplest geometrical setting with dimensions of 8.0 × 0.17 mm. However, the shape of the flow chamber is found to have a minor impact on the accumulation mechanism.

The thermally driven formation of pH gradients can be incorporated into a microfluidic device that forms tunable pH gradients and subjects molecules to pH oscillations defined in range and frequency. This device potentially allows for size selection and certain replication mechanisms to be functional.

Interestingly, the existing pH gradient can simultaneously be utilized by actively driven biomolecules, not only based on Brownian motion. The accumulation mechanism thereby subjects molecules to convectively driven pH cycles, resulting in permanent pH oscillation. Importantly, the oscillatory behavior applies for each individual species of the solution and strongly depends on its molecular properties. Hereby, specific molecular species harness the pH gradient by undergoing extensive pH oscillations, while others strongly accumulate by remaining in a limited pH region. This enables the formation of biomolecules that rely on fluctuations in pH during their assembly. The yield of pH-dependent multicomponent reaction systems, such as a three-component purine/pyrimidine reaction system, could be shifted along the height of the chamber. Here, purine ribonucleotides precursors would be synthesized at the top of the chamber at pH 5 while pyrimidine precursors would be synthesized at the bottom at pH 7.

### 7.5% sodium bicarbonate [^fc9d6703]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP is administered by the intravenous route.

In cardiac arrest, a rapid intravenous dose of one to two 50 mL vials (44.6 to 100 mEq) may be given initially and continued at a rate of 50 mL (44.6 to 50 mEq) every 5 to 10 minutes if necessary (as indicated by arterial pH and blood gas monitoring) to reverse the acidosis. Caution should be observed in emergencies where very rapid infusion of large quantities of bicarbonate is indicated. Bicarbonate solutions are hypertonic and may produce an undesirable rise in plasma sodium concentration in the process of correcting the metabolic acidosis. In cardiac arrest, however, the risks from acidosis exceed those of hypernatremia.

In infants (up to two years of age), the 4.2% solution is recommended for intravenous administration at a dose not to exceed 8 mEq/kg/day. Slow administration rates and the 4.2% solution are recommended in neonates, to guard against the possibility of producing hypernatremia, decreasing cerebrospinal fluid pressure and inducing intracranial hemorrhage.

In less urgent forms of metabolic acidosis, Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP may be added to other intravenous fluids. The amount of bicarbonate to be given to older children and adults over a four-to-eight-hour period is approximately 2 to 5 mEq/kg of body weight — depending upon the severity of the acidosis as judged by the lowering of total CO2 content, blood pH and clinical condition of the patient. In metabolic acidosis associated with shock, therapy should be monitored by measuring blood gases, plasma osmolarity, arterial blood lactate, hemodynamics and cardiac rhythm. Bicarbonate therapy should always be planned in a stepwise fashion since the degree of response from a given dose is not precisely predictable. Initially an infusion of 2 to 5 mEq/kg body weight over a period of 4 to 8 hours will produce a measurable improvement in the abnormal acid-base status of the blood. The next step of therapy is dependent upon the clinical response of the patient. If severe symptoms have abated, then the frequency of administration and the size of the dose may be reduced.

### Detection of electrostatic molecular binding using the water proton signal [^1cd5b524]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

where [HA] and [A −] are the molar concentrations of the weak acid and its conjugate base. The net charges of ACh and Cho (+1) are not significantly altered in the current pH range up to 8.5, due to a high(13.9). The observed lower rNOE signal from ACh and Cho below pH 6 (Figure 4G) may be due either to a gradual protonation of receptor groups (–COOH), and weaker binding (Figure S11) or the reduced exchange rates for exchangeable protons in the resin. Interestingly, at near physiological pH (pH 6 to 8, Figure 7), the rNOEs for ACh and Cho (as well as the molecular charges) are relatively constant, suggesting binding is not altered. In contrast, the rNOEs of Arg increases with pH (pH 6 to 8) and we therefore attribute the rNOE changes in Arg to be due to increased proton exchange rates for the guanidinium (position a, Figure 3A) and amide (position b) protons. The Arg rNOEs were found to decrease at strongly alkaline pH (above pH 8, Figure 3E), which may be caused by the Arg amino group becoming neutral and its binding becoming weaker (Figure S11). Therefore, the pH effects on rNOEs might be complicated: there are multiple possible saturation transfer pathways (both intermolecular rNOEs and intramolecular rNOEs, Figure 1). pH may affect binding initially and proton exchange in subsequent steps. It is clear from the equations that the pH effects on proton exchange will also affect overall rNOE efficiency, but this effect may not be the rate limiting over certain pH ranges, such as appears to be the case for Cho and ACh. Since the same resin is used for Arg, this means that the pH effect for the latter comes from the intra‐ligand exchangeable groups (guanidinium and amide protons), which also explains the pH sensitivity in the physiological range.

### Aggregation induced emission dynamic chiral europium (III) complexes with excellent circularly polarized luminescence and smart sensors [^58125a56]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

With rapid industrial development, the amount of acid/alkaline wastewater has increased swiftly. Such wastewater contains various harmful substances or heavy metal salts, which is highly corrosive, has seriously threatened human health, and caused irreversible damage to the ecology. Therefore, the development of sensors that accurately monitor pH is of great significance to various research fields ranging from the environment to chemical biology. In recent years, lanthanide complex emitters have been widely used in chemical sensing, such as the detection of explosives, heavy metal ions, and small organic molecules. However, the progress of lanthanide complex emitters for efficient light-responsive pH sensors still lags. Therefore, constructing optical sensors of lanthanide complexes with smart photo-responsiveness in a narrow pH range for precise measurement of acidic and basic pH values remains extremely challenging. Based on the aforementioned work and background, we explored the photoresponse behavior of chiral Eu III complexes R -Eu-Et-1 / 2 in a specific pH range. Specifically, 0–110 μL of the aqueous solution of C (H +) = 0.001 molL −1 (pH = 3) was accurately pipetted into the CH 3 CN solution containing R -Eu-Et-1 / 2 (2 mL), respectively, and the luminescence changes of the above mixed solutions were observed under the irradiation of a 365 nm UV-light. Solutions containing both R -Eu-Et-1 / 2 showed efficient and clear characteristic emission of Eu III ions (5 D 0 → 7 F 1, 592 nm, 5 D 0 → 7 F 2, 617 nm, 5 D 0 → 7 F 3, 650 nm, and 5 D 0 → 7 F 4, 685 nm). With the continuous addition of pH = 3 acidic aqueous solution, the characteristic emission peak intensity of the chiral lanthanide complexes gradually decreased (Fig. 6A, D). Similarly, accurately pipetted 0–55/65 μL of C (OH −) = 0.01 molL −1 (pH = 12) aqueous solution was introduced into the acetonitrile solution (2 mL) containing R -Eu-Et-1 / 2, and observed the luminescence change of the above mixed solution under the irradiation of 365 nm UV-light. Both solutions containing R -Eu-Et-1 / 2 showed the characteristic emission of Eu III ions, and the intensity of the above emission peaks gradually decreased with the continuous addition of pH = 12 aqueous solutions (Fig. 6B, E). The red characteristic emission of R -Eu-Et-1 / 2 solutions was completely quenched when the added acid or alkaline solution reached 110 and 55/65 μL, respectively. Note that both chiral Eu III complexes R -Eu-Et-1 / 2 achieved a linear decrease in emission in the ranges of pH = 4.28–6.3 and pH = 9.3–11.42. According to the Stern–Volmer equation, their detection limits for the C (H +) = 0.001 molL −1 and C (OH −) = 0.01 molL −1 aqueous solution were 1.91 and 2.84 μM (R -Eu-Et-1/2, for C (H +)); 4.44 and 12.58 μM (R -Eu-Et-1/2, for C (OH −)) (Fig. 6C, F). Compared with the reported fluorescent pH sensors (example: Zn-MOF, pH = 4–11, Zr-MOF, pH = 4.6–7.12, NGQDs, pH = 1.8–13.5, Tb-NCs, pH = 3–10, Tb-MOF, pH = 2–7, and Lum-MDI-CA/MTPP, pH = 1–2 and 12–14), R -Eu-Et-1 / 2 can intelligently photoresponse to acidic and alkaline solutions in a narrower pH range, and the response process shows a linear change, achieving excellent pH sensing behavior (Fig. 6G). As far as we know, this work is a rare example of the application of chiral lanthanide complex emitters to sensing of low-concentration acidic or alkaline solutions, which provides a strategy for the development of photoresponsive pH sensors with high sensitivity. In addition, the optical response sensitivities of R -Eu-Et-1 / 2 to Cu II ions under different pH conditions were explored, and their LODs were obtained. Specifically, Cu II ion aqueous solutions under acidic or alkaline conditions (pH = 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11) were gradually added to solution R -Eu-Et-1 or R -Eu-Et-2 respectively, and it was observed that the characteristic emission of Eu III ions of the above solutions gradually weakened and was eventually completely quenched. Through calculation, the LODs of R -Eu-Et-1 / 2 for Cu II ions under different pH conditions are 0.081 and 0.65 nM (pH = 4), 0.086 and 0.64 nM (pH = 5), 0.1 and 0.99 nM (pH = 6), 0.11 and 0.86 nM (pH = 9), 0.1 and 0.98 nM (pH = 10), 0.12 and 0.85 nM (pH = 11) (Supplementary Fig. 39, 40). The above experimental results prove that R -Eu-Et-1 / 2 can be used to sense trace amounts of heavy metal ions Cu II ions under different pH conditions, showing great potential for specific sensing of Cu II ions in complex environmental pollutants.

### 8.4% sodium bicarbonate [^8b1e5ff6]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Dosage and Administration

Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP is administered by the intravenous route.

In cardiac arrest, a rapid intravenous dose of one to two 50 mL vials (44.6 to 100 mEq) may be given initially and continued at a rate of 50 mL (44.6 to 50 mEq) every 5 to 10 minutes if necessary (as indicated by arterial pH and blood gas monitoring) to reverse the acidosis. Caution should be observed in emergencies where very rapid infusion of large quantities of bicarbonate is indicated. Bicarbonate solutions are hypertonic and may produce an undesirable rise in plasma sodium concentration in the process of correcting the metabolic acidosis. In cardiac arrest, however, the risks from acidosis exceed those of hypernatremia.

In infants (up to two years of age), the 4.2% solution is recommended for intravenous administration at a dose not to exceed 8 mEq/kg/day. Slow administration rates and the 4.2% solution are recommended in neonates, to guard against the possibility of producing hypernatremia, decreasing cerebrospinal fluid pressure and inducing intracranial hemorrhage.

In less urgent forms of metabolic acidosis, Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP may be added to other intravenous fluids. The amount of bicarbonate to be given to older children and adults over a four-to-eight-hour period is approximately 2 to 5 mEq/kg of body weight — depending upon the severity of the acidosis as judged by the lowering of total CO2 content, blood pH and clinical condition of the patient. In metabolic acidosis associated with shock, therapy should be monitored by measuring blood gases, plasma osmolarity, arterial blood lactate, hemodynamics and cardiac rhythm. Bicarbonate therapy should always be planned in a stepwise fashion since the degree of response from a given dose is not precisely predictable. Initially an infusion of 2 to 5 mEq/kg body weight over a period of 4 to 8 hours will produce a measurable improvement in the abnormal acid-base status of the blood. The next step of therapy is dependent upon the clinical response of the patient. If severe symptoms have abated, then the frequency of administration and the size of the dose may be reduced.

### Extraction of valuable metals from acid mine drainage by an electrochemically activated limestone system [^12c51d08]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

After metal extraction by the EAL treatment, the SEM images of the cathodes showed many micro-sized particles (Supplementary Fig. 20a), while the EDS result suggests that these particles are mainly composed of elements Cu, Cd, Zn, C, and O (Supplementary Fig. 20b). Besides, XRD-GI characterization identified that these micro-sized particles were Cu/Cd metallic alloy (PDF#97–8956) and Zn 5 (OH) 6 (CO 3) 2 (PDF#01-072-1100) (Supplementary Fig. 20c). This evidence further demonstrated that the EAL system can effectively extract heavy metals through reduction and precipitation in mixed heavy metals loaded AMD.

Beyond metal recovery, given the increase of pH and hardness ions (2.4 mM Ca 2+ and 0.4 mM Mg 2+), we explored the benefits of the EAL system in direct air CO 2 capture (DAC) at room temperature (22.0 ± 2.0 °C). As illustrated in Fig. 5d, after 15 h of exposure to air, the pH of the solution decreased from 9.3 to 8.8, while the concentration of inorganic carbon increased from 4.1 to 4.8 mM. Since the effluent was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter, the increased inorganic carbon should not come from any solids. Instead, it probably results from CO 2 entering the solution from the air and reacting with OH − to form HCO 3 − (CO 2 +OH − →HCO 3 −), according to the total charge (cation, anion) neutralization (Supplementary Note 1). Meanwhile, the concentration of calcium ions decreased from 2.4 to 2.2 mM, indicating that some of the Ca 2+ began to form precipitates under alkaline conditions (Ca 2+ + HCO 3 − →CaCO 3 +H +). At the subsequent 80 h of reaction, the DIC concentration decreased from 4.8 to 4.6 mM and finally achieved equilibrium, while the concentration of Ca 2+ declined gradually to 2.0 mM. This is primarily due to the simultaneous precipitation of CaCO 3 and the direct capture of CO 2 from the air. Meanwhile, the solution pH gradually decreased and stabilized at 8.3, within the permissible discharge range (pH 6.0–9.0).

### Mechanistic basis of the dynamic response of TWIK1 ionic selectivity to pH [^ed8940dd]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Results

A method to identify residues involved in the response of TWIK1 ionic selectivity to pH

Progressive acidification of the extracellular pH has sequential effects on TWIK1. First, channel activity increases between pH7.5 and pH6.5, then ionic selectivity changes at lower pH levels as shown by the shift of the reversal potential (Fig. 1A–C). As observed with H122K, the H122R mutation that mimics the protonation of the His122 side chain leads to an increase in TWIK1 activity at high pH, without affecting the subsequent change in ionic selectivity at lower pH (Fig. 1D–F). This result shows that other residues are required for the acidification-induced change in ionic selectivity. To identify these residues we first focused on the area of the selectivity filter (Fig. 2). Mutations of TWIK1 residues were designed to test putative mechanisms within the limits of available natural amino acids (Fig. 3). For example, replacing histidine with an asparagine gives comparable side-chain volumes and hydrophilicity, while suppressing protonation at low pH. pKa calculation was performed on all titratable TWIK1 residues located in the crystal structure. These calculations enabled us to select the selectivity filter residues to be titrated for MD simulations (residues shown in blue in Fig. 2) and the trajectories of these simulations were analyzed to highlight alterations within the atomic networks (Fig. 4 and Fig. S1). The next sections describe how interactions between His122, Lys246, Glu235, Phe109 and Ser106 as well as Asp230 respond to acidification. These descriptions provide an atomic-level overview of pH-induced responses for most of these key elements.

### High-resolution discrimination of homologous and isomeric proteinogenic amino acids in nanopore sensors with ultrashort single-walled carbon nanotubes [^a96ce2c6]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Next, we measured current-voltage (I-V) curves of the selected range of SWCNT nanopores. It was found that all the I-V curves exhibited linear characteristics when both chambers were filled with the same concentrations of electrolyte (Supplementary Fig. 8). For any of the SWCNT nanopores, when the solution pH was adjusted from 8.0 to 3.0, the conductance gradually decreased presumably due to the protonation of the end carboxylic groups. Then, we further explored the ion selectivity of the tubes with reversal potential measurements in which the two sides of the SWCNT nanopore are exposed to different concentrations of electrolyte (cis 0.1 M KCl/trans 1.0 M KCl). For one example shown in Fig. 1d, the selectivity ratio (SR) of K + /Cl − is 2.14 at pH 8.0, which is about the same magnitude as those of biological α-hemolysin (αHL) nanopore and its mutants, but much less prominent than that of 0.8-nm-diameter SWCNTs (SR of K + /Cl - ≈ 40) reported by Noy and coworkers. When the solution pH was gradually tuned in situ to 3.0 with hydrochloric acid, we observed the decrease of both the conductance and SR of K + /Cl - (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 1). Apparently, the end carboxylic acid groups are the origins of the cation selectivity of SWCNT nanopores. We also tested the SWCNTs of lower fractions and found that the larger conductance tubes have smaller SR of K + /Cl -, which is well in line with previous reports. Similarly, when pH is lowered from 8.0 to 3.0, the SR of K + /Cl - also decreased considerably (Fig. 1e).

### PROTAMINE SULFATE INJECTION, USP 50mg / 5mL… [^0a752343]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

Protamines are simple proteins of low molecular weight that are rich in arginine and strongly basic. They occur in the sperm of salmon and certain other species of fish. Protamine sulfate occurs as fine white or off-white amorphous or crystalline powder. It is sparingly soluble in water. The pH is between 6. 0 and 7.
0. The cationic hydrogenated protamine at a pH of 6. 8 to
7. 1 reacts with anionic heparin at a pH of 5. 0 to
7. 5 to form an inactive complex. Protamine Sulfate Injection, USP is a sterile, isotonic solution of protamine sulfate. It acts as a heparin antagonist. It is also a weak anticoagulant. Each mL contains: Protamine sulfate 10 mg; sodium chloride 9 mg; Water for Injection q. s. Sulfuric acid and/or dibasic sodium phosphate may have been added for pH adjustment. Protamine sulfate has a rapid onset of action. Neutralization of heparin occurs within five minutes after intravenous administration of an appropriate dose of protamine sulfate.

Although the metabolic fate of the heparin-protamine complex has not been elucidated, it has been postulated that protamine sulfate in the heparin-protamine complex may be partially metabolized or may be attacked by fibrinolysin, thus freeing heparin. Complement activation by the heparin-protamine complexes, release of lysosomal enzymes from neutrophils, and prostaglandin and thomboxane generation have been associated with the development of anaphylactoid reactions. Severe and potentially irreversible circulatory collapse associated with myocardial failure and reduced cardiac output can also occur. The mechanism of this reaction and the role played by concurrent factors are unclear. Overdose of protamine sulfate may cause bleeding. Protamine has a weak anticoagulant effect due to an interaction with platelets and with many proteins including fibrinogen.

This effect should be distinguished from the rebound anticoagulation that may occur 30 minutes to 18 hours following the reversal of heparin with protamine. The large size 25 mL vials are designed for antiheparin treatment only when large doses of heparin have been given during surgery and are to be neutralized by large doses of protamine sulfate after surgical procedures.

### Proton gradients and pH oscillations emerge from heat flow at the microscale [^a7eae511]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Proton gradients are essential for biological systems. They not only drive the synthesis of ATP, but initiate molecule degradation and recycling inside lysosomes. However, the high mobility and permeability of protons through membranes make pH gradients very hard to sustain in vitro. Here we report that heat flow across a water-filled chamber forms and sustains stable pH gradients. Charged molecules accumulate by convection and thermophoresis better than uncharged species. In a dissociation reaction, this imbalances the reaction equilibrium and creates a difference in pH. In solutions of amino acids, phosphate, or nucleotides, we achieve pH differences of up to 2pH units. The same mechanism cycles biomolecules by convection in the created proton gradient. This implements a feedback between biomolecules and a cyclic variation of the pH. The finding provides a mechanism to create a self-sustained proton gradient to drive biochemical reactions.

### The end of the bicarbonate era? A therapeutic application of the stewart approach [^10d02d03]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Unfortunately, the controversy has left many of us wondering whether it is truly important to learn the physicochemical approach. After all, intensivists really have access to only two tools for rapid manipulation of plasma pH in the setting of acidosis: 1) hyperventilation to lower P 2 and 2) administration of sodium bicarbonate. Nonetheless, our understanding of these interventions may be improved with the physicochemical approach. For example, although the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation predicts that hyperventilation will lower pH, it doesn't allow us to understand that hyperventilation does this by removing carbon dioxide without changing the strong ion difference, and it doesn't predict the effect that remaining weak acids will have on the final observed pH.

Similarly, the physicochemical approach helps us understand that administration of sodium bicarbonate increases pH by increasing the concentration of plasma sodium relative to chloride, rather than simply by adding a bicarbonate buffer to the system. This is because sodium fully dissociates in solution, whereas bicarbonate exists in equilibrium with dissolved carbon dioxide (P 2) (i.e. it behaves like a weak acid). In fact, the physicochemical approach helps us understand the potential harmful effects of a rapid bolus of sodium bicarbonate, because it predicts an increase in the local P 2. This may rapidly increase intracellular P 2, worsening intracellular acidosis, because carbon dioxide rapidly diffuses across cellular membranes.

### Effects of pH-neutral, bicarbonate-buffered dialysis fluid on peritoneal transport kinetics in children [^bf3279f4]. Kidney International (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Due to their superior biocompatibility, pH-neutral solutions are beginning to replace acidic lactate-buffered peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluids. We hypothesized that pH-neutral and acidic solutions might differentially affect peritoneal transport in the early dwell phase, due to differences in ionic shifts and initial peritoneal vasodilation. Such differences may become clinically relevant in patients with frequent short cycles on automated PD (APD).

Methods

Twenty-five children were treated with a lactate-buffered (35 mmol/L, pH 5.5) or a bicarbonate-buffered PD solution (34 mmol/L, pH 7.4) in randomized order on two sequential days. Each day a four-hour Standardized Permeability Analysis (SPA) was performed, followed by overnight APD (7 cycles, fill volume 1000 mL/m2, dwell time 75 min). Functional peritoneal surface area was dynamically assessed using the three-pore model.

Results

While intraperitoneal pH was constant at 7.41 ± 0.03 throughout the SPA with bicarbonate fluid, the dialysate remained acidic for more than one hour with lactate solution (pH 7.12 ± 0.08 at 1 h). Total pore area was 60% higher during the first 30 minutes of the dwell than under steady-state conditions, without a difference between acidic and pH-neutral fluid. Net base gain, intraperitoneal volume kinetics, glucose absorption, ultrafiltration rate, effective lymphatic absorption and the transport of urea, potassium, beta2-microglobulin and albumin were similar with both fluids. However, phosphate and creatinine elimination were 10% lower with bicarbonate PD fluid, resulting in corresponding significant decreases in the 24-hour clearances of these solutes.

Conclusion

The peritoneal surface area is not measurably influenced by pH-neutral PD fluid. Creatinine and phosphate elimination appears to be slightly reduced with bicarbonate fluid; this observation awaits clarification in extended therapeutical trials.

### A chemoenzymatic reaction-diffusion system with local inhibition and distal activation [^9cda8568]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

One other advantage of having ProA is that temporal control can be achieved by modifying the reaction parameters of ProA to A. We simulated cases where we modified the k cat /k M ratio to increase or decrease by 10- and 100-fold (at a range of five orders of magnitudes from 30 to 300000 mM −1 s −1) (Supplementary Figs. 63–68). The point of time when the desired concentration of P is observed in the system is tracked. The results show that temporal control of this RD system can be achieved by modifying reaction kinetics of ProA to A reaction. This temporal control would not be possible in a simple system with only two diffusing species as shown in A + IN case and therefore, validating the necessity of reaction-diffusion for more distinct LIDA with manifold spatiotemporal diversity.

Numerical simulation considering pH sensitivity of urease reactivity

So far, we have not considered the pH sensitivity of urease reactivity. Urease activity followed a bell-shaped curve where at pH 7 enzyme showed its highest activity. In our experiment, we found that the initial zones remain acidic due to presence of ATP, whereas outer zone has higher pH (data demonstrated in Fig. 3). Indeed, upon measuring ammonia production rate during urease-urea reaction, we also found that with increasing ATP concentration urease reactivity decreased (Supplementary Table S3). Here pH of the system is also decreasing with increasing ATP.

For modeling pH-dependent urease activity, a Gaussian curve centered at pH 7 (enzyme's optimal pH) was used as previously shown by Straube et al. The experimentally measured pH values at each of the 8 zones over time are associated with the equivalent radial zones of the model at the specified time points (Supplementary Table 3). Zone 0, representing the central cavity is assigned a pH value of 3.7 to represent its acidic nature due to presence of 5 mM ATP. For each zone, the pH data is interpolated over the experimental time range using the 'interp1d' function of Python, so that the local pH can be looked up at any simulation moment for each radial position.

### Stability of cyclophosphamide and mesna admixtures in polyethylene infusion bags [^f0679fdf]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Cyclophosphamide (CYP) is used to treat cancers in combination with mesna to prevent cystitis. The use of extemporaneously prepared admixtures of these drugs must be supported by documentation of their chemical stability.

Objective

To evaluate the chemical stability of CYP and mesna admixtures in dextrose 5% polyethylene infusion bags.

Methods

The drugs were diluted in 100-mL dextrose 5% infusion bags to final concentrations of CYP 10.8 mg/mL with mesna 3.2 mg/mL (solution A) and CYP 1.8 mg/mL with mesna 0.54 mg/mL (solution B). Six infusion bags from each solution were stored at 4 degrees C and 6 were stored at room temperature. Triplicate HPLC determinations were performed on each bag to measure drug concentrations at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 96 hours.

Results

At 96 hours, drug concentrations in all solutions stored at room temperature were found to be < 80% compared with the initial concentrations. The solutions stored at 4 degrees C retained at least 90% of the initial drug concentrations at 48 hours. The pH of solutions A and B stored at room temperature decreased significantly by 4.44 and 4.31 units, respectively. The pH of the refrigerated infusion bags decreased significantly by 1.46 units for solution B.

Conclusions

Admixtures stored at 4 degrees C (pH 7.90 ± 0.004; mean ± SD) are stable for 48 hours. The CYP and mesna combination can be infused at room temperature over 6 hours without significant degradation of the drugs. Stabilities are dependent on pH, temperature, and/or concentration.

### ADENOSINE injection… [^fa45fd7b]. FDA (DailyMed) (2023). Medium credibility.

Adenosine, USP is a white crystalline powder. It is soluble in water and practically insoluble in alcohol. Solubility increases by warming and lowering the pH. Adenosine, USP is not chemically related to other antiarrhythmic drugs. Adenosine injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution for rapid bolus intravenous injection. Each mL contains 3 mg adenosine, USP and 9 mg sodium chloride in water for injection, USP. The pH of the solution is between 4. 5 and 7.
5. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY. Since adenosine kinase has a lower K m and V max than adenosine deaminase, deamination plays a significant role only when cytosolic adenosine saturates the phosphorylation pathway. Inosine formed by deamination of adenosine can leave the cell intact or can be degraded to hypoxanthine, xanthine, and ultimately uric acid. Adenosine monophosphate formed by phosphorylation of adenosine is incorporated into the high-energy phosphate pool.

While extracellular adenosine is primarily cleared by cellular uptake with a half-life of less than 10 seconds in whole blood, excessive amounts may be deaminated by an ecto-form of adenosine deaminase. As adenosine requires no hepatic or renal function for its activation or inactivation, hepatic and renal failure would not be expected to alter its effectiveness or tolerability. Arrhythmias at Time of Conversion At the time of conversion to normal sinus rhythm, a variety of new rhythms may appear on the electrocardiogram. They generally last only a few seconds without intervention, and may take the form of premature ventricular contractions, atrial premature contractions, atrial fibrillation, sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, skipped beats, and varying degrees of A-V nodal block. Such findings were seen in 55% of patients.

Repeat administration: If conversion of PSVT does not occur within 1 to 2 minutes, additional bolus injections of adenosine can be administered at incrementally higher doses, increasing the amount given by 0. 05 to
0. 1 mg/kg. Follow each bolus with a saline flush. This process should continue until sinus rhythm is established or a maximum single dose of 0. 3 mg/kg is used.

### Guideline for disinfection and sterilization in healthcare facilities, 2008 [^f18d9dc0]. CDC (2008). Medium credibility.

Glutaraldehyde — overview, activation, and stability: Glutaraldehyde is a saturated dialdehyde that has gained wide acceptance as a high-level disinfectant and chemical sterilant. Aqueous solutions are acidic and generally in this state are not sporicidal, and only when the solution is activated (made alkaline) by use of alkalinating agents to pH 7.5–8.5 does the solution become sporicidal. Once activated, solutions have a shelf-life of minimally 14 days because of polymerization of the glutaraldehyde molecules at alkaline pH levels, which blocks the active sites (aldehyde groups) responsible for its biocidal activity. Novel formulations produced in the past 30 years have overcome the problem of rapid loss of activity (e.g., use-life 28–30 days) while generally maintaining excellent microbicidal activity; however, antimicrobial activity depends not only on age but also on use conditions, such as dilution and organic stress.

### Rapid evaluation of bioactive Ti-based surfaces using an in vitro titration method [^607aff8c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 3
Free calcium profiles of titration experiments using four titanium surfaces. The black lines indicate free calcium concentrations measured by a calcium ISE. The dash lines give the concentration of added amount of calcium ions. The difference of the two is given by the dotted line. The colored region marks the possible dominant crystalline phases identified from TEM analysis

Figure 3 shows the titration curves for the four titanium surfaces: Ti, Ti HT, Ti NaOH, and Ti NaOH HT. It can be seen that the presence of Ti or Ti HT powder does not seem to have an effect on the CaP formation pathway in the solution as reflected in the shape of the curve. The two-step pathway is again followed with a distinct separation of the two events. Sampling the solution using a TEM grid at the second peak in the free calcium profile, crystals can be observed both on Ti powder surface as well as in the solution (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Similarly, at the end of the titration between 250 and 300 min, crystals with characteristic HA morphologies in the form of nano-sheets aggregated into globules can be seen in the solution (Supplementary Fig. 5b), an evidence of homogenous nucleation products from the solution. However, in the case of Ti NaOH and Ti NaOH HT powders, not only the free calcium profile was modified with only one prominent peak remaining but also the nucleation onset point was significantly shifted to earlier time points. In addition, instead of a rather rapid nucleation process, the nucleation seems to happen slowly with a gradual increase in complexed and precipitated Ca around the onset point and a smoother pH profile. In fact, when sampled roughly 5–10 min before the highest free Ca point, crystalline CaP species can already be found together with pieces of Ti NaOH (Supplementary Fig. 6). At the highest free Ca point, crystalline CaP is also found embedded in the porous surface layer (Supplementary Fig. 7). The detailed analysis of the diffraction pattern indicates very similar features as the crystalline product from the homogenous nucleation, which is possibly OCP. At this stage, transformation to the thermodynamically most stable phase takes place and typical HA morphologies can be observed after the peak in free Ca even before reaching the lowest Ca concentration (Supplementary Fig. 8). Therefore, we propose that for the active surfaces of Ti NaOH and Ti NaOH HT, the initial nucleation barrier is significantly lowered and the free Ca peak observed corresponds to the final transformation, equivalent to the second peak in the case of homogeneous nucleation and nucleation in the presence of inert Ti and Ti HT. These features represent a clear measurable difference between different surfaces in solution. If we define the supersaturation of the solution at the first major precipitation event as an indicator for bioactivity, using the titration data and the thermodynamic model (Supplementary Note 1), we can quantitatively calculate the solution supersaturation at the first nucleation point, taking into account the adsorption of free Ca 2+ ion by Ti NaOH and Ti NaOH HT. Figure 4 shows a summary of supersaturation, calculated as for OCP, at the first free calcium peak for the four surfaces compared with the case of homogeneous nucleation (n = 3 using distinct samples). Statistical analysis using a one-way ANOVA test shows statistical differences between the five groups (p < 0.01). In addition, statistical significance exists between any case of the group of no sample, Ti and Ti HT and any material of the group composed of Ti NaOH and Ti NaOH HT (p < 0.001). There is no statistical difference between materials within each group. This conclusion is consistent with the direct visual observation of the modification of the free calcium profile from different materials but the supersaturation values provide us a quantitative measure of bioactivity. The lower relative supersaturation required for the precipitation in the case of Ti NaOH and Ti NaOH HT powders indicates their higher bioactivity compared with Ti and Ti HT powder. It should also be noted that this is in fact an underestimation for the bioactivity for Ti NaOH and Ti NaOH HT since the precipitation event actually corresponds to the second precipitation in the case of Ti and Ti HT. If in all cases we use the supersaturation level for the last precipitation event, which is the transformation to the thermodynamically most stable phase HA, the difference observed in the current experiments will be even more prominent.

### In-situ detection of pH and dissolved oxygen in electrolyte of aqueous zinc-ion batteries [^80ae6fd1]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

To meet the demand for the real-time detection of both pH and DO, a constant gate voltage bias was applied to the EGFET sensor after varying the analyte concentration, and the dynamic response curves of the channel currents (I DS) were recorded (Section 1.2 of Supplementary information). The EGFET-pH & DO sensor adopts a single RFE to simplify its structure, which means that the sensitive electrodes for pH and DO must be able to operate at the same gate voltage bias. To ensure a high signal-to-noise (Supplementary Fig. 6), a driving voltage (V ref.) of −2.00 V was selected for all the channel current acquisitions in this work. As shown in Fig. 3d, I DS of the EGFET-pH sensor gradually decreased from 63.0 to 11.2 μA as pH decreased from 7.00 to 3.00, and then recovered to 66.9 μA when the pH value was restored to 7.00. Within the tested pH range, log(I DS) is linearly and positively correlated with pH, and the corresponding fitted curve is log(I DS) = 0.198 pH −5.54 with a correlation coefficient of 0.991 (Fig. 3e). Figure 3f demonstrates the continuous response curve of the EGFET-DO sensor, where the I DS decreased from 45.9 to 7.12 μA as the DO concentration in the electrolyte gradually increased from 0.0022 to 9.8 mg L −1 and recovered to the baseline value by removing DO from the electrolyte. The fitted curve in Fig. 3g shows that log(I DS) is linearly and negatively correlated with log(ρ DO) in the range of 0.020 to 9.8 mg L −1, and the corresponding fitted curve is log(I DS) = −0.271 log(ρ DO) − 4.86 with a correlation coefficient of 0.991. The stabilities of the EGFET-pH and EGFET-DO sensors against crossover interferences were then tested, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3h, the I DS of the EGFET-pH sensor remained relatively constant when the DO concentration in the aqueous ZnSO₄ electrolyte was changed. Similarly, the anti-interference test results of EGFET-DO were shown in Fig. 3i, after adding H 2 SO 4 (0.05 mol L −1, 100 μL), the pH of the electrolyte decreased rapidly from 4.28 to 3.61, and then increased sharply to 5.26 with the addition of NaOH (0.1 mol L −1, 200 μL), while I DS response curve of EGFET-DO did not drift significantly. To further verify the interference of ion concentration changes in the electrolyte, MnSO 4 (0.1 mol L −1, 200 μL) and deionized water (1 mL) were added to the electrolyte, respectively. It can be found in Supplementary Fig. 7 that the I DS of the EGFET-pH decreased slightly after the addition of MnSO 4. The pH value decreased from 4.22 to 4.17, which was mainly due to the hydrolysis of Mn 2+. Subsequently, deionized water was added to dilute the Zn 2+ and SO 4 2− in the electrolyte, and pH merely increased from 4.17 to 4.19. The results indicate that EGFET sensors have robust anti-interference characteristics and reliability.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Acetazolamide use during hospitalization for heart failure (HF) — trial and meta-analysis signals — reports a shorter duration of hospital stay (8.8 days vs 9.9 days; P = 0.016) compared with placebo, while a prespecified analysis of ADVOR found acetazolamide was associated with modestly higher creatinine levels during decongestion, particularly in the heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) cohort; carbonic anhydrase inhibition should not be used chronically for HF, and if acetazolamide is used for longer durations, kidney function and serum bicarbonate should be monitored because plasma bicarbonate can fall dramatically and lead to severe acidosis; a meta-analysis of 9 studies with a total of 229 patients with HF found significant decreases in serum pH, pCO2, and serum bicarbonate with acetazolamide.

### Sodium bicarbonate [^c666a04e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP is administered by the intravenous route.

In cardiac arrest, a rapid intravenous dose of one to two 50 mL vials (44.6 to 100 mEq) may be given initially and continued at a rate of 50 mL (44.6 to 50 mEq) every 5 to 10 minutes if necessary (as indicated by arterial pH and blood gas monitoring) to reverse the acidosis. Caution should be observed in emergencies where very rapid infusion of large quantities of bicarbonate is indicated. Bicarbonate solutions are hypertonic and may produce an undesirable rise in plasma sodium concentration in the process of correcting the metabolic acidosis. In cardiac arrest, however, the risks from acidosis exceed those of hypernatremia.

In less urgent forms of metabolic acidosis, Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP may be added to other intravenous fluids. The amount of bicarbonate to be given to older children and adults over a four-to-eight-hour period is approximately 2 to 5 mEq/kg of body weight - depending upon the severity of the acidosis as judged by the lowering of total CO2content, blood pH and clinical condition of the patient. In metabolic acidosis associated with shock, therapy should be monitored by measuring blood gases, plasma osmolarity, arterial blood lactate, hemodynamics and cardiac rhythm. Bicarbonate therapy should always be planned in a stepwise fashion since the degree of response from a given dose is not precisely predictable. Initially an infusion of 2 to 5 mEq/kg body weight over a period of 4 to 8 hours will produce a measurable improvement in the abnormal acid-base status of the blood. The next step of therapy is dependent upon the clinical response of the patient. If severe symptoms have abated, then the frequency of administration and the size of the dose may be reduced.

### Comment: balanced salt solutions for critically ill patients: nonplused and back to basics [^f5a1b08b]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

The analysis of trial results of the intravenous fluids pharmacodynamics revealed problems common to all studies, such as varying study designs, clinical discretion for treatments, and heterogeneous patients. We believe that in the methodology of future research it is also necessary to pay due attention to the actual rather than theoretical physicochemical parameters of the solutions used, such as osmolality, pH, and potential excess of bases. Paying attention to these parameters of intravenous fluids will be useful for assessing their role in producing pharmacodynamic effects in critically ill patients.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^e328f94b]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis fluid choice — lactated Ringer solution has advantages over normal saline. Normal saline is more acidic with a pH of 5.5 and is associated with a nonanion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and renal injury when large volumes are given, and in 3 well-designed prospective randomized trials lactated Ringer solution has been shown to be more beneficial than normal saline. Patients receiving lactated Ringer solution were less likely to develop SIRS and were less likely to be admitted to the critical care unit and had a shorter hospitalization compared with normal saline, although in patients in the emergency department for a long period and inadequately treated with early aggressive hydration, the benefit may not exist and may be harmful when transferred to the floor or ICU.

### Biochemical phosphates observed using hyperpolarizedP in physiological aqueous solutions [^07e52330]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
High-resolution 31 P NMR spectra of Pi in a hyperpolarized state and at thermal equilibrium. a 31 P NMR spectra of hyperpolarized Pi in D 2 O (2.72 mM). The solid-state polarization was carried out in basic pH and the dissolution medium pH was 8.1 (with the Pi). The individual spectra, acquired with 1 s temporal resolution, are presented using a Maroon color scale for visual clarity and convenience. A total of 180 scans were acquired. Only the spectra with visible Pi signal are shown. The excitation angle was 10° at a field of 5.8 T. The initial polarization demonstrated in the 1st spectrum was 9.6%. The line width of the hyperpolarized signals was 13 Hz. b A thermal equilibrium 31 P spectrum of the same sample shown in a, acquired with 400 excitations, a nutation angle of 90°, and a repetition time of 151 s (ca. 17 h of acquisition). c The decay of the hyperpolarized Pi signal is demonstrated via the integrated intensity of the Pi signal (in arbitrary units, a.u.), marked with blue x. The fit of the data to the longitudinal relaxation decay equation (see "Methods") is depicted by the continuous line (black). This fit resulted in a T 1 of 24.2 s (95% confidence interval 23.7, 24.6 s)

The effect of water protons on the hyperpolarized Pi decay

To explore the effects of solvent (water) protonation in the basic condition, the experiment was repeated using pure water for dissolution. The T 1 of the hyperpolarized Pi decreased twofold to about 15 s (Fig. 1). This effect can be explained by inter-molecular dipolar interaction between the water protons and the hyperpolarized 31 P nucleus. The effect of dissolution osmolarity was also tested (using physiological saline as the dissolution medium, ca. 300 mOsm), and the T 1 was found to be shortened slightly to about 13 s (Fig. 1). Despite this T 1 shortening effect of using water instead of D 2 O and using iso-osmotic solutions, the T 1 of the basic formulation was still comparable to the T 1 of the acidic formulation in D 2 O. We conclude that the basic formulation is preferential for preparing Pi solutions for hyperpolarization.

### Functional regimes define soil microbiome response to environmental change [^c38447c1]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

To perturb the soil pH to desired levels, we constructed each soil's pH titration curve for the 20 soils with varying native pH to know exactly how much acid or base to add to each soil sample. To do so, separate from the main pH perturbation experiment, we added 23 different levels of HCl (acid) or NaOH (base) in the slurry, final concentrations ranging from 0–100 mM HCl or NaOH. We colorimetrically measured the pH (see section below) immediately after and 4 days after adding each well's designated amount of acid/base. Owing to natural soil's buffering capacity, it takes 1–2 days to stabilize its pH level. Thus, we used the endpoint (after 4 days) pH measurements for all pH perturbations. We did a spline interpolation on the titration data points, plotting endpoint pH (y axis) against acid or base input (x axis), to compute how much HCl and NaOH needs to be added to the soil to obtain 13 different levels of pH with ~0.4 intervals ranging from pH 3 to 9, including the pH level without the addition of any acid or base. For Soil 19 and Soil 20, we had only 7 and 3 perturbed pH levels respectively, because the strong buffering capacity of these soils (native pH over 8) limited the range of pH perturbation. We additionally tested whether the anion of acid (Cl −) or the cation of base (Na +) had a distinctive effect on the nitrate reduction dynamics, which was not the case (for results, see Extended Data Fig. 2g and Supplementary Information, 'Effect of base cation on nutrient release in soils').

### Modulation of polypeptide conformation through donor-acceptor transformation of side-chain hydrogen bonding ligands [^3299a0ce]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
Coil-to-helix transition induced by protonation of side-chain 1,2,3-triazole. a The pH titration curve of P1 with side-chain triazoles and P2 without side-chain triazoles. b CD spectra of P1 upon stepwise addition of concentrated HCl. c The mean residue molar ellipticity of P1 at 222 nm (−[θ] 222 nm) after alternating addition of HCl and NaOH over five cycles. At pH ~ 2.8 (light grey background), P1 adopts an α-helical conformation with a positive −[θ] 222 nm value; at pH ~ 9.5 (white background), the value of −[θ] 222 nm is approximately zero indicating a random coil structure

The protonation of triazole at weakly acidic pH leads to changes in its H-bonding pattern (Fig. 2b), which should subsequently induce changes in the polypeptide conformation according to our hypothesis. To test this, we analyzed the CD spectra of P1 at varying pH values. While P1 remained as a random coil at neutral and basic pH, it began to adopt an α-helical conformation as the pH was lowered (Fig. 3b). The starting point of the shift in conformation observed by CD coincided with the onset of the buffering effect of the titration curve (pH ~ 6.6), indicating the correlation between the inhibition of disruptive effect on α-helix and the protonation of side-chain triazole. The appearance of an isodichroic point at 203 nm is consistent with a two-state helix-coil transition and suggests the absence of other secondary structure during the transition. As a comparison, control polypeptide P2 without side-chain triazole linkage remained as an α-helix with negligible ellipticity changes upon decreasing the pH (Supplementary Fig. 3). The conformational change was also verified by 1 H NMR, where the sharp peaks for all backbone protons of P1 became weaker and broader upon decreasing the pH, mainly due to side-chain shielding upon polypeptide folding (Supplementary Fig. 2). All these results collectively indicate that protonation of the triazole into a triazolium indeed results in removal of the inhibitory BHB pattern and recovery of the helix in situ. This pH induced conformational transition is also highly reversible as expected. After five cycles from pH ~9.5 to ~2.8 and back, the α-helix demonstrated complete recovery of ellipticity at the low pH condition (Fig. 3c). The reversible nature of this transition additionally excludes the possibility of irreversible chemical changes, such as the hydrolysis of side-chain esters or the isomerization of the backbone α-carbon.

### Recycling e-waste into gold-loaded covalent organic framework catalysts for terminal alkyne carboxylation [^7d9265c8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Sorption experiments

The nitrogen-rich tetrazine linkers and the sulfur-rich TTF units of TTF-COF mean that these COFs could serve as effective adsorbents for removing gold ions from the solution. Solution pH impacts adsorption experiments by controlling the oxidation state of the metal ions as well as the surface charge of the adsorbents. The adsorption capacity for Au(III) on TPE-COF and TTF-COF is high in the pH range of 1–5, gradually decreasing from pH 5 to 7 (Supplementary Fig. 33). At lower pH values, Au(III) exists predominantly as [AuCl 4] –1, but as the pH increases, hydroxyl-containing gold complexes form due to the base-assisted hydrolysis of [AuCl 4] –1. The sorption experiments were conducted at pH 5, where the adsorption capacity for [AuCl 4] –1 is expected to be optimal based on the electrostatic interactions, the oxidation state of the gold ions stable, and the specific chemical environment maintainable by the COF materials.

The electrostatic interaction between the COFs and the [AuCl 4] –1 ions was investigated by measuring the zeta potentials (ζ) of TTF-COF and TPE-COF across a range of pH levels (Supplementary Fig. 34). The zeta potential, which reflects the surface charge of the COFs, is directly influenced by the protonation state of the tetrazine nitrogens within the framework. For TTF-COF, the zeta potential shifted from negative to positive as the pH decreased, with the point of zero zeta potential observed at pH 5.31. This indicates that, at pH values around 5, the protonation of the tetrazine units confers a positive charge on the COF surface, thereby enhancing the electrostatic attraction to the negatively charged [AuCl 4] –1 ion. A similar behavior was observed for TPE-COF, with a point of zero zeta potential at pH 5.52. These findings confirm that the high adsorption capacity of these COFs for [AuCl 4] –1 ions is not solely due to covalent interactions but is also driven by electrostatic forces, particularly under acidic conditions.

### Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in children: pathophysiological considerations and suggested guidelines for treatment [^a58b368a]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric HHS — targets for glucose and sodium correction during fluid therapy emphasize gradual changes: With adequate rehydration, serum glucose concentrations should decline by 75 to 100 mg/dL/hr (4.1–5.5 mmol/L/h), and lack of appropriate decline in serum glucose should prompt reassessment and evaluation of renal function; although there are no data to indicate an optimal rate of decline in serum sodium, a rate of 0.5 mEq/L per hour has been recommended for hypernatremic dehydration; replacement of urinary losses is recommended, and 0.45% saline solution approximates the typical urine sodium concentration during osmotic diuresis.

The stability of initial and reduced PW 12 under a high alkaline condition was investigated by the titration experiments. Figure 3b shows the acid-base titration curves of H-PW 12 with different reduced states. NaOH was added into the initial state H-PW 12 (0e − H-PW 12) until the molar ratio of Na +: PW 12 reached 5. The pH value was still lower than 2 because PW 12 was gradually decomposed into WO 4 2− and PO 4 3−, and thus consumed the newly added OH − (shown in Supplementary Fig. 6). When neutralizing the reduced PW 12 (1e − and 2e − H-PW 12), the pH jumped rapidly at the Na +: PW 12 ratio of 3, which indicates that reduced PW 12 or PW 11 cannot consume the excess OH −. Therefore, the stability of tungsten based polyoxometalates in the high pH solution was highly improved after it was reduced. During the charging process, with the pH increased to 11, reduced PW 12 was partially degraded into PW 11, but it will not be continuously decomposed into WO 4 2− and PO 4 3−. As the pH changed back to initial value in the discharge process, PW 11 and decomposed species of PW 12 would self-assemble back into PW 12, which is recognized as the self-healing property of polyoxometalate (as shown in Supplementary Fig. 6). This was also verified by the 31 P NMR of the 3Na-PW 12 anolyte solutions before charging and after discharging (Fig. 3c). The two spectra are almost the same, indicating that the anolyte solution after discharging was basically restored to the initial state of PW 12. Species such as WO 4 2− produced by the decomposition of PW 12 at high pH usually have very weak redox activities, as evidenced by the CV curves in Fig. 3d, e. However, the reduced 3Na-PW 12 was able to maintain stable and exhibited remarkable redox activity under neutral (pH 7), or even high alkaline conditions (pH 11).

### Sodium chloride, sodium acetate anhydrous, sodium gluconate, potassium chloride, and magnesium chloride (normosol-R) [^5d38b854]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Normosol-R pH 7.4 is indicated for replacement of acute extracellular fluid volume losses in surgery, trauma, burns or shock. Normosol-R pH 7.4 also can be used as an adjunct to restore a decrease in circulatory volume in patients with moderate blood loss. Normosol-R pH 7.4 is not intended to supplant transfusion of whole blood or packed red cells in the presence of uncontrolled hemorrhage or severe reductions of red cell volume.

Normosol-R pH 7.4 is particularly valuable as a solution for use in starting blood, i.e., as a priming solution for the infusion set. No hemolysis of blood is seen at the interface or with mixed solution and blood. It may also be used as a diluent to aid in the transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBC). Normosol-R pH 7.4 and physiologic saline solution (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) are compatible with both young and old PRBC.

### Proton gradients and pH oscillations emerge from heat flow at the microscale [^2d4256dd]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

For living systems, the creation of pH differences is tedious and requires complex protein-mediated transport mechanisms. On prebiotic earth, natural pH gradients would form by laminar mixing of fluids with different pH values, e.g. at the interface between disequilibria at submarine hydrothermal vents and the Hadean ocean –. However, these systems rely on a continuous influx of mass and energy. Molecules would experience this gradient only for a short time and are washed out into a pH-equilibrated reservoir, keeping the mechanism transient. A repetitive pH oscillation inside a closed system would be desirable and keep molecules at one location without being lost by a flow or by diffusion.

Here we found a mechanism to form stable pH gradients and continuous cycling of pH in a closed system. Thermal energy, the form of energy necessary for the mechanism, triggers an accumulation mechanism for individual ionic species. The heat flow forms a temperature gradient, spanning across sub-millimeter-sized water-filled compartments. This is likely a common setting on early earth, found for example in geothermally heated porous rocks such as hydrothermal vents or cooling volcanic sites. This elementary setting has previously been shown to concentrate dilute nucleotides, accumulate lipids to facilitate the formation of vesicles, shift polymerization reactions toward longer DNA/RNA strands, and selectively replicate longer polymers. This study now extends these characteristics to include the formation of a stable pH gradient by thermally separating dissolved buffer molecules of different charge states. This locally shifts the buffer equilibrium, yielding pH differences of up to two units and provides another aspect for a promising long-term microhabitat for the onset of molecular evolution.

### Protein fibers with self-recoverable mechanical properties via dynamic imine chemistry [^e13b87d1]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Subsequently, the tensile tests showed that the ultimate tensile strength and toughness of post-stretched DIF-72 fibers were significantly decreased from 277.2 ± 29.2 MPa (pH = 7) to 176.7 ± 19.1 MPa (pH = 1) and from 64.2 ± 14.7 MJ/m 3 (pH = 7) to 34 ± 7.2 MJ/m 3 (pH = 1). In this process, the imine bonds in the densely packed cross-linking networks were partly broken within the post-stretched DIF-72 fibers after being treated with acid, significantly weakening both ultimate tensile strength and toughness. Similarly, the mechanical performance of post-stretched DIF-72 fibers was recovered when dynamic imine bonds were reformed after immersion in an aqueous solution (pH = 8, 50 mNa 3 PO 4) (Supplementary Figs. 26–29). Of note, the variations in pH have minimal impact on the conformation of the K-proteins but the imine bonds could break and reform within the DIF fibers, as confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. 30). After being treated with acid conditions (e.g. pH 1), the stretching vibration of the imine bond (1610–1640 cm −1) was not distinguished due to the overlay by the amide I band. However, the stretching vibration of the C = O bond (aldehyde) from the hydrolyzed imine bonds for both as-spun and post-stretched DIF-72 fibers was detected at ~1740 cm -1, indicating the acid-induced hydrolysis of imine bonds within the DIF fibers, which resulted in the decreased mechanical performance. When the pH was recovered to 8, the stretching vibration of the C = O bond (aldehyde) decreased. This suggests that the imine bonds were reformed, thereby recovering the mechanical performance of DIF fibers to their initial state. Further control experiments showed that the ultimate tensile strength and toughness of degummed natural silkworm fibers were permanently decreased after being subjected to 2000 loading-unloading cycles or treated with a pH = 1 solution, which could not be recovered by treatment in a pH = 8 solution due to the irreversible destruction of internal structures within the silkworm fibers (Supplementary Figs. 31–32 and Supplementary Table 6). The distinct advantages in the recoverability of DIF fibers are attributed to the dynamic imine bonds within the DIF fibers. In a low pH solution, H + facilitated the disassociation reaction of imine bonds, resulting in more fractured imine bonds and thus weakening the fiber strength. Therefore, the ultimate tensile strength gradually decreased as pH decreased. Under alkaline conditions, OH — would facilitate the recondensation of amino and aldehyde groups, reconstructing the dynamic imine network within the fibers, thereby recovering the fiber's mechanics.

### Chlorella-derived natural photosynthetic system for in situ energy metabolism enhancement in cardiomyocytes [^bfbe4677]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

To expand the application of UCNPs in the biomedical field, we also investigated their degradability. The water-soluble [ZrF 7] 4- species possess a propensity to dissolve expeditiously, leading to the NaCeF 4 crystal lattice being destroyed and turning into positive ions and [ZrF 7] 4- clusters (Fig. 2H). To corroborate this mechanism, the synthesized UCNPs were uniformly dispersed in different solutions, including KH 2 PO 4 solution (pH 4.8), KH 2 PO 4 -K 2 HPO 4 solution (pH 6.5), Hank's balanced salt solution (pH 7.4), sodium bicarbonate solution (pH 8.3), Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) and sodium hydroxide solution (pH 9.6) (Supplementary Fig. 3). The UCL intensity significantly decreased (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b) after 48 h. Additionally, TEM images showed that the part UCNPs had disintegrated into debris after 48 h in PBS buffer solutions (Fig. 2I). The concentration of degraded Zr manifested a progressive augmentation commensurate with the elapse of time in PBS solutions, while the degradation rate exhibited a corresponding gradual increase with increasing doping of Zr ions (Fig. 2J, K). Nevertheless, in the upconversion emission spectra of UCNPs with varying Zr concentrations, a gradual reduction in luminescence intensity was observed with increasing Zr doping levels (Supplementary Fig. 5). Considering both biosafety and therapeutic efficacy in a comprehensive manner, it is essential to ensure optimal fluorescence intensity alongside material degradation. Therefore, a doping concentration of 10% Zr ions is identified as the most favorable. Thus, we ultimately selected 10% Zr as the final doping content in UCNPs, ensuring an appropriate treatment duration while preventing the long-term accumulation of UCNPs in vivo. Moreover, the bright-blue UCL of UCNPs disappeared after being dispersed in pure water for 48 h (Fig. 2L), further confirming the degradability.

### Guidelines for the use of local anesthesia in office-based dermatologic surgery [^c014b5cf]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Addition of sodium bicarbonate — multiple well-designed randomized controlled trials show that the addition of sodium bicarbonate to local anesthetic in order to raise the pH decreases patient pain during drug delivery via subcutaneous or intradermal infiltration, and in these studies, approximately 2 out of 3 patients noted a 20% to 40% decrease in injection pain with the addition of sodium bicarbonate compared to plain lidocaine with epinephrine. One nonconfirmatory study compared a solution of 0.1% lidocaine without bicarbonate to a solution of 1% lidocaine with bicarbonate; this was not a relevant comparison because there was a 10-fold difference in lidocaine concentrations between the 2 groups. While the addition of sodium bicarbonate to infiltration anesthesia has not been examined in the pediatric population, the authors find that buffering anesthesia also decreases injection pain in children. Lidocaine and bupivacaine were the only drugs studied, and the work group does not recommend buffering of the latter, because precipitation of the anesthetic may lead to decreased efficacy. For preparation, the concentrations of sodium bicarbonate varied from 10 to 100 mEq/L, with most solutions prepared by mixing 8.4% sodium bicarbonate and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine in a 1:9 or 1:10 ratio by volume. Regarding stability, investigators found the concentration of epinephrine to decrease by 25% per week after the addition of 100 mEq/L of sodium bicarbonate; a follow-up study confirmed that buffered anesthetic solutions prepared 1 week before use caused nearly equal areas of anesthesia and vasoconstriction as solutions mixed the day of the procedure, and this evidence suggests that buffered solutions of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine may be prepared up to 1 week in advance of use.

### A natural light-driven inward proton pump [^ef12f6e8]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

As for the identity of H + donor to the Schiff base, the decay of the M intermediate accompanies protonation of the Schiff base, and if H + is taken up from the aqueous phase, the decay of M should slow down at high pH. We thus measured the M decay kinetics at different pH values. Figure 7a shows strong pH dependence of the M rise but limited pH dependence of the M decay. In fact, the speed of M decay increased at pH 9.0. This fact indicates the presence of an internal H + donor. If it is a carboxylic acid, we expect a negative band in the 1,760–1,700 cm −1 region in the Po XeR 13C -minus- Po XeR AT difference FTIR spectra. However, Fig. 7b shows a broad positive peak at 1,723 cm −1 in addition to a peak pair at 1,741 (+)/1,736 (−) cm −1. Absence of deprotonation signal in this region questions the role of a carboxylic acid as the H + donor. Other residues such as arginine and protein-bound water molecules are possible candidates for the internal H + donor. The spectral features at 1,336 (+) cm −1 and 1,198 (−)/1,183 (+) cm −1 (Fig. 7b and Supplementary Fig. 3) resemble those of the dark adaptation in BR, suggesting that Po XeR 13C contains the 13- cis, 15- syn configuration.

Thiamine (vitamin B1) in enteral and parenteral nutrition — metabolism, absorption, and kinetics are described as follows: Thiamine functions in several phosphorylated forms, chiefly as thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), and is water soluble, stable at acidic pH, and unstable in alkaline solutions and with exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. Thiamine is absorbed mainly in the jejunum by carrier-mediated active transport at lower concentrations and by passive diffusion at higher concentrations; only a small percentage of a high oral dose is absorbed and absorption declines at a dose above 5 mg. Thiamine is carried in erythrocytes and plasma and is not stored to a significant extent in any tissues but in more significant amounts in muscle, heart, liver, kidney, and brain; urinary excretion is increased when serum levels are elevated and decreased when low, with maximum excretion 2 hours after oral intake. The biological half-life has been determined to be 9–18 days, and the adult body is thought to contain approximately 30 mg.

### Dilutional acidosis: where do the protons come from? [^040bf532]. Intensive Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the mechanism of acidosis developing after saline infusion (dilutional acidosis or hyperchloremic acidosis).

Methods

We simulated normal extracellular fluid dilution by infusing distilled water, normal saline and lactated Ringer's solution. Simulations were performed either in a closed system or in a system open to alveolar gases using software based on the standard laws of mass action and mass conservation. In vitro experiments diluting human plasma were performed to validate the model.

Results

In our computerized model with constant pKs, diluting extracellular fluid modeled as a closed system with distilled water, normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution is not associated with any pH modification, since all its determinants (strong ion difference, CO(2) content and weak acid concentration) decrease at the same degree, maintaining their relative proportions unchanged. Experimental data confirmed the simulation results for normal saline and lactated Ringer's solution, whereas distilled water dilution caused pH to increase. This is due to the increase of carbonic pK induced by the dramatic decrease of ionic strength. Acidosis developed only when the system was open to gases due to the increased CO(2) content, both in its dissociated (bicarbonate) and undissociated form (dissolved CO(2)).

Conclusions

The increase in proton concentration observed after dilution of the extracellular system derives from the reaction of CO(2) hydration, which occurs only when the system is open to the gases. Both Stewart's approach and the traditional approach may account for these results.

### Acid-base homeostasis during hemodialysis: new insights into the mystery of bicarbonate disappearance during treatment [^10dcfc5d]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

In patients receiving hemodialysis, it has long been recognized that much more bicarbonate is delivered during treatment than ultimately appears in the blood. To gain insight into this mystery, we developed a model that allows a quantitative analysis of the patient's response to rapid alkalinization during hemodialysis. Our model is unique in that it is based on the distribution of bicarbonate in the extracellular fluid and assesses its removal from this compartment by mobilization of protons (H +) from buffers and other sources. The model was used to analyze the pattern of rise in blood bicarbonate concentration ([HCO 3 -]), calculated from measurements of pH and PCO 2, in patients receiving standard bicarbonate hemodialysis. Model analysis demonstrated two striking findings: (1) 35% of the bicarbonate added during hemodialysis was due to influx and metabolism of acetate, despite its low concentration in the bath solution, because of the rapidly collapsing gradient for bicarbonate influx. (2) Almost 90% of the bicarbonate delivered to the patients was neutralized by H + generation. Virtually all the new H + came from intracellular sources and included both buffering and organic acid production. The small amount of added bicarbonate retained in the extracellular fluid increased blood [HCO 3 -], on average, by 6 mEq/L in our patients. Almost all this rise occurred during the first 2 hours. Thereafter, blood [HCO 3 -] changed minimally and always remained less than bath [HCO 3 -]. This lack of equilibrium was due to the continued production of organic acid. Release of H + from buffers is a reversible physiological response, restoring body alkali stores. By contrast, organic acid production is an irreversible process during hemodialysis and is metabolically inefficient and potentially catabolic. Our analysis underscores the need to develop new approaches for alkali repletion during hemodialysis that minimize organic acid production.

### 7.5% sodium bicarbonate [^065208a3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy increases plasma bicarbonate, buffers excess hydrogen ion concentration, raises blood pH and reverses the clinical manifestations of acidosis.

Sodium bicarbonate in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and bicarbonate (HCO3¯) ions. Sodium (Na+) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Bicarbonate (HCO3¯) is a normal constituent of body fluids and the normal plasma level ranges from 24 to 31 mEq/liter. Plasma concentration is regulated by the kidney through acidification of the urine when there is a deficit or by alkalinization of the urine when there is an excess. Bicarbonate anion is considered "labile" since at a proper concentration of hydrogen ion (H+) it may be converted to carbonic acid (H2CO3) and thence to its volatile form, carbon dioxide (CO2) excreted by the lung. Normally a ratio of 1:20 (carbonic acid: bicarbonate) is present in the extracellular fluid. In a healthy adult with normal kidney function, practically all the glomerular filtered bicarbonate ion is reabsorbed; less than 1% is excreted in the urine.

### Causes of metabolic acidosis in canine hemorrhagic shock: role of unmeasured ions [^e6464671]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Results

One animal died from myocardial failure during shock induction and two animals dropped out during resuscitation and observation due to premature death, leaving eight dogs for final statistical analysis. Measured and calculated values of the acid-base status throughout the course of the experiment are presented in Table 1. During induction of shock, arterial pH decreased significantly from 7.41 to 7.19. An additional decrease in pH to 7.13 was observed after completion of resuscitation. pH had increased at 30, 60, and 180 minutes after therapy but remained lower than the baseline value. pCO 2 increased transiently at the end of resuscitation and 30 minutes after therapy. It did not show major deviations from baseline at other times of the protocol. Directional changes in base excess were similar to changes in pH. Plasma concentrations of sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium did not show major deviations from the respective baseline values. The plasma concentration of chloride increased significantly 60 and 180 minutes after therapy. Serum lactate increased significantly from 1.5 mEq/L (baseline) to 5.5 mEq/L after shock induction and remained elevated until 30 minutes post-therapy. The SID a decreased significantly after completion of resuscitation and remained so post-therapy. The serum concentration of phosphate did not show major deviations from baseline. Due to hemorrhage and dilution with colloid solutions, the serum concentration of albumin decreased significantly after shock induction and remained decreased 30, 60, and 180 minutes post-therapy. The SID e decreased earlier than the SID a (after induction of shock) and remained significantly decreased until the end of the experiment.

### Electrochemical oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide at practical rates in strong acidic media [^3f396c38]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

A continuous supply of cation solutions in the SE layer could limit the device's real applications due to the following two reasons. First, it could result in a significant consumption of cations as most of them are flowing out of the SE layer and only part of them crossed to the cathode chamber. Second, the generated H 2 O 2 solution in the cathode would be slightly alkaline due to the Na + ion crossover from the SE layer (resulting in slight acidity in the SE layer downstream flow). To further explore the high potential of our SE cell for practical uses, we operated the cell by circulating the cation solution from the SE layer into the cathode side, and then back to the SE layer for H 2 O 2 accumulation. The outlet solution in the middle chamber was mixed with oxygen flow and supplied to the cathode to produce H 2 O 2. Then the as-produced solution containing H 2 O 2 and cations was cycled back into the middle chamber (Fig. 6e). By doing so we could continuously reuse the cations by circulating them back to the SE layer for a closed system without the need for a continuous cation stream supply. Also, the excessive OH − groups generated from the cathode would be neutralized by exactly the same number of excessive protons in the SE layer. Our target is to accumulate the H 2 O 2 concentration to ~5000 ppm in a 250 mL solution (containing only 60 mM of Na +) for each operation cycle via maintaining a 50 mA cm −2 cell current. As shown in Fig. 6f, the H 2 O 2 concentration continuously increased to ~5000 ppm in about 13 h. The cell can be operated for more than 200 h with negligible degradations. During this stability test, a total of 3.7 L 5000 ppm H 2 O 2 solution was obtained. We also observed that, in each operation cycle the H 2 O 2 FE slightly decreases with increased H 2 O 2 concentration, which may be due to the H 2 O 2 self-decomposition, further reductions on the cathode, and/or the crossover oxidation on the anode side. For each operation cycle, the H 2 O 2 concentration can reach up to ~0.15 M, which is 5 times of the Na 2 SO 4 additive in the final product. A higher concentration of H 2 O 2 solutions can also be produced by extending the operation time while maintaining the current and FE. As a result, a high concentration of 20,000 ppm H 2 O 2 solution was achieved in 17 h by circulation of the 50 mL water at the cathode side (Fig. S30). Based on the above promising H 2 O 2 activity, selectivity and especially the durability, and since all the reactor components, including catalysts, membrane, and the polymer SE are all commercially available, our PEM-based H 2 O 2 SE cell with cation promotion effect has a great potential for future's practical applications.

### Cardiovascular effects of hypertonic lactate solutions: acid-base or metabolic cause, or both? [^665d9248]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The first point concerns the confounding acid–base effects secondary to the administration of hypertonic sodium-lactate and sodium-chloride. In the current study, the sodium-lactate and sodium-chloride groups demonstrated significant and substantial differences in pH, chloride, bicarbonate, lactate, and potassium levels. Although the authors stated that there is no hyperchloremic acidosis, we calculated an average difference in the standard base excess of − 7.4 mmol/L (−2.1 versus + 5.3) between the groups. The acid–base difference between groups is virtually entirely — barring a minimal amount of unmeasured anion in the sodium-lactate group — explained by their relative changes in chloride (see supplemental material for full calculation).

As lactate is metabolized, the strong ion difference in the sodium-lactate group rises, whereas the strong ion difference in the sodium-chloride group decreases due to hyperchloremia. This is a problematic confounder because a hypochloremia with metabolic alkalosis has a positive inotropic effect, whereas a hyperchloraemia with metabolic acidosis causes myocardial depression. Thus, the different cardiovascular effects (reflected in a different stroke volume) between these groups may well be attributed to the electrolyte or acid-base properties of the respective solutions. In fact, previous experiments in hemorrhaging canines also demonstrated the superior cardiovascular effects of hypertonic fluids with either acetate or lactate, versus unbalanced hypertonic saline. The metabolization of acetate, another organic anion, also induces alkalosis in a manner similar to that of lactate. The authors found that acetate may have a superior resuscitative profile due to its strong intrinsic vasodilatory properties and capacity to persistently restore oxygen consumption. Moreover, another study in hemorrhaging dogs showed that infused acetate was rapidly metabolized, whereas equivalent lactate loads exceeded the capacity for metabolism and caused a progressive accumulation, worsening the acid–base status and potentially the hemodynamics. These effects are also replicated in clinical studies that compared infusion of saline versus non-lactate balanced crystalloids during surgery and reported similar adverse hemodynamic effects of saline. This suggests that expanding volume with fluids with a higher strong ion difference, rather than a specific energetic or signaling profile of lactate, may be the factor driving differences in cardiovascular effects.

The treatment effect on 6MWD at Week 16 was consistent for various subgroups, including etiology of PH-ILD, disease severity, age, sex, baseline hemodynamics, and dose (Figure 4).

Figure 4:	Forest Plot on Subgroup Analyses of Peak 6MWD (Meter) at Week 16 (PH-ILD)

Time to clinical worsening in the INCREASE study was defined as the time of randomization until 1 of the following criteria were met: hospitalization due to a cardiopulmonary indication, decrease in 6MWD > 15% from baseline directly related to PH-ILD at 2 consecutive visits and at least 24 hours apart, death (all causes), or lung transplantation. Treatment with Tyvaso Inhalation Solution in patients with PH-ILD resulted in numerically fewer hospitalizations. The numbers of reported deaths were the same for both treatment groups (Table 3). Overall, treatment with Tyvaso Inhalation Solution demonstrated a statistically significant increase in the time to first clinical worsening event (log-rank test p = 0.041; Figure 5), and a 39% overall reduction in the risk of a clinical worsening event (HR = 0.61 [95% CI; 0.40, 0.92]; Figure 5).

MRI of Fe-CPNDs

The longitudinal (r 1) and transverse (r 2) relaxivities were measured to examine the feasibility of using Fe-CPNDs as T 1 MRI contrast agents (Fig. 2a). The r 1 and r 2 relaxivities of the Fe-CPNDs are 1.5 and 2.9 mM −1 s −1, respectively, which are comparable to those of reported contrast agents. The values of r 1 and r 2 / r 1 (ca. 1.9) suggest that the Fe-CPNDs can be used as highly efficient T 1 contrast agents. The coordination number of TA (tannic acid) in Fe 3+ –TA n complexes is increased by increasing the solution pH value (that is, the Fe 3+ –TA, Fe 3+ –TA 2 and Fe 3+ –TA 3 complexes dominate at pH < 2, pH = 3–6 and pH > 7, respectively). Because GA is the monomer of TA, GA may also form pH-dependent coordination complexes. For example, three GA molecules can react with one Fe 3+ to form a stable complex (Fe 3+ –GA 3) under physiological conditions. However, Fe 3+ –GA 3 will gradually dissociate in mildly acidic environments, and Fe 3+ –GA n complexes consequently transform from tris-coordination to bis-coordination. The pH value similarly affects the ultraviolet−visible spectra of the as-prepared Fe-CPNDs and Fe 3+ –TA n complexes (Supplementary Fig. 18). The spectral changes of Fe-CPNDs can be attributed to transitions between the mono-, bis- and tris-complex states of Fe 3+ –GA n complexes. The reduced coordination number in mildly acidic conditions could enhance the quantity and the mobility of the coordinated water in the first and second coordination spheres surrounding the Fe paramagnetic centre to further improve the relaxivity. Infrared spectra at different temperatures confirmed the coordinated water in degraded Fe-CPNDs (Supplementary Fig. 19; Supplementary Methods). Furthermore, more CO adsorbed to the Fe-CPNDs at pH 5.0 than at pH 7.4, indicating that the Fe-CPNDs contain more activated Fe 3+ sites at pH 5.0 (Supplementary Fig. 20; Supplementary Methods). As expected, we observed a significant increase in the r 1 value, from 1.4 to 1.9 mM s −1 (Fig. 2b), when the pH was adjusted from 7.4 to 5.0. The MRI contrast, which is activated by the pH value, is beneficial to tumour detection. For instance, the performance of Fe-CPNDs during MRI could greatly improve at the tumour site because tumour tissues are normally more acidic than normal tissues. After incubation at 37 °C for a given period, the absorbance of Fe-CPNDs decreased, and the colour of the solution gradually faded as the solution pH decreased. The results suggest that Fe-CPNDs can degrade (Supplementary Fig. 21). The degradation products were further analysed based on the high-performance liquid chromatography, fast Fourier transfer (FFT) patterns and XPS. The amount of free GA in the solution positively correlated with the incubation time and negatively correlated with the pH value (Supplementary Fig. 22; Supplementary Methods). The XPS spectrum and FFT patterns of Fe-CPNDs display negligible changes after degradation (Supplementary Figs 23 and 24). The results demonstrate that GA molecules gradually dissociated from Fe-CPNDs in mildly acidic environments, and the dissociation of GA did not generate a new crystalline phase.

### Changes in acid-base balance following bolus infusion of 20% albumin solution in humans [^5e68a55d]. Intensive Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate changes in acid-base balance following bolus infusions of a 20% albumin solution.

Design and Setting

Randomized prospective study in a university hospital.

Patients and Participants

Two groups of eight patients each undergoing gynecological surgery.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 0.9% saline or lactated Ringer's solution. At the end of surgery two boluses of 0.5 g/kg body weight of a 20% albumin solution were administered. Arterial blood gases, electrolytes, and total protein were measured. The strong ion difference and the amount of weak plasma acid were calculated. pH and titratable acidity of the 20% albumin solution were determined.

Measurements and Results

The infusion of a 20% albumin solution resulted in a significant decrease in pH from 7.284 to 7.262 in the saline group and from 7.422 to 7.394 in the Ringer's group. In both groups the 20% albumin solution caused an increase in strong ion difference and an increase in the amount of weak plasma acid. The observed changes in serum bicarbonate concentration were in good agreement with the changes in strong ion difference and the amount of weak plasma acid. The 20% albumin solution possessed a pH of 6.95 and a titratable acidity of 8.5 mEq/l.

Conclusions

According to the Stewart approach, the observed changes in acid-base balance are the net result of the two opposing effects of the strong ion difference and the amount of weak plasma acid. Alternatively, the acidifying effect of the 20% albumin solution may stem from the titratable acid content of the solution.

### Crystallization of short-acting and intermediate-acting local anesthetics when mixed with adjuvants: a semiquantitative light microscopy analysis [^3c4b0e0a]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The addition of adjuvants to short-acting local anesthetics (LA) is common practice in clinical routine to speed up block onset and decrease pain on injection. In a previous study, we observed the development of microscopic crystal precipitations after bupivacaine or ropivacaine were mixed with adjuvants; this follow-up study is intended to clarify whether crystallization (A) also occurs in short-acting or intermediate-acting LA-adjuvant mixtures, (B) changes over time, and (C) is associated with the solutions' pH.

Methods

Lidocaine 2%, prilocaine 2%, mepivacaine 2%, procaine 2% and chloroprocaine 2% were individually mixed with clonidine, dexamethasone, dexmedetomidine, epinephrine, fentanyl, morphine or sodium bicarbonate 8.4% in clinically established ratios. For each mixture, we measured initial pH and recorded crystallization patterns at 0, 15, 30 and 60min using a standardized, semiquantitative light microscopy approach.

Results

Lidocaine 2% and mepivacaine 2% plus sodium bicarbonate 8.4%, and mepivacaine 2% plus dexamethasone developed delayed grade 5 crystallization over 1hour. Prilocaine-based, procaine-based and chloroprocaine-based mixtures showed much less pronounced crystallization, with a maximum of grade 2. Initial pH and grade of crystallization showed weak monotonic relationships at time points t 0, t 15 and t 30 (ρ = -0.17, 0.31 and 0.32, (all p > 0.05)) and a moderate relationship time point t 60 (ρ = 0.57 (p = 0.0003)) CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed high grades of crystallization in lidocaine/mepivacaine-bicarbonate and mepivacaine-dexamethasone mixtures, although these were previously considered safe for local, perineural or neuraxial use. Our findings cast particular doubt on the safety of preparing these formulations for later use.

### Secondary responses to altered acid-base status: the rules of engagement [^81b4c8bb]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Each of the four canonical acid-base disorders expresses as a primary change in carbon dioxide tension or plasma bicarbonate concentration followed by a secondary response in the countervailing variable. Quantified empirically, these secondary responses are directional and proportional to the primary changes, run a variable time course, and tend to minimize the impact on body acidity engendered by the primary changes. Absence of an appropriate secondary response denotes the coexistence of an additional acid-base disorder. Here we address the expected magnitude of the secondary response to each cardinal acid-base disorder in humans and offer caveats for judging the appropriateness of each secondary response.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^559dccd3]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Hypertonic sodium solution administration — acute kidney injury (AKI) risk mitigation recommendations are as follows: We suggest that severe hypernatremia and hyperchloremia during treatment with hypertonic sodium solutions should be avoided due to the association with acute kidney injury (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). An upper serum sodium range of 155–160 mEq/L and a serum chloride range of 110–115 mEq/L may be reasonable to decrease the risk of acute kidney injury (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Clinicians should routinely monitor both sodium and chloride serum concentrations to assess risk of AKI related to elevated concentrations (good practice statement), and renal function should be monitored closely in patients receiving hypertonic sodium solutions due to the risk of AKI with hyperosmolar therapy (good practice statement). For monitoring frequency, clinicians should use patient-specific factors with ranging from twice daily to every 2 h based on rapidity of change to interventions.

### Protamine sulfate injection, USP… [^d67bdaa1]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

Protamines are simple proteins of low molecular weight that are rich in arginine and strongly basic. They occur in the sperm of salmon and certain other species of fish. Protamine sulfate occurs as fine white or off-white amorphous or crystalline powder. It is sparingly soluble in water. The pH is between 6. 0 and 7.
0. The cationic hydrogenated protamine at a pH of 6. 8 to
7. 1 reacts with anionic heparin at a pH of 5. 0 to
7. 5 to form an inactive complex. Protamine Sulfate Injection, USP is a sterile, isotonic solution of protamine sulfate. It acts as a heparin antagonist. It is also a weak anticoagulant. Each mL contains: Protamine sulfate 10 mg; sodium chloride 9 mg; Water for Injection q. s. Sulfuric acid and/or dibasic sodium phosphate may have been added for pH adjustment. The preparation is preservative free. Protamine sulfate is administered intravenously. When administered alone, protamine has an anticoagulant effect.

However, when it is given in the presence of heparin, a stable salt is formed and the anticoagulant activity of both drugs is lost. Protamine sulfate has a rapid onset of action. Neutralization of heparin occurs within five minutes after intravenous administration of an appropriate dose of protamine sulfate. Although the metabolic fate of the heparin-protamine complex has not been elucidated, it has been postulated that protamine sulfate in the heparin-protamine complex may be partially metabolized or may be attacked by fibrinolysin, thus freeing heparin. Overdose of protamine sulfate may cause bleeding. Protamine has a weak anticoagulant effect due to an interaction with platelets and with many proteins including fibrinogen. This effect should be distinguished from the rebound anticoagulation that may occur 30 minutes to 18 hours following the reversal of heparin with protamine.

Because heparin disappears rapidly from the circulation, the dose of protamine sulfate required also decreases rapidly with the time elapsed following intravenous injection of heparin. For example, if the protamine sulfate is administered 30 minutes after the heparin, one-half the usual dose may be sufficient. The dosage of protamine sulfate should be guided by blood coagulation studies.

### PH-and concentration-dependent supramolecular assembly of a fungal defensin plectasin variant into helical non-amyloid fibrils [^1f6a307c]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

NMR spectroscopy examination of factors affecting fibrillation

We used real-time NMR spectroscopy to follow the kinetics of PPI42 fibrillation at various pH values at a protein concentration of 1.1 mg/mL (250 µM). Due to their large size and long rotational correlation time, fibrils of PPI42 are not visible in liquid-state NMR, and the time series therefore followed the fraction of monomer over time (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 10). This allowed for an indirect way to follow the kinetics of protein fibrillation based on the integration of the isolated methyl groups of I22 and L36. Both, the fibrillation kinetics and the fraction of monomer in solution at equilibrium were pH-dependent. The pH-responsive fibrillation kinetics showed a transition between pH 6.0 and 7.0 (Fig. 6a), indicative of the titration of a histidine residue playing a role in fibrillation. The titration behaviour of chemical shifts for both protons in the imidazole rings of (H16) and (H18) was therefore determined by 2D 1 H– 1 H TOCSY NMR spectra (Fig. 6b). The pK a for (H16) was around 4.4, while the pK a for (H18) was around 6.4, which corresponds to the pH, where fibril formation was observed. (H18) and (H16) are involved in the hydrophobic interactions on the monomeric interfaces forming the outer hydrophobic ring, which might explain the pH-responsive fibril formation of PPI42 upon sidechain deprotonation (charge reduction). (S21) is involved in the interactions between the two fibrils and showed a similar pH response as (H18), indicating that the helix cap is structurally affected when fibrils are formed. For the plectasin wildtype no pH response of (S21) could be observed (Supplementary Fig. 10). The kinetic progress of fibrillation notably showed sigmoidal behaviour, strongly indicative of the need for an initial nucleation step to facilitate fibril growth. Consequently, fibrillation kinetics were investigated with regards to dependence on seeding and monomer concentration. To a sample of PPI42 freshly diluted into pH 6.75, 5 µL of a previously equilibrated sample in the same condition was added for seeding, which led to vastly accelerated fibrillation (Fig. 6c). This observation supported that a nucleation step occurs in fibril formation. Fibrillation kinetics as followed by NMR at varying protein concentrations at pH 6.75 finally showed that the supramolecular reaction had a strong dependence on protein concentration (Fig. 6d).

### Cromolyn sodium inhalation solution [^75b1775d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Cromolyn Sodium Inhalation Solution Therapy in Relation to Other Treatments for Asthma:

Non-steroidal agents:

Cromolyn sodium inhalation solution should be added to the patient's existing treatment regimen (e.g., bronchodilators). When a clinical response to cromolyn sodium inhalation solution is evident, usually within two to four weeks, and if the asthma is under good control, an attempt may be made to decrease concomitant medication usage gradually.

If concomitant medications are eliminated or required on no more than a prn basis, the frequency of administration of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution may be titrated downward to the lowest level consistent with the desired effect. The usual decrease is from four to three vials per day. It is important that the dosage be reduced gradually to avoid exacerbation of asthma. It is emphasized that in patients whose dosage has been titrated to fewer than four vials per day, an increase in the dose of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution and the introduction of, or increase in, symptomatic medications may be needed if the patient's clinical condition deteriorates.

Corticosteroids:

In patients chronically receiving corticosteroids for the management of bronchial asthma, the dosage should be maintained following the introduction of cromolyn sodium inhalation solution. If the patient improves, an attempt to decrease corticosteroids should be made. Even if the corticosteroid-dependent patient fails to show symptomatic improvement following cromolyn sodium inhalation solution administration, the potential to reduce corticosteroids may nonetheless be present. Thus, gradual tapering of corticosteroid dosage may be attempted. It is important that the dose be reduced slowly, maintaining close supervision of the patient to avoid an exacerbation of asthma.

### Guideline for disinfection and sterilization in healthcare facilities, 2008 [^12a01914]. CDC (2008). Medium credibility.

Sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) disinfectants — In the United States, aqueous solutions of 5.25%–6.15% sodium hypochlorite are described as broad-spectrum, leaving no toxic residues, being unaffected by water hardness, inexpensive and fast acting, removing dried or fixed organisms and biofilms, and having a low incidence of serious toxicity. At the same concentration used in household bleach (5.25–6.15%), adverse effects can include ocular irritation and oropharyngeal, esophageal, and gastric burns. Disadvantages include corrosiveness to metals in high concentrations (> 500 ppm), inactivation by organic matter, fabric bleaching, and release of toxic chlorine gas when mixed with ammonia or acid. The disinfecting efficacy of chlorine decreases with increasing pH as undissociated hypochlorous acid (HOCl) converts to hypochlorite ion (OCl-). Additional hazards include production of bis(chloromethyl) ether when hypochlorite solutions contact formaldehyde and production of trihalomethane when hot water is hyperchlorinated. Environmentally, EPA determined that currently registered hypochlorite uses will not result in unreasonable adverse effects.

### Effects of pH on potassium: new explanations for old observations [^37860d8c]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Maintenance of extracellular K(+) concentration within a narrow range is vital for numerous cell functions, particularly electrical excitability of heart and muscle. Potassium homeostasis during intermittent ingestion of K(+) involves rapid redistribution of K(+) into the intracellular space to minimize increases in extracellular K(+) concentration, and ultimate elimination of the K(+) load by renal excretion. Recent years have seen great progress in identifying the transporters and channels involved in renal and extrarenal K(+) homeostasis. Here we apply these advances in molecular physiology to understand how acid-base disturbances affect serum potassium.

The etiology and pathogenesis of dental caries — Dental caries is a dynamic process at the tooth surface with constant demineralization and remineralization of enamel influenced by bacteria, sugar, saliva, and fluoride; the oral microbiome at the tooth surface is dental plaque, in which aciduric and acidogenic bacteria predominate during disease, with Streptococcus mutans most commonly associated; dietary sugar intake enables selection and proliferation of pathogenic bacteria that ferment sugars, produce acid, decrease plaque pH, and drive demineralization that, if unimpeded, results in cavitation; saliva buffers low pH, flushes food particles, provides calcium and phosphate and antimicrobial proteins, and when salivary flow is impeded the pH decreases further and the time to buffer back to a normal pH is longer, tipping the balance toward demineralization.

### Sodium ion specifically modifies plasma ionized calcium concentration [^ee756667]. American Journal of Nephrology (2002). Low credibility.

Background/Aim

Recently, we observed a progressive decline in the plasma ionized calcium (iCa) concentration after ingestion of Na-free beverage. Although both plasma pH and Na significantly correlated with iCa, the correlation of the latter was stronger than that of the former. Therefore, we explored the effect of Na on plasma iCa.

Methods

Pooled human plasma was diluted with normal saline, 5% glucose, 0.9% KCl, or distilled water to examine the effect of plasma dilution on iCa. Also, to evaluate the effects of an isovolemic increase in ion concentration and osmolarity on plasma iCa, NaCl, KCl, and D-glucose were added to plasma. Electrolytes (Na(+), K(+), Cl(-), iCa, HCO(-)(3)), pH, and osmolarity were measured by using ion-selective electrodes.

Results

In the plasma dilution study, although all solutions significantly decreased the iCa concentration, the decrease in iCa concentration in the normal saline treated solution was significantly lower than in others. When the plasma osmolarity was isovolemically increased, the iCa concentration significantly increased in parallel with the increase in osmolarity in the NaCl group (r = 0.604, p < 0.01, n = 50). In contrast, no significant change in the iCa concentration was seen in the other solutions. NaCl did not increase, but rather decreased the iCa concentration when added to a protein-free solution.

Conclusion

The present study demonstrated that Na specifically affects plasma iCa independently of pH, presumably via modulating Ca binding to plasma proteins.

### A genetically encoded single-wavelength sensor for imaging cytosolic and cell surface ATP [^e54e6d24]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

pH sensitivity of iATPSnFR 1.0 and mRuby-iATPSnFR 1.0

As with all GFP-based sensors, the fluorescence of iATPSnFRs is expected to be sensitive to pH with a H + dependence largely determined by GFP. We performed a specific set of experiments to assess this as a guide for future use of the sensors. We focused on iATPSnFR 1.0, because this was used for most of the work reported in this study. First, we measured the fluorescence of extracellularly displayed iATPSnFR 1.0 on the surface of HEK293 cells at a range of pH values between 4 and 9 in the absence and presence of ATP (Fig. 7a). As expected, acidification strongly decreased fluorescence of the ATP bound and unbound states. Between pH 6.5 and 9, there was a strong increase in fluorescence upon binding ATP. Second, we repeated the aforementioned experiments with iATPSnFR 1.0 in solution (from bacterial lysates). We found the same effect with acidification for the ATP bound and unbound states (Fig. 7b). Third, we performed similar experiments for the mRuby-iATPSnFR 1.0 sensor in solution (from bacterial lysates) while assessing fluorescence emission in the green ATP sensor channel and in the reference red mRuby channel (Fig. 7c, d). For the ATP sensors, we again found that acidification decreased fluorescence of the ATP bound and unbound states. mRuby pH effects were not ATP-dependent, indicating that mRuby-iATPSnFR 1.0 can be used as a ratiometric sensor (Fig. 7c, d). Fourth, we performed ATP dose–response curves for iATPSnFR 1.0 and mRuby-iATPSnFR 1.0 in solution at pH 6.4 and 7.4 (Fig. 7e, f). These data showed that acidification decreased fluorescence responses at all concentrations of ATP that were effective in increasing fluorescence. Overall, taken together these data show that iATPSnFR 1.0 and mRuby-iATPSnFR 1.0 function as single wavelength and ratiometric ATP sensors, but do indeed display sensitivity to acid pH as expected by the nature of GFP. Perhaps more usefully, the calibration curves shown in Fig. 7 provide a metric by which to judge the consequences of acidification in future experiments in which the sensors are used. The sensors are likely to be of limited use in environments where the pH is more acidic than ~6.2. Finally, we assessed the kinetics for ATP binding to iATPSnFR 1.0 in solution at pH 7.4 and found that they did not follow typical pseudo-first order behavior (Supplementary Figure 8), but were instead consistent with a mechanism in which both higher and lower fluorescent states occur (potentially resulting from monomeric and dimeric states). This possibility could be usefully explored in follow up studies.

### Strong ion difference in urine: new perspectives in acid-base assessment [^04efc178]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

The plasmatic strong ion difference (SID) is the difference between positively and negatively charged strong ions. At pH 7.4, temperature 37 degrees C and partial carbon dioxide tension 40 mmHg, the ideal value of SID is 42 mEq/l. The buffer base is the sum of negatively charged weak acids ([HCO3(-)], [A-], [H2PO4(-)]) and its normal value is 42 mEq/l. According to the law of electroneutrality, the amount of positive and negative charges must be equal, and therefore the SID value is equal to the buffer base value. The easiest assessment of metabolic acidosis/alkalosis relies on the base excess calculation: buffer base(actual) - buffer base(ideal) = SID(actual) - SID(ideal). The SID approach allows one to appreciate the relationship between acid-base and electrolyte equilibrium from a unique perspective, and here we describe a comprehensive model of this equilibrium. The extracellular volume is characterized by a given SID, which is a function of baseline conditions, endogenous and exogenous input (endogenous production and infusion), and urinary output. Of note, volume modifications vary the concentration of charges in the solution. An expansion of extracellular volume leads to acidosis (SID decreases), whereas a contraction of extracellular volume leads to alkalosis (SID increases). A thorough understanding of acid-base equilibrium mandates recognition of the importance of urinary SID.

### Sodium bicarbonate [^3f533989]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy increases plasma bicarbonate, buffers excess hydrogen ion concentration, raises blood pH and reverses the clinical manifestations of acidosis.

Sodium bicarbonate in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) ions. Sodium (Na+) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Bicarbonate (HCO3-) is a normal constituent of body fluids and the normal plasma level ranges from 24 to 31 mEq/liter. Plasma concentration is regulated by the kidney through acidification of the urine when there is a deficit or by alkalinization of the urine when there is an excess. Bicarbonate anion is considered "labile" since at a proper concentration of hydrogen ion (H+) it may be converted to carbonic acid (H2CO3) and thence to its volatile form, carbon dioxide (CO2) excreted by the lung. Normally a ratio of 1:20 (carbonic acid: bicarbonate) is present in the extracellular fluid. In a healthy adult with normal kidney function, practically all the glomerular filtered bicarbonate ion is reabsorbed; less than 1% is excreted in the urine.

Healthy housing — acid water corrosion (Table 8.6) uses "Colorimetric field titrametric tests for acidity, pH, and carbon dioxide (pH is determined at the titration end point)", with thresholds that "A pH below 6.5 causes corrosion" and "Carbon dioxide should be less than 10 mg/L Or less than 5 mg/L if alkalinity is less than 100 ppm"; corrective actions are that "Soda ash solution is fed into the well or suction line of a pump. May be fed along with chlorine solution. Limestone chips (calcite) neutralize the water by increasing its alkalinity and hardness".

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2020 ISPD practice recommendations for prescribing high-quality goal-directed peritoneal dialysis [^137d739b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Residual kidney function in peritoneal dialysis (PD) — "The amount of kidney function that continues to remove waste products and the remaining urine volume should be known for all individuals doing PD. Management should focus on preserving this as long as possible". The work group suggests residual kidney function "be measured as the average of the 24-hour urinary urea and creatinine clearances", with tracking of "urine volume in milliliters per 24 hours" if full measurement is not feasible, and they recommend evaluating it "as practical under individual circumstances because there is no evidence for the ideal frequency of evaluation". For preservation, "Several clinical trials support the recommendations for the use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker and neutral-pH low glucose degradation product PD solutions", and "other recommendations such as the use of volume diuretics and icodextrin as needed to maintain euvolemia while avoiding volume depletion" are noted albeit with "evidence that is more limited". Modality choice "(CAPD vs APD) should be based on individual choice because there is no consistent evidence that one preserves residual kidney function better than the other", aminoglycosides — "it is advisable to limit their use to less than 3 weeks to prevent ototoxicity", and "there are no studies that have shown an association of contrast administration with a sustained decrease in residual kidney function in people receiving PD". Clinical utility is emphasized because residual kidney function has been associated with "longer survival; better control of volume and BP, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and hyperphosphatemia; lower probability of protein-energy wasting, inflammation, and peritonitis; and increased clearance of middle molecules and protein-bound uremic solutes", and recognizing it "allows for a potential decrease in the PD prescription, which would likely mean less treatment burden for the person on PD". Implementation challenges include dependence on collecting "a 24-hour urine sample" and that "neutral-pH low glucose degradation product PD solutions are not commercially available and use of icodextrin is restricted by some dialysis provider organizations in the United States".
