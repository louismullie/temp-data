## Question

What specific pulmonary assessment skills do RTs utilize in the initial stabilization of patients in respiratory failure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the specific pulmonary assessment skills that respiratory therapists (RTs) utilize during the initial stabilization of patients in respiratory failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the RT's scope and immediate priorities in acute respiratory failure. Then, I should verify the core bedside assessment domains and how they map to decision-making. Next, I will examine advanced monitoring and ventilator-specific competencies, including waveform analysis and lung-protective targets. After that, I need to consider special populations and noninvasive support strategies. Finally, I should integrate team-based protocols, documentation, and quality metrics to ensure the assessment translates into improved outcomes.

> Let me first confirm the RT's role and the initial stabilization frame. RTs are credentialed professionals specializing in pulmonary assessment and therapeutics, including oxygen, aerosol therapy, and noninvasive and invasive ventilation; in acute respiratory failure, their initial assessment must be rapid, structured, and protocolized to guide escalation or de-escalation decisions and to align with lung-protective strategies and early mobilization principles where appropriate [^113FPCbz] [^113woDFU] [^115sZEWa].

> I will now examine the primary survey and airway-breathing-circulation priorities. Wait, let me verify the essentials: mental status using AVPU, airway patency with jaw thrust or head-tilt chin-lift as indicated, breathing rate/pattern/effort including retractions and accessory muscle use, and circulation with pulse quality and skin signs; these elements establish immediate severity and the need for emergent airway or ventilatory support and are foundational to RT-led stabilization algorithms [^115cyxtF].

> Next, I should review respiratory mechanics and pattern assessment. I need to ensure I capture respiratory rate, depth, regularity, and work of breathing, because tachypnea, shallow respirations, paradoxical motion, or asynchronous efforts signal impending failure; accurate monitoring of these parameters enables early recognition and intervention, and should be documented serially to trend deterioration or response to therapy [^115mukEq].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach to dyspnea in mechanically ventilated patients. Even in intubated patients, RTs can and should assess dyspnea using simple, feasible protocols at the bedside; asking "Are you short of breath right now?" and grading severity yields patient-centered data that can inform ventilator adjustments, sedation optimization, and asynchrony management, and should be embedded in routine 4-hour assessments when feasible [^114us9qK] [^114UxH1c].

> Let me consider gas exchange and oxygenation assessment. Pulse oximetry provides continuous noninvasive monitoring, but I should double-check that SpO₂ is interpreted in the clinical context and that FiO₂ is recorded to estimate oxygen requirements; when ABGs are unavailable, the SpO₂/FiO₂ ratio can substitute for PaO₂/FiO₂ to risk-stratify hypoxemia, and any increase in oxygen requirement should trigger urgent reassessment and repeat blood gas analysis when available [^111uzeny] [^116PnC3M].

> I need to check ventilator-specific assessments next. Per the AARC patient-ventilator assessment guideline, RTs should measure and document plateau pressure to ensure lung protection, verify tidal volume as 4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight, assess PEEP and auto-PEEP, and consider driving pressure. They should also evaluate FiO₂ to target normoxemia and document settings in PBW-based units, with bedside assessment preferred over telemonitoring when resources allow [^113woDFU].

> But wait, what if the ventilator waveforms reveal asynchrony that worsens work of breathing? RTs must interpret pressure, flow, and volume waveforms to detect trigger asynchrony, ineffective efforts, double triggering, and flow starvation; structured training improves waveform recognition and should be reinforced early in practice, as asynchrony can increase sedation needs, prolong ventilation, and worsen outcomes if uncorrected [^1122ZuaC].

> Next, I should review noninvasive support strategies and their monitoring. For acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, high-flow nasal oxygen is often favored over NIV, whereas NIV remains first-line for hypercapnic COPD exacerbations. In either case, RTs must closely monitor respiratory drive, effort, and tolerance, and be prepared to escalate promptly if deterioration occurs, recognizing that delayed intubation after NIV failure increases harm [^114jwiAB] [^114Yi1bP] [^113GYteG].

> Let me think about special populations where my assessment must adapt. In neuromuscular disease, I should confirm that cough strength, bulbar function, and ventilatory reserve are assessed because these predict NIV success and airway protection needs. In obesity hypoventilation syndrome, I should verify that baseline nocturnal monitoring guides PAP initiation and that early follow-up ensures adherence and efficacy. In COPD, I should confirm risk factors for NIV failure and be ready to adjust interface, settings, or escalate to intubation if pH falls or mental status worsens despite optimized NIV [^113hM34f] [^113kTciT] [^114Yi1bP].

> I should confirm that my assessment integrates with team-based protocols and documentation. RT-driven readiness screens, spontaneous breathing trials, and sedation-minimization pathways reduce ventilator days and improve outcomes; standardized documentation of ventilator parameters, sedation level, and patient-ventilator interaction supports protocol fidelity and enables quality audits and feedback loops [^113ATuwM] [^113woDFU] [^1118bXJj].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am aligning with performance measures and safety targets. For ARDS, lung-protective ventilation with low tidal volumes, limitation of plateau pressures, and early prone positioning for severe cases are core measures; RTs operationalize these at the bedside, track adherence, and adjust therapy to meet evolving targets, which directly correlates with improved survival and ventilator-free days [^114KHeYq] [^112dDD7E].

> Let me reconsider the role of advanced monitoring when conventional strategies fail. Esophageal manometry, echocardiography, and electrical impedance tomography can refine PEEP titration, recruitment maneuvers, and hemodynamic coupling in refractory hypoxemia; RTs are integral to executing these maneuvers safely and interpreting real-time data within lung rescue frameworks [^1144yKdP].

> Finally, I should double-check that my assessment plan includes education and communication. For mechanically ventilated patients with limited communication, augmentative tools and family engagement improve symptom assessment and shared decision-making; embedding these practices into routine RT workflows enhances patient-centered care and may reduce sedation exposure and delirium [^114UxH1c].

Respiratory therapists (RTs) use a **structured, rapid assessment** approach in respiratory failure, prioritizing airway patency, breathing pattern, and circulation [^115cyxtF]. Key skills include: assessing mental status and work of breathing; measuring respiratory rate, depth, and effort; auscultating breath sounds; monitoring SpO₂ and end-tidal CO₂; interpreting ABGs; and evaluating ventilator waveforms for asynchrony [^115mukEq] [^1122ZuaC]. RTs also perform rapid point-of-care lung ultrasound to detect pneumothorax, effusions, or consolidation; assess cough strength and secretion clearance; and apply validated tools (e.g. HACOR) to predict NIV failure [^114Nv7VW] [^112B9xxC]. These assessments guide immediate interventions — oxygen, NIV, or intubation — and are repeated frequently to detect deterioration early and adjust therapy [^113GYteG] [^115mukEq].

---

## Airway assessment

- **Airway patency**: RTs quickly assess for obstruction, stridor, or foreign body, using jaw thrust, head tilt-chin lift, oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal airways, and bag-mask ventilation as needed [^115cyxtF].

- **Mental status**: AVPU (Alert, Voice, Pain, Unresponsive) guides airway protection and the need for intubation [^notfound].

- **Cough strength**: Assessed to gauge airway clearance and aspiration risk, influencing intubation decisions [^113hM34f].

---

## Breathing assessment

- **Respiratory rate and pattern**: Tachypnea, bradypnea, irregular patterns, or agonal respirations indicate severity and guide escalation [^115cyxtF].

- **Work of breathing**: Retractions, nasal flaring, accessory muscle use, and paradoxical motion signal increased effort and impending fatigue [^115cyxtF].

- **Breath sounds**: Auscultation identifies wheeze, crackles, stridor, or diminished sounds, guiding diagnosis and therapy [^115cyxtF].

- **Pulse oximetry**: Continuous SpO₂ monitoring tracks oxygenation and response to therapy [^113kTciT].

- **End-tidal CO₂**: Noninvasive capnography detects hypoventilation, airway obstruction, or ventilator disconnects [^notfound].

---

## Circulation and perfusion assessment

During circulation and perfusion assessment, **heart rate and rhythm** are monitored to detect tachycardia, bradycardia, or arrhythmias that may reflect hypoxemia or acidosis. Skin color and temperature are assessed for cyanosis, pallor, or mottling, which indicate hypoperfusion or hypoxemia [^115cyxtF].

---

## Gas exchange and ventilatory support assessment

- **Arterial blood gases (ABGs)**: RTs interpret pH, PaCO₂, PaO₂, HCO₃⁻, and lactate to classify respiratory failure and guide ventilatory support [^1118bXJj] [^111KHUFy].

- **Ventilator waveforms**: Analysis of pressure, flow, and volume waveforms identifies asynchrony, leaks, or obstructed airways, enabling rapid correction [^1122ZuaC].

- **Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) monitoring**: RTs assess comfort, mask fit, leaks, and response to NIV, using clinical judgment and tools like the HACOR score to predict failure [^112B9xxC] [^113GYteG].

---

## Advanced diagnostic tools

Lung ultrasound is a **point-of-care tool** used to rapidly detect pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or consolidation, guiding interventions [^114Nv7VW]. Chest X-ray is interpreted to identify pneumonia, ARDS, or barotrauma and to direct management [^notfound].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

In COPD exacerbations, RTs assess for **dynamic hyperinflation, auto-PEEP, and secretion retention**, and initiate NIV when indicated [^113woDFU]. In ARDS, they evaluate for refractory hypoxemia and consider prone positioning or ECMO [^114KHeYq]. In neuromuscular disease, they assess cough strength, bulbar function, and ventilatory drive to decide on NIV or invasive ventilation [^111fh2eW].

---

## Documentation and communication

RTs **document all findings, interventions, and responses** to enable continuity and quality improvement. They communicate with the multidisciplinary team to coordinate care and escalate as needed [^1118bXJj].

Despite the fact that physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists share a common training in scientific evidence and frequently share a common understanding of the evidence, debates occur about the proper management of individual patients. Clinicians may interpret this as a failure of evidence-based medicine, when, in fact, evidence is only one of many factors that play a role in clinical decision-making. By clearly understanding the other factors that affect clinical decision making-prior beliefs about treatment effectiveness, patient and clinician values, and clinical expertise-clinicians can better understand which clinical disagreements are about scientific evidence and which are about other factors.

### Monitoring patients with acute respiratory failure during non-invasive respiratory support to minimize harm and identify treatment failure [^113FYAsY]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Non-invasive respiratory support (NRS), including high flow nasal oxygen therapy, continuous positive airway pressure and non-invasive ventilation, is a cornerstone in the management of critically ill patients who develop acute respiratory failure (ARF). Overall, NRS reduces the work of breathing and relieves dyspnea in many patients with ARF, sometimes avoiding the need for intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation with variable efficacy across diverse clinical scenarios. Nonetheless, prolonged exposure to NRS in the presence of sustained high respiratory drive and effort can result in respiratory muscle fatigue, cardiovascular collapse, and impaired oxygen delivery to vital organs, leading to poor outcomes in patients who ultimately fail NRS and require intubation. Assessment of patients' baseline characteristics before starting NRS, close physiological monitoring to evaluate patients' response to respiratory support, adjustment of device settings and interface, and, most importantly, early identification of failure or of paramount importance to avoid the negative consequences of delayed intubation. This review highlights the role of respiratory monitoring across various modalities of NRS in patients with ARF including dyspnea, general respiratory parameters, measures of drive and effort, and lung imaging. It includes technical specificities related to the target population and emphasizes the importance of clinicians' physiological understanding and tailoring clinical decisions to individual patients' needs.

### Long-term noninvasive ventilation in chronic stable hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1167dJQh]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is used for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic hypercapnia. However, evidence for clinical efficacy and optimal management of therapy is limited. Target Audience: Patients with COPD, clinicians who care for them, and policy makers. Methods: We summarized evidence addressing five PICO (patients, intervention, comparator, and outcome) questions. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach was used to evaluate the certainty in evidence and generate actionable recommendations. Recommendations were formulated by a panel of pulmonary and sleep physicians, respiratory therapists, and methodologists using the Evidence-to-Decision framework. Recommendations: 1) We suggest the use of nocturnal NIV in addition to usual care for patients with chronic stable hypercapnic COPD (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty); 2) we suggest that patients with chronic stable hypercapnic COPD undergo screening for obstructive sleep apnea before initiation of long-term NIV (conditional recommendation, very low certainty); 3) we suggest not initiating long-term NIV during an admission for acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, favoring instead reassessment for NIV at 2–4 weeks after resolution (conditional recommendation, low certainty); 4) we suggest not using an in-laboratory overnight polysomnogram to titrate NIV in patients with chronic stable hypercapnic COPD who are initiating NIV (conditional recommendation, very low certainty); and 5) we suggest NIV with targeted normalization of Pa CO2 in patients with hypercapnic COPD on long-term NIV (conditional recommendation, low certainty). Conclusions: This expert panel provides evidence-based recommendations addressing the use of NIV in patients with COPD and chronic stable hypercapnic respiratory failure.

Key objectives and outcomes for ML in respiratory failure

Part of the discussion focused on what respiratory outcomes are most critical. Panelists agreed that predicting emergence and progression of respiratory failure would be the most 'actionable'. Specifically, panelists identified that the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation was a critical outcome of interest. However, initiation of high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and/or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) was also felt to be important, particularly if these therapies require transfer to the ICU. Local practice varies, as some centers require ICU transfer for initiation of therapy whereas others have intermediate care units which allow for these oxygen delivery modalities. The considerable variation across centers did not appear to be data driven but rather reflected local/regional practices and experiences, perhaps emphasizing the need for further study to inform such decisions. Additional potential outcomes of interest for future studies included both patient-related and health system-related. Relevant patient related outcomes may include mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay (LOS), and tracheostomy rates among others. For the health system, in addition to some parallel outcomes of interest (e.g. ICU LOS), system related outcomes such as cost, and resource utilization may also be of interest.

The panel also discussed several priorities for predictive analytics in the respiratory failure. Panelists emphasized the important impact of early knowledge of a patient's likelihood of respiratory failure progression [e.g. nasal cannula (NC) to HFNC to IMV]. Providing advanced warning is most useful when it gives clinicians enough lead time to collect and interpret focused diagnostics and potentially intervene to prevent deterioration. There was debate regarding the optimal prediction horizon length (the time frame in which the outcome could occur or when prediction should apply), but most agreed that a 12 to 24-hours before the onset of respiratory failure would be a useful window to implement preventative strategies. This time frame would also allow the design of randomized controlled trials to test interventions to prevent progression of respiratory failure.

Another key element is clinical collaboration and incorporating appropriate risk thresholds that are important to clinical decision-making. For example, working with clinicians to identify appropriate risk thresholds for notification is crucial. This approach helps notify clinicians only at thresholds they believe to be clinically important, avoiding alarm fatigue and over-notification.

Methods

This retrospective study used electronic medical records from Allegheny Health Network (AHN) as the primary data source. The patient population included in this study consisted of individuals whose information was already shared as part of the existing vendor contract between AHN and the Lifeline PR Program (Lifeline) when a patient is referred for PR.

Study population

This study included patients who were evaluated at an AHN clinic (69% seen at post-COVID clinic and 21% from other clinics), determined to have PASC based on European Respiratory Society guidelines, and subsequently referred to Lifeline. To be included in the study, patients were required to be ≥ 18 years old and diagnosed with "History of COVID-19 infection", "Post-COVID syndrome", "Long COVID", or any synonymous diagnoses. There were no explicit exclusion criteria.

Pulmonary rehabilitation program

Our study partnered with Lifeline Physical Therapy and Pulmonary Rehabilitation Centers to deliver a comprehensive post-COVID-19 recovery program. The program consists of an orientation session, initial assessments by physical and respiratory therapists, and a risk assessment to develop a personalized care plan. It emphasizes a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating goals to improve activities of daily living, functional abilities, strength, endurance, and self-management skills. The rehabilitation schedule typically spans three months, with sessions held two to three times a week, available through in-facility, telehealth, and a hybrid mode. The program concludes with an evaluation to assess progress and provide patients with ongoing recommendations and a certificate of completion, ensuring a tailored and patient-centric rehabilitation journey.

### Competencies needed by graduate respiratory therapists in 2015 and beyond [^114wLHrn]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

The American Association for Respiratory Care has established a task force to identify potential new roles and responsibilities of respiratory therapists (RTs) in 2015 and beyond. The first task force conference confirmed that the healthcare system in the United States is on the verge of dramatic change, driven by the need to decrease costs and improve quality. Use of evidence-based protocols that follow a nationally accepted standard of practice, and application of biomedical innovation continue to be important competency areas for RTs. The goal of the second task force conference was to identify specific competencies needed to assure safe and effective execution of RT roles and responsibilities in the future. The education needed by the workforce to assume the new responsibilities emerging as the healthcare system changes starts with a close look at the competencies that will be needed by graduate RTs upon entry into practice. Future specialty practice areas for experienced RTs are identified without defining specific competencies. We present the findings of the task force on the competencies needed by graduate RTs upon entry into practice in 2015.

### Pulmonary care for ALS: progress, gaps, and paths forward [^1116nMGw]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). Medium credibility.

4.2 ∣ Initiation and monitoring of respiratory support

Inconsistent pulmonary engagement has caused many ALS clinics to develop processes for prescribing NIV in the absence of an engaged pulmonologist. Anecdotally, and as indicated earlier, NIV for patients seen at ALS centers in the US often is initiated when a neurologist submits a prescription to a DME company for in-home set-up by a respiratory therapist. Initial device settings may unintentionally cause discomfort and interrupt sleep. Thereafter, several successive, frequent iterations during outpatient visits may be necessary to attain NIV settings which both: (a) provide restorative sleep, and (b) normalize nocturnal gas exchange.

An elective inpatient admission for NIV settings titration would suffice to avoid some of the pitfalls of the initiation process; however, current US payor guidelines necessitate a qualifying acute decompensation diagnosis for hospital admission. Unfortunately, some patients are initiated on nocturnal NIV only after acute respiratory failure leads to intensive care unit (ICU) admission. If the patient is fortunate enough to survive without a tracheostomy, then NIV is prescribed upon hospital discharge. In Europe, ALS patients starting NIV commonly undergo a 3- to 7-day inpatient admission for nocturnal settings titration. One US study suggested that elective inpatient NIV initiation may be effective for ALS patients with chronic hypercapnia.

4.3 ∣ Gaps in care

Technological advancements over the last two decades have produced several proprietary devices, software, and treatment algorithms that have created a new pulmonary niche focused on the outpatient management of chronic respiratory failure. Meanwhile, specialist training has struggled to maintain pace with the latest home respiratory care capabilities. With the birth of a new specialty combined with a dearth of master clinicians, several critical gaps have surfaced in the home respiratory care of ALS.

### Outcomes of patients with do-not-intubate orders treated with noninvasive ventilation [^114x5kjp]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether diagnosis and bedside observations predict outcomes of patients who have declined intubation but accept noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) to treat their respiratory failure.

Design

Prospective multiple-center cohort trial.

Setting

Two teaching hospitals and two community-based hospitals in southeastern New England from January through October 1999.

Patients

All patients receiving NPPV for acute respiratory failure were screened and enrolled if they had a written do-not-intubate (DNI) order.

Interventions

Patients were begun on NPPV with mean inspiratory and expiratory pressures of 13.4 ± 0.3 and 5.0 ± 1 cm H2O, respectively. Respiratory therapists recorded demographic information, blood gases, and ventilator type and settings, and they made bedside assessments of cough strength, presence of airway secretions, awake state, and agitation. Patients were followed until discharge for duration of NPPV, survival status, and disposition.

Measurements and Main Results

Of 1,211 screened patients, 114 had a DNI status and were enrolled into the study. Of these, 49 (43%) survived to discharge. Age, gender, location in a community vs. teaching hospital, and initial pH and PaO2 did not affect survival, but a higher baseline PaCO2 was associated with a favorable odds ratios for survival to discharge. Diagnosis was an important determinant of survival, with congestive heart failure patients having significantly better survival rates than those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, pneumonia, or other diagnoses. A stronger cough and being awake were also associated with increased probability of survival.

Conclusion

Patients with respiratory failure and a DNI status have a high overall mortality rate when treated with NPPV, but those with diagnoses such as congestive heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who have a strong cough, or who are awake have better prognoses. These data should be useful when counseling DNI patients and their families on use of NPPV.

### Development of a lung rescue team to improve care of subjects with refractory acute respiratory failure [^1144yKdP]. Respiratory Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

A lung-protective mechanical ventilation strategy has become the hallmark of ventilation management for patients with acute respiratory failure. However, some patients progress to more severe forms of acute respiratory failure with refractory hypoxemia. In such circumstances, individualized titration of mechanical ventilation according to the patient's specific respiratory and cardiovascular pathophysiology is desirable. A lung rescue team (LRT) was recently established at our institution to improve the medical care of patients with acute respiratory failure when conventional treatment fails. The aim of this report is to describe the consultation processes, the cardiopulmonary assessment, and the procedures of the LRT.

Methods

This was a retrospective review of the LRT management of patients with acute respiratory failure and refractory hypoxemia at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. The LRT is composed of a critical care physician, the ICU respiratory therapist on duty, the ICU nurse on duty, and 2 critical care fellows. In the LRT approach, respiratory mechanics are evaluated through lung recruitment maneuvers and decremental PEEP trials by means of 3 tools: esophageal manometry, echocardiography, and electrical impedance tomography lung imaging.

Results

The LRT was consulted 89 times from 2014 to 2019 for evaluation and management of severely critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure and refractory hypoxemia on mechanical ventilation. The LRT was requested a median of 2 (interquartile range 1–6) d after intubation to optimize mechanical ventilation and to titrate PEEP in 77 (86%) subjects, to manage ventilation in 8 (9%) subjects on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and to manage weaning strategy from mechanical ventilation in 4 (5%) subjects. The LRT found consolidations with atelectasis responsive to recruitment maneuvers in 79% (n = 70) of consultations. The LRT findings translated into a change of care in 81% (n = 72) of subjects.

Conclusions

The LRT individualized the management of severe acute respiratory failure. The LRT consultations were shown to be effective, safe, and efficient, with an impact on decision-making in the ICU.

### The role of respiratory management of Pompe disease [^113nMDky]. Respiratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Respiratory failure is an unavoidable event in the natural history of some neuromuscular diseases, while appearing very infrequently in others. In some cases, such as Pompe disease, respiratory failure progresses more rapidly than motor impairment, sometimes being the onset event. Home mechanical ventilation improves survival and quality of life of these patients, with a reduction in healthcare costs. Therefore, pulmonologists must improve their skills in order to play a more relevant role in the care of these patients. The aim of this statement is to provide pulmonologists with some simple information in order for them to fulfil their role of primary caregiver, enabling appropriate and rapid diagnosis and treatment.

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113kTciT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

PAP initiation and follow-up in OHS — titration, monitoring, and adherence: The consensus opinion is that PAP should be titrated based on the individual's overnight respiratory monitoring, with, as a minimum, overnight monitoring including continuous oximetry; the use of only empiric settings for initial PAP in patients with OHS without guidance of overnight physiological assessment is not ideal. Once PAP treatment is established, patients should receive standardized education and training with early (4–8 wk) follow-up to assess clinical and physiological response, and follow-up should include monitoring objective adherence because higher rates of adherence to PAP are associated with superior control of respiratory failure in OHS. Among patients with eucapnic obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), telemonitoring and educational support have improved adherence to PAP, but no such data exist in OHS; guidance on the use of ventilator-derived data in eucapnic OSA on PAP can be reasonably extrapolated to OHS.

### A dyspnea evaluation protocol for respiratory therapists: a feasibility study [^114us9qK]. Respiratory Care (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

We tested the feasibility of incorporating a dyspnea evaluation protocol into bedside assessments routinely performed by respiratory therapists (RTs) on mechanically ventilated patients at a university teaching hospital.

Methods

A dyspnea assessment protocol was incorporated into the RT assessments performed at 4-hour intervals on endotracheally intubated, mechanically ventilated patients in our medical and surgical intensive care units. RTs were asked to inquire of all responsive patients: "Are you feeling short of breath right now?" and, if yes, "Is your shortness of breath mild, moderate, or severe?" We analyzed 324 consecutive patient ventilator flow sheets from 77 medical and 161 surgical intensive care unit patients.

Results

Dyspnea scores were recorded during 1,870 of 2,539 scheduled RT patient assessments. The protocol compliance rate was 74%. Patients were sufficiently responsive to answer the protocol questions during 32.1% of the bedside assessments. Dyspnea was recorded in 11% (67/600) of those encounters. Dyspnea was described most often as mild.

Conclusions

Initial implementation of a dyspnea evaluation protocol was moderately successful in prompting RTs to ask mechanically ventilated patients whether they felt short of breath during scheduled bedside visits. A rapid bedside evaluation for dyspnea may prove useful in evaluating the effect on patient distress of implementing protocols designed to optimize ventilator settings or the use of sedating drugs during mechanical ventilation. By this approach RTs may also be able to promote a patient-centered approach to managing respiratory failure in the intensive care unit.

### Pulmonary care for ALS: progress, gaps, and paths forward [^117HwuwK]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). Medium credibility.

4.3.6 ∣ Lack of formal education

The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education stipulates that pulmonary and critical care fellows demonstrate competence in the management of outpatients with chronic respiratory failure with neuromuscular disorders. However, most fellowship exposure to this topic includes acute respiratory failure in the ICU. ALS patients admitted to an ICU are at high risk of undergoing tracheostomy before being transferred to a long-term care facility, which is typically devoid of pulmonary trainees. In the outpatient setting, few centers around the country have designated home ventilation clinics that concentrate patients among a handful of invested experts. Among those few centers, a fraction include a pulmonologist in their ALS clinic.

Guidelines on the respiratory care of ALS focus heavily on thresholds for initiating noninvasive ventilation. Few studies have addressed the subsequent (and meticulous) steps involved in tailoring the NIV devices and their myriad of settings to deliver effective, comfortable ventilation. Most of the evidence guiding best practices is based on expert opinion, with few clinical trials in the pipeline.

The absence of a formal educational curriculum, fellowship program, or guidelines has created a critical knowledge gap among pulmonologists for managing respiratory complications of neuromuscular disease. Neurologists have recognized this gap. In being dedicated to their patients, neurologists have learned to identify and address early respiratory insufficiency in ALS. Depending on local center expertise, neurologists may hesitate to refer to pulmonologists until advanced respiratory failure, when NIV seems intolerable and tracheostomy appears imminent.

### Improved outcomes with routine respiratory therapist evaluation of non-intensive-care-unit surgery patients [^113LaLnh]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Respiratory therapist (RT) driven protocols decrease ventilator days and resource utilization in the intensive care unit (ICU). Protocols have been studied in non-ICU settings, but their effect on mortality has been incompletely studied.

Methods

In our neurosurgery step-down, trauma/surgery step-down, and trauma/surgery general units we initiated an RT-driven evaluate-and-treat protocol that included a standardized, quantitative, RT-driven patient-assessment scale and protocolized interventions. Before and after initiation of the protocol we collected data on non-ICU patients at risk for pulmonary complications.

Results

The patient groups before (n = 2,230) and after (n = 2,805) protocol initiation were well matched in age, sex, Charlson score, and admitting service. Most of the patients, whether assessed by a physician or an RT, were deemed to have low risk of pulmonary complications and did not require any respiratory treatments. The number of respiratory treatments increased after protocol initiation, but the patients who received respiratory treatments after protocol initiation had shorter ICU stay and hospital stay, and lower total hospital costs than those who received respiratory treatments before protocol initiation. There was a nonsignificant trend toward lower mortality after protocol initiation.

Conclusions

Our RT-evaluate-and-treat protocol for non-ICU surgery patients was associated with more patients receiving respiratory treatments but decreased ICU and hospital stay and lower total hospital costs. Routine RT-driven assessment of non-ICU patients may reduce pulmonary complications in high-risk patients.

### Mechanical ventilation competencies of the respiratory therapist in 2015 and beyond [^1139dmHV]. Respiratory Care (2013). Low credibility.

The evolution of critical care and mechanical ventilation has been dramatic and rapid over the last 10 years and can be expected to continue at this pace into the future. As a result, the competencies of the respiratory therapist regarding mechanical ventilation in 2015 and beyond are expected to also markedly increase. Respiratory therapists are expected to be the experts on the mechanical ventilator and all aspects of the application of mechanical ventilation. They will be considered consultants on all aspect of ventilatory support. This requires an expanded education in a number of areas. To achieve these levels of competency, as recommended by the third "2015 and Beyond" conference, the entry level education of the respiratory therapist of the future must be at the baccalaureate level.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: key concepts and advances in pulmonary rehabilitation [^111bkmX8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary rehabilitation — early mobilization and exercise in critically ill respiratory failure patients emphasizes that, when patients are unable to move actively, neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) was associated with reductions in muscle atrophy and critical illness neuropathy, and quadriceps NMES plus active limb mobilization enhanced muscle strength and hastened independent transfer from bed to chair. In individuals requiring long-term mechanical ventilation, a 6-week upper and lower limb training program improved limb muscle strength, ventilator-free time, and functional outcomes compared with usual care. Organizational strategies influence mobility, as transferring a patient from the intensive care unit (ICU) to the respiratory ICU increased the number of individuals ambulating threefold versus pretransfer rates, and physical therapists mobilize critically ill individuals to higher levels of mobilization than nursing staff; physiotherapists are described as ideally heavily involved in mobilization plans, exercise prescription, and progression with medical and nursing staff.

### Monitoring patients with acute respiratory failure during non-invasive respiratory support to minimize harm and identify treatment failure [^113GYteG]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Non-invasive respiratory support has consistently shown variable efficacy across different scenarios in preventing the harmful effects of invasive ventilation and improving outcomes for patients with acute respiratory failure. A thorough assessment of the patients' initial characteristics, combined with close physiological monitoring to adjust settings is essential to tailor a personalized approach and minimize the risk of harm and failure. Importantly, applying non-invasive respiratory support in critically ill patients, particularly those with de novo acute respiratory failure, demands a delicate balance between avoiding invasive ventilation and ensuring timely intubation when clinically indicated.

### Respiratory management of patients with neuromuscular weakness: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline and expert panel report [^111fh2eW]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Respiratory failure is a significant concern in neuromuscular diseases (NMDs). This CHEST guideline examines the literature on the respiratory management of patients with NMD to provide evidence-based recommendations.

Study Design and Methods

An expert panel conducted a systematic review addressing the respiratory management of NMD and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach for assessing the certainty of the evidence and formulating and grading recommendations. A modified Delphi technique was used to reach a consensus on the recommendations.

Results

Based on 128 studies, the panel generated 15 graded recommendations, one good practice statement, and one consensus-based statement.

Interpretation

Evidence of best practices for respiratory management in NMD is limited and is based primarily on observational data in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The panel found that pulmonary function testing every 6 months may be beneficial and may be used to initiate noninvasive ventilation (NIV) when clinically indicated. An individualized approach to NIV settings may benefit patients with chronic respiratory failure and sleep-disordered breathing related to NMD. When resources allow, polysomnography or overnight oximetry can help to guide the initiation of NIV. The panel provided guidelines for mouthpiece ventilation, transition to home mechanical ventilation, salivary secretion management, and airway clearance therapies. The guideline panel emphasizes that NMD pathologic characteristics represent a diverse group of disorders with differing rates of decline in lung function. The clinician's role is to add evaluation at the bedside to shared decision-making with patients and families, including respect for patient preferences and treatment goals, considerations of quality of life, and appropriate use of available resources in decision-making.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^111KHUFy]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Hospitalization assessment and emergency department management in COPD exacerbations — potential indications for hospitalization assessment include severe symptoms such as sudden worsening of resting dyspnea, high respiratory rate, decreased oxygen saturation, confusion, drowsiness; acute respiratory failure; onset of new physical signs (e.g., cyanosis, peripheral edema); failure of an exacerbation to respond to initial medical management; presence of serious comorbidities (e.g., heart failure, newly occurring arrhythmias, etc.); and insufficient home support. When patients with a COPD exacerbation come to the emergency department, if hypoxemic they should be provided with supplemental oxygen and undergo assessment to determine whether the exacerbation is life-threatening and if increased work of breathing or impaired gas exchange requires consideration for non-invasive ventilation; if so, healthcare providers should consider admission to an area where proper monitoring and care can be provided, whereas in less severe cases the patient may be managed in the emergency department or hospital ward unit. In addition to pharmacological therapy, hospital management of exacerbations includes respiratory support (oxygen therapy, ventilation), and we recommend that in hospitalized patients the severity of the exacerbation should be based on the patient's clinical signs.

### Integrating patients with chronic respiratory disease and heart failure into a combined breathlessness rehabilitation programme: a service redesign and pilot evaluation [^115odAUV]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Patient and public involvement

The initial idea for the project was presented to the department's Patient and public involvement (PPI) group (comprising of both cardiac and respiratory patients) some years ago with no preconceived plans of how this question might be addressed. There was support for the concept and an enthusiasm to be involved in the development of the service. As the project evolved, the PPI group was continually involved and guidance seeked as and when there was new information. Two of the PPI group members attended the steering group for the duration of data collection and dissemination of the project.

Revised programme structure

Participants

Patients were referred into CR and PR as normal by consultants, community heart failure nurses, specialist nurses, allied health professionals and general practitioners.

Eligibility criteria

Cardiac patients

Patients had a known diagnosis of heart failure (HF) (confirmed by echocardiogram ejection fraction (EF) < 40%) or HF with a normal ejection fraction (normal EF, New York Heart Association (NYHA) 2 or more, 3 or more admissions over 12 months, self-reported symptoms on activity).

Pulmonary patients

Patients were eligible to partake if they had a confirmed diagnosis of a chronic respiratory disease (Medical Research Council (MRC)Dyspnoea Scale2 and above).

Patients were excluded by either service if:

They had a lack of motivation (declined face-to-face classes) to participate in the programme,
Had severe musculoskeletal or neurological disorders that limited mobility; patients needed to be independently mobile with or without a walking aid,
Had a severe psychiatric disorder,
Had a cardiac event within the last 6 weeks or
Had a history of falls.

Assessment

All patients referred to either the PR or CR services were scheduled a comprehensive one-to-one assessment with a member of the multidisciplinary team (MDT). These are registered healthcare professionals who are clinical specialists in either PR or CR. The assessment included a review of the patient's relevant medical and social history, as well as an assessment of their current level of exercise performance and health status. Local risk stratification protocols were adhered to with telemetry performed on those cardiac patients at risk of exercise-induced arrhythmias or hypotension.

Patient assessment was carried out using a disease-specific proforma individual to the services but collecting commonalities. Class paperwork was an amalgamation of the two services using the PR exercise diary for patients to record their progress in class and at home and the CR paperwork which was adapted to record patient observations, class attendance and exercises during class.

### Monitoring breathing frequency, pattern, and effort [^115mukEq]. Respiratory Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Monitoring respiratory values such as breathing frequency, minute ventilation, breathing effort, and dyspnea are common in acute care. There is evidence that accurate monitoring and interpretation of these values leads to early identification and treatment of impending respiratory failure. Despite this evidence, some values, such as breathing frequency, are largely undervalued in the clinical setting. The undervaluation of breathing frequency is complex and will require a multifaceted approach, including education and improved technology, to reestablish its clinical potential. Many questions remain regarding how to most efficiently and effectively monitor other respiratory values, like noninvasive minute volume and breathing effort, as well. As technology continues to improve alongside the understanding of respiratory physiology, clinicians are able to apply basic clinical assessment skills and technology together to improve patient safety and outcomes.

### Noninvasive ventilation for critical care [^114vQtwR]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Noninvasive ventilation (NIV), the provision of ventilatory assistance without an artificial airway, has emerged as an important ventilatory modality in critical care. This has been fueled by evidence demonstrating improved outcomes in patients with respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbations, acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, or immunocompromised states, and when NIV is used to facilitate extubation in COPD patients with failed spontaneous breathing trials. Numerous other applications are supported by weaker evidence. A trial of NIV is justified in patients with acute respiratory failure due to asthma exacerbations and postoperative states, extubation failure, hypoxemic respiratory failure, or a do-not-intubate status. Patients must be carefully selected according to available guidelines and clinical judgment, taking into account risk factors for NIV failure. Patients begun on NIV should be monitored closely in an ICU or other suitable setting until adequately stabilized, paying attention not only to vital signs and gas exchange, but also to comfort and tolerance. Patients not having a favorable initial response to NIV should be considered for intubation without delay. NIV is currently used in only a select minority of patients with acute respiratory failure, but with technical advances and new evidence on its proper application, this role is likely to further expand.

### Respiratory management of patients with neuromuscular weakness: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline and expert panel report [^115hCMqE]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

Guideline overview and limitations — neuromuscular disease (NMD) respiratory management: Respiratory failure is common and often the final cause of death in patients with NMD; the guideline examined management literature to provide evidence-based and expert guidance, offering recommendations where evidence allowed and consensus-based and best practice statements when high-quality evidence was lacking. The document highlights heterogeneity across NMDs, limited randomized controlled trials, reliance on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) evidence, the need to individualize elements by rate of progression, and that the guideline focuses on diagnosis and therapy initiation rather than details of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or mechanical ventilation (MV). The panel recommends shared decision-making that respects patient preferences, treatment goals, and quality-of-life considerations, acknowledges access may depend on local resources and may require referral to a specialist center, and frames the guideline as an advocacy opportunity to ensure equal access given potential for increased health inequities; future randomized controlled trials are noted as needed to establish a higher level of evidence.

### Acute respiratory failure from early pandemic COVID-19: noninvasive respiratory support vs mechanical ventilation [^112wB6Ht]. CHEST Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal strategy for initial respiratory support in patients with respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 is unclear, and the initial strategy may affect outcomes.

Research Question

Which initial respiratory support strategy is associated with improved outcomes in patients with COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure?

Study Design and Methods

All patients with COVID-19 requiring respiratory support and admitted to a large health care network were eligible for inclusion. We compared patients treated initially with noninvasive respiratory support (NIRS; noninvasive positive pressure ventilation by facemask or high-flow nasal oxygen) with patients treated initially with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The primary outcome was time to in-hospital death analyzed using an inverse probability of treatment weighted Cox model adjusted for potential confounders. Secondary outcomes included unweighted and weighted assessments of mortality, lengths of stay (ICU and hospital), and time to intubation.

Results

Nearly one-half of the 2,354 patients (47%) who met inclusion criteria received IMV first, and 53% received initial NIRS. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 38% (37% for IMV and 39% for NIRS). Initial NIRS was associated with an increased hazard of death compared with initial IMV (hazard ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.03–1.94), but also an increased hazard of leaving the hospital sooner that waned with time (noninvasive support by time interaction: hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95–0.98).

Interpretation

Patients with COVID-19 with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure initially treated with NIRS showed an increased hazard of in-hospital death.

### How to create a primary respiratory care model [^113FPCbz]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Respiratory therapists (RTs) are credentialed health professionals who specialize in assessment of pulmonary conditions, performing assessment of pulmonary function and delivering pulmonary therapeutics including aerosol therapy, and noninvasive and invasive mechanical ventilation. Respiratory therapists work closely with various clinicians including physicians, nurses, and therapy staff in a number of different settings including outpatient clinics, long-term facilities, EDs, and ICUs. RTs are integral in the treatment of patients with several acute and chronic conditions. In this review, we outline the importance, the elements of, and an approach to building a comprehensive RT program that allows delivery of high-quality care while ensuring RTs practice at the full scope of their licensure. Over the last two decades, we have implemented a suite of changes to the training, functioning, deployment, continuing education, and capacity building in our Lung Partners Program practice, under the supervision of a medical director, that have allowed us to create an effective inpatient and outpatient model of primary respiratory care.

### Appropriate use of high-flow nasal oxygen in hospitalized patients for initial or postextubation management of acute respiratory failure: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^113YoKhb]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) for acute respiratory failure — scope and methods — address the use of HFNO in hospitalized patients for initial or postextubation management of acute respiratory failure, targeting adult patients treated in hospital settings and clinicians as the audience, and base recommendations on a systematic review with searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and CINAHL for randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews published in English from January 2000 through July 2020 with an updated bridge search through February 2021 that compared HFNO with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or conventional oxygen therapy (COT). The CGC and a technical expert panel suggested stratifying the primary analysis by indication (initial management of acute respiratory failure and postextubation respiratory failure), committee and CGC Public Panel members were asked a priori to independently rate the importance of evaluated outcomes, members agreed a priori on thresholds to categorize effect sizes for specified outcomes, and GRADE guidance was adopted to narratively describe findings; ACP staff also searched additional databases through October 2020 to identify evidence on patient values and preferences.

D. Initial oxygen therapy; initial choice of equipment for patients who do not have critical illness (see figures 1–2 and table 2 and full Guideline sections 8.9 and 10) i

Initial oxygen therapy in critical illness is covered in the next section.
D1. For acutely breathless patients not at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure who have saturations below 85%, treatment should be started with a reservoir mask at 15 L/min in the first instance. The oxygen concentration can be adjusted downwards (using nasal cannulae at 1–6 L/min or a simple face mask at 5–10 L/min) to maintain a target saturation of 94–98% once the patient has stabilised (grade D).
D2. In other cases of acute hypoxaemia without critical illness or risk factors for hypercapnic respiratory failure, treatment should be started with nasal cannulae (or a simple face mask if cannulae are not tolerated or not effective) with the flow rate adjusted to achieve a saturation of 94–98% (grade D).
D3. If medium-concentration therapy with nasal cannulae or a simple face mask does not achieve the desired saturation, change to a reservoir mask and seek senior or specialist advice (grade D).

### The Society of Critical Care Medicine at 50 years: interprofessional practice in critical care: looking back and forging ahead [^1118bXJj]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In 2018, there were 134,000 RTs with 81% of these therapists working in hospital settings. A majority of RTs in the acute care setting work in ICUs where they are responsible for the technical aspects of the various bedside clinician-ordered respiratory therapies including oxygen, airway clearance, lung expansion, intubation, blood gas measurement, pulmonary function testing, and bronchoalveolar lavage. In addition, RTs may also have independent professional practice roles as physician extenders in the application of protocols that permit the therapist to allocate respiratory care therapies including oxygen and medicated aerosols as needed to avoid complications, reduce misallocated therapies, and improve patient outcomes. RTs may also make protocol-driven ventilator setting changes as needed, and protocol-driven weaning from mechanical ventilation has become a recognized standard of practice since the early 2000s. A number of studies have demonstrated that protocol-driven weaning involving RTs results in significantly shorter durations of mechanical ventilation. This approach resulted in an estimated cost savings of $42,960 per patient in one recent study when compared with standard physician-driven weaning. Similarly, an RT-implemented lung-protective ventilation strategy in recent studies demonstrated an increase in the use of this strategy, and increases in ventilator free days and survival in both acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and non-ARDS patients.

In addition to ventilator management, RTs have also repeatedly demonstrated their value in improving outcomes using "assess and treat" protocols. A quality-improvement project in surgery patients receiving an RT-driven assess and treat protocol demonstrated shorter ICU and hospital stays, and lower hospital costs compared with preprotocol physician-directed respiratory care. The addition of RT involvement in an automated rapid response team has also recently been shown to result in lower hospital mortality and length of stay, and a decrease in the number of subsequent cardiopulmonary arrests.

The role of the RTs has grown and evolved considerably since the early days as oxygen technicians in the 1940s to important members of the multiprofessional ICU team to help coordinated comprehensive respiratory care including support for respiratory failure and weaning from mechanical ventilation. The ability of the RTs to develop appropriate respiratory care plans that target therapies to prevent pulmonary complications will continue to contribute to optimal patient outcomes including shorter times on mechanical ventilation and shorter ICU length of stay. Technological advances that alert clinicians and RTs of potential problems at earlier time points will enhance RTs ability to intervene in a timely manner to help prevent complications and improve outcomes.

### Partnering for optimal respiratory home care: physicians working with respiratory therapists to optimally meet respiratory home care needs [^116YmzGG]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

The need for respiratory care services continues to increase, reimbursement for those services has decreased, and cost-containment measures have increased the frequency of home health care. Respiratory therapists are well qualified to provide home respiratory care, reduce misallocation of respiratory services, assess patient respiratory status, identify problems and needs, evaluate the effect of the home setting, educate the patient on proper equipment use, monitor patient response to and complications of therapy, monitor equipment functioning, monitor for appropriate infection control procedures, make recommendations for changes to therapy regimen, and adjust therapy under the direction of the physician. Teamwork benefits all parties and offers cost and time savings, improved data collection and communication, higher job satisfaction, and better patient monitoring, education, and quality of life. Respiratory therapists are positioned to optimize treatment efficacy, maximize patient compliance, and minimize hospitalizations among patients receiving respiratory home care.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society policy statement: enhancing implementation, use, and delivery of pulmonary rehabilitation [^115YUcpQ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary rehabilitation — definition, benefits, and access gaps are summarized as follows: PR is a "comprehensive intervention based on a thorough patient assessment followed by patient-tailored therapies that include, but are not limited to, exercise training, education, and behavior change, designed to improve the physical and psychological condition of people with chronic respiratory disease and to promote the long-term adherence to health-enhancing behaviors"; PR "reduces patients' symptoms; improves limb muscle function, exercise capacity, emotional function, quality of life, knowledge, and self-efficacy; has health economic benefits; and is an essential component of the integrated care of patients with chronic respiratory diseases". Despite these benefits, PR "is grossly underutilized and is frequently inaccessible to patients", with contributing factors including "Insufficient funding; limited resources for PR programs; inadequate allocation of health system reimbursement for PR; lack of healthcare professional, payer, patient, and caregiver awareness and knowledge regarding the process and benefits of PR; suboptimal use of PR by suitable patients; and limited training opportunities for PR professionals", leading to "the gap between the science and benefits of PR… and the actual delivery of PR services". Additionally, "although intensive inpatient rehabilitation services for the sickest patients are widely distributed, availability of outpatient or community-based PR programs is insufficient or lacking in many geographic areas", and "within and among countries, PR is heterogeneous regarding program structure, content, staffing, available resources, and patient referral practices".

### Ideal postdischarge follow-up after severe pneumonia or acute respiratory failure: a qualitative study of primary care clinicians in diverse settings [^115B2DU2]. CHEST Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Integrating the Hospitalization Into the Primary Care Relationship:

Despite the centrality of the longitudinal relationship, primary care clinicians reported they usually had not been a part of the acute hospitalization; some expressed frustration. They needed to understand the hospitalization's implications for the ongoing longitudinal arc of care, to provide anticipatory guidance on what recovery might look like, and to resolve patients' questions about the hospitalization.

"They want to know why they don't feel better yet. [It's] helping them set realistic expectations. 'For every day you're on your back, it's going to take three to recover. Your lungs are struggling, damaged'. Patients want to feel better faster".

Assessing Mental and Physical Well-Being:

Clinicians varied in their assessments of functional status, from basic mobility to swallowing and emotional well-being. Clinicians tried to link patients to available resources, acknowledging they sometimes felt ill-equipped.

"Everyone who's… lying in bed all day should probably be getting some sort of physical therapy or rehab".

"Our patients receive a [Patient Health Questionnaire 2] screening [for depression and anxiety] when they come into our office… and [posttraumatic stress disorder] — after being hospitalized — that can be present there as well".

Rehabilitation Follow-Up:

Primary care clinicians explained and practiced breathing exercises with a patient, scheduled referrals for physical therapy, or referred patients to pulmonary rehabilitation services.

"What activities are they being able to do? Just gauging their recovery. Sometimes patients are sent home with an incentive spirometer. I'll ask, 'Are you doing that?' Or certain inhalers. It's ingrained in me to always check on dosing and technique".

Background: Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is used for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic hypercapnia. However, evidence for clinical efficacy and optimal management of therapy is limited.

Target Audience: Patients with COPD, clinicians who care for them, and policy makers.

Methods: We summarized evidence addressing five PICO (patients, intervention, comparator, and outcome) questions. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach was used to evaluate the certainty in evidence and generate actionable recommendations. Recommendations were formulated by a panel of pulmonary and sleep physicians, respiratory therapists, and methodologists using the Evidence-to-Decision framework.

Recommendations: 1) We suggest the use of nocturnal NIV in addition to usual care for patients with chronic stable hypercapnic COPD (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty); 2) we suggest that patients with chronic stable hypercapnic COPD undergo screening for obstructive sleep apnea before initiation of long-term NIV (conditional recommendation, very low certainty); 3) we suggest not initiating long-term NIV during an admission for acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, favoring instead reassessment for NIV at 2–4 weeks after resolution (conditional recommendation, low certainty); 4) we suggest not using an in-laboratory overnight polysomnogram to titrate NIV in patients with chronic stable hypercapnic COPD who are initiating NIV (conditional recommendation, very low certainty); and 5) we suggest NIV with targeted normalization of Pa CO 2 in patients with hypercapnic COPD on long-term NIV (conditional recommendation, low certainty).

Conclusions: This expert panel provides evidence-based recommendations addressing the use of NIV in patients with COPD and chronic stable hypercapnic respiratory failure.

### Respiratory management of patients with neuromuscular weakness: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline and expert panel report [^112gzkWj]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

Respiratory management of patients with neuromuscular weakness — CHEST clinical practice guideline reports that an expert panel conducted a systematic review using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach and a modified Delphi technique to reach consensus, and based on 128 studies generated 15 graded recommendations, one good practice statement, and one consensus-based statement. Evidence of best practices is limited and is based primarily on observational data in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The panel found that pulmonary function testing every 6 months may be beneficial and may be used to initiate noninvasive ventilation (NIV) when clinically indicated, and that an individualized approach to NIV settings may benefit patients with chronic respiratory failure and sleep-disordered breathing related to neuromuscular disease (NMD). When resources allow, polysomnography or overnight oximetry can help to guide the initiation of NIV. The panel provided guidelines for mouthpiece ventilation, transition to home mechanical ventilation, salivary secretion management, and airway clearance therapies, and emphasized that NMD pathologic characteristics represent a diverse group with differing rates of decline in lung function, with the clinician's role including bedside evaluation and shared decision-making that respects patient preferences, quality of life, and appropriate use of available resources.

The role of the respiratory therapist in the care of patients with cystic fibrosis has expanded throughout the years. As key members of the multidisciplinary team, respiratory therapists actively participate in the medical management of patients with cystic fibrosis along the continuum of care, from acute in-patient stays to the out-patient clinic and/or home setting. Through their involvement in diagnostic testing, administering therapy, or direct bedside care, patient and caregiver education, and disease management, respiratory therapists strive to preserve lung function, maintain overall health, and improve the patient's quality of life.

Gap in alternative communication tools — in MV care, "inadequate and inconsistent communication strategies" by critical care clinicians "create barriers to understanding and accurately assessing the patient's symptom experience". This gap "can be addressed by routine speech–language pathologist consultation", team-wide communication training and competency testing, and "incorporating augmentative and alternative communication tools as standard practice". "Evidence-based approaches to minimizing sedation use are necessary" to optimize patients' communication, and "family engagement in bedside communication" with augmentative/alternative tools "can improve symptom recognition and assessment". Interprofessional skill building in symptom assessment "should include the use of simulation exercises" with multidisciplinary teams, and "research that connects symptom assessment and management with MV patient outcomes and long-term recovery is needed".

### Respiratory management of patients with neuromuscular weakness: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline and expert panel report [^113hM34f]. Chest (2023). High credibility.

Neuromuscular disease (NMD) pulmonary function testing (PFT) — clinical practice suggest that PFT is a common diagnostic method to assess the progression of respiratory failure and predictors of survival in patients with NMD, and no clear harms were identified; the balance of effects strongly favors the intervention and supports its use as standard clinical practice. Among the PFT parameters identified as predictors of clinical outcomes, the panel recommends the measurement of vital capacity (FVC or SVC), MIP or MEP, SNIP, or PCF in patients with NMD, and a review of 142 abstracts did not identify any studies that addressed the impact of the frequency of PFTs on disease progression, quality of life, or clinical use in NMD. Based on expert opinion, the panel believed that testing and follow-up at least every 6 months have benefits over yearly or as-needed testing, and using a consensus-based approach, the panel chose an interval of 6 months; in some NMDs, such as ALS, patients may show a significant change in respiratory parameters in 3 to 6 months, whereas in stable or slowly progressing diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, PFT could be performed at less frequent intervals such as every 12 months. PFT is a low-cost intervention that can be performed in the office or with home-based monitoring, and spirometry should be performed with a mouthpiece and a nasal clip or a mask (if the patient cannot close their mouth). The following values are considered abnormal: FVC < 80% predicted, MIP < –60 cm H2O, MIP < 40 cm H2O, and PCF < 270 L/min in individuals ≥ 12 years of age; SNIP can be substituted for MIP in case of significant NMD. The panel found limited data on PFT in the supine vs erect postures and, although no recommendation was made, we do not limit or advise against the use of supine testing when available, and more frequent testing may be performed based on patient symptoms.

### Identification and prevention of extubation failure by using an automated continuous monitoring alert versus standard care [^115tdAgv]. Respiratory Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Postextubation monitoring helps identify patients at risk of developing respiratory failure. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of our standard respiratory therapist (RT) assessment tool versus an automated continuous monitoring alert to initiate postextubation RT-driven care on the re-intubation rate.

Methods

This was a single-center randomized clinical trial from March 2020 to September 2021 of adult subjects who received mechanical ventilation for > 24 h and underwent planned extubation in the ICU. The subjects were assigned to the standard RT assessment tool or an automated monitoring alert to identify the need for postextubation RT-driven care. The primary outcome was the need for re-intubation due to respiratory failure within 72 h. Secondary outcomes included re-intubation within 7 d, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, hospital mortality, ICU cost, and RT time associated with patient assessment and therapy provision.

Results

Of 234 randomized subjects, 32 were excluded from the primary analysis due to disruption in RT-driven care during the surge of patients with COVID-19, and 1 subject was excluded due to delay in the automated monitoring initiation. Analysis of the primary outcome included 85 subjects assigned to the standard RT assessment group and 116 assigned to the automated monitoring alert group to initiate RT-driven care. There was no significant difference between the study groups in re-intubation rate, median length of stay, mortality, or ICU costs. The RT time associated with patient assessment (P < .001) and therapy provided (P = 0.031) were significantly lower in the automated continuous monitoring alert group.

Conclusions

In subjects who received mechanical ventilation for > 24 h, there were no significant outcome or cost differences between our standard RT assessment tool or an automated monitoring alert to initiate postextubation RT-driven care. Using an automated continuous monitoring alert to initiate RT-driven care saved RT time. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT04231890).

### AARC clinical practice guideline: spontaneous breathing trials for liberation from adult mechanical ventilation [^112Dv3P3]. Respiratory Care (2024). High credibility.

American College of Chest Physicians–Society of Critical Care Medicine–American Association for Respiratory Care 2001 ventilator weaning/discontinuation guidelines — In patients requiring mechanical ventilation for > 24 h, a search for all causes that may be contributing to ventilator dependence should be undertaken, and reversal of all possible ventilatory and non-ventilatory issues should be an integral part of the ventilator discontinuation process. Patients receiving mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure should undergo a formal assessment of discontinuation potential if criteria are satisfied (evidence for some reversal of the underlying cause for respiratory failure, adequate oxygenation and pH, hemodynamic stability, and capability to initiate an inspiratory effort), and formal discontinuation assessments should be done during spontaneous breathing rather than while the patient is still receiving substantial ventilatory support. Removal of the artificial airway after successful discontinuation should be based upon assessments of airway patency and the ability of the patient to protect the airway. Patients who fail a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) should have the cause for the failed SBT determined and, once reversible causes are corrected, subsequent SBTs should be performed every 24 h, with interim support provided in a stable, non-fatiguing, comfortable form of ventilatory support. Anesthesia/sedation strategies and ventilator management aimed at early extubation should be used in postsurgical patients, and ICUs should develop and implement weaning/discontinuation protocols for non-physician health care professionals as well as protocols aimed at optimizing sedation. Tracheostomy should be considered after an initial period of stabilization on the ventilator when it becomes apparent that the patient will require prolonged ventilator assistance. Unless there is evidence for clearly irreversible disease, a patient requiring prolonged mechanical ventilatory support for respiratory failure should not be considered permanently ventilator-dependent until 3 months of weaning attempts have failed; when medically stable for transfer, patients who have failed ventilator discontinuation attempts in the ICU should be transferred to facilities with demonstrated success and safety, and the weaning strategy in the prolonged mechanically ventilated patient should be slow paced and should include gradually lengthening self-breathing trials.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: spontaneous breathing trials for liberation from adult mechanical ventilation [^113ATuwM]. Respiratory Care (2024). High credibility.

Adult ventilator liberation — evidence on weaning strategies and SBT processes indicates that two multi-center randomized controlled trials compared gradual rate reductions with IMV or SIMV versus gradual inspiratory pressure reductions with PSV; one RCT comparing SIMV and PSV with progressively longer T-piece trials reported best outcomes with PSV, and another RCT comparing IMV and PSV with once- or twice-daily SBTs using progressively longer T-piece trials reported best outcomes, while both studies found worse outcomes with SIMV weaning that delayed liberation from mechanical ventilation. These trials began with an assessment of readiness and an SBT lasting up to 2 h, and in both, 75% of subjects successfully completed the first SBT. Subsequent RCTs reported benefits of respiratory therapist (RT)–driven protocols in which RTs assess patients with a safety screen and, if passed, initiate an SBT, and this process is ideally in collaboration with the interprofessional ICU team to implement spontaneous awakening trials coordinated with SBTs.

Discussion

Although significant advancements have been made in the management of ARDS, many questions remain. Several recommendations in this guideline are conditional in nature and, as such, require careful evaluation of patient and illness characteristics when considering their use. Future studies may serve to strengthen these recommendations or provide additional caveats to their implementation. Measures with more established evidence of benefit also exist, including lung protective ventilation for all patients with ARDS and prone positioning for those with severe ARDS. Although strong recommendations in favor of these measures have previously been made, translating evidence into practice has been fraught with challenges. Considerable practice variation exists in ARDS management, and evidence-based modalities remain underused. This underuse is associated with increased mortality, suggesting that there is significant opportunity to improve ARDS outcomes. To maximize these opportunities, future efforts must be made to facilitate access to readily available, granular data about ARDS management practices in real-world settings to allow for benchmarking, auditing, and continuous quality improvement. Additionally, it is crucial to understand the clinician-, systems-, and patient-level barriers to, and facilitators of, the use of evidence-based supportive care in ARDS to inform a comprehensive approach to implementation.

In addition to implementation research, there are several opportunities to address other areas of uncertainty. Much remains unknown about the impact of supportive measures used for ARDS on the long-term outcomes of survivors, an issue of vital importance to patients. There is a critical need for future clinical trials to not only consistently collect these data, but also to involve patient and family representatives to help identify and guide the selection of specific outcomes to study. There are also other modalities used in a small but significant minority of patients with ARDS, such as pulmonary vasodilators and alternative ventilator modes, for which further data are needed before meaningful recommendations can be made. Additionally, although supportive therapies are often used in combination rather than in isolation, it remains unknown whether combination treatments are synergistic. Treatment effects can also vary across individuals, a concept known as heterogeneity of treatment effect, which is an issue that may be especially relevant to ARDS. There is substantial heterogeneity in ARDS, including patient characteristics, underlying etiologies, mechanisms of injury, and degrees of severity. In light of these issues, there has been growing interest in identifying homogeneous subgroups in ARDS with potential differential responses to treatment. Although the methods for subphenotyping patients with ARDS are currently investigational, the identification of distinct subsets of patients may provide an opportunity to improve patient selection for clinical trials in the future and ultimately increase the likelihood of finding effective interventions.

### The 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease report and practice implications for the respiratory therapist [^114KADo3]. Respiratory Care (2017). Low credibility.

Since 1998, the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) has worked with health care professionals, medical researchers, and public health officials around the world to optimize the prevention, treatment, and management of COPD. GOLD has continually worked to ensure COPD management strategy recommendations are aligned with current published research. The 2017 GOLD report represents a major revision to GOLD strategy guidelines, the first such major revision in the last 5 years. As such, the 2017 report has significant implications for the diagnosis of COPD, the management of stable disease, and the treatment of exacerbations. As respiratory therapists (RTs) are front-line clinical professionals throughout the COPD continuum of care, a thorough understanding of the new GOLD recommendations for practice is critical. New recommendations regarding diagnosis, severity assessment, and both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of COPD are presented, and suggestions for how RTs can integrate these recommendations into COPD care practices are provided.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: key concepts and advances in pulmonary rehabilitation [^115sZEWa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Early rehabilitation in acute respiratory failure emphasizes assessment and safe mobilization by an interdisciplinary intensive care unit (ICU) team. Although survival in critically ill individuals, especially those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), has improved, this is often associated with generalized deconditioning, functional impairment, and reduced health-related quality of life after ICU discharge, indicating the need for rehabilitation after ICU and hospital discharge and for measures during ICU stay to prevent or attenuate deconditioning. Clinical interest and scientific evidence have given support to safe and early physical activity and mobilization in critically ill patients with respiratory failure. Planning early mobilization involves assessment of cooperation, cardiopulmonary reserve, muscle strength, joint mobility, functional status, and quality of life; muscle strength assessment is important for guiding progressive ambulation and predicting outcomes. In alert ICU patients, strength can be measured with the Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnea grade, handgrip dynamometer, and handheld dynamometer, while in unconscious individuals muscle thickness by ultrasound is available as a nonvalidated test. Several protocols address safety, cardiorespiratory and neurologic status, cooperation level, and functional status, and provide steps to gradually increase activity and mobilization in the critically ill.

American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society pulmonary rehabilitation — definition and scope is presented as a comprehensive, assessment-based and patient-tailored intervention including exercise training, education, and behavior change to improve the physical and psychological condition of people with chronic respiratory disease and to promote long-term adherence to health-enhancing behaviors. Pulmonary rehabilitation is implemented by a dedicated, interdisciplinary team and should be individualized to the patient's needs, with components integrated throughout the clinical course, and may be initiated at any stage of the disease, during clinical stability or during or directly after an exacerbation. The goals include minimizing symptom burden, maximizing exercise performance, promoting autonomy, increasing participation in everyday activities, enhancing health-related quality of life, and effecting long-term health-enhancing behavior change. The document situates pulmonary rehabilitation within integrated care as defined by the World Health Organization and states that integration improves access, quality, user satisfaction, and efficiency of medical care.

### The 2007 GOLD guidelines: a comprehensive care framework [^11179NH3]. Respiratory Care (2009). Low credibility.

Comprehensive management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes proper assessment, monitoring of disease, reduction of risk factors, the management of stable COPD, and the prevention and management of exacerbations. The 2007 COPD guidelines from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease address each of these aspects of COPD management in detail and provide evidence-based recommendations for patients and health-care professionals. Reduction of risk factors emphasizes the importance of smoking cessation and control of environmental indoor and outdoor pollutants. The management of COPD must be individualized. Aerosol administration of bronchodilators is the most effective method of reducing the work of breathing and alleviating dyspnea. Glucocorticosteroid therapy is recommended to reduce the frequency of exacerbations and improve health-related quality of life for patients with stage 3 and 4 COPD. Pulmonary rehabilitation proves effective in relieving symptoms, improving quality of life, and increasing patients' physical and emotional participation in activities of daily life. Oxygen therapy is essential for patients with substantial hypoxia. Patients with COPD and respiratory failure may benefit from noninvasive ventilation. Surgery may play a limited role in the management of selected patients with COPD. Since exacerbations influence lung function and clinical decline in patients with COPD and contribute to the cost of caring for this disease, efforts must be directed at prevention and management of exacerbations. In addition to controlled oxygen therapy, antimicrobials, brief courses of systemic corticosteroids and, on occasion, noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation may play a role. The role of respiratory therapists in the prevention, diagnosis, and management of stable COPD and exacerbations is absolutely essential if the goals of the 2007 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines are to be attained.

### Primary, secondary survey-CHEMM… [^115cyxtF]. chemm.hhs.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Initial Assessment The initial assessment has six components; Form a general impression of the patient- The general impression will help you decide the seriousness of the patient's condition based on his level of distress and mental status Assess the patient's mental status- Initially this may mean determine if the patient is responsive or unresponsive. Classify the patient by the AVPU scale. Assess the patient's airway- Is the patient's airway open. If the patient is unresponsive stabilize the head and neck and use the jaw-thrust maneuver to ensure an open airway. If you do not suspect a spine injury use the head tilt, chin lift maneuver. Assess the patients breathing- Is the patient breathing adequately. With the airway open, place your ear over the patient's nose and mouth and watch for chest movement, note symmetry or lack of symmetry in chest movement. Listen and feel for the presence of exhaled air. Listen to the quality of the breath sounds.

Sporadic respirations are called agonal respirations and occur just prior to death. Assess the patient's circulation
- Does the patient have an adequate pulse. Is there serious bleeding. Did the patient lose a large quantity of blood prior to your arrival.
- If the patient is not breathing check the pulse at the neck.
- If the patient is breathing you can check the carotid or the pulse at the wrist
- If you document the presence of a carotid pulse but the radial pulse is absent this may represent a shock situation. A rapid or weak pulse may also represent a shock situation. Make a decision on the priority or urgency of the patient for transport Special consideration for infants and children. Vital signs
- This include pulse, respirations, skin signs, pupils and blood pressure. This may include documenting the oxygen saturation level.

Pulse
- Assess for rate, rhythm, and strength Respiration
- Assess for rate, depth, sound, and ease of breathing. Neck
- Is stridor present
- Are the muscles in the neck "pulling" Chest/Lungs
- Note the presence of increased work of breathing i.e. retractions, increased rate
- Note the presence of stridor
- Note the presence of wheezing, rhonchi, rales, decreased breath sounds
- Note the presence of central cyanosis
- Does the patient complain of burning in the chest or chest pain.

Ventilatory support and intensive care admission — COPD exacerbations: Some patients need immediate admission to the respiratory care or intensive care unit, and admission to intermediate or special respiratory care units may be appropriate if adequate personnel skills and equipment exist to identify and manage acute respiratory failure. Ventilatory support in an exacerbation can be provided by either noninvasive (nasal or facial mask) or invasive (oro-tracheal tube or tracheostomy) ventilation, and respiratory stimulants are not recommended for acute respiratory failure. Indications for respiratory or medical intensive care unit admission include severe dyspnea that responds inadequately to initial emergency therapy, changes in mental status (confusion, lethargy, coma), persistent or worsening hypoxemia (PaO2 < 5.3 kPa or < 40 mmHg) and/or severe/worsening respiratory acidosis (pH < 7.25) despite supplemental oxygen and noninvasive ventilation, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and hemodynamic instability with need for vasopressors.

### Can we predict the future of respiratory failure prediction? [^112B9xxC]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

More complicated scoring systems also exist, examining a wider range of respiratory pathologies and oxygen delivery modalities. For example, the HACOR score predicts the risk of mechanical ventilation after the initiation of NIV in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure of any etiology. The HACOR score incorporates heart rate, acidosis (pH), consciousness (GCS), oxygenation (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio), and respiratory rate. At 1-hour, a HACOR score > 5 is associated with a high risk of NIV failure with an AUC 0.71. Refinements to the HACOR score, adding six additional variables — sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, presence of pneumonia, septic shock, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, ARDS, and immunosuppression — improved its predictive capabilities, raising the AUC to 0.78. Despite the earlier prognostication time (1–2 h after initiation of NIV) offered by the HACOR score compared to other prediction scores, its limitations include the scoring system complexity and number of variables required for calculation. Additionally, the use of NIV has decreased in the pneumonia/ARDS population following the High-Flow Oxygen through Nasal Cannula in Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure (FLORALI) trial, which demonstrated a 90-day mortality benefit of HFNC over NIV in acute hypoxemic non-hypercapnic respiratory failure.

Expert panel members agreed that these scores are rarely used in clinical practice. Lack of routine use of existing scoring systems may be due to multiple factors. Some highlighted limitations include that current algorithms can identify, but not necessarily predict, respiratory failure. Instruments which rely on tachypnea and hypoxemia are likely identifying established or impending respiratory failure but not truly predicting a future event. Instead, expertise and clinical gestalt are heavily relied upon when assessing a patient and their risk of respiratory failure progression. However, it was recognized that even experienced clinicians provide incomplete evaluations based on variable time at the bedside, particularly overnight, with a high patient census, and may not be aware of decompensating patients outside the ICU setting in the absence of effective warning systems. There may also be some value in these indices in early medical education to help learners contextualize and form their own mental frameworks for understanding disease and illness severity.

### Comprehensive approach to the management of the patient with multiple rib fractures: a review and introduction of a bundled rib fracture management protocol [^115wPUhN]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Multimodal systemic analgesia

Under the rib fracture management protocol, patients receive multimodal systemic pain management on admission. Unless contraindications apply, patients should receive any home pain medications (including psychoactive medications and opioids), oral gabapentin (dose adjusted for age and renal function when indicated), oral or IV acetaminophen (except in geriatric patients or those with liver dysfunction), and either IV ketorolac or oral celecoxib. In addition, patients are prescribed oral opioids or patient-controlled opioid analgesia, titrated to effect or side effects.

When initial multimodal systemic analgesia is ineffective, our institution's Acute Pain Service is consulted for consideration of neuraxial catheter placement.

Nursing, respiratory therapy, and physician components

The primary physician places electronic orders for the protocol with admission orders, or at the time of extubation if patients are initially intubated. This includes hourly pulmonary hygiene, minimization of IV fluids as possible, frequent mobilization, elevation of head of bed, respiratory therapy, and multimodal analgesia. PIC scores and spirometry volumes are incorporated into daily team rounds, and are used to guide care decisions.

Nursing-based interventions include assessment and charting of PIC scores, patient and family education, encouragement of frequent pulmonary hygiene and early mobilization. A patient and family education brochure is provided and family members are encouraged to support the patient in incentive spirometry use to improve their scores.

Respiratory therapists evaluate all ICU patients within 1 hour of admission, and all acute care floor patients within 6 hours of admission. Therapists set the goal and alert inspiratory spirometry levels as described above, and perform frequent monitoring and care. ICU patients on the protocol receive respiratory therapy every 4 hours; acute care patients receive therapy every 6 hours.

For patients without improved pain scores and respiratory parameters despite 6–8 hours of multimodal analgesia, our hospital's Anesthesiology Acute Pain Service is consulted for consideration of neuraxial catheter placement. Decision for neuraxial catheter placement is made on an individual patient basis, with consideration to pain level, respiratory capacity, coagulation status, mental status, spine injuries and positioning limitations, sepsis or infection, allergies, comorbidities and hemodynamics.

Early surgical rib stabilization (within 72 hours following trauma admission) is considered for patients meeting any of the following anatomical criteria: 3 or more displaced rib fractures, flail segment, patients who require video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or thoracotomy, or patients who have marked sternal flail and overlapping sternal fractures. Likewise, surgical rib stabilization is considered for patients who fail extubation attempts due to mechanical instability or pain.

It is recognised that PFTs may be challenging in those with significant learning and behavioural issues. Therefore, the threshold for referral to respiratory specialists is likely to be lower in these patients and would be expected before transition to adult services. Difficulty performing reproducible PFTs does not preclude a young person from tolerating ventilatory support and other interventions. However, the risks and benefits of initiating treatment need to be considered on an individual basis and tolerating effective intervention is likely to require more time and support. Engagement with learning disability and palliative care teams is recommended.

Where formal spirometry cannot be reliably performed or in the presence of significant scoliosis, this should prompt onward referral.

Decisions about initiation of ventilatory support are complex and depend on many factors, including patient wishes, and should be made by a specialist respiratory team after discussion with patient, carers and other relevant specialists including palliative care teams.

Emergency care considerations

Children and adults with DMD and compromised respiratory function can rapidly deteriorate during an intercurrent infection. Lack of awareness of DMD and its complications, including respiratory care requirements and considerations, can lead to inappropriate interventions.

It is therefore important that an individualised emergency healthcare plan is in place and discussed with the patient and family and referred to in case of acute hospital admission. A DMD-specific 'In case of emergency' appis available for families to carry on their phones that includes key information about DMD, its complications and essential medical considerations for the management of a patients with DMD during acute medical events and hospital admissions.

Figure 2 provides emergency guidelines to support management during an unexpected medical event where there are respiratory considerations.

In the event of an unplanned/emergency admission to hospital, a child or adult with DMD may require stabilisation in a local emergency department. Due to the generalised weakness and reduced mobility, they may not display the laboured breathing and accessory muscle use seen typically in respiratory distress. Where there is a possibility of compromised respiratory function, management should be led by a specialist respiratory team. If the admitting centre does not have a specialist respiratory team, contact should be made with the nearest specialist respiratory centre as soon as possible for advice, guidance and possible transfer. Urgent assessment by a physiotherapist with experience in airway clearance is recommended.

### Official executive summary of an American Thoracic Society / American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline: liberation from mechanical ventilation in critically ill adults [^114rgy5w]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society (ATS)/American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) guideline on liberation from mechanical ventilation — panel composition, process, and grading are detailed as follows: Six co-chairs were appointed, three each by the ATS and CHEST leadership, and the final panel consisted of the six co-chairs, eight pulmonary/critical care physicians, four critical care physicians, one critical care nurse, one physical therapist, one critical care pharmacist, and two methodologists, divided among six topic groups; the six co-chairs proposed six clinical questions. Outcomes for each question were weighted following the Grading Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group approach, the panel used the GRADE approach to assess overall certainty of evidence, and the Evidence-to-Decision framework facilitated recommendation development. Each recommendation was considered strong or conditional and required at least 80% panel consensus for approval, with any below-threshold item revised and resubmitted. The guideline's goal is to help clinicians safely and effectively liberate patients from mechanical ventilation and improve outcomes among critically ill patients, and ATS and CHEST elected to share publication of a document that consists of six questions with related evidence syntheses and recommendations.

### The future of respiratory care [^1138m2Av]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

The term respiratory care has more than one meaning, referring both to a subject area within clinical medicine and to a distinct health care profession. In the light of several fundamental transformations of health care during the 20th century, this article reviews the history of respiratory care in both of these contexts and offers 10 predictions for the future: (1) Less focus on raising P(aO2) as a primary goal in managing patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. (2) More attention to the adequacy of tissue oxygenation in such patients, irrespective of P(aO2), and the emergence of "permissive hypoxemia", analogous to permissive hypercapnia, in managing them. (3) Smarter monitors that display information less but process it more, while interacting directly with ventilators and other devices to modify therapeutic interventions. (4) Increased use of and expertise with noninvasive ventilation, with a corresponding decrease in intubations and complications, in treating patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. (5) Increased use of triage in the intensive care unit, including earlier determination of the appropriateness of maximal supportive intervention. (6) Greater use of protocols in patient assessment and management, in all clinical settings. (7) Increased awareness of, expertise in, and resources for palliative care, with a more active and acknowledged role for respiratory therapists. (8) Accelerating progress in smoking cessation and prevention, and also in early detection and intervention in COPD, led by the respiratory care profession. (9) An increasing presence and impact of respiratory therapists as coordinators and care givers in home care. (10) A continued and enlarging role for the journal Respiratory Care in disseminating research findings, clinical practice guidelines, protocols, and practical educational materials in all areas of the field.

### Asthma disease management and the respiratory therapist [^1132ywGY]. Respiratory Care (2008). Low credibility.

The role of the respiratory therapist (RT) is expanding with the growing acceptance and use of the disease-management paradigm for managing chronic diseases. RTs are key members of the asthma disease-management team, in acute-care settings, patients' homes, out-patient clinics, emergency departments, and in the community. Utilizing RTs as disease managers allows patients to be treated faster and more appropriately, discharged to home sooner, and decreases hospital admissions. RT are leaders in the emerging field of asthma disease management.

Pulmonary hypertension — competencies include skill to evaluate patients with pulmonary hypertension to determine etiology, skill to recommend the initial pharmacological regimen for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, and skills to assess functional capacity and risk stratify patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Additional skills are to perform serial noninvasive assessments of right ventricular function and pulmonary arterial pressure and integrate these data in the management of patients with pulmonary hypertension and to detect clinical deterioration in patients with pulmonary hypertension and adjust treatment accordingly, including determining when hospitalization is necessary. Competency also includes skill to stabilize patients with acute right ventricular failure in the setting of pulmonary hypertension.

### Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure [^114gkJcR]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Noninvasive ventilation has assumed an important role in the management of respiratory failure in critical care units, but it must be used selectively depending on the patient's diagnosis and clinical characteristics.

Data

We review the strong evidence supporting the use of noninvasive ventilation for acute respiratory failure to prevent intubation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations or acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and in immunocompromised patients, as well as to facilitate extubation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who require initial intubation. Weaker evidence supports consideration of noninvasive ventilation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with postoperative or postextubation respiratory failure; patients with acute respiratory failure due to asthma exacerbations, pneumonia, acute lung injury, or acute respiratory distress syndrome; during bronchoscopy; or as a means of preoxygenation before intubation in critically ill patients with severe hypoxemia.

Conclusion

Noninvasive ventilation has assumed an important role in managing patients with acute respiratory failure. Patients should be monitored closely for signs of noninvasive ventilation failure and promptly intubated before a crisis develops. The application of noninvasive ventilation by a trained and experienced intensive care unit team, with careful patient selection, should optimize patient outcomes.

### Utilizing competence-based simulation to improve orientation outcomes [^114r31H8]. Respiratory Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

New graduate respiratory therapists (RTs), regardless of the degree program, receive limited preparation in neonatal/pediatric diseases and management. Experienced RTs typically have adult knowledge but limited exposure to pediatrics. We developed a program that included competence-based simulation to improve orientation success.

Methods

A 9-week orientation program curriculum with simulation-based competence assessment was developed to ensure all new hires gained knowledge and skills to perform pediatric clinical tasks. Each new hire individually completed the same simulation scenarios during the first week and last week of orientation. Curriculum changes were made over time based on performance in simulations and on-the-job knowledge and skills during and after orientation. Paired and unpaired t tests were used with P < .05 as significant.

Results

From January 2017-February 2020, the program had 3 updates. Noninvasive ventilation and decompensating patient scenarios were completed for all periods. Ninety-two new staff were oriented in period 1 = 29 (new graduate RTs 20, experienced RTs 9); period 2 = 17 (new graduate RTs 10, experienced RTs 7); period 3 = 24 (new graduate RTs 21, experienced RTs 3), and period 4 = 22 (new graduate RTs = 22). Remediation during orientation occurred in 15% of the staff. Seventy-one percent successfully advanced to ICU orientation after completion of the program. All staff improved scores between pre- versus post-simulations in all periods: mean difference ± SD period 1: new graduate RTs 32.0 ± 17.0, P < .001; experienced RTs 28.0 ± 18.9, P < .001; period 2: new graduate RTs 23.0 ± 15.2, P < .001; experienced RTs 29.0 ± 12.1, P < .001; period 3: new graduate RTs 26.0 ± 15.8, P < .001; experienced RTs 27.0 ± 15.1, P = 0.007; and period 4: new graduate RTs 19.0 ± 14.5, P < .001, paired t test. The scores between new graduate RTs and experienced RTs during post-simulation were not significantly different for period 1 (P = 0.35) but were significantly different for periods 2–4 (P = 0.040, unpaired t test).

Conclusions

The use of a competence-based orientation program showed educational advancements and helped determine successful orientation completion.

### Should a patient be extubated and placed on noninvasive ventilation after failing a spontaneous breathing trial? [^117WC5sx]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

Between 15% and 35% of mechanically ventilated patients fail an initial spontaneous breathing trial. For these patients, 40% of total time on mechanical ventilation is consumed by the weaning process (60% for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Longer duration of mechanical ventilation is associated with higher risk of complications and probably with higher mortality. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) has been used successfully in some forms of acute respiratory failure. Randomized controlled trials have indicated that, in selected patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute-on-chronic respiratory failure, NIV can facilitate weaning, reduce the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, decrease complications, and reduce mortality, compared to weaning on continued invasive ventilation. However, extubation failure resulting in re-intubation is associated with higher mortality, and this mortality risk increases with delay of re-intubation and may not be prevented by application of NIV. Patients extubated to NIV must have careful monitoring by skilled clinicians able to provide timely re-intubation if the patient shows signs of intolerance or worsening respiratory failure.

### Appropriate use of high-flow nasal oxygen in hospitalized patients for initial or postextubation management of acute respiratory failure: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^114jwiAB]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

High-flow nasal oxygen — key questions and systematic review methods are summarized as follows: The guideline's questions addressed comparative effectiveness and harms of HFNO versus NIV or COT in hospitalized patients with acute respiratory failure, including whether effects vary by patient characteristics, disease or diagnosis, protocol or device settings, or location of administration. Reviewers searched English-language literature from January 2000 to July 2020 with a bridge search through February 2021, assessed risk of bias using a modified Cochrane approach for randomized controlled trials, analyzed initial management and postextubation acute respiratory failure separately, and conducted subgroup analyses by clinical setting, disease indication, treatment duration, and type of acute respiratory failure. Certainty of evidence was rated using a modification of GRADE (high, moderate, low, or insufficient), and GRADE guidance was adapted to narratively describe findings by effect size and certainty.

### Lung ultrasound: the emerging role of respiratory therapists [^114Nv7VW]. Respiratory Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Lung ultrasound is a point-of-care imaging tool that is routinely used in acute care medicine. Traditionally, radiology physicians were the primary practitioners of diagnostic ultrasound, but with the recognition of its importance in intensive care medicine, critical care physicians have also adopted this practice. Within the intensive care unit inter-professional team is the respiratory therapist, who participates actively in the care of ventilated patients. Their scope of responsibility is expanding with newer technologies being brought into clinical use on a regular basis. This review focuses on the scope and benefits of ultrasound training within respiratory care-related areas.

### Impact of a mechanical ventilation curriculum on respiratory therapist recognition of patient-ventilator asynchrony [^1122ZuaC]. Respiratory Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Respiratory therapists (RTs) play a crucial role in managing mechanically ventilated patients, such as addressing patient-ventilator asynchronies that may contribute to patient harm. Waveform analysis is integral to the evaluation of patient-ventilator asynchronies; despite this, no published studies have assessed the ability of practicing RTs to interpret ventilator waveform abnormalities.

Methods

The study took place between June 2017-February 2019. Eighty-six RTs from 2 academic medical centers enrolled in a one-day mechanical ventilation course. The scores of 79 first-time attendees were included in the analysis. Prior to and following the course, RTs were asked to identify abnormalities on a 5-question, multiple-choice ventilator waveform exam. They were also asked to provide a self-assessment of their ventilator management skills on a 1 (complete novice) to 5 (expert) scale.

Results

Initial scores were low but improved after one day of ventilator instruction (19.4 ± 17.1 vs 29.6 ± 19.0, P < .001). No significant difference was noted in mean confidence levels between the pre- and post-course assessments (3.8 ± 0.9 vs 3.8 ± 1.0, P = 0.56). RTs with fewer years of clinical experience (0–10 y) had a statistically significant improvement in their post-course test scores relative to their pre-course scores (0–5 y: 12.5 ± 10.1 to 46.0 ± 10.8, P < .001; 6–10 y: 18.7 ± 15.8 to 32.1 ± 16.7, P = 0.02), whereas those with > 11 y of clinical experience did not (11–20 y: 22.4 ± 15.5 to 27.4 ± 19.0, P = 0.44; 21+ y: 19.6 ± 22.1 to 15.3 ± 13.8, P = 0.50).

Conclusions

RTs may benefit from additional training in ventilator waveform interpretation, especially early in their clinical training. More work is needed to determine the optimal length and content of a mechanical ventilation curriculum for RTs.

### Pulmonary care for ALS: progress, gaps, and paths forward [^111YsWNH]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). Medium credibility.

4 ∣ CURRENT STATE OF RESPIRATORY CARE IN ALS

4.1 ∣ Provision of respiratory care in ALS clinics

In the United States, the foundational guidelines for respiratory care in ALS arise from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) recommendations on respiratory and multidisciplinary care. Both the AAN guidelines and CMS use criteria for initiating NIV based on an expert consensus statement published in 1999. Consequently, most ALS clinics focus their respiratory monitoring around measuring FVC, maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), and nocturnal pulse oximetry.

Guidelines and organizations vary on recommendations for involving a pulmonologist in ALS care. The AAN guidelines do not mention involving a pulmonologist, and instead suggest involving a respiratory therapist as part of a multidisciplinary team. National organizations such as the ALS Association (ALSA) and Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) offer financial incentives to form multidisciplinary outpatient clinics.

ALSA recommends that pulmonologists focus on advising "… people living with ALS regarding major decisions about long-term respiratory and nutritional support". Although the overarching message from ALSA seems to suggest that a respiratory therapist drives respiratory care under most circumstances, ALSA recommendations do acknowledge that a pulmonologist may work collaboratively with the respiratory therapist. In contrast with ALSA and AAN guidelines, the MDA clearly designates (and requires) an MDA/ALS Care Center to include a pulmonologist as a core part of the team.

As an update to the 1999 Melo et al article mentioned previously, one of the most compelling recent reviews of practice patterns of respiratory care in ALS was published in 2018 by Heiman-Patterson et al. In a 2016 survey of centers within the Northeast ALS (NEALS) consortium on NIV practice patterns, 68% (39 of 57) of US respondents reported that initial NIV set-up was routinely performed in the patient's home by a respiratory therapist. Just over half of US centers reported early pulmonologist involvement, as 18 of 57 (32%) had the patient seen by a pulmonologist the same day, whereas 15 of 57 (26%) referred to a pulmonologist/other specialist outside of the ALS clinic for initiation of NIV. A low percentage of US centers (11 of 57, 19%) reported that a pulmonologist decides what type of equipment to use, significantly fewer than the 25 of 39 (64%) European respondents.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome: diagnosis and management… [^112Hx8kf]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

MECHANICAL VENTILATION Although mild cases of ARDS may respond to noninvasive ventilation, most patients require sedation, intubation, and ventilation while the underlying injury is treated. Any ventilator mode may be used. Prone positioning requires moving a patient from the traditional supine position while maintaining the integrity of the patient-ventilator circuit and all venous, arterial, urinary, and other access lines. Although the process is labor intensive and requires special training and beds, it is thought to improve ventilation-perfusion matching by recruiting more lung and allowing each inspired breath to be more uniformly distributed over a greater surface. Prone positioning is recommended for patients with severe ARDS and for those with moderate ARDS whose Pao. 2/Fio 2 ratio is less than 150. 33 When this technique is used, the position should be maintained for at least 12 to 16 hours per day.

25–27 Recruitment maneuvers are temporary elevations in airway pressures intended to expand collapsed lung and increase the surface available for gas exchange. Guidelines offer mixed recommendations on recruitment maneuvers; the more recent ones recommend against them, taking into account a trial that showed increased 28-day mortality rates among patients who underwent lung recruitment. 18 They recommend the ARDS Network's protocol for PEEP and tidal volume settings, and prone positioning for patients who cannot be adequately ventilated in the supine position. The DoD guidelines do not recommend routine neuromuscular blockade or use of inhaled nitric oxide. Venovenous ECMO is an option for patients with refractory hypoxemia. The World Health Organization likewise recommends early recognition, personal protection during intubation, and low tidal volumes.

63 It encourages plateau pressures less than 30 cm H 2O, prone positioning, conservative fluid management, higher PEEP values, and avoidance of routine neuromuscular blockade. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign makes similar recommendations: the use of high-flow nasal cannulas over noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, low tidal volumes in those requiring mechanical ventilation, plateau pressures less than 30 cm H. 2O, higher vs. lower PEEP values, a conservative fluid strategy, prone positioning and consideration of neuromuscular blockade for patients with moderate to severe ARDS, and consideration of inhaled pulmonary vasodilators and recruitment maneuvers. ECMO is recommended for patients with refractory hypoxemia. 65.

Pulmonary function testing quality reviewer — In the clinical pulmonary function laboratory, technicians, supervisors/managers, or computer software can assign quality grades, whereas in the clinical research setting, an independent quality reviewer is commonly used. This reviewer should be an expert in pulmonary function testing and have extensive experience, both in direct testing and in monitoring testing performed by others. If more than one reviewer is used, comparisons across reviewers should be done to ensure consistency, for example, with a blinded sample of good and bad test sessions.

### Pediatric respiratory therapists lack a standard mental model for managing the patient who is difficult to ventilate: a video review [^1115t9TM]. Respiratory Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

All health-care providers who care for infants and children should be able to effectively provide ventilation with a bag and a mask. Respiratory therapists (RTs'), as part of rapid response teams, need to quickly identify the need for airway support and use adjunct airway interventions when subjects are difficult to mask ventilate. Before implementation of an educational curriculum for airway management, we assessed whether pediatric RTs' who enter the room of a simulated infant mannequin in severe respiratory distress are able to apply bag-mask ventilation within 60 s and implement 2 adjunct airway maneuvers in a patient who is difficult to ventilate.

Methods

All pediatric RTs' were required to attend one high-fidelity simulation at the Johns Hopkins Medicine Simulation Center. The sessions were reviewed to evaluate whether the therapists would implement adjunct maneuvers to a patient who was in respiratory distress and was difficult to ventilate.

Results

Twenty-eight therapists participated in the baseline skills assessment session, and 26 (72% of eligible therapists) were evaluable with video clips. Only 3 of 26 (12%) attempted bag-mask ventilation within 60 s. Although all the therapists attempted one airway maneuver, only 65% were able to implement ≥ 2 airway maneuvers and achieve effective ventilation, with a wide range of time (98–298 s). There was no pattern regarding which intervention was implemented first, second, and so forth.

Conclusions

Our team of pediatric RTs' did not share a standard mental model for initiating bag-mask ventilation during impending respiratory failure or implementing airway adjuncts. This may place children who are critically ill at risk of suboptimal management and threaten clinical outcomes. Therapist performance indicated that no established care algorithm had been effectively implemented or that skill retention was poor. A change in the content and delivery method of bag-mask ventilation training is warranted to improve the time to performance of key interventions and to establish a clear cognitive framework of difficult mask ventilation management.

Regarding respiratory support for heart failure, more specifically with respect to mechanical ventilation, ESC 2021 guidelines recommend to consider initiating noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in patients with respiratory distress (respiratory rate > 25 breaths/min, SpO2 < 90%) and starting as soon as possible to decrease respiratory distress and reduce the rate of mechanical endotracheal intubation.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of acute respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^116PnC3M]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Availability, affordability, safety, and feasibility.

Initiating invasive ventilation based on clinical signs like fatigue and exhaustion, in combination with refractory hypoxemia, helps prioritize intubation in COVID-19 patients to the ones who really need it. However, close monitoring for worsening signs of respiratory symptoms could be a challenge in LMICs, in particular when less experienced healthcare workers have to take care of these patients in the surge of patients who need hospitalization. – When arterial blood gases are not available, the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio could be replaced by the SpO 2 /FiO 2 according to well-defined formulas. – When available, intubation teams formed by skilled professionals and with predefined protocols for airway management should be considered.

Recommendations and suggestions (Table 1).

1 In hypoxemic COVID-19 patients in LMICs, we recommend to intubate and initiate invasive ventilation based on signs of fatigue and respiratory distress more than on refractory hypoxemia alone (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).
2 In hypoxemic COVID-19 patients in LMICs, we recommend close monitoring for respiratory worsening and early intubation if worsening occurs (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).
3 In hypoxemic COVID-19 patients in LMICs, we recommend staff members to be readily available to closely monitoring a patient when an early intubation was not performed, and staff should be trained in timely recognition of respiratory distress and sign of worsening of respiratory distress (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).

How to set the ventilator in COVID-19 patients in LMICs?

Rationale.

Data to support evidence-based management of invasive ventilation in COVID-19 patients remain scarce. However, an adequate ventilatory strategy is frequently associated with better outcomes in patients receiving mechanical ventilation, and this should not be different in COVID-19 patients.

Exclusions and observation rules — patients with chronic fibrotic lung disease (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and stage IV sarcoidosis) are excluded from the LTVV PM and patients who die within 12 hours of intubation are also excluded; twice-daily observation settings should be collected and should count toward the PM until initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, a plan for withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, meeting ventilator weaning criteria, or discontinuation of mechanical ventilation; ventilator settings should not be reported from weaning assessments and patients subsequently deemed inappropriate for weaning will still be included in the PM denominator pool.
