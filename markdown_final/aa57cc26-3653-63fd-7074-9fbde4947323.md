## Question

What to order for a rash

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to order for a rash. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and red flags. Then, I should verify the core history elements that narrow the differential. Next, I will examine the physical exam features that drive testing. After that, I need to stratify by morphology and severity to choose labs and imaging. Then, I should consider special populations and drug-induced etiologies. Finally, I will outline when to escalate to biopsy, dermatology, or inpatient care, and close with a concise decision framework summary.

> Let me first confirm the priority: airway, breathing, circulation, and mental status come before any rash workup, and I need to screen for life-threatening causes like SJS/TEN, DRESS, meningococcemia, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and anaphylaxis, because delays in recognizing these can be fatal, so I should not wait for labs if the clinical picture is concerning [^ee7d974c] [^7565e82b] [^f44d06dc].

> Wait, let me verify the history elements that most efficiently narrow the differential: onset and evolution, distribution and morphology, associated symptoms such as fever, pruritus, pain, mucosal involvement, arthralgias, and systemic features, plus medication exposures including new drugs in the last 4–8 weeks, OTCs, and herbals, travel and animal exposures, immunocompromise, and prior similar rashes or atopy, because these steer me toward infectious, drug-induced, autoimmune, or vasculitic etiologies [^ee7d974c] [^36efc081].

> I will now examine the physical exam with a focus on morphology and distribution, since morphology is the primary driver of the differential: petechial/purpuric rashes raise concern for vasculitis, meningococcemia, or RMSF; vesiculobullous lesions push me to consider SJS/TEN, autoimmune bullous disease, or infections like HSV/VZV; maculopapular eruptions suggest viral exanthems or drug eruptions; and target lesions make me think erythema multiforme versus SJS/TEN, so I need to check for mucosal involvement, Nikolsky sign, and pain out of proportion to appearance [^7565e82b] [^960c77ba] [^3d99e66b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should stratify by severity and body surface area, because this determines urgency and level of care: any mucosal involvement, blistering, skin pain, or rapidly progressive eruption warrants urgent dermatology input and often hospitalization, while limited, nonpainful, nonblistering rashes without systemic symptoms can be managed outpatient with close follow-up and escalation if unchanged in 48–72 hours [^304b1740] [^ee7d974c].

> For petechial or purpuric rashes with fever, I need to check CBC with differential, platelets, PT/INR, aPTT, and consider blood cultures, because I must exclude sepsis, DIC, and vasculitis. In children with nonblanching rashes, validated algorithms can help decide on empiric antibiotics for possible meningococcal disease, but I should not wait for labs if the child is ill-appearing [^5656e42d] [^9a05d3d6] [^c325af01].

> For vesiculobullous eruptions or suspected SJS/TEN, I should confirm that immediate actions include stopping the culprit drug, obtaining CBC, CMP, and daily electrolytes, and arranging transfer to a burn center early, with dermatology and ophthalmology involved. I also need to consider skin biopsy for full-thickness epidermal necrosis if the diagnosis is uncertain or to distinguish from mimics, and I should remember that SJS/TEN is a clinical diagnosis with high mortality if management is delayed [^304b1740] [^3d99e66b] [^9c17e6e5].

> For maculopapular drug eruptions without mucosal involvement, I should double-check for systemic features and obtain CBC, CMP, and LFTs to screen for DRESS, and if there is facial edema, lymphadenopathy, or organ involvement, I need to escalate to systemic steroids and inpatient monitoring, because DRESS has a delayed onset and significant mortality if missed [^e4cfac0e] [^72f8addf].

> In immunocompromised patients, I need to ensure I broaden the differential to include atypical infections and drug reactions. HSV/VZV PCR from blood or lesion swabs can be decisive when the presentation is atypical, and I should maintain a low threshold for empiric acyclovir while awaiting results, especially with vesicular or ulcerative lesions [^7700b6b6] [^f5a670db].

> For suspected immune checkpoint inhibitor–related rashes, I should confirm grade by BSA and features, obtain CBC with differential and CMP, and involve dermatology early. Management is grade-based with topical steroids and antihistamines for low grade, and systemic steroids for grade 2–3, with permanent discontinuation for SCARs like SJS/TEN or DRESS, and I should document with serial photos to track response [^c841ebb1] [^309d660f] [^5fbc48cc].

> For targeted therapy rashes such as with alpelisib or BRAF/MEK inhibitors, I need to check whether prophylactic antihistamines were used and treat with topical steroids and antihistamines for low-grade rashes, escalating to oral steroids if BSA is ≥ 10% or ADLs are impaired, and I should coordinate with oncology to balance rash control against anticancer efficacy and hyperglycemia risk [^1ef3527d] [^47dab29a] [^04372e73].

> But wait, what if the rash is chronic, atypical, or refractory to standard therapy? In that case, I should reconsider the diagnosis and consider a skin biopsy to clarify morphology and guide therapy, and I should also review medications again for delayed drug reactions, because anchoring on an initial diagnosis can delay appropriate care [^5337b982] [^e758ab34].

> I should confirm pediatric nuances: in children with fever and nonblanching rash, I must balance overtesting versus missing meningococcal disease. Algorithms can support decision-making, but clinical judgment and close observation remain essential, and I should avoid anchoring on viral exanthems when red flags are present [^9a05d3d6] [^c325af01].

> Let me summarize the decision framework to ensure I have not missed anything: stabilize and screen for life threats first. Obtain a targeted history focused on onset, morphology, distribution, systemic symptoms, and drugs. Perform a full skin and mucosal exam. Stratify by morphology and severity. Order core labs such as CBC, CMP, and LFTs when systemic involvement is possible. Add infectious testing guided by exposure and morphology. Escalate to biopsy, dermatology, or inpatient care for severe, progressive, or refractory cases. And always reassess within 24–48 hours if the diagnosis is uncertain or the patient is not improving [^ee7d974c] [^36efc081] [^304b1740].

For a new rash, order a **focused history and physical exam** to characterize morphology, distribution, and systemic features [^ee7d974c]; obtain **CBC, CMP, and urinalysis** to screen for infection, organ involvement, or drug reactions [^304b1740]; and perform a **skin biopsy** if the diagnosis is unclear, the rash is atypical, or there is concern for vasculitis, malignancy, or severe drug reactions (SJS/TEN, DRESS) [^304b1740]. Add targeted tests based on suspicion: RPR/FTA-ABS for syphilis [^8daabde5], ANA/ENA for autoimmune disease, blood cultures for sepsis [^bed0efd7], viral PCR/serology for suspected infections (HSV, VZV, HIV, RMSF) [^7700b6b6] [^f44d06dc], and drug-specific tests for suspected hypersensitivity [^e4cfac0e]. Escalate to dermatology or hospitalization for severe, rapidly progressive, or systemic involvement [^304b1740].

---

## Initial clinical assessment

A thorough **history and physical examination** are essential to guide testing and management [^ee7d974c].

- **History**: onset, duration, progression, associated symptoms (fever, pruritus, pain, arthralgias, mucosal involvement), recent exposures (medications, chemicals, allergens, travel, sick contacts), medical history (autoimmune disease, immunodeficiency, malignancy), and family history of skin disorders [^58484bf6].

- **Physical examination**: morphology (maculopapular, vesicular, petechial, urticarial, bullous), distribution (localized, generalized, acral, truncal, mucosal), and systemic signs (fever, lymphadenopathy, organomegaly) [^7565e82b].

---

## Basic laboratory tests

Basic laboratory tests are indicated for most patients with a new rash, particularly when systemic involvement is suspected [^notfound].

| **Test** | **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Complete blood count (CBC) | - Routine <br/> - Suspected infection <br/> - Hematologic disorders | - Evaluate for infection <br/> - Anemia <br/> - Thrombocytopenia <br/> - Eosinophilia (e.g. drug reactions) [^304b1740] |
| Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) | - Routine <br/> - Suspected organ involvement | Assess renal and hepatic function; detect electrolyte disturbances [^304b1740] |
| Urinalysis | - Suspected renal involvement <br/> - Vasculitis | Detect proteinuria, hematuria, or casts indicating renal involvement [^notfound] |

---

## Targeted laboratory tests

Targeted tests are guided by clinical suspicion, rash morphology, and patient risk factors [^notfound].

| **Test** | **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) or fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) | - Suspected syphilis <br/> - Atypical rash <br/> - Mucosal involvement | Confirm or exclude syphilis, which can mimic many rashes [^notfound] |
| Antinuclear antibody (ANA) and extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) panel | - Suspected autoimmune disease (e.g. SLE, dermatomyositis) | Detect autoimmune markers [^notfound] |
| Blood cultures | - Suspected sepsis <br/> - Fever with rash | Identify bacteremia or endocarditis [^notfound] |
| Viral PCR or serology (HSV, VZV, HIV, RMSF) | - Suspected viral infection <br/> - Vesicular or petechial rash | Confirm viral etiology [^7700b6b6] [^f44d06dc] |
| Drug-specific tests (e.g. lymphocyte transformation test) | Suspected drug hypersensitivity (e.g. DRESS) | Identify culprit drug [^e4cfac0e] |

---

## Skin biopsy

Skin biopsy is indicated when the diagnosis is uncertain, the rash is atypical, or there is suspicion of serious conditions such as vasculitis, malignancy, or severe drug reactions (SJS/TEN, DRESS) [^304b1740]. Histopathology provides definitive diagnosis and guides management [^notfound].

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging is reserved for specific clinical scenarios, such as suspected deep infection, malignancy, or systemic disease. Chest X-ray or CT may be used for suspected sarcoidosis, malignancy, or infection; MRI for deep soft tissue infection or malignancy; and ultrasound for abscess or cellulitis.

---

## Indications for specialist referral

- **Dermatology**: Atypical rashes, suspected autoimmune or inflammatory skin diseases, severe drug reactions, chronic or refractory rashes [^304b1740].

- **Infectious diseases**: Suspected systemic infection, immunocompromised patients, travel-related rashes [^bed0efd7].

- **Rheumatology**: Suspected autoimmune diseases (e.g. SLE, vasculitis) [^notfound].

- **Oncology**: Suspected paraneoplastic rashes or cutaneous metastases [^5337b982].

---

## Summary of recommended tests

- **Routine tests**: CBC, CMP, urinalysis [^notfound].

- **Targeted tests**: RPR/FTA-ABS, ANA/ENA, blood cultures, viral PCR/serology, drug-specific tests [^notfound].

- **Skin biopsy**: Indicated for uncertain diagnoses, atypical rashes, or suspected serious conditions [^304b1740].

- **Imaging**: Reserved for specific clinical suspicions (e.g. deep infection, malignancy) [^bed0efd7].

---

The workup for a new rash should be **individualized** based on history, physical examination, and clinical suspicion. Start with basic labs and escalate to targeted tests, biopsy, and imaging as indicated, and involve specialists for atypical or severe cases [^ee7d974c].

### The generalized rash: part I. differential diagnosis [^36efc081]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Physicians often have difficulty diagnosing a generalized rash because many different conditions produce similar rashes, and a single condition can result in different rashes with varied appearances. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is critically important to make treatment decisions, especially when mortality or significant morbidity can occur without prompt intervention. When a specific diagnosis is not immediately apparent, it is important to generate an inclusive differential diagnosis to guide diagnostic strategy and initial treatment. In part I of this two-part article, tables listing common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rash are presented to help generate an inclusive differential diagnosis. The tables describe the key clinical features and recommended tests to help accurately diagnose generalized rashes. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the primary care physician must decide whether to observe and treat empirically, perform further diagnostic testing, or refer the patient to a dermatologist. This decision depends on the likelihood of a serious disorder and the patient's response to treatment.

### Cutaneous reactions to drugs in children [^50cde856]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Cutaneous eruptions are a commonly reported adverse drug reaction. Cutaneous adverse drug reactions in the pediatric population have a significant impact on patients' current and future care options. A patient's recollection of having a "rash" when they took a medication as a child is a frequent reason for not prescribing a particular treatment. The quick detection and treatment of cutaneous adverse drug reactions, plus identification of the causative agent, are essential for preventing the progression of the reaction, preventing additional exposures, and ensuring the appropriate use of medications for both the current condition and others as the patient ages. The purpose of this review is to discuss a reasonable approach to recognition and initial management of cutaneous adverse drug reactions in children.

### Fever and rash [^ee7d974c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Infectious causes of fever and rash pose a diagnostic challenge for the emergency provider. It is often difficult to discern rashes associated with rapidly progressive and life-threatening infections from benign exanthems, which comprise the majority of rashes seen in the emergency department. Physicians must also consider serious noninfectious causes of fever and rash. A correct diagnosis depends on an exhaustive history and head-to-toe skin examination as most emergent causes of fever and rash remain clinical diagnoses. A provisional diagnosis and immediate treatment with antimicrobials and supportive care are usually required prior to the return of confirmatory laboratory testing.

### Managing hyperglycemia and rash associated with alpelisib: expert consensus recommendations using the Delphi technique [^1ef3527d]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Rash treatment and management consensus recommendations per areas of agreement

Experts reviewed 364 scenarios/round for rounds 1 and 2. In round 2, agreement was reached in 79% of scenarios.

Based on expert consensus, it is recommended to give prophylactic nonsedating (H1) antihistamine therapy at standard dose for all patients starting alpelisib. These include once-daily dosing of cetirizine 10 mg, levocetirizine 5 mg, loratadine 10 mg, or fexofenadine 180 mg. Initial management for rash in patients who are on alpelisib include nonsedating H1 antihistamines and topical steroids (class I–III) such as fluocinonide 0.1%, triamcinolone acetonide 0.5%, or betamethasone dipropionate 0.05%. The choice of topical steroids depends on the body part and the affected BSA. Class I–II steroids are typically used on areas with thicker skin (e.g. soles of the feet), and should not be used on the face, groin, or axilla. Nonsedating H1 antihistamines may be escalated if response to standard-dose nonsedating H1 antihistamine is inadequate up to: cetirizine 40 mg/day, levocetirizine 15 mg/day, loratadine 20 mg/day, or fexofenadine 360 mg/day. High doses of nonsedating H1 antihistamines are well tolerated, but some patients may experience somnolence, sedation, or anticholinergic side effects –. For rash affecting > 10% BSA, it is appropriate to consult a specialist (dermatologist or allergist). Oral corticosteroid (OCS) therapy (e.g. prednisone) is recommended in patients with rash affecting ≥ 10% BSA, with a dose of 0.5–1 mg/kg. However, there was disagreement on recommending the use of OCS for patients with an FBG of ≥ 160 mg/dL presenting with rash for the first time, affecting 10–30% BSA or any BSA limiting instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs). OCS can lead to, or exacerbate, hyperglycemia; hence, exercise caution on its use in patients with elevated FBG. OCS therapy is generally discontinued within 2 weeks.

### Managing hyperglycemia and rash associated with alpelisib: expert consensus recommendations using the Delphi technique [^fad49ad0]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of rash to determine appropriate management should not only depend on BSA affected, but also its effect on the patient's ADLs. The only way to ascertain impact on ADLs is by asking the patient or caregiver. Regardless of initial management, re-evaluate patients who developed rash after 1–2 weeks, adjust antihistamine dose and topical steroids as needed.

Angioedema is an AE associated with alpelisib reported in the postmarketing setting, and refers to the swelling of the deeper layers of the skin, frequently observed in the eyelids, mouth or genitals, typically associated with urticaria or hives. Angioedema should be documented by an allergist and/or dermatologist. If a patient receiving alpelisib develops angioedema at initial rash management, either hold alpelisib and start OCS, or permanently discontinue alpelisib. If it persists or reoccurs, permanently discontinue alpelisib. The rash treatment algorithms and recommendations for the use of antihistamines based on the rash expert panel consensus are included in Fig. 3,– and Fig. 4.

### Managing hyperglycemia and rash associated with alpelisib: expert consensus recommendations using the Delphi technique [^47dab29a]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperglycemia and rash are expected but challenging adverse events of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibition (such as with alpelisib). Two modified Delphi panels were conducted to provide consensus recommendations for managing hyperglycemia and rash in patients taking alpelisib. Experts rated the appropriateness of interventions on a 1-to-9 scale; median scores and dispersion were used to classify the levels of agreement. Per the hyperglycemia panel, it is appropriate to start alpelisib in patients with HbA1c 6.5% (diabetes) to < 8%, or at highest risk for developing hyperglycemia, if they have a pre-treatment endocrinology consult. Recommend prophylactic metformin in patients with baseline HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4%. Metformin is the preferred first-line anti-hyperglycemic agent. Per the rash panel, initiate prophylactic nonsedating H1 antihistamines in patients starting alpelisib. Nonsedating H1 antihistamines and topical steroids are the preferred initial management for rash. In addition to clinical trial evidence, these recommendations will help address gaps encountered in clinical practice.

### Management of rash and other toxicities in patients treated with epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted agents [^06565224]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) represents one of the most important avenues for research and development in the field of cancer therapy. The EGFR is a member of the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase (TK) family, which also includes ErbB-2 (HER2/neu), ErbB-3 (HER3), and ErbB-4 (HER4). Current EGFR therapies available for use include monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, and small-molecule EGFR TK inhibition by agents such as erlotinib. Side effects of these agents include dermatologic manifestations without the bone marrow suppressive properties of chemotherapy. Understanding of rash and how it relates to EGFR inhibitor toxicity and, perhaps more importantly, EGFR inhibitor response must be more clearly defined with clinical trials. The optimum management of rash in patients receiving anti-EGFR therapy remains somewhat controversial; this is secondary to imprecise classification of rash as well as the lack of clinical trials to determine the most appropriate treatment algorithm for these patients. We propose a treatment strategy to help aggressively treat dermatologic side effects allowing patients to continue receiving therapy without dose interruption or drug discontinuation.

### Diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management of Kawasaki disease: a statement for health professionals from the committee on rheumatic fever, endocarditis and Kawasaki disease, council on cardiovascular disease in the young, American Heart Association [^4706d8e8]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Kawasaki disease is an acute self-limited vasculitis of childhood that is characterized by fever, bilateral nonexudative conjunctivitis, erythema of the lips and oral mucosa, changes in the extremities, rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Coronary artery aneurysms or ectasia develop in approximately 15% to 25% of untreated children and may lead to ischemic heart disease or sudden death.

Methods and Results

A multidisciplinary committee of experts was convened to revise the American Heart Association recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management of Kawasaki disease. The writing group proposes a new algorithm to aid clinicians in deciding which children with fever for ≥ 5 days and ≤ 4 classic criteria should undergo echocardiography, receive intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG) treatment, or both for Kawasaki disease. The writing group reviews the available data regarding the initial treatment for children with acute Kawasaki disease, as well for those who have persistent or recrudescent fever despite initial therapy with IVIG, including IVIG retreatment and treatment with corticosteroids, tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonists, and abciximab. Long-term management of patients with Kawasaki disease is tailored to the degree of coronary involvement; recommendations regarding antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy, physical activity, follow-up assessment, and the appropriate diagnostic procedures to evaluate cardiac disease are classified according to risk strata.

Conclusions

Recommendations for the initial evaluation, treatment in the acute phase, and long-term management of patients with Kawasaki disease are intended to assist physicians in understanding the range of acceptable approaches for caring for patients with Kawasaki disease. The ultimate decisions for case management must be made by physicians in light of the particular conditions presented by individual patients.

### The emerging zika virus threat: a guide for dermatologists [^b204bf7e]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

We provide a guide for dermatologists to follow if they encounter patients with a rash and clinical history suspicious of Zika virus infection, including diagnostic testing and management options. We also provide an illustrative case report of a patient from Brazil who was diagnosed with Zika virus infection after presenting with a generalized pruritic rash. One of the most prominent symptoms of Zika virus infection is a cutaneous eruption. As such, it is especially necessary for dermatologists to understand this virus so that they may appropriately recognize this entity as a diagnostic consideration in the clinic. The rash associated with Zika virus infection is most commonly an erythematous maculopapular eruption that presents after an initial 3–4 days of fever, headache, and arthralgia or myalgia. The rash typically lasts for an average of 6 days, and can spread to involve any part of the body, including the face, torso, extremities, palms, and soles.

### Rash decisions: an approach to dangerous rashes based on morphology [^7565e82b]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Rash is a common complaint in the emergency department. Many causes of rash are benign; however, some patients may have a life-threatening diagnosis.

Objective

This review will present an algorithmic approach to rashes, focusing on life-threatening causes of rash in each category.

Discussion

Rash is common, with a wide range of etiologies. The differential is broad, consisting of many conditions that are self-resolving. However, several conditions associated with rash are life threatening. Several keys can be utilized to rapidly diagnose and manage these deadly rashes. Thorough history and physical examination, followed by consideration of red flags, are essential. This review focuses on four broad categories based on visual and tactile characteristic patterns of rashes: petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. Rashes in each morphologic group will be further categorized based on clinical features such as the presence or absence of fever and distribution of skin lesions.

Conclusions

Rashes can be divided into petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. After this differentiation, the presence of fever and systemic signs of illness should be assessed. Through the breakdown of rashes into these classes, emergency providers can ensure deadly conditions are considered.

### The rash that becomes an erythroderma [^fc998c52]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Erythroderma is a dermatologic emergency with potentially serious consequences. Several diseases with different etiologies characteristically appear as erythroderma. Depending on the age groups, congenital ichthyosiform disorders, infections, preexisting dermatoses, drug eruptions, and internal malignancies commonly present with, or progress to, erythroderma. The course, prognosis, and management strategies also vary depending on the cause of erythroderma; hence, an accurate diagnosis is essential in minimizing associated morbidity and mortality. The generalized erythema and scaling often obscure the classic clinical features of the underlying skin diseases, posing a diagnostic challenge to dermatologists. Awareness and elicitation of subtle signs and clinical manifestations are crucial. A step-wise approach ensures completeness of clinical evaluation and avoids missing any relevant clinical data. The initial clinical presentation, cutaneous examination findings, and systemic clues reveal important information regarding the diagnosis, course, and prognosis of erythroderma. The age at onset, symptomatology, duration of illness, initial lesions, initial site of onset, clinical course, family history, types of scales, changes in cutaneous integuments and systemic clues will assist in delineating the nature of underlying disease.

### HER1 / EGFR inhibitor-associated rash: future directions for management and investigation outcomes from the HER1 / EGFR inhibitor rash management forum [^91ac588b]. The Oncologist (2005). Low credibility.

Skin rash associated with HER1/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors is common. The lack of clinical and patient guidance for this often chronic and sometimes distressing side effect makes rash management and etiology investigation high priorities. To address this, oncologists and dermatologists with experience with HER1/EGFR inhibitors attended the HER1/EGFR Inhibitor Rash Management Forum. Recommendations include continued analysis of the correlation between rash and clinical outcome and improving the accuracy and reproducibility of terminology and grading systems. Because acne vulgaris has a unique pathology, and the pathology and etiology of rash are unclear yet distinct from acne vulgaris, using such terms as acne, acne-like, or acneiform should be avoided. Until there is a specific dermatological definition, rash is best described using phenotypic terms for its appearance and location. It is currently unknown which agents are best for treating rash. Clinical trials of rash treatments are urgently required, and suggestions for agents to consider are made based on current knowledge. The effect of dose reduction or interruption on rash should also be investigated. Secondarily infected rash may be more frequent than has been previously recognized, and some investigators favor empiric use of an oral antibiotic if this appears to be the case. Suggestions for patients include makeup to camouflage the rash and an emollient to prevent and alleviate skin dryness. The increasing use of HER1/EGFR-targeted agents makes managing rash important. We hope the outcomes from this Forum provide background for future studies.

### Pediatric recurrent fever and autoinflammation from the perspective of an allergist / immunologist [^c29c6637]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Autoinflammatory diseases are monogenic and polygenic disorders due to dysregulation of the innate immune system. The inherited conditions have been clustered with primary immunodeficiencies in the latest practice parameters; however, these diseases have unique clinical presentations, genetics, and available therapies. Given the presentation of fevers, rashes, and mucosal symptoms observed in many of these syndromes, patients are likely to present to an allergist/immunologist. Although there has been attention in the literature to diagnosis and treatment of rare, genetically defined autoinflammatory disorders, physicians are challenged by increasing numbers of patients with intermittent or periodic fevers who face unnecessary morbidities due to a lack of a diagnosis. The broad differential of diseases presenting with fever includes autoinflammatory syndromes, infections associated with immunodeficiency and/or allergies complicated by infection, and less commonly, autoimmune disorders or malignancy. To address this challenge, we review the history of the medical approach to fever, current diagnostic paradigms, and controversies in management. We describe the spectrum of disorders referred to a recurrent fever disorders clinic established in an Allergy/Immunology division at a tertiary pediatric care center. Finally, we provide practical recommendations including historical features and initial laboratory investigations that can help clinicians appropriately manage these patients.

### Fever, rash, and cough in a 7-year-old boy [^728b600e]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

A 7-year-old boy presented to the emergency department with fever, cough, congestion, abdominal pain, myalgias, and morbilliform rash. Several aspects of the patient's history, including recent travel, living on a farm, exposure to sick contacts, and new medications, resulted in a wide differential diagnosis. Initial laboratory testing revealed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and elevated atypical lymphocytes, but did not reveal any infectious causes of illness. He was discharged from the hospital, but then represented to the emergency department a day later with worsening rash, continued fever, abdominal pain, and poor intake. He was then admitted. A more comprehensive laboratory evaluation was initiated. During this hospital course, the patient's physical examination changed when he developed head and neck edema, and certain laboratory trends became clearer. With the assistance of several specialists, the team was able to reach a more definitive diagnosis and initiate treatment to appropriately manage his condition.

### Infant with a rapidly progressing rash [^b5c8a91e]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

An infant presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of rapidly progressing erythematous macules and distal oedema. The rash was striking in appearance, covering most of the body, which raised concern for pressing infectious (eg, meningococcaemia) and other serious aetiologies. Nevertheless, the infant remained playful and was overall stable and posed a diagnostic and management dilemma. After an extensive workup and multispecialty consultations, the patient was eventually diagnosed with acute haemorrhagic oedema of infancy, a benign leucocytoclastic vasculitis. The patient received no treatment and resolution of the rash occurred within 7 days of onset. Recognition of this condition and its benign nature can spare patients from an extensive workup and reduce anxiety for both family members and healthcare providers.

### Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia: prevention and management [^1144a2e5]. American Family Physician (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for herpes zoster, more specifically with respect to systemic antiviral therapy, AAFP 2017 guidelines recommend to initiate acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir ideally within 72 hours of the appearance of the rash to decrease the duration of symptoms and severity of pain in patients with HZ.

### DRESS syndrome: part II. management and therapeutics [^e4cfac0e]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The appropriate management of the drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is paramount because it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This syndrome shares clinical features with other dermatologic conditions, including other severe cutaneous drug reactions, requiring the clinician to carefully examine the proposed criteria to make the appropriate diagnosis. Once the diagnosis of DRESS syndrome has been established, the next step in management is immediate cessation of the causative medication(s). In cases in which the culprit drug is not obvious, clinicians must use their clinical judgment to select which medication to discontinue. They may also utilize patch or lymphocyte transformation tests to aid in identification when appropriate. Topical corticosteroids can be used for symptomatic relief, but systemic steroid therapy is generally required. Other immunosuppressants have also been employed in treatment and show promise in future therapy. Patients with DRESS syndrome should be managed in an intensive care or burn unit for appropriate care and infection control. In addition, appropriate specialists should be consulted based on the affected organ systems. Most patients recover completely after drug withdrawal and appropriate therapy. However, some patients with DRESS syndrome suffer from chronic complications and approximately 10% die, primarily from visceral organ compromise. Controlled clinical trials investigating the most appropriate therapies and their risks, particularly intravenous corticosteroids, are lacking, and would be invaluable in determining the optimal future treatment regimen for DRESS syndrome.

An evidence summary (literature review) was developed for each panel based on recent reviews, clinical trials, case studies, guidelines, and real-world evidence obtained from targeted searches of the PubMed database on October 5, 2021, using the following search terms: "(alpelisib) AND (hyperglycemia)" and "(alpelisib) AND ((rash) OR (drug rash))". The full search strategy is provided in Supplementary Table 1, and the list of publications reviewed is provided in Supplementary Table 2. For each panel, a structured questionnaire was developed based on the summary of current evidence in collaboration with panelists on the mechanism of action, risk factors, and management strategies for hyperglycemia and rash associated with alpelisib in patients with HR+, HER2– ABC.

The Delphi process involved 2 rounds per panel: in each round, experts were asked to review the evidence and rate the appropriateness of (in total) 1433 clinical interventions for hyperglycemia or 728 clinical interventions for rash on hypothetical patient scenarios using a scale of 1 (highly inappropriate, risks outweigh the benefits) to 9 (highly appropriate, benefits outweigh the risks). Aggregated first-round rating form results were reviewed at a virtual meeting. A moderator guided the discussion, focusing on items that generated the most disagreement, and ensured that feedback from all panelists was captured. Results from round 1 and the meeting discussion informed iterations needed for the round 2 rating form. No formal attempt to reach consensus was made during the meeting. Instead, at the conclusion of the meeting, experts completed the rating form a second time. Experts on the hyperglycemia panel decided some portions of the rating form needed to be revised and agreed to convene at a follow-up meeting to discuss their ratings of the revised sections.

Data analysis

Data from the final rating form were then classified into 4 categories based on the median scores and dispersion. Disagreement was defined as being present if there were ≥ 2 ratings of 1–3 and ≥ 2 ratings of 7–9 for an intervention. The remaining categories were "appropriate", defined as a median score of 7–9; "may or may not be appropriate", defined as a median score of 4–6; and "inappropriate", defined as a median score of 1–3; all without disagreement. For each panel, consensus statements and treatment algorithms were developed based on these ratings and were considered final after the review and approval of all panelists.

### Update on Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: diagnosis and management [^3d99e66b]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Assessment

Red flags on initial examination include skin pain, prodromal symptoms and mucositis in relation to a rapidly developing extensive rash. On presentation, a thorough skin examination should be conducted to evaluate the extent of cutaneous involvement, along with examination by ophthalmology, urology, and gynecology specialists for mucosal involvement. Skin, ocular, and oral examinations should be conducted daily. Patients should also be closely examined and monitored for systemic involvement. Laboratory assessment including complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess electrolyte status in the setting of significant insensible losses, and baseline arterial blood gas to determine respiratory status are essential on initial evaluation. Additionally, electrolytes, glucose, and fluid balance should be monitored daily during admission and managed appropriately. Imaging should be obtained if clinically indicated. Given the high prevalence of oral and mucosal involvement, it is also critical to evaluate if there is a need for orotracheal intubation.

Diagnosis

There are no standard diagnostic criteria for SJS/TEN, though the presence of macular targetoid lesions, involvement of two mucous membranes, recent drug exposure, and corresponding histopathology are all suggestive. As defined in the introduction, the clinical differentiation between SJS and TEN is based on body surface area involvement specifically of detached or detachable skin. Other lesions that may appear on intact skin (and thus do not count towards BSA involvement), include morbilliform rash, erythematous macules or patches, purpura, and targetoid lesions. SJS is when < 10% BSA is affected, SJS-TEN overlap is 10%–30% BSA, and TEN is > 30% BSA.

Clinical features of SJS/TEN can mimic other dermatologic diseases, including erythema multiforme, reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption, generalized bullous fixed drug eruption, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, pemphigus vulgaris, and acute graft versus host disease, among others (Table 2). It is important to differentiate between these conditions, as they have different treatments and prognoses. In particular, note that Nikolsky sign is not pathognomonic for SJS/TEN alone, as it can be present in multiple diseases.

### A 59-year-old man with a rash and hearing loss [^f3c683f9]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 59-year-old man who initially had a sore throat, a truncal rash, and fever. Two weeks later, arthralgias and abrupt bilateral hearing loss developed. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is refined until a diagnosis is made.

### The role of dermocosmetics in the management of cancer-related skin toxicities: international expert consensus [^e9d60850]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Maculopapular rash

Maculopapular rash is also associated with a variety of anticancer treatments and may be both more common and more severe with combination therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors with cytotoxic drugs (Table 1). Maculopapular rashes may appear as early as within the first 2 weeks of anticancer treatment and may be accompanied by non-cutaneous symptoms such as fever. There is evidence to show that Grade 1 rash may be managed with emollients and appropriate skin cleansers. Rash severity may be a surrogate marker of anticancer therapy efficacy, so every effort should be made to manage the patient's symptoms with dermocosmetics and skin care to allow continuation of therapy as long as possible.

It is important to verify whether severe rash (grades 3 or higher by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events definition) is not a cutaneous toxicity that would necessitate drug interruption. In some cases, a topical corticosteroid and antihistamines can be added to allow therapy to continue.

### Alectinib-induced rash unresponsive to desensitization: a case report and literature review [^818e6792]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

With the discovery of new treatment modalities for non-small cell lung cancer there is increased opportunity for greater progression free survival and overall survival in patients dealing with the disease. One such modality is targeted therapy which, as suggested by its name, targets specific molecular alterations found in certain patient populations with NSCLC. One of these alterations is that of the ALK gene which causes the formation of the novel fusion oncogene EML4–ALK that is found in up to 7% of NSCLC cases. Albeit in a small subset of cases, it is noted that this genetic alteration appears more frequently in patients with adenocarcinoma, female, younger age, and never to light smokers demonstrating an important mutation to search for in this cohort of patients presenting with NSCLC.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have proven to be successful in treating NSCLC patients with ALK mutations. Second generation TKIs such as Alectinib and Brigatinib are quickly overtaking their predecessor Crizotinib in efficacy and superiority with increased progression free survival. Despite the success of these newer medications, there are still side effects from these therapies which can affect the ability of patients to continue with these treatment modalities. One of the side effects is rash presentation which, although rare, is important to identify in order to come up with the best management approach. In Alectinib usage, grade 3 level rash formation was found in only 1% of the patients as reported in the ALEX trial. Within both the ALEX and J–ALEX trial, the management for the development of rash was to reduce the dosage of the medication. No consensus was determined in providing the best opportunity for eradication of this side effect.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^c841ebb1]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Cutaneous toxicities — rash or inflammatory dermatitis grading and management (G1–G2): G1 is "Rash covering < 10% BSA, which may or may not be associated with symptoms of pruritus or tenderness", managed by "Continue ICPI", "Treat with topical emollients and/or mild-moderate potency topical corticosteroids", and "Counsel patients to avoid skin irritants". G2 is "Rash covering 10%-30% BSA with or without symptoms (eg, pruritus, burning, and tightness); limiting instrumental ADL; rash covering > 30% BSA with or without mild symptoms", and management states "Consider holding ICPI and monitor weekly for improvement. If skin toxicity is not improved after 4 weeks, then regrade toxicity as grade 3", add topical emollients, oral antihistamines, and medium-to-high potency topical corticosteroids, and "Consider initiating prednisone (or equivalent) at dosing 0.5–1 mg/kg, tapering over 4 weeks", with topical anti-itch remedies for pruritus without rash.

### Management of adverse events in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer treated with everolimus: observations from a phase III clinical trial [^15da9449]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Rash

Rash induced by treatment with mTOR inhibitors (Table 1) typically occurs as maculopapular or papulopustular lesions, often with pruritus, and erythematous papules or pustules usually constitute the primary lesion morphology. Rash primarily occurs on the trunk, scalp, face, and neck, with extremities commonly involved. The condition generally appears during the first months of everolimus treatment and is most often grade 1 to 2 in severity.

Management recommendations

Patient awareness and early intervention is important for managing rash. Patients should be informed of the possibility of developing rash and should promptly report the first signs or symptoms in order to initiate early intervention. Patients should also be educated on the need for moisturizing frequently; using a thick, alcohol-free emollient cream such as Eucerin®, Aquaphor®, or Cetaphil®; taking short, lukewarm showers; using mild moisturizing, fragrance-free soap; and bathing in lukewarm water with one to two cups of baking soda or Aveeno® bath treatment added to the water. Patients should also be advised to use a sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher, preferably containing zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, in order to minimize sun exposure. Management strategies when rash develops should be based on clinical phenotype. For grade 1 papulopustular rash, a course of topical low- to moderate-strength corticosteroid and topical antibiotics should be sufficient; for grade 3 or intolerable grade 2 rashes, oral antibiotics for 2 to 4 weeks are advocated. For grade 1 maculopapular rash, topical low- to moderate-strength corticosteroids and oral antihistamines should be considered; for grade 3 or intolerable grade 2 rashes, oral corticosteroids and dose reduction/interruption may be required.

### Diagnosis and management of tickborne rickettsial diseases: rocky mountain spotted fever and other spotted fever group rickettsioses, ehrlichioses, and anaplasmosis-United States [^f44d06dc]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) pathophysiology and clinical presentation — timing, rash features, and diagnostic cautions — include that symptoms of RMSF typically appear 3–12 days after the bite of an infected tick or between the fourth and eighth day after discovery of an attached tick, and the incubation period is generally shorter (5 days or less) in patients who develop severe disease. Initial symptoms include sudden onset of fever, headache, chills, malaise, and myalgia, and other early symptoms might include nausea or vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia, and photophobia. A rash typically appears 2–4 days after the onset of fever, and the classic triad of fever, rash, and reported tick bite is present in only a minority of patients during initial presentation; therefore, health care providers should not wait for development of this triad before considering a diagnosis of RMSF. The RMSF rash classically begins as small (1–5 mm in diameter), blanching pink macules on the ankles, wrists, or forearms that subsequently spread and the classic spotted or generalized petechial rash usually appears by day 5 or 6 and is indicative of advanced disease. Absence of rash should not preclude consideration of RMSF; ≤ 50% of patients have a rash in the first 3 days of illness, children aged < 15 years more frequently have a rash than older patients, and unlike some SFG rickettsioses, an inoculation eschar is rarely present with RMSF. Rickettsia rickettsii primarily infects vascular endothelial cells leading to systemic vasculitis; pathogen-mediated endothelial injury results in increased capillary permeability, microhemorrhage, and platelet consumption, with late-stage manifestations including noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) and cerebral edema, and hyponatremia occurs as a result of appropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone in response to hypovolemia; if disease progresses untreated, it can result in end-organ damage associated with severe morbidity and death.

Regarding medical management for Erdheim-Chester disease - NCCN, more specifically with respect to considerations for targeted therapy (management of BRAF and MEK inhibitor-associated toxicities), NCCN 2021 guidelines recommend to obtain regular dermatologic evaluation and refer to a dermatologist or provider experienced in the diagnosis and management of cutaneous manifestations of targeted therapy. Recognize that BRAF inhibitors are associated with cutaneous SCC, extreme photosensitivity, and other dermatologic toxicities, which occur much less often with concurrent MEK inhibitors. Severe and life-threatening skin toxicity, such as drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, can occur with the use of BRAF inhibitors following immune checkpoint blockade and requires prompt dermatologic consultation for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Recognize that cutaneous toxicities of MEK inhibitors most commonly manifest as acneiform rash. Consider using topical benzoyl peroxide with or without oral doxycycline or minocycline at the onset of rash.

### Verrucous herpes treated as condyloma acuminata: a case of cognitive bias [^e758ab34]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

This patient's rash was incorrectly labeled as CA, and this diagnosis carried forward through his subsequent visits. His clinical history of immunocompromised state and atypical presentation were not considered, while they should have warranted a thorough workup. Although alternative diagnoses were documented during the initial consult, no further evaluation was done, and they were not reconsidered until 2 years later. Verrucous lesions having similar clinical features may have different etiologies, highlighting the importance of a broad differential and a high level of clinical suspicion.

Availability bias, which relies on the mental shortcut of immediate examples that come to mind, can lead physicians to consider prevalent diseases more frequently and forgo the less common. Anchoring is the tendency to stick with the initial impression, even when new information becomes available. These biases are a trap into which even the most experienced physicians can fall victim and studies have found that anchoring and availability are some of the most common biases associated with diagnostic inaccuracies. We believe both contributed to our patient's delay in diagnosis. Anchoring is often accompanied by confirmation bias, the tendency to interpret new data as confirmation of the preliminary diagnosis. Serious problems can arise when initial impressions are incorrect, as these biases together can cause physicians to confirm their initial impressions, become "anchored" in their diagnosis, and unconsciously ignore contradictory evidence and lead to further management errors. Busy clinics with multiple providers, who have inadequate time to review previous notes are not uncommon, and in most electronic medical records, finding inpatient and ER notes requires extra steps and a more thorough search. Though it takes extra time, a careful review of a patient's records and a comprehensive differential can improve patient outcomes. After years of ineffective treatment, our patient was eventually diagnosed with a verrucous herpetic dermatitis and started on appropriate therapy.

This case is a reminder that different dermatologic conditions may present similarly, and our initial impressions and past experiences can influence our diagnosis. Biases have the potential to seriously impact the quality, consistency, and accuracy of diagnoses and therapeutic management. This case highlights the importance of being aware of these biases, and importantly, sharing difficult cases, even when they include errors, so that we all can learn.

### Heterogeneity in the evaluation of suspected MIS-C: a cross-sectional vignette-based survey [^32d63261]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is an emerging complication of COVID-19 which lacks a definitive diagnostic test and evidence-based guidelines for workup. We sought to assess practitioners' preferences when initiating a workup for pediatric patients presenting with symptoms concerning for MIS-C.

Methods

In a cross-sectional vignette-based survey, providers were presented with clinical vignettes of a patient presenting with 24 h of fever from a community with high rates of COVID-19. Respondents were asked about their general practices in pursuing a workup for potential MIS-C including testing obtained, criteria for diagnosis, and timing to confirm or rule out the diagnosis.

Results

Most of the 174 respondents were physicians from the United States at academic medical centers. The majority of providers would not initiate MIS-C workup for fever and non-specific symptoms unless the fever lasted more than 72 h. Skin rash, abdominal pain, and shortness of breath were symptoms that raised greatest concern for MIS-C. Most providers would obtain COVID-19 PCR or antigen testing, plus blood work, in the initial workup. The list of laboratory studies providers would obtain is extensive. Providers primarily rely on cardiac involvement to confirm a MIS-C diagnosis, and establishing a diagnosis takes 24–48 h.

Conclusions

Significant heterogeneity exists amongst providers as to when to initiate the MIS-C workup, the order and content of the workup, and how to definitively diagnose MIS-C. A diagnostic test with high sensitivity and specificity for MIS-C and refined evidence-based guidelines are needed to expedite diagnosis and treatment.

### The "Petechiae in children" (PiC) study: evaluating potential clinical decision rules for the management of feverish children with non-blanching rashes, including the role of point of care testing for procalcitonin&Neisseria meningitidis DNA-a study protocol [^27589a6c]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Early diagnosis of meningococcal disease (MD) is associated with improved outcomes including reduced morbidity and mortality. However during its prodrome phase invasive MD, which most often presents with a fever and non-blanching rash (NBR), is indistinguishable from many self-limiting viral infections, creating a significant diagnostic challenge for clinicians. This combination of features is a common presentation to Emergency Departments (ED) and inevitably leads to caution amongst clinicians, resulting in admission and administration of broad spectrum antibiotics to large numbers of children who do not have MD. Despite this cautious approach a cohort of children are still diagnosed late. Paediatric Emergency Research in the UK and Ireland (PERUKI, a research collaborative) highlighted these challenges in the context of a paucity of relevant evidence, and identified the derivation of a clinical decision rule (CDR) for the management of feverish children with NBRs as a priority for future research.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events [^309d660f]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Skin toxicity panel recommendations

The following recommendations are intended to be used within the framework of toxicity management, including direction for at what grade of toxicity to hold and/or permanently cease treatment, considerations for life-threatening toxicities, as well as recommendations on optimal timing and dosing for administration of corticosteroids and/or other immunosuppressive agents by grade of AE, discussed in the General panel recommendations section. Any skin-specific exceptions or additional considerations are noted in the recommendations below.

For patients with pruritus without rash, treatment with high-potency topical corticosteroids and GABA agonists may be considered (LE: 4).
Workup for patients with potential ICI-related rash (grade < 3) should include CBC with differential, CMP, assessment of the percentage body surface area involved by the rash, assessment of special features (eg, bullous formation, mucosal involvement), and patient history of allergy or atopy. Referral to a dermatologist should be considered.
Workup for patients with potential ICI-related rash (grade ≥ 3) should also include referral to a dermatologist and possible skin biopsy.
Rash with blisters, mucosal involvement, or bullous formation should trigger suspicion of lichenoid rash, pemphigus, pemphigoid, or SJS/TEN and follow-up testing, including skin biopsy with direct immunofluorescence studies and serum antibodies to desmogleins 1 and 3, bullous pemphigoid antigens 1 and 2, and indirect immunofluorescence studies in salt-split skin. ICI therapy should be interrupted until resolution or significant improvement of symptoms.
If ICI-related rash does not respond to topical or oral corticosteroids, is grade ≥ 3, or is intolerable, a dermatological consultation is recommended.
Grade ≥ 2 dermatological events (rash, pruritus) may recur after steroid taper. Therefore, a dermatological consultation or use of a steroid-sparing agent is recommended (rituximab for pemphigus (LE: 1) or bullous pemphigoid (LE: 4), dupilumab for eczema (LE: 1), infliximab for lichenoid rash, and omalizumab for urticaria/pruritus (LE: 1)).
Patients who have experienced grade 3 ICI-related rash may be re-challenged with ICIs. Rash that does not respond to immunosuppressive therapy should underscore the possibility of an infection and corresponding cultures should be obtained.

### The rash that becomes purpuric, petechial, hemorrhagic, or ecchymotic [^5656e42d]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhagic rashes are observed in a wide variety of conditions, ranging from harmless to life-threatening. This review offers a stepwise approach, which helps limit the possible differential diagnoses based on the clinical manifestations and the clinical picture. The most common and most important conditions, including infectious, coagulation and embolic disorders, vasculitides, and vasculopathies, are briefly reviewed focusing on morphology. Dermatologists often need to distinguish among infectious, reactive, or autoimmune etiologies of the rash and determine if the condition is dangerous or even life-threatening in order to make the right decision. Dermatologic expertise provides vital input in the diagnosis and care of complex interdisciplinary patients, such as those with sepsis, purpura fulminans, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

### The "Petechiae in children" (PiC) study: evaluating potential clinical decision rules for the management of feverish children with non-blanching rashes, including the role of point of care testing for procalcitonin&Neisseria meningitidis DNA-a study protocol [^c325af01]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Children commonly present to Emergency Departments (ED) with a non-blanching rash in the context of a feverish illness. While most have a self-limiting viral illness, this combination of features potentially represents invasive serious bacterial infection, including meningococcal septicaemia. A paucity of definitive diagnostic testing creates diagnostic uncertainty for clinicians; a safe approach mandates children without invasive disease are often admitted and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Conversely, a cohort of children still experience significant mortality and morbidity due to late diagnosis. Current management is based on evidence which predates (i) the introduction of meningococcal B and C vaccines and (ii) availability of point of care testing (POCT) for procalcitonin (PCT) and Neisseria meningitidis DNA.

Methods

This PiC study is a prospective diagnostic accuracy study evaluating (i) rapid POCT for PCT and N. meningitidis DNA and (ii) performance of existing clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for feverish children with non-blanching rash. All children presenting to the ED with a history of fever and non-blanching rash are eligible. Children are managed as normal, with detailed prospective collection of data pertinent to CPGs, and a throat swab and blood used for rapid POCT. The study is running over 2 years and aims to recruit 300 children.

Primary Objective

Report on the diagnostic accuracy of POCT for (i) N. meningitidis DNA and (ii) PCT in the diagnosis of early MD Report on the diagnostic accuracy of POCT for PCT in the diagnosis of Invasive bacterial infection Secondary objectives: Evaluate the performance accuracy of existing CPGs Evaluate cost-effectiveness of available diagnostic testing strategies Explore views of (i) families and (ii) clinicians on research without prior consent using qualitative methodology Report on the aetiology of NBRs in children with a feverish illness DISCUSSION: The PiC study will provide important information for policy makers regarding the value of POCT and on the utility and cost of emerging diagnostic strategies. The study will also identify which elements of existing CPGs may merit inclusion in any future study to derive clinical decision rules for this population.

### A painful rash on a white woman [^5337b982]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

A 78-year-old woman presented to the dermatology clinic with a 4-week history of an itchy, painful, pink-red progressively worsening rash on her chest and neck (Fig 1). Her history included remote breast cancer and metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with known axillary nodal involvement. At presentation, she was undergoing treatment of her metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with pembrolizumab, carboplatin, and pemetrexed for the last 6 months, and had undergone radiation to axillary lymph node metastases in previous months. Physical examination found thin pink-red plaques around her neck and chest. She denied fever or chills. She was prescribed a 2-week prednisone taper and triamcinolone 0.1% ointment with 1-month follow-up arranged where she demonstrated no response to treatment.

Question 1: What is the best next step in caring for this patient?
A. Perform biopsy of lesion.
B. Prescribe betamethasone dipropionate to apply 3 times daily.
C. Swab lesion and perform polymerase chain reaction.
D. Reassurance that rash is self-limiting and will resolve.
E. Admit for intravenous cefazolin.

Answers:
A. Perform biopsy of lesion – Correct. In this patient with history of malignancies, biopsy should be done of the lesion to rule out metastasis of internal malignancy.
B. Prescribe betamethasone dipropionate to apply 3 times daily – Incorrect. This patient had attempted oral and topical steroids with no relief of symptoms/rash. At this point, another round of steroids would be inappropriate.
C. Swab lesion and perform polymerase chain reaction – Incorrect. This would be appropriate if herpes zoster was suspected. This patient's rash does not consist of papules or vesicles expected of herpes zoster and does not follow a dermatomal distribution.
D. Reassurance that rash is self-limiting and will resolve – Incorrect. This patient's rash has persisted for greater than 4 weeks. Her history of malignancy is concerning, and as such reassurance would be inappropriate at this time.
E. Admit for intravenous cefazolin – Incorrect. This would be the correct option if erysipelas or severe cellulitis was suspected. We would expect this patient to display acute-onset systemic symptoms such as fever; her rash developed slowly over 4 weeks and not as acutely as one would expect with erysipelas.

### Consensus recommendations on management of selumetinib-associated adverse events in pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and plexiform neurofibromas [^f444beb3]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Acneiform Rash

13 For mild acneiform rashes, patients should use a topical antibiotic and/or low-potency topical corticosteroid.

Overall, topical antibiotics are typically the first choice of treatment. Topical corticosteroids are then added only if notable inflammation is present with no sign of infection. Swabs should be considered to guide therapy if appropriate.

14 For patients with severe acneiform rashes, physicians should consider using semisynthetic oral tetracyclines. If the patient is aged < 8 years, the use of topical antibiotics is preferred.

Oral antibiotics can be considered in more severe cases. Empirical treatment in line with acne management guidelines is recommended, unless bacterial swab sensitivities are available to guide treatment choice. Oral tetracyclines should be used for 2–6 weeks, as long as the patient is symptomatic. Minocycline is sometimes used; however, it is not recommended due to its associated AE profile. Systemic doxycycline treatment has been used to successfully treat a case of iatrogenic MEK1/2 inhibitor-induced acneiform rash following a slight worsening of the skin lesions after initial treatment with topical erythromycin cream and fusidic acid plus betamethasone cream. Resolution of a case of recalcitrant selumetinib-induced paronychia with doxycycline following treatment with various antibiotics, topical medications, and surgeries that were only deemed to be minimally effective, has also been reported for a 12-year-old patient with NF1. Therefore, doxycycline may be an acceptable therapeutic agent for patients aged ≥ 8 years with dermatologic AEs that have otherwise been difficult to treat.

Differential diagnosis of fever and rash — tickborne rickettsial diseases: The differential is broad, and early in illness these diseases can be clinically indistinguishable from many viral exanthems and other illnesses, particularly in children, and can be mistaken for conditions including viral gastroenteritis, upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, nonrickettsial bacterial sepsis, TTP, idiopathic vasculitides, or viral or bacterial meningoencephalitides. Despite nonspecific initial symptoms, early consideration in the differential diagnosis and empiric treatment is critical in preventing poor outcomes, especially for RMSF, which progresses rapidly without treatment.

### The mydriatic red eye as the initial presentation of syphilis [^8daabde5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that has been increasing in prevalence since the early 2000s. Ocular involvement occurs in a minority of patients and must be in the differential diagnosis for patients who present with red eye and uveitis.

Case Report

A 29-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a painful, mydriatic red eye. Review of systems revealed a rash as well as a recent genital lesion and, on further questioning, she admitted to a history of intravenous drug use and high-risk sexual activity. Ophthalmology was consulted and the patient was diagnosed with bilateral uveitis. Serologic testing was positive for syphilis, and she was admitted and treated with intravenous penicillin, with resolution of her uveitis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Red eye is a common ocular symptom in patients presenting to the emergency department. The differential diagnosis of the red eye is broad and can range from benign etiologies, such as conjunctivitis, to life- and sight-threatening conditions, such as endogenous endophthalmitis. Systemic diseases such as syphilis may present with primarily ocular symptoms, and ocular syphilis must be identified and managed appropriately to prevent devastating sequelae.

Recognize that BRAF inhibitors are associated with cutaneous SCC, extreme photosensitivity, and other dermatologic toxicities, which occur much less often with concurrent MEK inhibitors. Severe and life-threatening skin toxicity, such as drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, can occur with the use of BRAF inhibitors following immune checkpoint blockade and requires prompt dermatologic consultation for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Recognize that cutaneous toxicities of MEK inhibitors most commonly manifest as acneiform rash. Consider using topical benzoyl peroxide with or without oral doxycycline or minocycline at the onset of rash.

EGFR inhibitor–associated rash and therapeutic response: "One of the observations made by early clinical investigators was the correlation between the development of rash and response to EGFR therapy", and "if rash proved to be a clinical marker for response, it would offer patients a motivating factor to work through the rash associated with the first 2 months of therapy in order to establish drug efficacy". Although "mixed", "the bulk of data would tend to support the correlation between rash and outcomes in patients treated with EGFR therapy", with "Positive correlations between rash and outcome" reported for "cetuximab", "erlotinib", "gefitinib", and "panitumumab". "Data support not only an increase in response but an increase in survival for those patients experiencing a rash".

### Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: an update [^d23b1841]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are life-threatening mucocutaneous reactions, predominantly drug induced. The mortality rates for SJS and TEN are as high as 30%, and short- and long-term morbidities are very common. SJS/TEN is one of the few dermatological diseases that constitute a true medical emergency. Early recognition and prompt and appropriate management can be lifesaving. In recent years, our understanding of the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and management of SJS/TEN has improved. Nevertheless, in 2015, there are still no internationally accepted management guidelines. This review summarizes up-to-date insights on SJS/TEN and describes a protocol for assessment and treatment. We hope these suggested guidelines serve as a practical clinical tool in the management of SJS/TEN. The classic manifestation of SJS/TEN consists of initial "flu-like" symptoms (malaise, fever, anorexia) in the prodromal phase, followed by cutaneous and mucous membrane (ocular, oral, and genital) inflammation and pain, and other systemic involvement. Symptoms usually begin 4–28 days after the onset of drug intake. Treatment is multidisciplinary and includes identification and withdrawal of the culprit drug, transfer to a specialist unit, supportive care, medical treatment, communication, and provision of appropriate information and emotional support.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^8c650e9b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) — skin rash, often erythematous and papular or pustular, is commonly associated with TKIs, particularly EGFR inhibitors, occurring in up to 100% of patients; because of outcome associations, supportive care with steroids, antihistamines, and antibiotics is preferable in many cases. Diarrhea is also observed commonly with TKIs as a class, and several agents (lapatinib, sunitinib, pazopanib) carry a black box warning for liver toxicity; dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered with hepatotoxicity as well as severe and chronic diarrhea.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^d390748d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Clopidogrel hypersensitivity — incidence, presentation, and diagnostic notes include that clopidogrel (Plavix) is a selective, irreversible inhibitor of ADP-induced platelet aggregation for oral use, and the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions has been reported to range from 1% to 6%, with most estimates ranging from 1% to 3%. The most common hypersensitivity reaction is rash — macular, morbilliform, or diffuse and erythematous — beginning about 5 days into treatment; IgE-mediated reactions comprise about 5% to 7%, and in one case series urticaria represented 17% of reactions to clopidogrel. There is no validated skin testing or patch testing to clopidogrel, though the largest case series (42 patients) evaluated both immediate hypersensitivity testing and patch testing after a history suggestive of hypersensitivity; of the 42 patients tested, most had a history consistent with a delayed rash.

### Diagnosing and managing drug reaction with Eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) amidst remaining uncertainty [^72f8addf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, represents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge due to its varied, evolving clinical presentation, complex pathophysiology, and potential for severe systemic involvement. This article explores DRESS syndrome through 3 illustrative cases from diverse populations and with different background comorbidities. Cases highlight different challenges in DRESS care, including (1) the need for early diagnosis and severity scoring, (2) identification of offending drugs and risk stratification to consider a possible drug challenge, and (3) best practice management including long-term monitoring for emergent autoimmunity. Recent developments in our understanding of clinical spectrum of disease, genomic and nongenomic biomarkers, severity groupings, and pharmacological and longer-term management strategies are described. Critical gaps remain in several of these domains, particularly in vulnerable groups such as the immune-compromised. In the absence of robust evidence, we aim in this article to assist attending clinicians with current expert opinion in DRESS management. Finally, we highlight areas for further research needed to improve the clinical care and outcomes of DRESS.

### Defining D-irAEs: consensus-based disease definitions for the diagnosis of dermatologic adverse events from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy [^7c45ce7e]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

The accurate diagnosis and proper management of D-irAEs, as well as development of prevention strategies, are challenging because of the lack of specific, standardized disease definitions and severity grading criteria that capture the heterogeneity of possible manifestations. For example, rash is typically reported as maculopapular, a non-specific eruption, which may be due to the lack of guidance in the CTCAE for classifying specific subtypes. Making an accurate diagnosis of rash subtype is critical for effective D-irAE treatment and for predicting rash associated morbidity/mortality risk; thus, diagnosing the D-irAE subtype may impact ICI management. Moreover, preventing the progression of toxicity may reduce the risk of ICI interruption, discontinuation, and use of systemic immunosuppression.

Here, we report disease definitions for diagnosis and severity grading of D-irAEs. The definitions were developed through a Delphi consensus process similar to that which recently resulted in the first disease definitions for neurologic irAEs, in partnership with Project Data Sphere, an independent, not-for-profit initiative of the CEO Roundtable on Cancer. Guidance statements and descriptions are presented for dermatologic disease categories organized by most to least commonly reported. In addition to supporting diagnosis and clinical management, these definitions will improve the documentation of D-irAEs in ICI clinical trials, which often relies on non-dermatologists to assess and grade cutaneous toxicities. Precise definitions will also advance the clinical, histological, and immunophenotypical characterization of D-irAEs in clinical/translational research cohorts.

### Managing toxicities associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors: consensus recommendations from the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) toxicity management working group [^99187f7b]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation and epidemiology

Maculopapular rash and pruritus are common reactions to ICIs but lichenoid, eczematous, and bullous dermatitis, and psoriasis have also been reported, albeit less frequently. Vitiligo is frequently seen in the melanoma patient population. Dermatologic toxicity (all grades) is reported in 30–40% of patients taking PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, and approximately 50% of patients treated with ipilimumab. A systematic review of the literature reported that 13–20% of patients taking pembrolizumab or nivolumab developed rash or pruritus (all-grade) and approximately 8% (all with melanoma) developed vitiligo, which is associated with tumor response. More recently, several cases of hair re-pigmentation have also been described in patients treated with anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy. Onset of skin irAEs typically occurs within days or weeks of treatment although onset may be delayed, appearing after several months of treatment. Most dermatologic irAEs are low-grade and manageable, although rare, potentially life-threatening exfoliative dermatological conditions such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported. Severe irAEs tend to occur more commonly with combination ICI therapy. Any clinical suspicion of such reactions should prompt immediate specialist referral. Permanent discontinuation of immunotherapy is mandatory for grade 4 dermatologic irAEs, SJS/TEN, or DRESS syndrome.

Diagnostic evaluation:

Given the frequency and persistence of skin toxicities with ICIs, dermatologic assessments are warranted in patients with a known history of immune-related skin disorders such as psoriasis, bullous pemphigoid or lupus. Non-specific maculopapular eruptions are commonly reported, which may, in part, reflect the limitations of CTCAE in the classification of specific subsets of skin disorders. Whenever possible, the irAE should be categorized since management algorithms reflect the approach to idiopathic skin disorders, beyond systemic immune suppression with steroids. Patients should undergo full skin and mucosal exam, taking note of the extent and type of lesions present.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^5fbc48cc]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Cutaneous immune-related adverse events (irAEs) with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPI) therapy — epidemiology, timing, severity, and management — are characterized as follows: Cutaneous toxicities are the most common irAEs, reported in up to 71.5% of individuals across ICPI therapy, and are often early, typically noted within 3 weeks after the initiation of ipilimumab and within 6 weeks following the start of anti–PD-1 therapy, though onset can be delayed even after completion of therapy. Severe events are uncommon with monotherapy, with severe cutaneous toxicities of grade 3 or higher observed in 3% or fewer individuals. Once identified, cutaneous toxicities should be managed according to guidelines using an interprofessional approach through early engagement of a dermatologist. Certain serious manifestations will require temporary or permanent discontinuation of therapy and Grade 4 toxicities will likely require hospitalization; early identification and symptomatic or systemic management are pivotal to enhance compliance, treatment continuation, and ultimately therapeutic efficacy.

### FDA issues agency-initiated proposed order regarding OTC… [^a24c40e0]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Today, FDA issued a proposed administrative order, to address a safety issue related to over-the-counter monograph drug products containing acetaminophen. Based on a comprehensive scientific review of available data, FDA determined that acetaminophen continues to be associated with the risk of rare but serious skin reactions. This proposed order, if finalized, would require drug companies to add a warning to the labeling. The proposed warning below, which is the same as the warning language FDA previously recommended in a 2017 guidance, would alert consumers that the use of acetaminophen may cause severe skin reactions. Allergy alert: Acetaminophen may cause severe skin reactions. Symptoms may include:

- skin reddening
- blisters
- rash If a skin reaction occurs, stop use and seek medical help right away. FDA is seeking comments on this proposed order and instructions on how to submit comments are found below.

After a review of comments, FDA will issue a final order. FDA has communicated about this safety issue in the past.
- In August 2013, FDA issued a Drug Safety Communication informing the public that use of acetaminophen is associated with a risk of rare but serious skin reactions.
- In 2017, FDA issued final Guidance for Industry titled, Recommended Warning for Over-the-Counter Acetaminophen-Containing Drug Products and Labeling Statements Regarding Serious Skin Reaction. The 2017 guidance recommended the addition of language in product labeling warning consumers that acetaminophen may cause severe skin reactions.

Specifically, through Proposed Administrative Order: Amending Over-the-Counter Monograph M013: Internal Analgesic, Antipyretic, and Antirheumatic Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use, the agency proposes to amend the conditions described in OTC Monograph M013 1 to require OTC oral analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products containing acetaminophen to include the above warning on the product labeling about serious skin reactions. 1 OTC Monograph M013 describes the conditions under which OTC IAAA drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective. OTC monograph drug products may be marketed under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act without an approved drug application if they meet the conditions in the relevant OTC monograph and other applicable requirements.

### Severe systemic Bacillus anthracis infection in an intravenous drug user [^1fa24ca6]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

There has recently been an outbreak of injectional anthrax infection secondary to contaminated heroin use in the UK and Europe. We present a case of a 37-year-old man presenting with pain and swelling in the groin following injection of heroin into the area. He was initially treated for severe cellulitis, however, he failed to respond to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. He went onto develop a widespread rash; it was then that a diagnosis of injectional anthrax infection was considered. Appropriate investigations were initiated including serum sample and tissue biopsy, and the diagnosis was confirmed. Management included extensive surgical debridement and a prolonged course of combination antibiotic therapy. The authors summarise the important steps in diagnosis and the management options in patients presenting with this life-threatening infection.

Chronic urticaria (CU) diagnosis and management algorithm — patients with a history suggestive of chronic urticaria and/or angioedema are first assessed for angioedema; if present, "Consider medications, C1INH syndromes, or conditions that mimic angioedema". If not and the "history, review of systems, and physical examination" are not consistent, "Consider alternative diagnoses (see Differential Diagnosis Section)". When the history suggests a physical component, "Does the history suggest physical urticaria? Is there a physical component to the urticaria and/or" and the action is to "Consider appropriate challenge testing for physical urticaria". If vasculitis is suggested, "If skin biopsy diagnostic for vasculitis, manage vasculitis. If biopsy negative go to box 10". If "history, physical examination, and/or basic laboratory tests" indicate an underlying cause, "Evaluate and manage specific conditions", otherwise proceed with "Management of chronic urticaria/angioedema" and ensure "Periodic reassessment for underlying etiology and response to therapy".

### Erythema nodosum: a practical approach and diagnostic algorithm [^86660303]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Erythema nodosum is the most common form of panniculitis and is characterized by tender erythematous nodules mainly in the lower limbs on the pretibial area. The exact cause of erythema nodosum is unknown, although it appears to be a hypersensitivity response to a variety of antigenic stimuli. Although the etiology is mostly idiopathic, ruling out an underlying disease is imperative before diagnosing primary erythema nodosum. Erythema nodosum can be the first sign of a systemic disease that is triggered by a large group of processes, such as infections, inflammatory diseases, neoplasia, and/or drugs. The most common identifiable causes are streptococcal infections, primary tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, Behçet disease, inflammatory bowel disease, drugs, and pregnancy. We propose a diagnostic algorithm to optimize the initial work-up, hence initiating prompt and accurate management of the underlying disease. The algorithm includes an initial assessment of core symptoms, diagnostic work-up, differential diagnosis, and recommended therapies. Several treatment options for the erythema nodosum lesions have been previously reported; nevertheless, these options treat the symptoms, but not the triggering cause. Making an accurate diagnosis will allow the physician to treat the underlying cause and determine an optimal therapeutic strategy.

Resource use will be derived at the individual patient level. Clinical staff will record the time and activities undertaken for specimen collection. Associated costs will be calculated using a standard micro costing (bottom-up) approach, and will be based on clinical staff salaries plus on-costs (employer's national insurance and superannuation contributions) and appropriate capital, administration, laboratory and training costs. These data will also inform the costs of designing and running a large multicentre study.

### Cutaneous immune-related adverse events to checkpoint inhibitors [^67188d4b]. Clinics in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The development of immunotherapy has led to a paradigm shift in the treatment of both solid and hematologic malignancies. As immunomodulatory therapies are employed with increasing frequency, a greater number of immune-related adverse reactions are being reported, and the majority of these involve the skin. As a result, dermatologists are increasingly becoming involved in the management of these cutaneous adverse reactions-often providing critical recommendations regarding ongoing cancer treatment. Cutaneous immune-related adverse reactions can vary significantly from patient to patient, making early recognition and timely intervention imperative to mitigate associated morbidity and potential treatment interruption. Although there is considerable overlap in the cutaneous adverse events caused by these immune checkpoint inhibitors, specific eruptions are characteristically associated with particular checkpoint inhibitors. In addition, a patient's comorbidities or immune status can play a significant role in the presentation and management of such adverse reactions. This review characterizes and provides management guidelines for the various cutaneous toxicities associated with checkpoint inhibitor therapy, including CTLA-4 inhibitors, PD-1 inhibitors, and PD-L1 inhibitors. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

### Atypical presentations of herpesvirus infections in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^f5a670db]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

The characteristic presentation of herpesvirus infections is a vesicular rash. The initial lesions appear as erythematous papules that turn into grouped vesicles and pustules eventuating into crusts. In most cases, the features are so characteristic that a diagnosis can be made by history and physical examination without further diagnostic testing. However, patients who are immunosuppressed (including those with hematologic malignancies) often have atypical presentations of herpesvirus infections. These cases require a high index of suspicion and appropriate diagnostic testing for proper management. In this report, we describe two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who developed atypical presentations of herpes zoster and herpes simplex infections. Herpetic infections should always be in the differential diagnosis of cutaneous ulcerations with necrosis in patients who are immunocompromised. Because of the atypical appearance of the lesions, the diagnosis may be confused or mistaken for several other conditions.

### Validation of two algorithms for managing children with a non-blanching rash [^9a05d3d6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Paediatricians are concerned that children who present with a non-blanching rash (NBR) may have meningococcal disease (MCD). Two algorithms have been devised to help identify which children with an NBR have MCD.

Aim

To evaluate the NBR algorithms' ability to identify children with MCD.

Methods

The Newcastle-Birmingham-Liverpool (NBL) algorithm was applied retrospectively to three cohorts of children who had presented with NBRs. This algorithm was also piloted in four hospitals, and then used prospectively for 12months in one hospital. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) algorithm was validated retrospectively using data from all cohorts.

Results

The cohorts included 625 children, 145 (23%) of whom had confirmed or probable MCD. Paediatricians empirically treated 324 (52%) children with antibiotics. The NBL algorithm identified all children with MCD and suggested treatment for a further 86 children (sensitivity 100%, specificity 82%). One child with MCD did not receive immediate antibiotic treatment, despite this being suggested by the algorithm. The NICE algorithm suggested 382 children (61%) who should be treated with antibiotics. This included 141 of the 145 children with MCD (sensitivity 97%, specificity 50%).

Conclusions

These algorithms may help paediatricians identify children with MCD who present with NBRs. The NBL algorithm may be more specific than the NICE algorithm as it includes fewer features suggesting MCD. The only significant delay in treatment of MCD occurred when the algorithms were not followed.

### Male mammary paget disease: a tale of 2 contrasting cases [^6c7990db]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Mammary Paget disease (MPD) comprises 1.45% all male breast cancers, compared with only 0.68% of all female breast cancers. Patients usually present in the fifth and sixth decades of life with ulceration, eczematous changes, discharge, bleeding, itching, and induration of the nipple and areola. Typically, there is a delay in definitive diagnosis and treatment from the onset of symptoms because most patients are initially treated for a rash. At the time of diagnosis, about half of the patients may have palpable breast mass, positive lymph nodes, or both. In this article, we present 2 cases of male MPD representing the extremes of clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic spectrum of the disease. One patient presented with a rash of the nipple of several months duration without an underlying lesion, whereas the other presented with sensitivity and pain of the nipple for 1 year and an underlying mass. Biopsies were diagnostic of MPD in both cases, and definitive surgery revealed an underlying ductal carcinoma in situ in the first case and an invasive ductal carcinoma in the second, highlighting the importance of early biopsy to initiate appropriate management.

### DRESS syndrome presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and delayed eosinophilia [^874234d4]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

The most common pulmonary radiographic findings in DRESS are interstitial infiltrates seen in 50% of cases, followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome in 31% of cases. Shortness of breath and cough are also common pulmonary symptoms seen in DRESS. In this case, the patient presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was found to have ground-glass and emphysematous changes of the lungs on CT chest.

Despite treatment with systemic steroids and maximal supportive care, our patient still developed cardiopulmonary failure. One possibility for this outcome is an intense delayed hypersensitivity reaction involving inflammatory cytokines that led to severe lung damage. Additionally, the patient reported completing the course of TMP-SMX despite symptoms of rash and myalgia after starting the medication. The continuation of TMP-SMX despite signs of an adverse reaction may have worsened the initial presenting symptoms. Another possibility is the use of furosemide during the hospital course. Prior case reports describe DRESS syndrome secondary to furosemide. Although unlikely, the use of this medication may have exacerbated the pulmonary manifestations of DRESS. It is important to note that the delayed onset of asynchronous and discontinuous features may have also contributed to this poor outcome.

There are no randomised controlled trials to date that guide treatment of DRESS syndrome. In general, first-line management involves discontinuation of the suspected offending agent and initiation of glucocorticoids. In mild to moderate cases without visceral organ involvement, topical steroids are used for rash. However, in more severe cases associated with visceral involvement, systemic steroids are used. Alternatives to corticosteroids, including the use of calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine, are being explored, particularly in patients who are unable to sustain prolonged immunosuppression.

Our case highlights the variability and severity in the presentation of DRESS syndrome. The sequelae of DRESS syndrome range from full recovery to even death, as demonstrated by this case. Patients should be properly counselled when prescribed medications that are known to be associated with DRESS to promptly call their provider if they develop a rash, fever or start to feel unwell. DRESS can present without the presence of particular features, and given the asynchronous nature of its presentation, it can be difficult to recognise on presentation. Early recognition and treatment of DRESS is imperative to lower mortality and improve outcomes. Given the severity of the manifestations of DRESS, awareness of this syndrome with early identification followed by appropriate management and close follow-up is necessary to minimise morbidity and mortality.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: melanoma: cutaneous, version 2.2024 [^04372e73]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Targeted therapy (BRAF or combined BRAF/MEK inhibitors) — management of dermatologic toxicity and pyrexia is as follows: Regular dermatologic evaluation and referral to a dermatologist or provider experienced in the diagnosis and management of cutaneous manifestations of targeted therapy is recommended. Severe and life-threatening skin toxicity (eg, drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome) can occur with the use of BRAF inhibitors following immune checkpoint blockade, and requires prompt dermatologic consultation for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Pyrexia (defined as a temperature of ≥ 38.5 °C) is a common (~55%) side effect of combining BRAF and MEK inhibitors and occurs less frequently with BRAF inhibitor monotherapy (~20%); the pyrexia is episodic, with a median duration of 9 days, and onset is often 2–4 weeks following the start of therapy. Pyrexia may be associated with chills, night sweats, rash, dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, and hypotension. Stopping or holding BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination at the onset of pyrexia will often interrupt the episode, and treatment can be resumed with full-dose BRAF/MEK inhibitors upon cessation of pyrexia and pyrexia-related symptoms. Upon re-exposure to BRAF/MEK inhibitors, repeat pyrexia events can occur, but grade > 3 events are uncommon (21%). In occasional instances of prolonged or severe pyrexia not responsive to discontinuation of BRAF/MEK inhibitors, low-dose corticosteroids (prednisone 10 mg/day) can be used, and patients with pyrexia should be advised to use antipyretics as needed and increase fluid intake. The frequency of pyrexia and other adverse events varies between specific BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations.

### Alectinib-induced rash unresponsive to desensitization: a case report and literature review [^44f2d86e]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Understanding the limitations of our case; and that the exact reasons for failure of desensitization cannot be known; it is important that we discuss potential causes in order to avoid repeated cases of failure. It is important for each physician to tailor regimens to the needs of the patient. With continued research on the subject the more likely it is to determine what factors work best for ensuring success in order that the patient may continue Alectinib treatment. With this in mind, we suggest the physicians consider rechallenging with a lower dose and titrating upwards to full dosage on an inpatient basis. Additionally, the use of steroids proved beneficial in the report by Kimura et al. who followed the protocol as seen in the successful re-initiation of Sorafenib in a case of rash formation in a patient with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. This is not the first time that the addition of steroids to rechallenge therapy has proved successful; as it has also been documented in treatment of other adverse grade events including Osimertinib-induced interstitial lung disease. Thus, we suggest the consideration of steroid usage on a case–by–case basis for patients presenting for rechallenge.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^0abc6aa7]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Cutaneous toxicities with immune checkpoint inhibitors — classification, onset, and presenting features: Immune-related cutaneous adverse events are characterized as inflammatory dermatoses, bullous dermatoses, and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), according to the CTCAE. The median time to onset of skin toxicities is 4 weeks, but can range broadly from 2 to 150 weeks. Rash or inflammatory dermatitis irAEs encompass erythema multiforme, lichenoid, eczematous, psoriasiform, morbilliform, and palmo-plantar erythrodysesthesia, or hand-foot syndrome, and presenting symptoms often include itch or with or without rash, new or worsening skin lesions, including macules, papules, or plaques, and loss of skin pigmentation. For bullous dermatoses, presenting symptoms may include new or worsening skin lesions, including bullae, persistent urticaria, or erosions on the skin or mucosal surfaces, and SCAR includes Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (although note that acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis is not always severe), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms or drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome.

### Malar rash in a patient with acute epiglottitis [^c911a5bc]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Early recognition of SLE and prompt immunosuppressive therapy are critical to preventing long-term complications. The standard approach to lupus nephritis involves induction therapy with glucocorticoids and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), followed by maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. Current EULAR guidelines also recommend additional immunosuppressive agents, such as belimumab and calcineurin inhibitors (eg, voclosporin or tacrolimus), as treatment options for lupus nephritis in select patients, depending on clinical factors and response to first-line therapies. In this case, the patient was initially treated with intravenous glucocorticoids, which were later transitioned to an oral taper alongside MMF. She was subsequently transitioned to long-term management with MMF and hydroxychloroquine, with close follow-up with rheumatology to monitor disease progression and medication side effects. At her most recent visit, the patient reported resolution of symptoms, and renal function had returned to normal.

This case underscores the indispensable role of patient history and physical examination in the diagnostic process, particularly in complex, multisystem diseases like SLE. While the malar rash was ultimately identified and contributed to the diagnostic pathway, it should not have been the first signal to prompt rheumatological evaluation. Earlier signs, such as joint pain, morning stiffness and possibly anaemia, were present and should have triggered further investigation. However, the failure to perform or interpret a thorough patient history and physical examination earlier in the course of her illness likely contributed to the delayed diagnosis. This highlights a critical lesson: physical examination is often revelatory. When combined with a careful history and sound clinical reasoning, it can uncover findings that shift the diagnostic trajectory.

Learning points

Malar rash can be a key clinical clue to the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Autoimmune pancreatitis is a rare but important manifestation of SLE.
Rheumatological evaluation should be considered in cases of unexplained pancreatitis, renal dysfunction and signs of systemic inflammation.
Infection with encapsulated organisms, such as Haemophilus influenzae, can complicate autoimmune conditions like SLE.
In some cases, infection may act as a trigger for the onset or exacerbation of autoimmune diseases, such as SLE.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^07de3909]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric HIV infection — nevirapine (NVP) rash and hypersensitivity reactions: Onset "occurs most frequently in the first few weeks of therapy but can occur through 18 weeks" and presentation comprises "flu-like symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, myalgia, fatigue, fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice) with or without skin rash that may progress to hepatic failure with encephalopathy". Frequency is reported as "Occurs in 4% of patients on average, with a range of 2.5% to 11%". Risk factors in adults include "ARV-naive with a higher CD4 count (> 250 cells/mm3 in women; > 400 cells/mm3 in men)", "Female sex (risk is threefold higher in females than in males)", and "Hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection", while in children "NVP hepatotoxicity and HSR are less common in prepubertal children than in adults, and both are uncommon in infants". When Starting NVP or Restarting NVP After Interruptions of > 14 Days, "A 2-week lead-in period with once-daily dosing, followed by dose escalation to twice daily as recommended, may reduce the risk of reaction" and "This may not be necessary in children aged < 2 years", and "Counsel families about signs and symptoms of HSR to ensure prompt reporting of reactions". Management states: "Discontinue all ARV drugs", "Consider other causes of hepatitis and discontinue all hepatotoxic medications", "Provide supportive care as indicated and monitor the patient closely", "Do not reintroduce NVP", and "It is unclear whether it is safe to use other NNRTIs after a patient experiences symptomatic hepatitis due to NVP, and many experts would avoid the NNRTI drug class when restarting treatment".

### Slowly progressive chest rash in an elderly woman [^dae5cd3a]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Question 3: What test is most important for determining this patient's prognosis?
A. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis
B. Skin punch biopsy
C. Mammogram
D. Breast ultrasound scan
E. Bacterial culture
Answers:
A. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis – Correct. Although cutaneous infiltration is often considered a sign of advanced disease and poor prognosis, a retrospective series reported a mean survival of 57.43 months for breast cancer with cutaneous-only metastases; about one-third of breast cancer cases with cutaneous metastases were confined to the skin with no visceral involvement. Bone scan and CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis found no metastatic disease in our patient, and she continues to feel well after 3 years of documented evidence of carcinoma en cuirasse with minimal progression.
B. Skin punch biopsy – Incorrect. Although skin punch biopsy is crucial for diagnosis and ascertainment of receptor positivity to guide treatment, the receptor positivity of the malignancy is less important to prognosis than the presence of visceral metastases.
C. Mammogram – Incorrect. At this point in our patient's evaluation, clinical suspicion is high for recurrence, so the priority is imaging to assess for metastasis. Previous workup before her dermatology presentation included diagnostic mammography with a normal right breast and high suspicion for recurrent carcinoma in the left breast.
D. Breast ultrasound scan – Incorrect. A left breast ultrasound scan in our patient showed confluent masses and associated marked skin thickening with an abnormal axillary lymph node. Metastatic workup with positron emission tomography scan or CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is more important than local imaging for prognosis.
E. Bacterial culture – Incorrect. Bacterial culture would direct antibiotic therapy in patients with purulent drainage or infection and would not assist in assessing this patient's prognosis.

### Drug-mediated rash: erythema multiforme versus Stevens-Johnson syndrome [^1b3c7ec7]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 92-year-old woman presented with an acute onset generalised maculopapular rash with associated mucosal involvement, on a background of recent start of griseofulvin. The rash progressed rapidly over 2 days to involve most of her body, however, mucosal involvement was limited to her oral mucosa. Characteristic target lesions appeared at 72 h, and a diagnosis of erythema multiforme secondary to griseofulvin was made after further investigation and skin biopsy. The patient was monitored closely for progression of the rash and other indicators of more severe dermatological conditions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome. She was managed symptomatically, with resolution of the rash in 4 weeks and full recovery to her premorbid level of functioning. This case details the diagnostic and management approach to erythema multiforme, a condition that warrants thorough consideration for the differential of Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^cb2b0168]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Penicillin hypersensitivity — classification, timing, and acute manifestations: "Hypersensitivity reactions to penicillin are classifiable as immediate or nonimmediate according to their clinical manifestation, time since the last drug administration, and the onset of symptoms". Immediate reactions are "predominantly IgE-mediated" and "can occur within 6 hours after the last drug administration but typically occur within 1 hour of the first dose of a new treatment course". Acute symptoms include "urticaria, angioedema, conjunctivitis, respiratory symptoms (rhinitis, bronchospasm, cough, dyspnea), gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain), and/or anaphylaxis". Nonimmediate reactions "occur more than 1 hour after the initial drug exposure, and they often develop days to weeks after medication initiation", with manifestations that include "maculopapular or morbilliform exanthems" and can also present as "delayed urticaria/angioedema, exfoliative dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and more severe bullous exanthems such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)". The multisystem presentation "is termed drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome or drug rash (or reaction) with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)".

### Alectinib-induced rash unresponsive to desensitization: a case report and literature review [^7d41e93e]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Thus, in regards to managing rash formation on Alectinib, to the best of the authors' knowledge only four other cases have been reported of Alectinib–induced rash formation and desensitization protocols enacted to combat said reaction. In these reports, desensitization was successful with their respective patient being able to reinitiate Alectinib treatment. Unfortunately, this was not the outcome in our case in which the patient was unable to continue with Alectinib treatment and was begun on Brigatinib. In order to avoid failure in future cases, we have gathered factors which differ in our report in comparison to the four successful cases of desensitization.

For our patient, we enacted the protocol as detailed by Seegobin et al. which differs from the other 3 cases by beginning with a higher dose of Alectinib at 150 mg twice daily. The other 3 cases began at 20 mg once daily, 37.5 mg once daily, and 40 mg once daily respectively. In our case beginning at the higher dose may have led to a greater risk of side effect recurrence. Additionally, it is important to note that in our case, a full on diagnosed rash did not occur when we reinitiated treatment. This was due to reluctance of continuing with the desensitization protocol once the initial symptoms of sore throat, erythema of the chest, and fever had returned. Other different factors were that in both reports by Shirasawa and Kimura, the patients were rechallenged with Alectinib on an inpatient basis. This was done in order to monitor progress and potential complications of rechallenge. In the report by Kimura et al. not only was the patient followed as an inpatient, Alectinib rechallenge was also given with 10 mg prednisolone. Steroids were added in this report to help combat any other possible reaction to the re-initiation. Within our case, neither of these two options were completed, as the patient was rechallenged in an outpatient setting and steroids were not administered. Combined with a higher dose on initial restart along with the decision to follow the patient on an outpatient basis may have reduced the likelihood of success in our case. Additionally, our patient had been administered 4 cycles of chemoimmunotherapy in a separate facility prior to beginning targeted therapy. It is important to realize that the amalgamation of combination chemoimmunotherapy, particularly immunotherapy, may have contributed to an adverse dermatological effect along with Alectinib. As aforementioned, Brigatinib was then chosen due to its differing chemical structure. To corroborate likely success of switch there are at least two other cases of successful changes from Alectinib to Brigatinib due to serious dermatological reactions. Unfortunately, understanding that relation will never be accomplished as a result of loss of contact with the patient following her move out of the country.

### Impact of a rash management guide in patients receiving apalutamide for high-risk localized prostate cancer in the apa-RP study [^66f65329]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The rash management guide developed for Apa-RP provides a proactive, patient-empowered approach to monitoring and managing rash events. In relation to rash, patients in Apa-RP experienced lower overall incidence, reduced severity, a shortened time to resolution, and lower rates of dose reduction and treatment interruption or discontinuation, vs those in SPARTAN and TITAN. Notably, no patients in Apa-RP required treatment discontinuation due to rash. The relative improvements in rash management in Apa-RP suggest that early identification and intervention may help to reduce the incidence, severity, and time to resolution of rash during treatment with apalutamide. The preventative measures presented in the Apa-RP rash management protocol may have contributed to the lower incidence of rash compared with SPARTAN and TITAN.

This study is limited by the small number of patients (N = 108) included only from North America. Previous studies have reported that the incidence of rash following apalutamide treatment varies across different geographical populations (for example, a higher incidence was reported among East Asian patients compared with the global population). Therefore, the analysis presented in this report only included participants from the North American populations of SPARTAN and TITAN to mitigate any potential bias.

While SPARTAN and TITAN studies recorded rash data beyond 12 months following initiation of apalutamide treatment, most patients (> 80%) experienced onset of rash within the first 12 months of treatment (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Data for dose modification or discontinuation beyond 12 months were not recorded for either study.

Although the patients included in this analysis span three prostate cancer disease states, the populations were considered similarly susceptible to rash, patients were receiving the same dose of apalutamide with ADT, and the same rash-related endpoints were recorded. Additionally, data were compared descriptively, with no comparative statistical analyses applied.

In conclusion, these findings suggest that increased vigilance from the care team and empowering patients through education may reduce the incidence, duration, and severity of rash during apalutamide treatment. Incorporating a proactive rash management guide into clinical practice appears to be warranted based on the data presented.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^7700b6b6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Herpesvirus management and adjunct diagnostic testing — Intravenous acyclovir should be added to the patient's antimicrobial regimen for suspected or confirmed cutaneous or disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV) or varicella zoster virus (VZV) infections; the sensitivity of a single-serum fungal antigen test is low particularly in patients receiving antifungal agents, and benefits from laboratory tests for fungal antigen or DNA detection remain inconsistent; and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood for HSV and VZV might be helpful in establishing a diagnosis of disseminated infection in patients with unexplained skin lesions.

### The rash that presents as target lesions [^5a1cb21f]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

We have explored the rash that appears as target lesions, with the central and dominant diseases belonging to the Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis group. After presenting the clinical patterns of an individual target lesion and classifying them into different types of lesions, the contribution has been organized with groups characterized by such specific findings according to the type of lesion: flat or raised, typical or atypical, presence or absence of fever, presence or absence of mucosal ulcerations, presence or absence of arthralgias, and/or internal organ involvement. Other specific features, such as histologic appearance, immunofluorescence findings, and laboratory changes, are considered. We provide clinicians with an algorithmic, systematic, and logical approach to diagnose the condition of the patients who present with targetoid lesions, and enable them to differentiate between those with serious systemic and life-threatening diseases from others with ordinary skin ailments.

### The rash with maculopapules and fever in adults [^bb8bbcf4]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

There is a broad differential diagnosis for the presentation of fever and maculopapular rash in an adult. Although some causative conditions are benign, others are medical emergencies that require prompt diagnosis. We describe various conditions that result in a fever and maculopapular rash in adults. These include infectious processes (meningococcemia, infectious mononucleosis, West Nile virus, zika virus, rubella, primary human immunodeficiency virus, parvovirus B19, ebolavirus), tick-borne illnesses (Rocky Mountain spotted fever, ehrlichiosis), and hypersensitivity reactions (exanthematous drug reactions). We also provide an algorithm to aid in the diagnosis of the patient with fever and maculopapular rash. Such conditions that can occur in adults but are seen predominantly in children are discussed in the article "Rash with maculopapules and fever in children" of this issue.

Ovarian cancer — preparation and management for drug reactions states that patients and their families "should be counseled about the possibility of a drug reaction and the signs and symptoms of one", and patients "should be told to report any signs and symptoms of a drug reaction, especially after they have left the clinic (ie, delayed rash)"; clinicians and nursing staff "should be prepared" each time a drug is infused and "standing orders should be written" with appropriate emergency equipment. For hypotension during or shortly after chemotherapy, "Epinephrine (intramuscular 0.3 mL of 1 mg/mL solution/EpiPen) should be used" for any patient with "systolic BP of < 90 mm Hg" with or without other allergic/hypersensitivity symptoms, and during acute cardiopulmonary arrest, "advanced cardiovascular life support [ACLS] procedures should be followed". Algorithms "are provided for management of mild, severe, and life-threatening reactions" and "are also useful for patients with other gynecologic cancers (eg, cervical, vulvar, and uterine cancers) who are receiving carboplatin, cisplatin, docetaxel, liposomal doxorubicin, oxaliplatin".

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^bed0efd7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Clinical, laboratory, and radiological evaluation in febrile neutropenia with skin and soft tissue lesions — key diagnostic steps are specified. Signs and symptoms are often diminished or absent in neutropenia, and skin lesions, no matter how small or innocuous in appearance, should be carefully evaluated. Early involvement of an infectious diseases specialist, a surgeon, and a dermatologist may result in improved outcome. Initial clinical impressions should be supplemented with a systemic approach to enhance diagnosis and management. Blood cultures are critical, and at least 2 sets should be obtained. Radiographic imaging should be performed as clinically indicated and can help define extent of disease; chest/sinus imaging may identify silent pulmonary or sinus infection with dissemination. The most specific method is biopsy or aspiration of lesions for histological, cytological, and microbiological evaluation.

### Management of adult-onset Still's disease: evidence-and consensus-based recommendations by experts [^8afb3df8]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

At the end of round 3, after rewording and merging, a total of 29 of 33 final statements achieved consensus (Table 1, Supplementary Tables S3 and S4, available at Rheumatology online). Based on these statements, we propose diagnostic and treatment algorithms (Figs 1 and 2 and Supplementary Figs S1–S3, available at Rheumatology online).

Figure 1.
Diagnostic workup of (suspected) AOSD. AOSD: adult onset Still's disease; GC: glucocorticoids; HLH: haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis; MAS: macrophage activation syndrome

Figure 2.
Suggested treatment algorithm for patients with AOSD. Severe disease is defined as hospital admission needed, with organ involvement or life-threatening disease. Systemic symptoms: fever, weight loss, sore throat, skin rash, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly. In case of predominant arthritis, IL-6 blockade may be preferred over IL-1 blockade. Low-dose glucocorticoid is ≤ 15 mg prednisone or equivalent. Double arrows indicate equivalent options and a decision should be made upon the physician's discretion. GC refers to high dose glucocorticoid, i.e. prednisone 0.5–1.0 mg/kg or equivalent. 'IL-1' indicates IL-1 blockade; 'IL-6' indicates IL-6 blockade. MTX dosing according to EULAR; IL-1 blockade 100–300 mg subcutaneously or off label intravenously. AOSD: Adult onset Still's Disease; GC: glucocorticoid; TNFi: TNF inhibitors

Table 1.
Main consensus statements used for the formation of a treatment algorithm for AOSD and level of evidence

Diagnostic approach

The statements on the approach to a patient with suspected AOSD are mainly based on expert opinion. The panel's statements and considerations on diagnostics are presented in Table 1, Supplementary Table S3, available at Rheumatology online and visualized in Fig. 1. AOSD mainly remains a diagnosis of exclusion and its differential diagnosis is broad and includes infections, non-infectious inflammatory diseases, and malignancies. Kontzias et al. have suggested a standard diagnostic approach for AOSD. Scoring of the Yamaguchi criteria is required. If available, measurement of serum soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) or IL-18 should be considered, preferably before the start of GC. Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)/haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a major complication of AOSD and present in up to 23% of patients.

### Periorbital necrotizing fasciitis: the manchester experience [^b84e2b1a]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients in our cohort presented with a short history of unilateral periocular swelling. Periocular swelling is a common, non-specific symptom which may be associated with many less serious infective conditions, such as pre-septal cellulitis. Given the severity of the swelling in our cohort, the differential diagnosis in most patients was orbital cellulitis, and urgent Ophthalmology input was sought. Early commencement of antimicrobial therapy for probable orbital cellulitis was common and preceded the clinical diagnosis of PONF in all cases. In most cases, clinical diagnosis of PONF was delayed until the patient was referred and transferred from the presenting trust to our centre for ophthalmic assessment, which caused a delay in diagnosis and appropriate management for PONF.

Patient 4 of this case series (Table 1) presented to a different centre with unilateral periocular swelling and scab-like lesions in the periocular region (Fig. 4). She was initially treated for HZO for around 12 h, followed by a rapid increase in periocular swelling and systemic deterioration with the development of sepsis. Several cases of NF following Herpes Zoster infection have been reported. Unfortunately, at the centre to which she presented, patient 4 had no microbiological testing at the onset of the initial vesicular rash, and no viral Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was sent as the disease progressed. It remains unclear if the presumed preceding viral infection led to the development of PONF or if there was a misdiagnosis at presentation. This patient was not known to be immunosuppressed. She only required 1 surgical debridement and 1 reconstructive procedure.

### Drug allergy mimics [^21ec1c22]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

When approaching a case of apparent drug allergy, the consulting clinician should consider a broad differential diagnosis. This article presents a series of cases that could be commonly referred to an allergist for assessment as "drug allergy", however, a real diagnosis exists that mandates a different diagnostic and treatment strategy, including a case of inducible laryngeal obstruction, multiple drug intolerance syndrome, viral rash, seizure due to metastatic malignancy, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis initially diagnosed as drug reaction and eosinophilia with systemic symptoms. The initial misdiagnoses of these patients delayed or interfered with their medical care, emphasizing the importance of accurate diagnoses for the benefit of our patients.

Management of drug reactions — preparation and acute response during chemotherapy: Patients and their families should be counseled about the possibility of a drug reaction and the signs and symptoms of one, and patients should be told to report any signs and symptoms of a drug reaction, especially after they have left the clinic (ie, delayed rash). Clinicians and nursing staff should be prepared for the possibility of a drug reaction every time a patient is infused with a drug, standing orders should be written for immediate intervention, and the treatment area should have appropriate medical equipment in case of a life-threatening reaction. Epinephrine (intramuscular [IM] 0.3 mL of 1 mg/mL solution/ Epipen) should be used for any patient experiencing hypotension (systolic blood pressure of < 90 mm Hg) with or without other symptoms of an allergic/hypersensitivity reaction during or shortly after any chemotherapy drug treatment, and in the setting of acute cardiopulmonary arrest standard resuscitation (advanced cardiovascular life support [ACLS]) procedures should be followed. Desensitization can be considered for patients who have had drug reactions, and if a patient has previously had a very severe life-threatening reaction, the implicated drug should not be used again unless under guidance of an allergist or specialist with desensitization experience. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPI) therapy — workup and management include "Total body skin examination with attention to examining ALL mucous membranes, as well as complete review of systems", to "Rule out any other etiology of the skin problem", and a "biologic checkup including a CBC with DIFF, liver, and kidney function tests; consider UA in the context of DRESS… If the patient is febrile, blood cultures should be considered as well", plus "Skin biopsies to assess for full-thickness epidermal necrosis… as well as other possible etiologies". The guidance states to "Follow patients closely using serial clinical photography", and if "mucous membrane involvement or blistering is noted on the skin, consider early admission to a burn center". For management, "In cases of suspected SJS or any mucous membrane involvement (not including isolated stomatitis), discontinue ICPI treatment and consult dermatology. Monitor closely for improvement regardless of grade". It further notes, "For the SCAR adverse reactions, there are no grade 1 or 2 categories… there should remain high concern that this reaction will progress to grade 3 or 4".

Multidisciplinary management in mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome (MF/SS) — consensus statements: The panel recommends that, when possible, the care of patients with Sézary syndrome or advanced-stage mycosis fungoides (stage IIB or higher) be carried out as a multidisciplinary collaboration between dermatology, hematology/ oncology, radiation oncology, and dermatopathology/ hematopathology; that patients with MF/SS continue to be seen by dermatology for ongoing management of their skin disease, including symptomatic lesions, infection, pruritus, even after referral to hematology/oncology and/or transplant; that in patients with MF/SS, localized radiation therapy continue to be used for treatment of appropriate symptomatic skin lesions in the settings of ongoing systemic treatment, preparation for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), or relapse/progression after allo-HCT; and that, when possible, referrals for allo-HCT evaluation be made to transplant centers with experience in allo-HCT for MF/SS. For patients with MF/SS who develop skin rash after allo-HCT, the panel recommends skin biopsy with dermatopathology evaluation to distinguish between graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), cutaneous relapse of MF/SS, and other dermatitis, and notes that when available, T-cell receptor gene rearrangement analysis in the tissue should be performed and results compared to prior studies in the blood and/or tissue.

### The rash that presents as a vesiculobullous eruption [^960c77ba]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Various infections and autoimmune and reactive skin conditions can present with blisters of varying sizes. Some of these disorders are seen in everyday practice, whereas others are rarely encountered. In many cases, the clinical picture is so typical that the diagnosis is easy and obvious; nevertheless, the significant clinical overlap between many of these diseases can cause frustration in both unexperienced and expert clinicians. We present the most typical clinical clues and offer simplified algorithms to the clinical diagnosis of skin conditions with vesicles and bullae. We focus on several aspects, when assessing a patient with blisters on the skin: age of onset, a history of comorbidities and medications intake, the general condition of the patient, and most importantly, the distribution, number, size, morphology, and evolution of the blisters, the characteristics of the peribullous skin, and the presence of mucosal involvement. Emphasis is put on differentiating between potentially life-threatening blistering eruptions and more benign self-limiting conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

### Update on Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: diagnosis and management [^9c17e6e5]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are the most severe cutaneous adverse reactions that are typically drug-induced in adults. Both SJS and TEN have high morbidity and mortality rates. SJS/TEN imposes clinical challenges for physicians managing patients suffering from this condition, both because it is rare and because it is a rapidly progressing systemic disease with severe cutaneous, mucosal, and systemic manifestations. Although many cases of SJS/TEN have been reported in the literature, there is no consensus regarding diagnostic criteria or treatment. Significant progress has been made in understanding its genetic predisposition and pathogenesis. This review is intended to provide physicians with a comprehensive but practical SJS/TEN roadmap to guide diagnosis and management. We review data on pathogenesis, reported precipitating factors, presentation, diagnosis, and management SJS/TEN focusing on what is new over the last 5 years.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immunotherapy for the treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancer [^c757768f]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Immune-related adverse events

Although the expected toxicity profiles vary between ICIs, the rates of occurrence of irAEs for patients with NMSCs treated with checkpoint blockade are in line with those in other disease settings. Specific data on occurrence rates of AEs and irAEs from the landmark trials leading to the FDA approvals of ICIs are summarized, when available, in the Approved anti-PD-(L)1 agents for MCC, Approved anti-PD-1 agents for CSCC, and the Approved immunotherapies for BCC sections. Overall, the most commonly reported TRAEs across registration trials for ICIs for NMSCs (in no particular order) were fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, asthenia, pruritus, and rash. The most frequently observed irAEs in trials leading to approvals of ICIs for NMSCs thus far (often sponsor-identified, in no particular order) have been hypothyroidism, rash, pruritus, pneumonitis, and diarrhea/colitis, consistent with the overall frequencies seen in other disease settings.

The management of irAEs for patients with NMSCs treated with ICIs follows the same general principles for other tumors and may include interruption of therapy, treatment with corticosteroids, referral to specialists where appropriate, treatment cessation, and, in severe cases, hospitalization. Detailed recommendations on the identification and management of irAEs, which is outside the scope of this guideline, may be found in guidelines from SITC, NCCN, and ASCO.
