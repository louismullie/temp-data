## Question

What is the mechanism of action of immersion foot?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the mechanism of immersion foot, also called non-freezing cold injury. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the defining exposure conditions and natural history, including the temperature range and the classic four stages. Then, I should verify the initial vascular events during cold, wet exposure and the TRPA1-mediated vasoconstrictive cascade. Next, I will examine the ischemic metabolic and neural consequences during exposure, followed by rewarming physiology and hyperemia. After that, I need to assess the progression to chronic sensory neuropathy and cold hypersensitivity. Finally, I will review key modifiers such as moisture, duration, repeated cooling–rewarming cycles, and host susceptibility, and I will sanity-check any staging language for accuracy while noting and correcting any misstatements I encounter along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and exposure parameters to anchor the mechanism. Immersion foot or non-freezing cold injury arises from prolonged exposure to cold and wet conditions at temperatures above freezing, typically between 0 and 15°C, without tissue ice crystal formation, and classically progresses through four stages that span the exposure/pre-hyperemic period, the overt hyperemic phase on rewarming, and a later post-hyperemic phase with chronic sequelae, which together define the natural history of the condition in field and clinical observations [^111hM56b] [^1164CKBb].

> Hold on, I should verify the initiating vascular response during cold, wet exposure. The predominant early event is intense, sustained vasoconstriction sufficient to markedly reduce or even arrest nutritive flow in superficial acral tissues; mechanistically, local cold sensing via TRPA1 triggers superoxide generation, which activates α2C-adrenoceptors and engages Rho-kinase–dependent myosin light chain phosphorylation to maintain vasoconstriction, a cascade demonstrated in a murine model but consistent with the human clinical phenotype of pallor and numbness during exposure; water against the skin accelerates heat loss, amplifying this vasoconstrictive drive by increasing conductive and convective cooling compared with air [^112D6UUH] [^111hM56b].

> Wait, let me consider the downstream ischemic tissue milieu during sustained vasoconstriction. Persistent flow limitation produces relative anoxia and metabolic derangements in cooled tissues, with accumulation of byproducts and ischemic stress that can provoke pain from hypoxic sensory nerve endings and early sensory dysfunction such as numbness and paresthesias, while the overlying vasomotor disturbance manifests clinically as pallor or mottling during the exposure phase, which aligns with field descriptions and classic clinical staging [^1164CKBb] [^111hM56b].

> Next, I should review what happens on rewarming because that transition is physiologically distinct. On passive rewarming, chilled ischemic tissues release relatively stable vasodilator metabolites and engage a restorative flow response driven by sensory nerve–derived dilator neuropeptides such as CGRP and substance P, along with nitric oxide signaling, producing intense hyperemia with swelling and severe pain; clinically this corresponds to the hyperemic stage, with erythema, edema, and dramatic pain escalation captured both in historical series and controlled vascular models of cold exposure [^1164CKBb] [^112D6UUH] [^111hM56b].

> I will now examine the transition to neurological injury and chronicity because this explains long-term morbidity. Repeated or severe episodes progress to a length-dependent small fiber–predominant sensory neuropathy, with marked reductions in intraepidermal nerve fiber density on skin biopsy and neuropathic pain characterized by high severity and interference scores; late findings include cold hypersensitivity and hyperhidrosis, consistent with autonomic involvement and durable neural injury rather than persistent large-fiber deficits, which aligns the chronic phenotype with objective small fiber pathology [^117Wso7y] [^113AJvzn] [^1164CKBb].

> But wait, what factors modulate risk and persistence, and how confident am I in each. Moisture accelerates cooling because water conducts heat far more efficiently than air, prolonged exposure over hours to days is typically required, and the relevant temperature band remains above freezing, distinguishing this entity from frostbite; repeated cycles of cooling and rewarming after an initial insult roughly double the risk of symptoms persisting beyond a week in service personnel, and epidemiologically, individuals of African descent have been overrepresented in contemporary cohorts, although the mechanism for that susceptibility remains uncertain; diagnostically, clinicians should think of NFCI when an extremity has been cold and numb for hours to days in wet, cold conditions sufficient to cause significant peripheral cooling, and consider NFCI in those with persistent neurologic symptoms beyond one week after exposure once other neuropathies are excluded [^111hM56b] [^111nqgDy] [^111aqyNr] [^115vVduR].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially summarized the stages as "exposure/pre-hyperemic (vasoconstriction), hyperemic (rewarmingflammation), andchronic phases nerve damage)", which is imprecise and contains typos; hold on, I should verify the canonical staging and restate it correctly as four phases: the period of exposure, the pre-hyperemic phase immediately after rescue with cold, numb, swollen, often pulseless extremities dominated by vasoconstriction, followed by the hyperemic phase with intense reperfusion pain and edema, and then the post-hyperemic phase over days to weeks when sensory deficits, sweating abnormalities, and weakness emerge and later evolve into cold sensitivity and hyperhidrosis, reflecting established peripheral nerve damage [^1164CKBb].

> I need to ensure I do not conflate pathophysiology with management, but the mechanism explains why passive, not rapid active, rewarming is advised for NFCI in prehospital or early care; allowing gradual rewarming at room temperature with elevation limits excessive provocation of hyperemia and pain in already ischemia–reperfusion–vulnerable tissues, and prehospital guidance specifically advises against warm-water baths, forced air, or heating pads in suspected NFCI, which is distinct from frostbite protocols that employ rapid warm-water rewarming once refreezing risk is controlled [^113mKnps] [^113cQhfo] [^112jnWDm] [^1152KVyE].

Immersion foot (trench foot) results from **prolonged exposure to cold, wet conditions** (0–15°C) [^111aqyNr] without freezing, causing **persistent vasoconstriction and microvascular ischemia** [^112D6UUH] [^114Miev6] that injure nerves and soft tissues [^111hM56b]. Key mechanisms include sustained sympathetic vasoconstriction [^112D6UUH], endothelial dysfunction, and microthrombi, leading to hypoxia, acidosis, and nerve injury; **rewarming triggers reperfusion injury** with oxidative stress and inflammation, and chronic neuropathic pain and cold sensitivity are common sequelae [^117Wso7y] [^111hM56b]. Management involves passive rewarming [^113mKnps], elevation [^116YypjJ], and infection control [^112ygJXR]; prevention relies on keeping feet dry and warm and changing socks regularly [^116TUKDY].

---

## Environmental and physiological triggers

Immersion foot occurs when feet are exposed to cold, wet environments for **prolonged periods** [^111hM56b], typically at temperatures between 0°C and 15°C (32°F–59°F) [^111aqyNr]. Common scenarios include military operations [^111nqgDy], outdoor activities, and occupational exposures where feet remain wet and cold for extended periods.

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

The pathophysiology of immersion foot involves a **complex interplay** of vascular, neural, and tissue-level mechanisms [^111hM56b].

---

### Vascular mechanisms

- **Initial vasoconstriction**: Prolonged cold exposure triggers sustained sympathetic vasoconstriction [^112D6UUH], reducing blood flow to the extremities [^111w5nX5] and causing ischemia [^111hM56b].

- **Endothelial dysfunction**: Persistent vasoconstriction leads to endothelial injury, increased vascular permeability, and microvascular thrombosis, further compromising tissue perfusion.

- **Reperfusion injury**: Upon rewarming, reactive hyperemia occurs [^1164CKBb], causing oxidative stress [^112D6UUH], inflammation, and additional tissue damage.

---

### Neural mechanisms

**Sensory neuropathy** results from ischemic-hypoxic injury to peripheral nerves, particularly small fibers, leading to sensory disturbances such as numbness, paresthesia, and chronic neuropathic pain [^111hM56b]. **Autonomic dysfunction** arises from injury to autonomic fibers, causing impaired thermoregulation, chronic cold sensitivity, and hyperhidrosis [^1164CKBb].

---

### Tissue-level mechanisms

**Soft tissue injury** occurs as prolonged ischemia causes tissue hypoxia, acidosis, and cellular injury, leading to edema, blistering [^1164CKBb], and potential necrosis. The **inflammatory response** during reperfusion exacerbates tissue damage and delays healing.

---

## Clinical progression

Immersion foot typically progresses through **distinct clinical stages**:

| **Stage** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|
| Initial exposure | - Cold, numb, swollen, pulseless feet [^1164CKBb] <br/> - Intense vasoconstriction |
| Hyperemic phase | - Intense hyperemia <br/> - Severe pain [^1164CKBb] <br/> - Increased swelling |
| Post-hyperemic phase | - Persistent sensory disturbances [^1164CKBb] <br/> - Hyperhidrosis <br/> - Muscle atrophy |
| Chronic phase | - Persistent neuropathic pain [^111hM56b] <br/> - Cold sensitivity [^117Wso7y] <br/> - Chronic ulcers <br/> - Potential gangrene [^11632AhY] |

---

## Long-term complications

Immersion foot can result in significant long-term complications. These include **chronic neuropathic pain** [^111hM56b] with cold hypersensitivity [^117Wso7y], recurrent ulcers and infections due to impaired tissue perfusion and neuropathy, and progression to gangrene requiring surgical intervention or amputation [^113H8ggZ] [^11632AhY].

---

## Preventive measures

For **effective prevention**, key strategies include:

- **Limiting exposure**: Avoid prolonged exposure to cold, wet conditions [^116TUKDY].

- **Proper footwear**: Use insulating, non-constricting footwear and change socks regularly [^116TUKDY].

- **Foot hygiene**: Keep feet dry, clean, and warm [^116TUKDY].

- **Regular monitoring**: Conduct frequent foot inspections and rotate personnel out of cold, wet environments [^116TUKDY].

---

## Management strategies

Management involves:

- **Passive rewarming**: Gradual rewarming at room temperature [^113mKnps], avoiding rapid rewarming methods [^117KwfeZ].

- **Elevation and protection**: Elevate affected extremities [^116YypjJ] and protect from further injury [^113cQhfo].

- **Pain management**: Use analgesics [^113y9KdZ], including NSAIDs, amitriptyline, or gabapentin for neuropathic pain [^112RDh3g] [^115g1V36].

- **Infection control**: Administer antibiotics only if infection is present [^112ygJXR] [^114Aetk2].

- **Surgical intervention**: Consult surgery for suspected tissue necrosis or gangrene [^11632AhY] [^113H8ggZ].

---

Immersion foot is a **preventable condition** caused by prolonged exposure to cold, wet environments and is characterized by vascular, neural, and tissue-level injury. Understanding these mechanisms supports effective prevention, early recognition, and appropriate management to reduce long-term complications [^111aqyNr].

### Chronic non-freezing cold injury results in neuropathic pain due to a sensory neuropathy [^111hM56b]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

Just over 100 years ago, 'trench foot' was described as a unique clinical syndrome observed in soldiers during World War I. Trench foot was caused by exposure to cold and wet conditions and was associated with swelling, pain, and sensory disturbance of the feet. In World War II, sailors developed 'immersion foot' due to submersion of the feet in cold water. Non-freezing cold injury (NFCI) is the umbrella term for these conditions and is part of the spectrum of cold environmental injuries. However, the clinical syndrome termed NFCI is not generally associated with the same degree of tissue loss as 'trench foot' and 'immersion foot'. NFCI results from exposure to temperatures between 0 and 15°C and is distinct from frostbite because tissue freezing does not occur. When cold is combined with moisture, the risk of injury is increased.

NFCI affects individuals of African ethnicity more frequently than Caucasians. A number of phases of NFCI have been recognized. Acutely, during the period of cold exposure, patients report sensory dysfunction in the extremities: numbness, paraesthesia, and pain, as well as vasomotor disturbance (pallor) that may be followed by swelling, erythema, and exacerbation of pain on rewarming of the affected limbs. Some patients develop chronic NFCI with persistent sensory symptoms, in particular chronic pain and cold hypersensitivity of the hands and feet. Despite the fact that NFCI is a recognized syndrome in military personnel, mountaineers, fishermen, and the homeless, it remains a diagnostic challenge.

We will include any study that fulfills our eligibility criteria and reports at least one of the outcomes of interest, which we have specified in this section. If we exclude studies based on outcomes, we will ensure that relevant outcomes are not available because they have not been measured, rather than simply not reported, by contacting the study authors.

For the purpose of this review, we will extract data on each outcome for two time points that correspond with the short-term (baseline measurement) and long-term effects (follow-up measurement). If measures are taken on multiple occasions within a specified timeframe (short- and long-term), we will prioritize outcomes measured initially at baseline to represent the short-term effects. Equally, if measures are taken on multiple follow-up occasions, we will prioritize outcomes measured at the latest time point to represent the long-term effect. We will only combine data for similar time points within a certain timeframe: short term (up to 1 month) and long term (one month or longer).

We will extract continuous data, as reported in the different studies, up to the longest follow-up period presented, but will only combine data for similar time points.

### Chronic non-freezing cold injury results in neuropathic pain due to a sensory neuropathy [^113AJvzn]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

All participants experienced symptoms in their feet and almost all in their hands. None of the participants suffered tissue loss, gangrene, amputation, or skin ulceration. The most prominent symptoms were chronic pain and cold hypersensitivity. All participants experienced pain limited to the hands and feet, which was bilateral and symmetrical in all cases.

The median BPI pain severity was high at 6.0 (4.8–7.8). Pain qualities were neuropathic in nature, as reflected by a median DN4 score of 7.5 (6.0–8.0) with all participants scoring ≥ 4 on the DN4. All participants experienced cold hypersensitivity, characterized by the exacerbation or emergence of symptoms in cool or cold conditions that would not previously have provoked such symptoms.

Subjective impairment in temperature sensibility was reported by 32 participants (76.2%). They had to use a more proximal part of the upper limb to test water temperature when showering or needed to use a thermometer to test water temperature when bathing children. The chronic pain and cold hypersensitivity had a significant deleterious impact on the quality of life for the study participants. The median BPI pain interference score was high at 7.2 (5.6–8.6), impacting all aspects of daily life. For example, 73.7% of study participants reported an exacerbation of symptoms when they used the fridge or freezer at home.

### Comparison of distal limb warming with Fluidotherapy and warm water immersion for mild hypothermia rewarming [^112tD6tE]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of the study was to determine the effectiveness of Fluidotherapy rewarming through the distal extremities for mildly hypothermic, vigorously shivering subjects. Fluidotherapy is a dry heat modality in which cellulose particles are suspended by warm air circulation.

Seven subjects (2 female) were cooled on three occasions in 8°C water for 60 minutes, or to a core temperature of 35°C. They were then dried and rewarmed in a seated position by shivering only; Fluidotherapy applied to the distal extremities (46 ± 1°C, mean ± SD); or water immersion of the distal extremities (44 ± 1°C). The order of rewarming followed a balanced design. Esophageal temperature, skin temperature, heart rate, oxygen consumption, and heat flux were measured.

The warm water produced the highest rewarming rate, 6.1°C·h⁻¹, 95% CI: 5.3–6.9, compared with Fluidotherapy, 2.2°C·h⁻¹, 95% CI: 1.4–3.0, and shivering only, 2.0°C·h⁻¹, 95% CI: 1.2–2.8. The Fluidotherapy and warm water conditions increased skin temperature and inhibited shivering heat production, thus reducing metabolic heat production (166 ± 42 W and 181 ± 45 W, respectively), compared with shivering only (322 ± 142 W). Warm water provided a significantly higher net heat gain (398.0 ± 52 W) than shivering only (288.4 ± 115 W).

Fluidotherapy was not as effective as warm water for rewarming mildly hypothermic subjects. Although Fluidotherapy is more portable and technically simpler, it provides a lower rate of rewarming that is similar to shivering only.

### Plantar skin exhibits altered physiology, constitutive activation of wound-associated phenotypes, and inherently delayed healing [^115EXrWe]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Wound research has typically been performed without regard for the location of wounds on the body, despite well-known heterogeneities in the physical and biological properties of different skin areas. The skin covering the palms and soles is highly specialized, and plantar ulcers are among the most challenging and costly wound types to manage. Using primarily the porcine model, we demonstrate that plantar skin is more molecularly and functionally distinct from nonplantar skin than previously recognized. It possesses unique gene and protein expression profiles, broad alterations in cellular functions, constitutive activation of many wound-associated phenotypes, and inherently delayed healing. This unusual physiology is likely to play a significant but underappreciated role in the pathogenesis of plantar ulcers, as well as the last 25+ years of futility in therapy development efforts. By revealing this critical yet unrecognized pitfall, we hope to contribute to the development of more effective therapies for these devastating nonhealing wounds.

### Foot fractures in restrained front seat car occupants: A long-term study over twenty-three years [^1127hUBB]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2001). Low credibility.

To analyze the mechanism of injury for foot and ankle fractures resulting from automobile accidents, we aim to create a basis for developing an improved design for protection.

- **Design**: Retrospective study conducted in a Level I trauma center with an accident research unit.

- **Patients**: Automobile accident reports and medical records of individuals injured in the accidents were reviewed.

- **Main outcome measurements**: Technical indicators such as collision type, impulse angle, deltav, and extent of vehicle deformation were examined alongside clinical data including injury location and severity (abbreviated injury scale and injury severity score) and long-term outcomes.

From 1973 to 1996, 15,559 car accidents were analyzed. Of these, 261 front seat occupants sustained fractures of the foot and ankle (ankle, 41%; forefoot, 29%; midfoot, 20%; and hindfoot, 10%). Seventy-five percent of the fractures were classified as abbreviated injury scale (foot) 2. The incidence, location, and abbreviated injury scale (foot) category of fractures were similar between drivers (n = 210) and front seat passengers (n = 51). Fifty percent of the fractures occurred in head-on collisions, while 34% occurred in accidents with multiple collisions. The deltav ranged in 82% of car crashes between fifteen and sixty kilometers per hour. The deltav and extent of foot compartment deformation correlated with the abbreviated injury scale. During our investigation, the deltav increased, the injury severity score decreased, and the extent of deformation did not differ significantly.

### Case series of non-freezing cold injury: The modern clinical syndrome [^111nqgDy]. BMJ Military Health (2020). Low credibility.

Non-freezing cold injury (NFCI) occurs when peripheral tissue is damaged by cold exposure but not to the extent of freezing. Historically, the phenotype of NFCIs sustained was severe, whereas today the spectrum of injury represented in the UK military predominantly comprises subtler injuries. The diagnostic challenge of recognizing these injuries, both in the acute and chronic settings, can lead to mismanagement and subsequent morbidity.

- **Methods**: We characterized a recent case series of 100 UK Service Personnel referred with suspected NFCI to a Military UK NFCI clinic. We characterized the acute and chronic phenotype of those diagnosed with NFCI (n = 76) and made comparisons to those who received alternate diagnoses (n = 24) to find discriminatory symptoms and signs.

- **Results**: The most common acute symptoms of NFCI were the extremities becoming cold to the point of loss of feeling for more than 30 minutes (sensitivity 96%, specificity 90%, p < 0.001), followed by a period of painful rewarming (sensitivity 81%, specificity 67%, p < 0.001). In-field foot/hand inspections took place in half of the NFCI cases. Importantly, remaining in the field and undergoing multiple cycles of cooling and rewarming after an initial NFCI was associated with having double the risk of the NFCI persisting for more than a week. The most common and discriminant chronic symptoms and signs of NFCI were having extremities that behave differently during cold exposures (sensitivity 81%, specificity 75%, p < 0.001) and having abnormal pinprick sensation in the affected extremity (sensitivity 88%).

### Heel pressure injuries: Consensus-based recommendations for assessment and management [^112m2Wv9]. Advances in Wound Care (2020). Low credibility.

The translational relevance of heel pressure injuries (HPIs) is significant, as their commonality poses high risks for patients. Despite their prevalence, the pathophysiology of HPIs is not yet fully understood. In particular, the mechanisms underlying the relationship between bed rest and the development of heel ulcers still require clarification, which currently precludes the development of adequate strategies for diagnosis and management. Furthermore, the crucial involvement of vital structures, such as bone and the calcaneal tendon, is particularly important. This issue is even more evident and disabling in frail elderly individuals and babies.

### Early use of iloprost in nonfreezing cold injury [^113H8ggZ]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI) is caused by prolonged exposure to cold, usually wet conditions, and represents a separate pathological entity from frostbite. The pathophysiology of NFCI is characterized by vasoconstriction and microcirculatory disturbance. Iloprost, a synthetic prostaglandin analogue with vasodilatory properties, is a recognized adjuvant treatment in frostbite; however, its role in NFCI is unclear. We present a case of a 29-year-old man with severe NFCI to both forefeet after prolonged immersion in cold seawater. Initial treatment with passive rewarming, analgesia, and aspirin was initiated. Infusion of iloprost was used within 24 hours from presentation and was well tolerated. This resulted in reduced tissue loss compared to the apparent tissue damage documented during the initial assessment. Delayed surgical intervention allowed minor debridement and minor toe amputations, maintaining the patient's ability to ambulate. This case demonstrates the safe use of iloprost in acute NFCI and highlights the importance of delayed surgical intervention in patients presenting with severe NFCI.

The disease immersion foot syndromes are associated with conditions such as prolonged exposure to wet environments, frostbite, and military service. Symptoms may include foot wrinkles, foot numbness, gait disturbance, foot pain, and foot swelling. Additional signs include waterlogged soles, white skin, cyanosis, skin blisters, decreased body temperature, and foot erythema. These conditions are commonly experienced by fishermen and sailors.

### The immersion foot syndrome [^1164CKBb]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Prolonged exposure of the extremities to cold, insufficient to cause tissue freezing, produces a well-defined syndrome. "Immersion foot" is one of the descriptive but inaccurate terms applied to this syndrome. The clinical features, aetiology, pathology, prevention, and treatment of immersion foot are considered in detail, alongside a discussion on pathogenesis.

In the natural history of a typical case of immersion foot, there are four stages: the period of exposure and the pre-hyperaemic, hyperaemic, and post-hyperaemic stages. During exposure and immediately after rescue, the feet are cold, numb, swollen, and pulseless. Intense vasoconstriction sufficient to arrest blood flow is believed to be the predominant factor during this phase.

This is followed by a period of intense hyperaemia, increased swelling, and severe pain. Hyperaemia is due to the release in chilled and ischaemic tissues of relatively stable vasodilator metabolites; pain may be the result of relative anoxia of sensory nerve endings.

Within 7–10 days of rescue, the intense hyperaemia and swelling subside, and pain diminishes in intensity. A lesser degree of hyperaemia may persist for several weeks. Objective disturbances of sensation, sweating, muscular atrophy, and paralysis now become apparent. These findings are correlated with damage to the peripheral nerves.

After several weeks, the feet become cold-sensitive; when exposed to low temperatures, they cool abnormally and may remain cold for several hours. Hyperhidrosis frequently accompanies this cold sensitivity.

### Epidemiology of foot injury in a high-income developing country [^113adB6Z]. Injury (2010). Low credibility.

To study the epidemiology of foot injuries and factors predicting their severity in a high-income developing country, the objective was to define prevention priorities. All patients admitted to Al-Ain Hospital with foot injuries between March 2003 and March 2006 were identified from a prospectively collected Trauma Registry. Injuries were scored using the foot and ankle severity scale (FASS). Severe foot injuries, defined as bilateral, multiple or segmental injuries, open fractures, or those with a FASS score higher than 3, were compared to simple foot injuries regarding patient demographics, co-morbidities, trauma mechanism and energy, incident location, number of associated injuries, Injury Severity Score (ISS), and hospital stay using a univariate analysis. A logistic regression model was then used to study factors predicting the severity of foot injuries.

A total of 171 patients (156 males) were studied, with an average (range) age of 34 (2–75). Among them, 95 had right foot injuries, 66 had left, and 10 had both. The most common mechanism was a fall from height. A majority, 105 (61%), had work-related injuries, and 130 (76%) had isolated foot injuries. Overall, 151 (88%) sustained 212 foot fractures, while 20 (12%) had soft tissue injuries. Severe injuries were found in 70 (41%) patients, whereas 101 (59%) had simple injuries. The multiple logistic model was highly significant (p = 0.002). The number of associated injuries (p = 0.025) and location of trauma (p = 0.044) were significant predictors, while the amount of energy (p = 0.054) showed a strong trend towards predicting severity.

In conclusion, a fall from height was identified as the most common mechanism of foot injury.

### Battlefield trauma-induced hypothermia: Transitioning the preferred method of casualty rewarming [^113cAJqn]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

For centuries, cold and wet weather has affected military combat operations, leading to a tremendous loss of manpower due to cold-weather-related injuries, including trench foot, frostbite, and hypothermia. The initial battlefield management of hypothermia in military personnel did not advance significantly following many wars and conflicts until 2006.

The aim of this review is to provide an overview of trauma-induced hypothermia (TIH) and to highlight these key aspects:

- **Department of Defense strategy**: Implementation of a hypothermia clinical management program for battlefield (prehospital) casualties.
- **Research and development**: Development of the Hypothermia Prevention and Management Kit (HPMK) as the preferred field rewarming system for battlefield TIH.
- **Transition to civilian sector**: How the HPMK can be easily adapted for active rewarming of both accidental and TIH patients.

The HPMK is ideal for use in civilian Emergency Medical Services and austere prehospital care environments. This kit is a low-cost, lightweight, small-dimension commercial product that can provide effective passive management or active rewarming for both accidental (primary) and trauma-induced (secondary) hypothermia patients.

### Cold water immersion syndrome and whitewater recreation fatalities [^115EhbGx]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Sudden death during whitewater recreation often occurs through understandable mechanisms such as underwater entrapment or trauma, but poorly defined events are common, particularly in colder water. These uncharacterized tragedies are frequently called flush drownings by whitewater enthusiasts. We believe the condition referred to as cold water immersion syndrome may be responsible for some of these deaths. Given this assumption, the physiological alterations contributing to cold water immersion syndrome are reviewed with an emphasis on those factors pertinent to flush drowning.

### The impact of foot shock-induced stress on pain-related behavior associated with burn injury [^112ZK2YN]. Burns (2021). Low credibility.

Acute pain is prevalent following burn injury and can often transition to chronic pain. Prolonged acute pain is an important risk factor for chronic pain, yet there is little preclinical research addressing this issue. Using a mouse model of second-degree burn, we investigated whether pre-existing stress influences pain sensitivity following a burn injury. We introduced stress in two different ways:

- **Foot-shock as a pre-injury stressor**: Using repeated mild foot shocks to induce stress over 10 continuous days.

- **Use of A/J mice**: Representing higher pre-existing stress compared to C57Bl/6 mice.

C57Bl/6 and A/J mice were subjected to either a burn injury or a sham burn injury on the plantar surface of the right hind paw. Assessments of mechanical and thermal sensitivities of the injured and uninjured paws were conducted during the shock protocol and at intervals up to 82 days post-burn injury.

In both strains of mice that underwent burn injury, thermal hypersensitivity and mechanical allodynia appeared rapidly in the ipsilateral paw. Stressed mice took much longer to recover their hind paw mechanical thresholds to baseline compared to non-stressed mice in both burn and non-burn groups. Analysis of the two mouse strains revealed that the recovery of mechanical thresholds in A/J mice, which exhibit higher levels of baseline anxiety, was shorter than in C57Bl/6 mice. No differences were observed regarding thermal sensitivities between strains.

Our results support the view that stress exposure prior to burn injury affects mechanical recovery outcomes.

### In pursuit of 'safe' water: The burden of personal injury from water fetching in 21 low-income and middle-income countries [^115ywK3g]. BMJ Global Health (2020). Low credibility.

The "bodily location" was specified for 211 reported injuries. Nearly two-thirds of these were injuries to the lower limbs (61.1%).

Information on the "physical context" was available for 85 (9.7%) injuries. Of the specified contexts, 69.4% occurred due to dangerous terrain (e.g. falling into bushes, stepping on nails), 23.5% due to poor roads, and 7.1% due to weather, such as heat or rain.

In bivariate analyses, several significant gender differences in the characteristics of injuries were observed. Men were significantly more likely than women to report fatigue (8.3% vs. 2.0%) and traffic accidents (14.8% vs. 3.5%). In contrast, women were nearly twice as likely to fall as men (61.4% vs. 33.7%). Men were also significantly more likely than women to report injuries from physical confrontation (10.7% vs. 3.5%).

- **Gender differences in reported water-fetching injuries**:
	- **Type of injury**: Examined across 24 HWISE sites in 21 low-income and middle-income countries (n = 716). HWISE, Household Water Insecurity Experiences.
	- **Mechanism**: Differences observed in the mechanisms causing injuries.
	- **Bodily location**: Distribution of injuries across bodily locations.
	- **Physical context**: Impact of different contexts on injury rates.

We began investigating our second objective — understanding the covariates of any injury — using single-predictor regression analyses. Most characteristics of those who reported injuries were significantly different from those who did not. Notably, women were significantly more likely to report injuries than men (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.74).

### Digital high-pressure injection injury: The importance of early recognition and treatment [^1116b3gV]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

High-pressure injection (HPI) injuries are an uncommon mechanism of trauma. The clinical effects of an HPI injury depend upon several variables, including the pressures involved, chemical toxicity, the quantity of material injected, and its temperature. Evidence within the literature has shown that a delay in identifying and treating such injuries can lead to devastating consequences. We describe one such case of an HPI injury involving engine oil to a digit. Additionally, we review the clinical course, pathophysiology, and management of such injuries.

### Cold exposure injuries to the extremities [^114e2rYh]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Cold exposure injuries include nonfreezing injuries such as chilblain (also known as pernio) and trench or immersion foot, as well as freezing injuries. These affect core body tissues, resulting in hypothermia of peripheral tissues and leading to frostnip or frostbite. Frostbite is the most severe peripheral injury, causing tissue necrosis through direct cellular damage and indirect damage from vasospasm and arterial thromboses.

The risk of frostbite is influenced by host factors, particularly alcohol use and smoking, as well as environmental factors including ambient temperature, duration of exposure, altitude, and wind speed. Rewarming frostbite should not be initiated until definitive medical care can be assured to prevent repeated freeze-thaw cycles, which exacerbate tissue necrosis.

- **Treatment**: Rewarming should be rapid and, for an affected limb, performed by submersion in warm water at 104 to 107.6 degrees Fahrenheit (40 to 42 degrees Celsius) for 15 to 30 minutes. Débridement of necrotic tissue is generally postponed until clear demarcation from viable tissue is visible, a process taking 1 to 3 months from the initial exposure. Immediate escharotomy or fasciotomy is necessary if circulation is compromised.

- **Sequelae**: Beyond the acute injury, frostbite is associated with late sequelae including altered vasomotor function, neuropathies, changes in joint articular cartilage, and, in children, growth defects due to epiphyseal plate damage.

### Influence of cold water immersion on limb and cutaneous blood flow at rest [^114Miev6]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Cold water immersion reduces exercise-induced muscle damage, and the benefits may partly arise from a decline in limb blood flow. However, no study has comprehensively investigated the influence of different degrees of cooling via cold water immersion on limb blood flow responses.

- **Purpose**: To determine the influence of cold (8°C) and cool (22°C) water immersion on lower limb and cutaneous blood flow.

- **Study design**: Controlled laboratory study.

- **Methods**: Nine men were placed in a semireclined position and lowered into 8°C or 22°C water to the iliac crest for two 5-minute periods interspersed with 2 minutes of nonimmersion. Rectal and thigh skin temperature, deep and superficial muscle temperature, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, thigh cutaneous blood velocity (measured via laser Doppler), and superficial femoral artery blood flow (measured via duplex ultrasound) were measured during immersion and for 30 minutes after immersion. Indices of vascular conductance were calculated (flux and blood flow/mean arterial pressure).

- **Results**: Reductions in rectal temperature (8°C, 0.2° ± 0.1°C; 22°C, 0.1° ± 0.1°C) and thigh skin temperature (8°C, 6.2° ± 0.5°C; 22°C, 3.2° ± 0.2°C) were greater in 8°C water than in 22°C (P < .01). Femoral artery conductance was reduced to a similar extent immediately after immersion (~30%) and 30 minutes after immersion (~40%) under both conditions (P < .01). In contrast, there was less thigh cutaneous vasoconstriction during and after immersion in 8°C water compared with 22°C (P = 0.01).

- **Conclusion**: These data suggest that immersion at both temperatures results in significant physiological changes.

### Immersion foot: A case report [^114JTwEz]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Immersion foot, commonly called "trench foot", was originally described in the military literature during World War I. Since that time, the Emergency Department (ED) has become a common setting where this injury presents. However, this topic is neglected in the emergency medicine literature. The purpose of this case report is to present trench foot in a way that is relevant to emergency physicians and to provide an up-to-date summary of the history, case reports, physiology, clinical presentation, and treatment of this injury.

- **Case report**: Here we present the case of a homeless, schizophrenic patient who presented to one Midwestern ED in January for immersion foot. Photos of the actual patient are shown to illustrate the case.

- **Awareness for emergency physicians**: Due to unfamiliarity, immersion foot can go undiagnosed during assessment of patients exposed to moist environments. In addition, patients at increased risk for developing immersion foot are frequently encountered in EDs. Most importantly, the appropriate treatment for immersion foot is different from the treatment for other freezing cold injuries.

### How does mechanism of injury relate to similar fracture patterns in bilateral displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures [^111qTU54]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Several biomechanical and cadaver studies have established a correlation between the mechanism of injury and fracture classification in calcaneal fractures; however, this has never been backed up by clinical studies. This study tests the hypothesis that the alleged similar mechanism of injury for both feet in bilateral calcaneal fractures leads to similar fracture types.

In this retrospective cross-sectional cohort study, patients with unilateral and bilateral calcaneal fractures treated between 2000 and 2017 were classified according to Essex-Lopresti and Sanders. Positive predictive values were computed, signifying the chance that the fracture type in the left foot corresponded to that in the right foot. These were then compared to the a priori chance of a fracture type (percentage of fracture type in unilateral fractures) by constructing 95% confidence intervals of the positive predictive value for each fracture type.

Of the 451 patients, 413 (91.6%) had unilateral and 38 (8.4%) bilateral calcaneal fractures. The mechanisms of injury were similar for unilateral and bilateral fractures. Using the Essex-Lopresti fracture classification, 34 cases (90%) had the same classification in both feet, compared with 24 cases (63%) in the Sanders classification. The chance of a fracture type in the left foot, with the right foot as reference, was significantly larger than expected from the a priori chance in the unilateral population. This leads to a new hypothesis that, more than the mechanism of injury, the magnitude of the impact and the position of the foot are important in predicting fracture classification.

### An updated epidemiology of foot and ankle fractures in the United States: Complications, mechanisms, and risk factors [^115mBQMs]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Foot and ankle fractures are prevalent emergent injuries, about which there remains a lack of in-depth epidemiological information. This analysis of the epidemiology of foot and ankle injuries in the United States updates a previously conducted study. Data from the National Trauma Data Bank (2012–2017) were used for analysis. Demographic variables, mechanism of injuries, and comorbidities were analyzed to determine risk factors for complications after foot and ankle injuries. Young adults aged 21 to 30 years had the highest injury rates; however, in general, older individuals were more at risk for complications. Black individuals were more at risk for certain complications, while Asians were at lower risk when compared to White individuals. The comorbidities of bleeding disorders, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease all increased the risk of at least one complication. In terms of mechanism, traffic incidents were found to be the most strongly associated with complications.

### Trpa1 is essential for the vascular response to environmental cold exposure [^112D6UUH]. Nature Communications (2014). High credibility.

The cold-induced vascular response, consisting of vasoconstriction followed by vasodilatation, is critical for protecting the cutaneous tissues against cold injury. While this physiological reflex response is historically known, the mechanisms involved remain unclear. By using a murine model of local environmental cold exposure, we demonstrate that TRPA1 acts as a primary vascular cold sensor, as determined through TRPA1 pharmacological antagonism or gene deletion. The initial cold-induced vasoconstriction is mediated via TRPA1-dependent superoxide production that stimulates α2C-adrenoceptors and Rho-kinase-mediated MLC phosphorylation, downstream of TRPA1 activation. The subsequent restorative blood flow component is also TRPA1-dependent and is mediated by sensory nerve-derived dilator neuropeptides, CGRP and substance P, as well as nNOS-derived NO. These results provide a new understanding of the importance of TRPA1 in cold exposure and offer impetus for further research into developing therapeutic agents aimed at the local protection of the skin in disease and adverse climates.

### Out of this world: Wound healing on Earth and in space [^116mTxJU]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Impaired wound healing is a significant concern for humans in space, where the unique microgravity environment poses challenges to the natural healing processes of the body. Similar to chronic wounds on Earth, such as diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers, wounds inflicted in space exhibit delayed or impaired healing responses. These wounds share common features, including dysregulated cellular signaling, altered cytokine profiles, and impaired tissue regeneration. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying wound healing under microgravity. In this review, we focused on exploring the parallels between wound healing in space and chronic wounds on Earth as a fundamental approach for developing effective countermeasures to promote healing and mitigate associated health risks during long-space missions.

### Mathematical models to assess foot-ground interaction: An overview [^113HW1jw]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2013). Low credibility.

The mechanical properties of the interface between the human body and the ground play an important role in attenuating the foot strike impact during locomotion. Understanding the properties of such an impact-attenuating system and the mathematical models governing its behavior has major implications in determining the load on the musculoskeletal system during locomotion.

This interface consists of the plantar soft tissue and the sole complex of the shoe that together act like a sophisticated suspension system with generic viscoelastic properties. The interface has generally been modeled as a system of spring and damper, in which the reaction force deformation is expressed by a mathematical equation that represents the reaction force as a nonlinear function of the deformation and deformation rate of the interface.

This overview intends to provide insight into the different mathematical models that have been used to describe such a relationship and to further understand the role of the reaction model parameters in determining the behavior of the interface under compression. Various models included within this review range from those representing the plantar soft tissue behavior during barefoot walking to those considering the sole complex force-deformation behavior during shod foot running.

- **Barefoot models**: These are categorized under in vitro/in situ and in vivo models.
- **Sole complex behavior models**: These are investigated before discussing the shod foot models. The mathematical models varied from those in which the reaction force was a nonlinear function.

### Three main mechanisms characterize medial collateral ligament injuries in professional male soccer-blow to the knee, contact to the leg or foot, and sliding: Video analysis of 37 consecutive injuries [^111W5q5B]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe the mechanisms, situational patterns, and biomechanics (kinematics) of medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries in professional male soccer players.

- **Design**: Case series.

- **Methods**: Fifty-seven consecutive MCL injuries across two seasons of professional soccer matches were identified. Researchers obtained and reviewed 37 of these 57 (65%) injury videos to establish the injury mechanism, situational pattern, and knee flexion angle. Detailed biomechanical analysis was used to assess indirect and noncontact injuries. Injury layoff times, timing of injuries during the match, and the location of injuries on the pitch were also reported.

- **Results**: Twenty-three (62%) injuries were direct contact, nine (24%) were indirect contact, and five (14%) were noncontact. Three main sprain mechanisms were noted: (1) direct contact/blow to the knee (n = 16); (2) contact to the leg or foot (lever-like) (n = 7); and (3) sliding (n = 9). Seventy-three percent of MCL injuries occurred during two main situations: (1) pressing/tackling (n = 14, 38%) and (2) being tackled (n = 13, 35%). For indirect and noncontact injuries, knee valgus loading (100% of cases), hip abduction (73% of cases), and external foot rotation (92% of cases) were prominent injury kinematics, often with lateral trunk tilt (median, 10°; 64% of cases) and rotation (64% of cases). Knee flexion angles were higher for indirect and noncontact injuries (median, 100°) than for direct-contact injuries (median, 22°; P < .01).

- **Conclusion**: Nearly two-thirds of MCL injuries occurred after direct contact. One in every four MCL injuries occurred…

### Trench foot: The medical response in the first World War 1914–18 [^112fKSDx]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The approaching 90-year anniversary of United States entry into the Great War is an apt time to examine the response to trench foot (now called nonfreezing cold injury [NFCI]) in this conflict. Trench foot appeared in the winter of 1914, characterized by pedal swelling, numbness, and pain. It was quickly recognized by military-medical authorities. There was little debate over whether it was frostbite or a new condition, and it was quickly accepted as a specific disease. The major etiologies proposed were exposure, diet, and infection. The opinion emerged that it was caused by circulatory changes in the foot due to cold, wet, and pressure. Predisposing factors included dietary inadequacy and fatigue. A number of labels were first given to the disease; however, the name "trench foot" was eventually officially sanctioned.

Trench foot became a serious problem for the Allies, leading to 75,000 casualties in the British forces and 2,000 in the American forces. Therapy for trench foot involved a number of conventional, tried-and-tested, and conservative methods. Some more innovative techniques were used. Amputation was only used as a last resort. Prevention involved general measures to improve the trench environment, modification of the footwear worn by the men, and the provision of greases to protect them from moisture. The medical reaction to this condition seems to have been relatively effective. The causation was identified, and prophylactic measures were introduced to fit this model; these measures appear to have been successful in reducing the prevalence of the condition by 1917–18.

### Hypothermia and localized cold injuries [^117JkPeK]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Hypothermia and localized cold injuries are largely preventable with proper preparation for activities in cold environments. Proficient field management is crucial to the final outcome in terms of function and viability because proper care is vital to preventing exacerbation of the initial exposure and injury. Rapid rewarming is optimal when further cold exposure can be avoided reliably. Repetitive freeze-thaw cycles are associated with increased morbidity and tissue loss caused by progressive microvascular injury and thrombosis. The subsequent care is largely supportive and consists of wound care and physical and hydrotherapy to promote optimal functional recovery.

### Chronic non-freezing cold injury results in neuropathic pain due to a sensory neuropathy [^117Wso7y]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

Non-freezing cold injury develops after sustained exposure to cold temperatures, resulting in tissue cooling but not freezing. This condition can result in persistent sensory disturbance of the hands and feet, including numbness, paraesthesia, and chronic pain. Both vascular and neurological aetiologies of this pain have been suggested but remain unproven.

We prospectively approached patients referred for clinical assessment of chronic pain following non-freezing cold injury between 12 February 2014 and 30 November 2016. Of the 47 patients approached, 42 consented to undergo detailed neurological evaluations. These evaluations included questionnaires to detail pain location and characteristics, a structured neurological examination, quantitative sensory testing, nerve conduction studies, and a skin biopsy for intraepidermal nerve fibre assessment.

Of the 42 study participants, all had experienced non-freezing cold injury while serving in the UK armed services, with the majority being of African descent (76.2%) and male (95.2%). Many participants reported multiple exposures to cold. The median time between initial injury and referral was 3.72 years.

Pain was principally localized to the hands and the feet, neuropathic in nature, and in all study participants associated with cold hypersensitivity. Clinical examination and quantitative sensory testing were consistent with a sensory neuropathy. In all cases, large fibre nerve conduction studies were normal. The intraepidermal nerve fibre density was markedly reduced, with 90.5% of participants having a count at or below the 0.05 percentile of published normative controls.

### Cold water mediates greater reductions in limb blood flow than whole body cryotherapy [^111w5nX5]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2017). High credibility.

Cold-water immersion (CWI) and whole body cryotherapy (WBC) are widely used recovery methods aimed at limiting exercise-induced muscle damage, soreness, and functional deficits after strenuous exercise. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of ecologically valid CWI and WBC protocols on post-exercise lower limb thermoregulatory, femoral artery, and cutaneous blood flow responses.

Ten males completed a continuous cycle exercise protocol at 70% maximal oxygen uptake until a rectal temperature of 38°C was attained. Participants were then exposed to lower-body CWI (8°C) for 10 minutes or WBC (-110°C) for 2 minutes in a randomized crossover design. Rectal and thigh skin, deep and superficial muscle temperatures, thigh and calf skin blood flow (laser Doppler flowmetry), superficial femoral artery blood flow (duplex ultrasound), and arterial blood pressure were measured before, and for 40 minutes post, cooling interventions.

Greater reductions in thigh skin temperature (CWI, -5.9°C ± 1.8°C; WBC, 0.2°C ± 0.5°C; P < 0.001) and superficial (CWI, -4.4°C ± 1.3°C; WBC, -1.8°C ± 1.1°C; P < 0.001) and deep muscle temperatures (CWI, -2.9°C ± 0.8°C; WBC, -1.3°C ± 0.6°C; P < 0.001) occurred immediately after CWI. Decreases in femoral artery conductance were greater after CWI (CWI, -84% ± 11%; WBC, -59% ± 21%; P < 0.02) and thigh (CWI, -80% ± 5%; WBC, -59% ± 14%; P < 0.001) and calf cutaneous vasoconstriction (CWI, -73% ± 13%; WBC, -45% ± 17%; P < 0.001) was greater after CWI. Reductions in rectal temperature were similar between conditions after cooling (CWI, -0.6°C).

Reporting bias assessment

Reporting biases may occur when the dissemination of research findings is influenced by the nature and direction of results. If we include 10 or more studies, we will use funnel plots to assess small study biases. If the funnel plots present asymmetry, we will investigate the possible reasons, such as true heterogeneity of effect with respect to study size, methodological design, and selective non-reporting; statistical advice will be sought for their interpretation.

- **Synthesis methods**: We only intend to undertake a meta-analysis if we believe the PICOs are adequately similar for a clinically meaningful result. We will conduct the meta-analysis via a random-effects model, using Cochrane's Q test to check for significant heterogeneity and calculating the I² statistic to quantify heterogeneity. When a meta-analysis is not possible, we will conduct alternative forms of synthesis, including the summary of effect estimates, the combination of P values, and vote counting based on the direction of effects, as described in Chapter 12 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. In such cases, we will follow the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) reporting guideline for results reporting.

We will consider the clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity of the included studies to guide our decisions regarding pooling of the data. We will assess heterogeneity using Chi² and I² and will use the guidance for interpretation as described in Chapter 10 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

### Stener-like lesions in the hand, knee and foot: A review of anatomy, mechanism of injury and imaging evaluation [^112PRsnh]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

A Stener lesion is a displaced tear of the ulnar collateral ligament in the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb, in which the adductor pollicis aponeurosis is positioned between the retracted ligament and the injury site, preventing natural healing. This lesion was first described in 1962, and since then, both radiologists and orthopedists have considered it important to treat surgically. Although this lesion was originally described in the thumb, this injury mechanism can occur in other joints of the hand, knee, and foot. The purpose of this study was to review the relevant aspects of classic Stener lesions of the thumb, as well as other Stener-like lesions, including their anatomy, mechanisms of lesion formation, and imaging features. The Stener-like injury pattern often necessitates surgical repair or reconstruction; thus, it is essential that radiologists recognize and report the different patterns of injury.

### Cold-water immersion (cryotherapy) for preventing and treating muscle soreness after exercise [^116zicUC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Many strategies are in use with the intention of preventing or minimizing delayed onset muscle soreness and fatigue after exercise. Cold-water immersion, in water temperatures of less than 15°C, is currently one of the most popular interventional strategies used after exercise.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effects of cold-water immersion in the management of muscle soreness after exercise.

- **Search methods**: In February 2010, we searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 1), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), British Nursing Index and archive (BNI), and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro). We also searched the reference lists of articles, handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and contacted experts. In November 2011, we updated the searches of CENTRAL (2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (up to November Week 3, 2011), EMBASE (2011 Week 46), and CINAHL (to 28 November 2011) to check for more recent publications.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing the effect of using cold-water immersion after exercise with passive intervention (rest/no intervention), contrast immersion, warm-water immersion, active recovery, compression, or a different duration/dosage of cold-water immersion. Primary outcomes were pain (muscle soreness) or tenderness (pain on palpation), and subjective recovery (return to previous activities without signs or symptoms).

### Trpa1 is essential for the vascular response to environmental cold exposure [^115qFpwB]. Nature Communications (2014). Low credibility.

The cold-induced vascular response, consisting of vasoconstriction followed by vasodilatation, is critical for protecting the cutaneous tissues against cold injury. While this physiological reflex response is historically known, the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Using a murine model of local environmental cold exposure, we show that TRPA1 acts as a primary vascular cold sensor, as determined through TRPA1 pharmacological antagonism or gene deletion. The initial cold-induced vasoconstriction is mediated via TRPA1-dependent superoxide production that stimulates α2C-adrenoceptors and Rho-kinase-mediated MLC phosphorylation, downstream of TRPA1 activation. The subsequent restorative blood flow component is also dependent on TRPA1 activation, being mediated by sensory nerve-derived dilator neuropeptides CGRP and substance P, and also nNOS-derived NO. The results provide a new understanding of the importance of TRPA1 in cold exposure and offer impetus for further research into developing therapeutic agents aimed at the local protection of the skin in disease and adverse climates.

### Nonfreezing cold injury and cold intolerance in paddlesport [^113Hezy6]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI) occurs when tissues are subjected to prolonged cooling that causes tissue damage, but not freezing. Long-term effects include cold intolerance, characterized by allodynia, pain, or numbness of the affected limb. Those who participate in outdoor paddlesports are at particular risk.

- **Methods**: This epidemiological study aimed to determine the risk factors for paddlesport athletes developing NFCI and chronic cold intolerance in their hands. Secondary outcomes were to correlate cumulative cold exposure with the development of cold intolerance and to identify risk factors for developing NFCI or cold intolerance. Six hundred nine athletes responded to a survey distributed by their national governing body, obtaining demographic and activity details, symptoms of NFCI, and a cold intolerance severity score (CISS).

- **Results**: Twenty-three percent reported symptoms consistent with acute NFCI. The median CISS was 31 (interquartile range 25–43), and 15% had a pathological CISS defined as > 50. Females and individuals with Raynaud's phenomenon or migraines had a significantly higher CISS (P < 0.05). There was no correlation between cumulative cold exposure and CISS.

- **Conclusions**: A large proportion of paddlesport athletes undertaking activity in cold conditions have a pathological CISS or episodes consistent with NFCI. Cumulative cold exposure was not correlated with CISS.

### Fractures and dislocations of the foot and ankle in people with diabetes: A literature review [^115fvwT7]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Initial evaluation of a foot and ankle fracture in a patient with diabetes mellitus (DM) begins with a comprehensive history, including the mechanism of injury, time elapsed since the injury, and any medical comorbidities. Pertinent medical history includes the presence or absence of nephropathy, neuropathy, history of prior ulceration or amputation, peripheral artery disease (PAD), active tobacco use, obesity, as well as duration of DM and glycemic control. Poorly controlled and longer duration of DM are more likely to be associated with complications such as neuropathy, nephropathy, and PAD. The absence of pain and the ability to ambulate on a fractured foot or ankle indicate peripheral neuropathy, which can lead to a delay in presentation and appropriate treatment.

Due to the lack of protective sensation, patients may continue to walk on the injured limb, causing further trauma. This prolongs the inflammatory response, potentially leading to net bone loss due to upregulation of osteoclastogenesis. Patients often seek medical treatment once they notice a red, warm, and edematous foot that no longer fits into a shoe.

### Immersion in cold-water evaluation (ICE) and self-reported cold intolerance are reliable but unrelated measures [^114cPRQi]. Hand (2008). Low credibility.

Intolerance to the cold is common following peripheral nerve injury and surgery of the upper extremity. Despite its prevalence, the exact pathophysiology and natural history of this condition are not well understood. Subjective, self-report questionnaires have been created and validated as reliable measures of post-traumatic cold intolerance. The difficulty currently lies in assigning an objective measure to this predominantly subjective phenomenon.

The present study evaluated the test-retest reliability of a proposed objective measure of cold intolerance, the Immersion in Cold-water Evaluation (ICE), and its correlation with subjective measures in healthy control subjects. Two age groups were also compared to investigate the effect of age on cold intolerance and temperature recovery. On two separate testing days, subjects completed three health-related questionnaires and submerged their dominant hands in cold water. The temperature of their second and fifth digits was monitored during recovery.

Both the objective cold-provocation testing and the subjective self-report questionnaires were highly reliable, albeit not significantly correlated. No significant temperature recovery trend was noted between the age groups. Post-traumatic cold intolerance is postulated to have both a vascular and neural etiology among other contributing causes. The protocol studied here was centered predominantly on the former etiology, examining peripheral blood flow and associated temperature recovery. This study established ICE as a reliable means to objectively measure cold response.

### Seawater immersion aggravates burn-associated lung injury and inflammatory and oxidative-stress responses [^115Up4MV]. Burns (2017). Low credibility.

With the increasing frequency of marine development activities and local wars at sea, the incidence of scald burns in marine accidents or wars has been increasing yearly. Various studies have indicated that immersion in seawater has a systemic impact on some organs of animals or humans with burns. Therefore, for burn/scald injuries after immersion in seawater, it is desirable to study the effects and mechanisms of action on important organs.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of immersion in seawater on lung injury and inflammatory and oxidative-stress responses in scalded rats. Structural damage to lungs was detected by hematoxylin and eosin staining, revealing that seawater immersion aggravated structural lung injury in scalded rats. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that seawater immersion increased HMGB1 expression in lung tissues of scalded rats. Apoptosis in lung tissues was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transfer-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining, indicating an increased apoptosis rate in lung tissues of scalded rats.

In addition, expression levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, SOD, and MDA in serum were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The results demonstrated that seawater immersion induced secretion of proinflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8), increased MDA protein levels, and suppressed SOD activity in the serum of scalded rats. Furthermore, measurements of plasma volume and pH showed that seawater immersion exacerbates these responses.

### Mechanisms involved in the development and healing of diabetic foot ulceration [^114PNW2p]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are one of the most common and serious complications of diabetes, affecting 15% of all diabetic patients. This condition leads to over 80,000 amputations per year in the U.S. and results in a high financial burden. Neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, and reduced resistance to infection are recognized risk factors leading to the development of DFUs, which have all the characteristics of a chronic wound.

In the study, we have well characterized and prospectively followed up a large number of diabetic patients, the majority of whom were at risk for developing foot ulceration. Our main hypothesis was that changes in peripheral nerve function and the diabetes-associated proinflammatory state are related not only to the development of DFUs but also to wound-healing failure.

### Frostbite of the feet after cryotherapy: A report of two cases [^1156idy6]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Use of cryotherapy for the reduction of postoperative swelling and pain has become commonplace in orthopedic, podiatric, and cosmetic surgery. However, prolonged exposure to extreme cold may induce an injury nearly identical to frostbite. The authors report on two patients who underwent podiatric orthopedic surgery and were exposed to prolonged cold therapy, resulting in limb-threatening problems. Both patients experienced prolonged and essentially uninterrupted application of cryotherapy for four to seven days, leading to rewarming injuries of tissue necrosis. A team of specialists successfully treated the patients using limb salvage therapy. Due to the issues encountered with the cold therapy devices, the authors caution against unmonitored and prolonged cold exposure. Newer devices that prevent cold exposure below 65 degrees F for longer than two hours could be a better option when cryotherapy is used.
