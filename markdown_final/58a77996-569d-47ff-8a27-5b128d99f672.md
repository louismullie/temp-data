## Question

What's the defense between biofeedback and behavioral activation as forms of therapy for treating depression?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the difference between biofeedback and behavioral activation as forms of therapy for treating depression. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and theoretical rationales. Then, I should review mechanisms of action. Next, I will examine comparative efficacy and the certainty of evidence. After that, I need to check delivery requirements and workforce implications. I should then assess cost-effectiveness and scalability. Finally, I will consider guideline positioning and clarify any overlapping or easily confused terms before synthesizing a bottom-line clinical takeaway.

> Wait, let me verify the query wording before proceeding. The prompt says "defense" between biofeedback and behavioral activation; I should confirm that "defense" is a typo for "difference", since the clinical task clearly involves distinguishing interventions rather than defending one over the other. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I will proceed on the assumption that the user wants a comparative, clinically grounded contrast, with attention to mechanisms, evidence, delivery, cost, and guideline relevance, and I will flag if anything contradicts that interpretation as I go.

> Let me first confirm what behavioral activation (BA) is. BA is a brief, structured psychotherapy that aims to alleviate depression by increasing contact with environmental reward, reducing avoidance, and improving problem solving, often delivered as a stand-alone treatment distilled from CBT principles, and it can be taught to junior mental health workers to implement with fidelity to core techniques such as activity monitoring and scheduling, functional analysis of avoidance, and building alternative, goal-directed behaviors [^117VJEqh] [^111iPoXk]. I should also note mechanistic signals; fMRI work suggests BA can reduce excessive prefrontal engagement during cognitive control in affective contexts, consistent with reduced ruminative control demands, although those neural findings need replication in larger samples, so I need to be cautious in over-interpreting that mechanistic claim [^116kggkD].

> Now I will examine biofeedback and neurofeedback. Biofeedback is a mind–body intervention that provides real-time signals linked to physiological processes, enabling patients to learn to self-regulate parameters such as HRV or EEG activity; neurofeedback extends this to cortical or circuit-level signals, including EEG and fMRI-based targets, with the clinical premise that modifying autonomic or neural dynamics can reduce depressive symptoms, although protocols and targets vary across studies [^117YMpU1] [^111JVD8a]. Let me consider the implication for mechanism: where BA changes behavior–environment interactions to increase reward contact, bio/neurofeedback trains top-down control of physiological signals that are typically outside awareness, anchoring change in autonomic balance or task-relevant brain networks rather than in daily activity patterns per se [^117YMpU1] [^111JVD8a].

> Next, I should review BA efficacy and certainty. Hold on, I should verify high-quality data first. The COBRA non-inferiority trial found BA delivered by junior workers was non-inferior to CBT at 12 months on PHQ-9, with virtually identical mean scores and recovery/response rates, and this inference was robust across mITT and per-protocol analyses with careful attention to clustering, supporting BA as a first-line option with outcomes comparable to specialist-delivered CBT [^115ThYbU] [^112hV71c]. I need to double-check broader syntheses; a meta-analysis of behavioral therapies shows superiority to controls and equivalence to CBT, reinforcing that BA-class interventions are effective across trials and not just in a single RCT context [^113uJVWj].

> I will now examine evidence for biofeedback and neurofeedback. A recent meta-analysis reported moderate within-group and between-group effects in MDD and small but significant effects across mixed conditions; however, it emphasized that estimates depend on study design quality and that many included studies were small, heterogeneous, and at high or unclear risk of bias, so the overall effectiveness remains methodologically uncertain and requires larger, rigorously controlled trials before firm conclusions can be drawn [^111JVD8a] [^114YYFSy]. Let me reconsider whether any contradictory synthesis changes this; duplicate analyses echo similar effect sizes while reaffirming risk-of-bias and underpowering concerns, so I should be cautious not to overstate efficacy or generalizability for routine care at this time [^111JVD8a] [^111o6WZe].

> I need to check delivery and workforce requirements. BA was intentionally designed for scalability; in COBRA, junior mental health workers without formal psychotherapy qualifications were trained to deliver BA with outcomes comparable to expert CBT, indicating relatively low training and supervision burdens for large-scale implementation in real-world services, which is clinically important where therapist resources are constrained [^111iPoXk] [^114hQWMs]. By contrast, bio/neurofeedback generally requires dedicated equipment, signal acquisition, calibration, and personnel skilled in psychophysiology or neuroimaging procedures, and the published literature largely reflects lab- or device-dependent settings rather than simplified community delivery, which raises practical barriers to scale without additional infrastructure [^117YMpU1] [^114YYFSy].

> Next, I should review cost-effectiveness. Let me verify the economic data for BA. The COBRA economic evaluation showed BA achieved similar or slightly better QALYs at substantially lower intervention cost than CBT, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio indicating dominance and an approximately 75–80% probability of cost-effectiveness at NICE thresholds, and importantly, the cost advantage persisted across sensitivity analyses, underlining BA's affordability and scalability for systems-level deployment [^117CJJJ4] [^11346oKZ]. For bio/neurofeedback, I should confirm whether comparable economic analyses exist; I find no cost-effectiveness trials in the provided set, and authors highlight the need for larger, device-enabled studies, implying that current implementations may entail higher per-patient costs linked to equipment and technician time, but I must acknowledge this as an evidence gap rather than a quantified economic disadvantage at this stage [^114YYFSy].

> I should confirm guideline positioning and clinical role. The COBRA investigators explicitly argue BA should be considered a front-line treatment given non-inferior outcomes to CBT with lower costs and easier workforce development, which aligns with general guideline flexibility to offer psychotherapy as initial treatment and in maintenance phases for adults with depression, though BA-specific naming varies across documents and local practice patterns [^114hQWMs] [^112i55cn] [^115ij3WN]. But wait, what about biofeedback's place in guidelines; the meta-analytic conclusion is that effectiveness remains controversial pending higher-quality trials, and there is no explicit first-line endorsement here, so its clinical role is best framed as adjunctive or investigational until evidence and implementation pathways are stronger [^111JVD8a].

> Hold on, I should verify potential terminology confusion to avoid misclassification. Activation therapy in inpatients combines BA with cognitive activation and is not the same as standard outpatient BA protocols; its trial signals cognitive and functional benefits without affecting short-term readmission rates, so I should avoid equating AT with BA alone in this context [^117YWBZf]. Likewise, feedback-informed treatment is a therapist quality-assurance system using outcome feedback rather than physiological biofeedback; conflating FIT with biofeedback would be an error, so I need to keep these constructs distinct in interpretation and recommendations [^111fy8rZ].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the synthesis is clinically precise. Behavioral activation is a behaviorally focused psychotherapy that increases environmental reward and reduces avoidance, supported by large RCTs and meta-analyses showing outcomes equivalent to CBT and favorable cost-effectiveness, and it can be delivered effectively by non-specialist staff, making it a pragmatic first-line option in many settings [^113uJVWj] [^115ThYbU] [^117CJJJ4] [^111iPoXk]. Biofeedback and neurofeedback are device-supported self-regulation techniques targeting autonomic and neural signals with promising but methodologically fragile evidence and higher implementation demands, suggesting a current role as adjunctive or experimental rather than routine first-line therapy pending more rigorous, scalable trials and economic evaluations [^111JVD8a] [^114YYFSy] [^117YMpU1].

Biofeedback and behavioral activation (BA) are distinct therapies for depression: biofeedback targets **physiological self-regulation** (e.g. HRV, EEG) to reduce stress and depressive symptoms [^111JVD8a], while BA targets **behavioral engagement** by increasing rewarding activities [^112Xz3VP] and reducing avoidance [^113uJVWj]. BA has **strong evidence** [^112Xz3VP] and is guideline-endorsed as a **first-line**, scalable, and cost-effective treatment [^112TaqDX] [^114hQWMs], whereas biofeedback shows **modest, heterogeneous effects** [^111JVD8a] and is best used as an adjunct or for patients with prominent somatic symptoms or stress-related depression. BA is preferred for broad depressive symptoms and functional impairment [^113uJVWj]; biofeedback is considered when physiological dysregulation is prominent or as an adjunct to other therapies.

---

## Theoretical foundations and mechanisms of action

### Biofeedback

- **Physiological self-regulation**: Biofeedback trains patients to modulate physiological signals (e.g. HRV, EEG) [^111JVD8a] to reduce stress and depressive symptoms.

- **Neurophysiological targets**: HRV biofeedback aims to enhance vagal tone and autonomic balance [^111JVD8a]; neurofeedback targets neural circuits (e.g. prefrontal-limbic) implicated in depression.

- **Stress reduction**: By improving autonomic regulation, biofeedback reduces stress and anxiety, indirectly improving mood [^111JVD8a].

---

### Behavioral activation

BA increases **engagement in rewarding activities** and **reduces avoidance**, directly improving mood and functioning [^113uJVWj] [^112Xz3VP]. It uses **positive reinforcement** to break the cycle of inactivity and anhedonia [^112Xz3VP] [^113uJVWj]. BA also enhances cognitive control and **reduces rumination**, which contributes to symptom improvement [^112Xz3VP] [^116kggkD].

---

## Clinical evidence and effectiveness

### Biofeedback

- **Effectiveness**: Meta-analyses show small-to-moderate effects on depressive symptoms (Hedges' g ≈ 0.3–0.7) [^111JVD8a], with significant heterogeneity and methodological limitations.

- **Adjunctive use**: Biofeedback is often used with other therapies (e.g. CBT, mindfulness) [^111JVD8a] to enhance outcomes.

- **Limitations**: Evidence is limited by small samples, heterogeneity, and lack of long-term follow-up [^111JVD8a].

---

### Behavioral activation

- **Effectiveness**: BA has robust evidence [^112Xz3VP], with large effects versus inactive controls [^113uJVWj] and non-inferiority to CBT [^115ThYbU].

- **Cost-effectiveness**: BA is simpler, scalable, and more cost-effective than CBT [^114hQWMs], suitable for delivery by less specialized providers [^117CJJJ4].

- **Guideline support**: BA is recommended as a first-line treatment for depression.

## Practical considerations and patient suitability

| **Factor** | **Biofeedback** | **Behavioral activation** |
|-|-|-|
| Delivery | Requires specialized equipment and training [^111JVD8a] | Simple, scalable, minimal training [^114hQWMs] |
| Patient suitability | Patients with physiological dysregulation, stress-related depression, or somatic symptoms [^111JVD8a] | Patients with behavioral avoidance, anhedonia, or functional impairment [^113uJVWj] |
| Cost-effectiveness | Moderate; equipment and training required | High; minimal resources needed [^117CJJJ4] |
| Evidence base | Modest, heterogeneous, adjunctive [^111JVD8a] | Robust, first-line, standalone [^113uJVWj] |
| Limitations | Limited access, technical complexity, variable adherence [^111JVD8a] | Requires patient motivation, less effective for severe anhedonia |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines indicate that **Biofeedback** is not a first-line standalone treatment and should be used as **adjunctive therapy**, especially for stress-related or somatic symptom presentations. In contrast, **Behavioral activation** is recommended as a **first-line treatment** for depression, particularly for behavioral avoidance and functional impairment.

---

## Summary of key differences

| **Aspect** | **Biofeedback** | **Behavioral activation** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | Physiological self-regulation | Behavioral engagement |
| Evidence | Modest, heterogeneous | Robust, first-line |
| Delivery | Specialized equipment | Simple, scalable |
| Cost | Moderate | High cost-effectiveness |
| Suitability | Physiological dysregulation | Behavioral avoidance |

---

Biofeedback and BA differ in mechanism, evidence, and delivery: biofeedback targets physiological self-regulation with modest, heterogeneous effects [^111JVD8a], while BA targets behavioral engagement with robust, first-line efficacy [^115ThYbU]. BA is **preferred** for broad depressive symptoms and functional impairment; biofeedback is best as an **adjunct** or when physiological dysregulation is prominent.

### Cost and outcome of behavioural activation versus cognitive behavioural therapy for depression (COBRA): a randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^114hQWMs]. Lancet (2016). High credibility.

Our findings could have substantial implications for the scalability of psychological treatment for depression internationally, given the greater availability and ease with which a BA workforce could be trained compared to a CBT workforce. For many years, CBT has been the foremost psychological therapy recommended by therapists, researchers, and policymakers. Our results challenge this dominance. Although more work needs to be done to find ways to effectively treat the 20–23% of patients whose depression was unchanged by BA or CBT, our findings suggest that BA should be a front-line treatment for depression, with substantial potential to improve access to psychological therapy globally.

Our results in both groups compare favourably with a meta-analysis of the effects of CBT that estimate proportions of patients with remissions of around 50%. Our cost-effectiveness analyses show the high probability that BA is cost-effective and affordable compared with CBT at standard willingness-to-pay thresholds. Our most striking finding is that BA leads to similar clinical outcomes for patients with depression, but at a financial saving to clinical providers of 21% compared with the costs of provision of CBT, with no compensatory use of other health-care services by patients.

Driving these savings is the fact that BA can be delivered by inexperienced MHWs with no professional training in psychological therapies, with no lesser effect than more highly trained and experienced psychological therapists giving patients CBT.

### Behavioural activation for depression: Efficacy, effectiveness and dissemination [^112Xz3VP]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Depression is a prevalent psychobiological disorder across the world, necessitating the identification of effective, evidence-based treatments that are both time and cost-effective to increase treatment accessibility for the population. Low-intensity interventions, such as guided self-help treatments, show promise for the dissemination of these treatments. Behavioural activation, a component of cognitive-behavioural therapy, is garnering attention and empirical support as a stand-alone psychological treatment for depression. This article reviews behavioural activation's theoretical foundations and efficacy to determine its potential as a low-intensity intervention.

- **Method**: A systematic review of articles on low-intensity behavioural activation interventions for depression was conducted using the PsychInfo, Medline, and Embase databases. The potential for dissemination of behavioural activation as a guided self-help treatment is discussed, and future research avenues are emphasized.

- **Limitations**: Studies on the efficacy of behavioural activation as a guided self-help treatment are very limited, and there are significant variations among existing studies.

- **Conclusions**: Based on the research literature, it can be concluded that behavioural activation could be a viable option as a low-intensity guided self-help psychological treatment for mild to moderate depression. Further research is required to better understand the optimal parameters and client-therapist characteristics of this form of low-intensity intervention.

### A meta-analysis of randomized trials of behavioural treatment of depression [^113uJVWj]. Psychological Medicine (2008). High credibility.

Depression is a common, disabling condition for which psychological treatments, particularly cognitive behavioural therapies, are recommended. Recent randomized trials have shown promising results, renewing interest in behavioural therapy. This systematic review sought to identify all randomized trials of behavioural therapy for depression, determine the effect of such interventions, and examine any moderators of such effect.

- **Method**: Randomized trials of behavioural treatments of depression versus controls or other psychotherapies were identified using electronic database searches, previous reviews, and reference lists. Data on symptom level, recovery/dropout rate, and study-level moderators (study quality, number of sessions, severity, and level of training) were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis and meta-regression, respectively.

- **Results**: Seventeen randomized controlled trials, including 1109 subjects, were included in this meta-analysis. A random-effects meta-analysis of symptom-level post-treatment showed that behavioural therapies were superior to controls (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.70, 95% CI -1.00 to -0.39, k = 12, n = 459), brief psychotherapy (SMD -0.56, 95% CI -1.0 to -0.12, k = 3, n = 166), and supportive therapy (SMD -0.75, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.14, k = 2, n = 45). They were equivalent to cognitive behavioural therapy (SMD 0.08, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.30, k = 12, n = 476).

- **Conclusions**: The results of this study indicate that behavioural therapy is an effective treatment for depression with outcomes equal to that of the recommended psychological intervention. Future research needs to continue exploring these findings to reinforce and expand upon the current evidence.

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^112TaqDX]. APA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of major depressive disorder, particularly in relation to initial therapy, the APA 2019 guidelines recommend considering the following options when selecting between treatments:

- **Behavioral therapy**: Rather than antidepressant medication alone.
- **Cognitive therapy plus antidepressant medication**: To improve the likelihood of full recovery when considering combined treatment.

### Efficacy of bio- and neurofeedback for depression: a meta-analysis [^111JVD8a]. Psychological Medicine (2022). High credibility.

For many years, biofeedback and neurofeedback have been implemented in the treatment of depression. However, the effectiveness of these techniques on depressive symptomatology remains controversial. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies extracted from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase.

- **Methods**: Two different strings were considered for each of the two objectives of the study: a first group comprising studies with patients having major depressive disorder (MDD) and a second group including studies targeting depressive symptomatology reduction in other mental or medical conditions.

- **Results**: In the first group of studies, including patients with MDD, the within-group analyses yielded an effect size of Hedges' g = 0.717, while the between-group analysis showed an effect size of Hedges' g = 1.050. Moderator analyses indicate that treatment efficacy is only significant when accounting for experimental design, favoring randomized controlled trials (RCTs) over non-RCTs. The type of neurofeedback, trial design, year of publication, number of sessions, age, sex, and quality of the study did not influence treatment efficacy. In the second group of studies, a small but significant effect between groups was found (Hedges' g = 0.303), favoring bio- and neurofeedback against control groups. Moderator analyses revealed that treatment efficacy was not moderated by any sociodemographic and clinical variables.

- **Conclusions**: Heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback and neurofeedback are associated with a reduction in self-reported depression.

### Neuromodulation strategies for the treatment of depression [^114fou9D]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

For many decades, psychiatric treatment has been primarily guided by two major paradigms of psychopathology: a neurochemical paradigm leading to the development of medications and a psychological paradigm resulting in the development of psychotherapies. A third paradigm, positing that psychiatric dysfunction results from abnormal communication within a network of brain regions that regulate mood, thought, and behavior, has gained increased attention over the past several years and underlies the development of multiple neuromodulation and neurostimulation therapies.

This neural circuit paradigm is not new. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was a common way of understanding psychiatric illness and led to several of our earliest somatic therapies. However, with the rise of effective medications and evidence-based psychotherapies, this paradigm went mostly dormant. Its recent reemergence resulted from a growing recognition that medications and psychotherapy leave many patients inadequately treated, along with technological advances that have revolutionized our ability to understand and modulate the neural circuitry involved in psychiatric disorders.

In this overview, the authors review the history and state of neuromodulation for psychiatric illness and specifically focus on these approaches as a treatment for depression, as this has been the primary indication for these interventions over time.

### The German version of the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS): A psychometric and clinical investigation [^113BoZ8D]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

The Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS) was developed to measure core concepts of behavioral activation for depression. A number of studies, mostly based on analogue samples, have provided initial support for the BADS. In the present study, we examined the psychometric properties of the German version of the scale more broadly, including change sensitivity and clinical treatment data.

A mixed sample of students (N = 312) and depressed outpatients in partial remission undergoing cognitive-behavioral group treatment for depressive rumination (N = 59) was examined. To analyze construct validity, a set of theoretically relevant constructs such as perseverative thinking, distraction, and mindfulness was also assessed. Results indicated good psychometric properties, additional evidence for construct validity of the total scale and subscales, and adequate fit of the data to the original factor structure. Furthermore, the BADS proved to be sensitive to changes in participants undergoing treatment for depression.

- **Key practitioner message**: Behavioral activation (BA) is an effective treatment for patients suffering from unipolar depression. The Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS) can be used to measure core elements of the BA treatment rationale. It is useful to track changes in activation within treatment. The BADS is available in different languages and has shown to possess good psychometric properties.

### Impact of activation therapy for inpatients with major depression: Primary and secondary outcomes from a randomized controlled trial [^113mD6Lm]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). High credibility.

Inpatient depression is associated with high morbidity and risk of suicide, as well as impairment in cognitive function. Cognitive impairment often persists after the resolution of mood symptoms and can cause difficulties after discharge, including in psychosocial and occupational domains. Readmission rates are high for those hospitalized with depression. The inpatient period, thus, provides an opportunity for intensive psychological and pharmacological treatment to address these issues.

Psychomotor slowing is a feature of severe, inpatient depression. Deactivation symptoms in depression — loss of interest, lack of enjoyment, indecisiveness, and reduced activity — are associated with poorer treatment responses to antidepressant medication and are particularly prevalent in inpatient depression.

We therefore developed an intensive, brief 'activation therapy' (AT), combining behavioral activation (BA) and cognitive activation, delivered during the inpatient period to target directly behavioral and cognitive deactivation.

- **Aims**: The primary aim was to investigate the impact of AT versus treatment as usual (TAU) on hospital readmission rates (within 12 weeks of discharge) for inpatients with depression. Secondary aims were to examine the impact of AT on cognition, functioning, and depression symptoms.

### Cost and outcome of behavioural activation versus cognitive behavioural therapy for depression (COBRA): a randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^114mMZmg]. Lancet (2016). Low credibility.

This trial addresses these research recommendations and is, to our knowledge, the only high-quality, fully powered non-inferiority and cost-effectiveness study addressing both the effects and costs of behavioral activation (BA) compared with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression. When we combine the data from our study with data from other international studies in the meta-analysis done by NICE, our data reduce the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around the effect size for depression symptoms immediately after treatment (Hedges' g 0.054 [95% CI −0.214 to 0.107]; p = 0.514) and at follow-up (0.059 [−0.234 to 0.115]; p = 0.503). This study unequivocally shows both non-inferiority of BA compared with CBT and that BA is more cost-effective against commonly applied decision-maker willingness-to-pay thresholds.

- **Implications of all the available evidence**: Junior mental health workers with no professional training in psychological therapies can deliver behavioral activation, a simple psychological treatment, with no lesser effect than CBT and at less cost. Effective psychological therapy for depression can be delivered without the need for costly and highly trained professionals.

Globally, health services require effective, easily implemented, and cost-effective psychological treatments for depression that can be delivered by less-specialist health workers than are needed at present. This approach is crucial to closing a treatment gap that can be as much as 80–90% in some low-income countries. One potential alternative, behavioral activation (BA), is a simple psychological treatment for depression, potentially easy and quick to train junior mental health workers to deliver.

### Impact of activation therapy for inpatients with major depression: Primary and secondary outcomes from a randomised controlled trial [^117YWBZf]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). High credibility.

Inpatient depression is associated with high morbidity and significant cognitive impairment. Inpatient treatment often focuses on short-term stabilization with medication, and readmission rates are high. We examined the impact of a novel psychological intervention, activation therapy (AT, behavioural activation combined with cognitive activation), versus treatment as usual (TAU) on readmission rates, and cognitive, functional, and depression outcomes in inpatient depression.

- **Method**: A randomised controlled trial in adults hospitalised with a major depressive episode. Inpatients were randomised to AT (8 individual sessions over 2 weeks) or not (TAU). Key time points were baseline (on admission) and 14 weeks after baseline. The primary outcome was psychiatric hospital readmission rates within 12 weeks of discharge. Secondary outcomes were cognition, general functioning, depression, and 'deactivation' symptoms (change from baseline to 14 weeks).

- **Results**: Ninety-seven individuals were randomised to AT (n = 47) or TAU (n = 50). Readmission rates did not differ between treatment arms (34% vs. 40%; OR = 0.76, CI = 0.30–1.90). Significant improvements for verbal learning and memory (d = 0.42) and general functioning (d = 0.58) were in favour of the AT versus TAU arms. Per protocol analysis showed additional significant effects of AT on psychomotor speed (d = 0.64) and clinician-rated depression symptoms (d = 0.56). No significant effects were observed for other secondary outcomes (subjective cognition, self-reported depression symptoms, and deactivation symptoms).

- **Conclusions**: The AT intervention resulted in specific cognitive and functional benefits compared to TAU, despite the lack of difference in readmission rates.

### A cognitive neural circuit biotype of depression showing functional and behavioral improvement after transcranial magnetic stimulation in the B-SMART-fMRI trial [^11512tn7]. Nature. Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

The focus of the present study was the quantification of cognitive control circuit connectivity engaged by cognitive task demands. Specifically, we concentrated on connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dLPFC) and dorsolateral anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), another core region of the cognitive control circuit, which is also impaired in the cognitive control biotype. Previous neuroimaging studies investigating how connectivity between the dLPFC and dACC relates to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) treatment response have largely utilized resting-state fMRI. These studies suggest that TMS of the dLPFC might improve symptoms of depression by affecting the functional coupling between the dLPFC and regions of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), although the putative therapeutic mechanism of TMS remains under study.

Consistent with the pre-registered aims of the present TMS study, we first tested the primary hypothesis that task-related dLPFC–dACC connectivity within the cognitive control circuit would change in a session-dependent manner — from the pre-TMS baseline to post-early TMS treatment through to the end of treatment (primary outcome) — and that the extent of this change would be related to baseline stratification by connectivity. We then tested the hypothesis that the magnitude of change in cognitive control connectivity would be associated with a corresponding change in cognitive performance as well as in overall symptom severity (secondary outcomes).

Our findings demonstrate that before commencing TMS, we can stratify individuals into those who have poor dLPFC–dACC connectivity (cognitive biotype +) and those with relatively intact connectivity (cognitive biotype).

### Efficacy of bio- and neurofeedback for depression: a meta-analysis [^1127T1tV]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

As illustrated in the PRISMA flow chart (Fig. 1), a total of 11,786 records were retrieved from the initial database searches. After removing all duplicated articles, the first screening step, which included examining titles and abstracts, identified 7,235 references of potential interest for our meta-analysis. This process was conducted by two reviewers and yielded 18 and 24 references for each respective step of our study. Ultimately, 22 papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Conversely, 24 papers were excluded because they did not satisfy the inclusion criteria, as described in Fig. 1. The entire procedure was independently carried out by two reviewers.

- **Flowchart of included studies**: A flowchart of the general inclusion procedure is reported in Fig. 1. We received no reply from any authors contacted to obtain missing data. Descriptions of all the included studies, along with relevant variables and study-level characteristics coded for each study, are reported in Tables 1–3 for each study step.

- **Table summaries**:
	- **Table 1**: Between-effect sizes of neuro- and biofeedback for depressive symptomatology in all conditions.
	- **Table 2**: Within-effect sizes of neuro- and biofeedback for depressive symptomatology in all conditions.
	- **Table 3**: Between-effect sizes of neuro- and biofeedback for depressive symptomatology in all conditions.

The efficacy of bio- and neurofeedback for major depressive disorder (MDD) was analyzed through pre-post between-group effect sizes. However, the description for the pre-post analysis portion is incomplete.

### The link between improvement in sleep and depressed mood: Exploring the role of repetitive negative thinking and behavioural activation [^111JJwmb]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

There is extensive evidence supporting a link between poor sleep and worse depression outcomes. Moreover, improvement in sleep contributes to enhanced depression outcomes. However, processes underlying this sleep-depression link are unclear. The study examined whether changes in potential underlying processes, namely repetitive negative thinking (RNT) and behavioural activation (BA), can explain the relationship between improvement in reported sleep disturbance (reduction in the number of days participants experience sleep difficulties) and depressed mood. Data were analyzed from 127 participants (mean [SD] age 39.16 [14.81], 60.6% women) who attended a group CBT mood management program at a government mental health service.

Our study found a significant association between improvement in sleep difficulties and improvement in depressed mood. However, this relationship was no longer significant (no direct association) when controlling for improvements in RNT, ab = 0.56, CI [0.21, 1.01], and BA, ab = 1.08, CI [0.41, 1.84]. The preliminary findings suggest that reduced RNT and enhanced BA may play an important role in explaining how improvement in sleep is related to improvement in depressed mood. Future research should investigate whether early improvements in sleep contribute to subsequent improvements in depressed mood via improvements in RNT and BA. To establish temporal ordering and assess causality, future studies should collect data across multiple time points and incorporate a more comprehensive measure of sleep.

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^114Hm3TR]. APA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for major depressive disorder, particularly in cases of inadequate response, the APA 2019 guidelines recommend considering the following psychotherapies or interventions for adult patients whose depression does not respond or only partially responds to initial antidepressant therapy:

- **Adding psychotherapy**: Incorporate interpersonal psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), or psychodynamic psychotherapy alongside antidepressant therapy.

- **Augmenting with another antidepressant medication**: Consider increasing the efficacy of treatment by adding another antidepressant.

### Cost and outcome of behavioural activation versus cognitive behavioural therapy for depression (COBRA): A randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^117A7nef]. Lancet (2016). Low credibility.

We found that BA was not different from CBT in anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7), depression status, and depression-free days, as well as anxiety diagnoses (SCID) for either the mITT or PP populations using observed or imputed data at 12 months. Because of substantial missing 36-Item Short Form Survey data at baseline, these data were analyzed adjusted for stratification variables only. There was no difference in the numbers of participants with at least one anxiety diagnosis: BA 43 (28%) of 153; CBT 43 (27%) of 161 (mITT population; χ² 0.08; p = 0.78).

Between 61% and 70% of mITT and PP participants in both groups met criteria for recovery from depression or response to treatment at 12 months, with no differences in the proportions of patients in each group who recovered or responded. Using observed data for all outcomes, no evidence of a difference was found between the CBT and BA groups over the period of the trial, as indicated by a non-significant time-by-treatment effect interaction, for both the mITT and PP populations. There was a small, negligible clustering of primary and secondary outcome scores at follow-up across therapists overall and within BA and CBT groups (intracluster correlation coefficient ≤ 0.04).

### Newer variations of cognitive-behavioral therapy: Behavioral activation and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy [^117VJEqh]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2009). High credibility.

Recent innovations in the treatment and prevention of depression that build on the foundation of cognitive-behavioral therapy represent promising directions for clinical practice and research. Specifically, behavioral activation and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy have been a recent focus of attention. Behavioral activation is a brief, structured approach to treating acute depression that seeks to alleviate depression by promoting an individual's contact with sources of reward through increasing activation, improving problem solving, and decreasing avoidance and other barriers to activation. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy is a brief group intervention that seeks to prevent depressive relapse by promoting mindful attention, acceptance, and skillful action to help individuals interrupt habitual cognitive and affective patterns associated with risk of relapse. Each approach is supported by at least two large-scale, randomized clinical trials; however, many important questions remain. We examine research on both approaches by addressing the robustness of findings, the extension to novel populations, and the processes by which clinical benefit is achieved.

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^112i55cn]. APA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for major depressive disorder, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, the 2019 APA guidelines recommend offering either monotherapy (psychotherapy or antidepressant therapy) or combined therapy as initial treatment. This should be done in the context of shared decision-making with the patient when considering options.

### Behavioural activation therapy for depression in adults with non-communicable diseases [^113nSquy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Depression is common in people with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and chronic respiratory conditions. The co-existence of depression and NCDs may affect health behaviours, compliance with treatment, physiological factors, and quality of life. This, in turn, is associated with worse outcomes for both conditions. Behavioural activation is not currently indicated for the treatment of depression in this population in the UK, but it is increasingly being used to treat depression in adults.

- **Objectives**: To examine the effects of behavioural activation compared with any control group for the treatment of depression in adults with NCDs. To examine the effects of behavioural activation compared with each control group separately (no treatment, waiting list, other psychological therapy, pharmacological treatment, or any other type of treatment as usual) for the treatment of depression in adults with NCDs.

- **Search methods**: We searched CCMD-CTR, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, and two trial registers on 4 October 2019 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of behavioural activation for depression in participants with NCDs, together with grey literature and reference checking. We applied no restrictions on date, language, or publication status to the searches.

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs of behavioural activation for the treatment of depression in adults with one of four NCDs: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and chronic respiratory conditions.

### Cost and outcome of behavioural activation versus cognitive behavioural therapy for depression (COBRA): a randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^11346oKZ]. Lancet (2016). High credibility.

Clinical depression is a common and debilitating mental health disorder, ranking as the second largest cause of global disability. Globally, the effect of depression on aggregate economic output is predicted to be US$5.36 trillion between 2011 and 2030. Reducing these substantial costs is a key objective for low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries alike. Antidepressant medication and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) have the most clinical evidence. However, although antidepressant medications are inexpensive, their use is limited by side effects, poor patient adherence, and discontinuation relapse risk. CBT is as effective as antidepressants and provides long-term protection against relapse, but it is complex and its effectiveness depends on the skills of psychological therapists, who are expensive to train and employ. For low-income and middle-income countries in particular, the need for an extensive professional infrastructure of such therapists limits access to CBT.

- **Research in context**:

	- **Evidence before this study**: Authors of published systematic reviews, including a Cochrane review, have commented on the limitations of existing evidence for the effectiveness of behavioural activation (BA) for depression compared with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and the scarcity of cost-effectiveness data, with existing evidence insufficiently robust to establish comparability. The authors of the Cochrane review called for studies that improve the quality of evidence. Our pretrial evidence incorporated findings from published reviews by the UK National Institute.

### Feedback-informed treatment versus usual psychological treatment for depression and anxiety: a multisite, open-label, cluster randomised controlled trial [^111fy8rZ]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2018). High credibility.

Previous research suggests that the use of outcome feedback technology can enable psychological therapists to identify and resolve obstacles to clinical improvement. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of an outcome feedback quality assurance system applied in stepped care psychological services.

- **Methods**: This multisite, open-label, cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted across eight National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England. It involved therapists qualified to deliver evidence-based low-intensity or high-intensity psychological interventions. Adult patients (18 years or older) who accessed individual therapy with participating therapists were eligible for inclusion, excluding patients who accessed group therapies and those attending less than two individual therapy sessions. Therapists were randomly assigned (1:1) to either an outcome feedback intervention group or a treatment-as-usual control group using a computer-generated randomisation algorithm. The allocation of patients to therapists was quasi-random, with patients on waiting lists allocated sequentially based on therapist availability. All patients received either low-intensity (less than eight sessions) or high-intensity (up to 20 sessions) psychological therapies during the 1-year study period. An automated computer algorithm alerted therapists in the outcome feedback group to patients who were not on track and prompted them to review these patients in clinical supervision. The primary outcome was symptom severity as measured by validated depression tools (Patient Health Questionnaire-…).

### Baseline depression severity as moderator of depression outcomes between cognitive behavioral therapy vs pharmacotherapy: An individual patient data meta-analysis [^1179x3xM]. JAMA Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

- **Importance**: Guidelines recommend treating severe depression with pharmacotherapy. Randomized clinical trials, as well as traditional meta-analyses, have considerable limitations in testing for moderators of treatment outcomes.

- **Objectives**: To conduct a systematic literature search, collect primary data from trials, and analyze baseline depression severity as a moderator of treatment outcomes between cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and antidepressant medication (ADM).

- **Data sources**: A total of 14,902 abstracts were examined from a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and Cochrane Registry of Controlled Trials from 1966 to January 1, 2014.

- **Study selection**: Randomized clinical trials in which CBT and ADM were compared in patients with a DSM-defined depressive disorder were included.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Study authors were asked to provide primary data from their trial. Primary data from 16 of 24 identified trials (67%), with 1700 outpatients (794 from the CBT condition and 906 from the ADM condition), were included. Missing data were imputed with multiple imputation methods. Mixed-effects models adjusting for study-level differences were used to examine baseline depression severity as a moderator of treatment outcomes.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Seventeen-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).

- **Results**: There was a main effect of ADM over CBT on the HAM-D (β = -0.88; p = 0.03) and a nonsignificant trend on the BDI (β = -1.14; p = 0.08, statistical test for trend), but no significant difference.

### Cost and outcome of behavioural activation versus cognitive behavioural therapy for depression (COBRA): a randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^115ThYbU]. Lancet (2016). High credibility.

We found no evidence of inferiority of PHQ-9 score at 12 months in either the mITT (CBT 8.4 PHQ-9 points [SD 7.5]; BA 8.4 PHQ-9 points [7.0]; mean difference 0.1 PHQ-9 points [95% CI −1.3 to 1.5]; p = 0.89) or PP (CBT 7.9 PHQ-9 points [7.3]; BA 7.8 [6.5]; mean difference 0.0 [−1.5 to 1.6]; p = 0.99) populations. The non-inferiority of BA to CBT was accepted for both the mITT and PP populations, as the lower bound of the 95% CI (one-sided 97.5% CI) of the between-group mean difference lies within the non-inferiority margin of −1.9 PHQ-9 points. Although we initially planned to include therapist as a random-effects variable, given the low levels of observed clustering, we parsimoniously fitted our models without therapist as a variable. We checked for no inference difference with and without inclusion of a random-effects therapist term. We ruled out superiority of CBT to BA as the lower bound of the 95% CI included zero for the mITT and PP populations. The inference of non-inferiority was robust to sensitivity analysis across different PP definitions. We found no evidence of a significant between-group treatment interaction across the mITT or PP populations with the primary outcome at 12 months as stratified by depression severity, antidepressant use, and recruitment site.

### The effects of brief behavioral activation therapy for depression on cognitive control in affective contexts: An fMRI investigation [^116kggkD]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by impaired cognitive control in affective contexts, but the potential for psychotherapy to affect the neural correlates of these functions has not been evaluated.

- **Method**: Twelve adults with and 15 adults without MDD participated in two identical functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans that utilized a task requiring cognitive control in both sad and neutral contexts. Between scans, MDD outpatients received Behavioral Activation Therapy for Depression, a psychotherapy modality designed to increase engagement with positive stimuli and reduce avoidance behaviors.

- **Results**: Seventy-five percent of adults with MDD were treatment responders, achieving post-treatment Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score of six or below. Consistent with predictions, psychotherapy resulted in decreased activation in response to cognitive control stimuli presented within a sad context in prefrontal structures, including the paracingulate gyrus, the right orbital frontal cortex, and the right frontal pole. Furthermore, the magnitude of pretreatment activation in the paracingulate gyrus cluster responsive to psychotherapy predicted the magnitude of depressive symptom change after psychotherapy.

- **Limitations**: Replication with larger samples is needed, as are follow-up studies that involve placebo control groups, wait-list control groups, and alternative forms of antidepressant intervention.

- **Conclusions**: Behavioral Activation Therapy for Depression improves depressive symptoms and concomitantly influences brain systems.

### Neuromodulation for major depressive disorder: Innovative measures to capture efficacy and outcomes [^117Hf4rV]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder is a common and debilitating condition. Although most patients benefit from established treatments, a subset of patients have symptoms that remain treatment resistant. Novel treatment approaches, such as deep brain stimulation, are urgently needed for patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. These novel treatments are currently being tested in clinical trials in which success hinges on how accurately and comprehensively the primary outcome measure captures the treatment effect.

In this personal view, we argue that measures used to assess outcomes in neurosurgical trials of major depressive disorder might be missing clinically important treatment effects. A crucial problem of continuing to use suboptimal outcome measures is that true signals of efficacy might be missed, thereby disqualifying potentially effective treatments. We argue that a re-evaluation of how outcomes are measured in these trials is much overdue and describe several novel approaches that attempt to better capture meaningful change.

### Psychotherapy or medication for depression? Using individual symptom meta-analyses to derive a symptom-oriented therapy (SORT) metric for a personalised psychiatry [^116JT1od]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

In the investigation, we aimed to develop and test what we term a Symptom-Oriented Therapy (SOrT) metric that aspires to quantify potential preference for (or against) antidepressant medication (ADM) or psychotherapy, akin to the PAI. Unlike the PAI, the SOrT metric is not based on pre-treatment (moderating) variables but instead utilizes patients' heterogeneity in symptom expression. Additionally, the SOrT metric is not based on re-analyses of individual RCT data; rather, it relies on effect size estimates obtained from meta-analyses of multiple RCTs to mitigate dependency on individual study samples. Specifically, we wanted to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize existing evidence from RCTs comparing ADM and psychotherapy in treating depression. Although we also aimed to update existing meta-analytic evidence of these treatments on depression sum-scores — a previously used strategy — our primary objective was to analyze treatment efficacy on individual depressive symptoms. As prior RCTs have predominantly measured depressive symptoms using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D, also commonly abbreviated as HRSD or HDRS) and/or Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI), we focused our investigation on these two scales.

Following this overview of symptom-based treatment differences and similarities, we then aimed to compute the meta-analysis-based SOrT metric to indicate preference (or not) for a specific treatment type (i.e. ADM or psychotherapy) at the individual-patient level. This was evaluated using both data from an existing depression database.

### Activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy on brain activation in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders [^113sroRN]. Depression and Anxiety (2025). Low credibility.

The findings of this study reveal that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) exerts different effects on the activation patterns of specific brain regions in patients with depressive and anxiety disorders in the task state. For patients with anxiety disorders, we observed increased activation in key regions, such as the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), pregenual cingulate cortex (PG), and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and decreased activation in the lateral nucleus (LN), caudate, and dorsal entorhinal cortex. However, for patients with depressive disorders, due to the limited number of included studies and the fact that the included studies utilized different task paradigms, we did not observe any changes in brain region activation.

Our findings indicate a significant modulation of activity in the LN following CBT treatment. The LN is implicated in a range of functions, including emotion regulation, cognitive control, and stress response. Existing literature posits that the LN is functionally compromised in individuals with anxiety disorders, marked by a reduced neuronal density. Further, a meta-analytic review has shown that activity in the LN is elevated in states of anxiety. The diminished activation of the LN observed in our study could suggest that CBT effectively mitigates its hyperactivity, thereby potentially ameliorating symptoms of anxiety and depression in patients. This modulation of LN activity may serve as a pivotal neurobiological mechanism through which CBT exerts its therapeutic effects on anxiety disorders.

### Cognitive behavioural therapies versus other psychological therapies for depression [^111fUac3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

This is the protocol for a review, and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:

- **To examine the effectiveness and acceptability**: Of all CBT approaches compared with all other psychological therapy approaches for acute depression.
- **To examine the effectiveness and acceptability of different CBT approaches**: Cognitive therapy, rational emotive behaviour therapy, problem-solving therapy, self-control therapy, and Coping with Depression course compared with all other psychological therapy approaches for acute depression.
- **To examine the effectiveness and acceptability of all CBT approaches**: Compared with different psychological therapy approaches, including psychodynamic, behavioural, humanistic, integrative, and third wave CBT, for acute depression.

Regarding the medical management of major depressive disorder, particularly in relation to initial therapy, the APA 2019 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against the following treatments for adult patients with depression:

- **Cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy**: This approach lacks sufficient evidence of efficacy for initial management.
- **Brief problem-solving therapy (≤ 10 sessions) versus usual treatment**: There is a lack of conclusive data supporting the efficacy of brief problem-solving therapy over standard care.

### Efficacy of bio- and neurofeedback for depression: a meta-analysis [^117YMpU1]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Biofeedback is considered one of the existing mind-body interventions that may foster the bridging of physiological and psychological interventions. Biofeedback techniques entail a signal, such as a video, audio display, or tactile connection, linked to a physiological process that enables an individual to be aware of normally unconscious physiological activity. In this sense, individuals are provided with explicit information about a certain psychophysiological process to foster its regulation.

Biofeedback has primarily been used in the medical realm, although there is also a long-standing tradition of research on biofeedback techniques for mental disorders. Notably, post-traumatic stress disorder and substance use disorder are among the most researched conditions. Different physiological processes have been implemented for biofeedback procedures, involving both the central and autonomic nervous systems. Electromyography biofeedback (EMGB), skin conductance biofeedback, and heart rate variability biofeedback (HRVB) are some of the most commonly used peripheral responses. Meanwhile, electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (fMRI-NF) are two of the most common techniques employing neural activity.

Ample evidence demonstrates that different psychophysiological processes are impaired in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Regarding neurocircuitry, functional impairments have been identified in the prefrontal, limbic, striatal, thalamic, and basal forebrain structures.

### Online behavioural activation during the COVID-19 pandemic decreases depression and negative affective bias [^115SG9fG]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Several cross-sectional studies have investigated what factors might play a role within this context. One UK study found that high levels of mental wellbeing were associated with higher levels of physical activity, while a Spanish survey reported that lifestyle factors, such as following a routine, pursuing hobbies, and spending time outdoors, were associated with lower levels of depression. Time spent focusing on the pandemic has also been identified as a risk factor. However, due to a lack of randomized controlled studies, it is not possible to infer the direction of causality or investigate whether other variables might better explain these effects.

It is crucial to experimentally examine what interventions may be most appropriate during societal crisis periods. It has been argued that the provision of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) should be increased; however, this intervention is costly and not easily accessible around the world. It has been found that behavioral activation (BA) can be as effective for depression as CBT but more cost-effective because it can be delivered by junior mental health workers with shorter training. BA helps patients examine their daily behavior and assists them in finding the right balance of routine, pleasurable, and necessary activities, which may be particularly helpful at a time of significant lifestyle disruption.

However, it is unclear whether BA can still be effective when options for activities are

### Activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy on brain activation in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders [^115JA5q4]. Depression and Anxiety (2025). Low credibility.

So far, there has been no standard checklist for assessing the quality of individual functional neuroimaging studies. A checklist, which included assessment of participants, image acquisition and analysis methods, and results and conclusions, with 10 subcategories from a previous meta-analysis, was utilized. The total score ranged from 0 to 10. The risk of bias was classified as high (1–3), medium (4–7), and low (8–10). The quality assessment was conducted based on standardized items (Table S2). If there was disagreement between two primary reviewers regarding the study's quality, a supervisor independently assessed the article.

### Symptom-specific effects of counselling for depression compared to cognitive-behavioural therapy [^114mi1qc]. BMJ Mental Health (2023). High credibility.

It is important to understand how interventions work so that more effective and efficient treatments can be developed, and interventions can be more acceptable to patients. This study suggests that cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) was uniquely associated with changes in symptoms associated with anxiety. Therefore, it may be better suited to those with anxiety symptoms comorbid to their depression.

The study also highlights methodological considerations. When assessing change, the baseline should be the first therapy session (or second session), not the pretreatment assessment. This approach will address potential sources of bias, such as regression to the mean. Additionally, when calculating change, residual change scores should be preferred over difference score methods.

### Efficacy of bio- and neurofeedback for depression: A meta-analysis [^114YYFSy]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Bio- and neurofeedback techniques have shown to be efficacious in reducing depressive symptomatology, with a small but significant effect size, though smaller than the pre-post between-groups effect size found for major depressive disorder (MDD). Despite the varied conditions, different baseline levels of depressive symptoms, and types of biofeedback used in the included studies, no significant heterogeneity was detected among the effect sizes. This indicates a stable efficacy of bio- and neurofeedback on depressive symptoms irrespective of the condition.

However, there are notable gaps and challenges in the literature on bio- and neurofeedback for depression. Many studies lacked rigorous methodology and had high or unclear risk of bias, emphasizing the need to improve research quality in this field. Additionally, several studies were underpowered. With the increasing availability of low-cost yet reliable psychophysiological devices, it should be possible to recruit larger samples in future research. This would be crucial in determining the extent of efficacy more accurately.

### Activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy on brain activation in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders [^112GHtE2]. Depression and Anxiety (2025). Low credibility.

Anxiety and depressive disorders are two pervasive mental health conditions with distinct but often overlapping symptoms. According to the American Psychological Association, anxiety manifests as emotional discomfort and physical tension, typically involving activation of the autonomic nervous system. Numerous studies have shown that anxiety disorders are associated with the onset and progression of cardiac disease and, in many cases, with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including mortality. Depression, another prevalent condition, is characterized by enduring feelings of sadness, anhedonia, and diminished motivation.

A comprehensive review by Santomauro et al. assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rates of depression and anxiety disorders across 204 countries and territories from January 2020 to January 2021. Excluding the influence of the pandemic, the global prevalence rates of depression and anxiety in 2020 would have been approximately 2470.5 and 3824.9 per 100,000 individuals, respectively. According to an assessment by the World Health Organization, approximately 280 million people in the world suffer from depression, while 301 million people globally suffer from anxiety disorders. In addition, depression is associated with an elevated risk of suicide, with more than 700,000 deaths by suicide each year, making it a mental health issue of high clinical concern. Identifying effective treatments for mental health conditions like anxiety and depression is of paramount importance. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) serves as a frontline in treatments for these conditions.

### Cost and outcome of behavioural activation versus cognitive behavioural therapy for depression (COBRA): A randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^117CJJJ4]. Lancet (2016). High credibility.

For economic analyses at 18 months, full service use data was available for 159 (90%) of 176 participants in the behavioural activation (BA) group and 168 (93%) of 180 participants in the cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) group. We found a significant difference in mean intervention costs between the two groups, but no differences in other categories of cost or in total cost. Mean health state utility scores according to EuroQoL-5D-3L were slightly higher in the BA group than in the CBT group across the entire follow-up period, with resultant quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) also higher for BA. However, the QALY difference was not significant. Costs were lower and QALY outcomes better in the BA group than in the CBT group, generating an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of –£6865.

The scatterplot of bootstrapped cost and effectiveness pairs for BA versus CBT illustrates dominance of BA over CBT, with the point estimate and two-thirds of scatter points falling in the southeast quadrant of the cost-effectiveness plane, where BA replications are cheaper and more effective than CBT ones. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve shows the probability of BA being cost-effective compared with CBT does not fall below 75% and is closer to 80% at NICE-preferred willingness to pay £20,000–30,000 per QALY.

In all sensitivity analyses, including complementary therapies and productivity losses, as well as analyses taking narrow intervention and mental health service perspectives, BA was significantly less costly than CBT. Therefore, BA continues to have a higher probability of being cost-effective than CBT at the NICE threshold.

### Psychological interventions to prevent the onset of major depression in adults: A systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis [^112E61t3]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2024). Low credibility.

Psychological interventions are increasingly discussed as a method to prevent major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults who already experience subthreshold depressive symptoms. In this individual participant data meta-analysis, we quantify the effect of preventive interventions against control on MDD onset in this population and explore effect modifiers.

- **Methods**: In this systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis, we screened full texts of eligible studies within the Metapsy research domain for articles on psychological interventions for depression, from database inception to May 1, 2023, published in English, German, Spanish, and Dutch. We included individual participant data of randomized trials comparing psychological interventions with a control group regarding their effects on MDD onset in adults with subthreshold depressive symptoms but no MDD at baseline, confirmed by standardized diagnostic interviews. Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB 2 tool. Effect on the onset of MDD (the primary outcome) and moderators were analyzed using one-stage individual participant data meta-analysis. Survival analyses were conducted to examine effects on time to MDD onset within 12 months. We involved people with related lived experience in the study design and implementation.

- **Findings**: Thirty of forty-two eligible randomized controlled trials with 7,201 participants (2,227 [30.9%] male, 4,957 [68.9%] female, and 17 [0.2%] preferred not to report their sex) were included in our analysis.

### Efficacy of bio- and neurofeedback for depression: A meta-analysis [^116yfmHF]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The systematic review was developed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (see Supplementary 1) [Moher et al.].

- **Search strategy**: Articles were identified through comprehensive searches of databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase, with the last update in December 2018. Reference lists of review articles were also considered for potential undetected studies, and gray literature was examined (for the search string, refer to Appendix 2).

- **Eligibility criteria**: This study follows a two-step level structure with two different eligibility criteria.
	- To address the first aim, original articles in English reporting the efficacy of bio- and neurofeedback in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) were considered. The term "clinical depression" as utilized in the DSM-5, which comprises MDD and dysthymic disorder, was taken into account. Studies were included if they established a diagnosis of depression using a standardized diagnostic interview (such as the SCID, CIDI, or SCAN) or included participants with elevated symptoms of depression based on self-report measures.
	- Studies including subjects taking psychopharmacology or receiving other active treatments such as hormone therapy or psychotherapy were excluded.
	- To address the second aim, studies that measured depressive symptomatology through a psychometrically validated instrument and that presented a condition of bio- or neurofeedback were considered.

### Comparison of behavioral activation-enhanced cognitive processing therapy and cognitive processing therapy among U.S. service members: A randomized clinical trial [^113UU3yS]. Psychiatry Research (2023). High credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) frequently co-occur and can cause significant impairment. Data are lacking as to whether interventions targeting both PTSD and MDD may improve treatment outcomes among individuals with this comorbidity compared with existing evidence-based PTSD treatments alone. This randomized trial compared the effectiveness of cognitive processing therapy (CPT) enhanced with behavioral activation (BA+CPT) versus CPT among 94 service members (52 women and 42 men; age M = 28.5 years) with comorbid PTSD and MDD.

The primary outcome was clinician-administered depression symptom severity on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) from pretreatment through 3-month follow-up. Intent-to-treat analyses using multilevel models showed statistically and clinically significant decreases in MADRS scores for both conditions over time, with no significant differences between BA+CPT and CPT. Secondary depression and PTSD symptom outcomes followed a similar pattern of results. For diagnostic MDD and PTSD outcomes using available data, no statistically significant differences between treatments emerged at posttreatment or 3-month follow-up.

Sessions attended, dropout rate, and treatment satisfaction did not significantly differ between treatments. Outcomes were comparable for both treatments, suggesting that BA+CPT and CPT were similarly effective psychotherapy options for comorbid PTSD and MDD.

### The effectiveness of group-based behavioral activation in the treatment of depression: An updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial [^112fFRUZ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Depression is a common mental health problem associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Among various psychological treatments for depression, individual behavioral activation (BA) has been shown to be effective and relatively simple in its delivery by health care providers. However, its effectiveness as a group-based intervention requires further evidence. The objective of this study is to evaluate and update the effectiveness of group-based BA in relieving symptoms of depression.

- **Methods**: A meta-analysis was performed, and prospective randomized trials were systematically searched from the OVID databases. The trials comparing group-based BA interventions versus usual care or waitlist controls were included. Depressive symptoms measured by various validated scales were the primary outcome. As the interventions can be heterogeneous across the included studies, all analyses were performed using a random-effects model.

- **Results**: Seven randomized control trials were identified from the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, and Iran, from 2003 to 2013. A total of 240 subjects were randomly assigned to group-based BA, and all participants included met the criteria for moderate to severe depression at baseline, with the majority of participants being females. Participants who joined the group-based BA showed lower depressive symptoms (MD of BDI-II: -6.06 [95% CI: -8.28 to -3.85] and MD of HRSD: -2.82 [95% CI: -4.62 to -1.02]) than participants randomized to the control group with usual treatment. The group-based BA also showed a significant reduction in anxiety levels.

### Effects of behavioral activation on default mode network connectivity in subthreshold depression: A preliminary resting-state fMRI study [^113qd8pZ]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Subthreshold depression is a risk factor for major depressive disorder and is known to negatively impact quality of life (QOL). Although behavioral activation, a type of cognitive behavioral therapy, is an effective psychological intervention for subthreshold depression, the neural mechanisms underlying this activation are unclear. Enhanced functional connectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and other brain regions has been observed in participants with subthreshold depression. This study aimed to examine the effects of behavioral activation on DMN abnormalities using resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI).

- **Methods**: Participants with subthreshold depression (N = 40) were randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a non-intervention group. They were scanned using rs-fMRI before and after the intervention. Independent component analysis indicated three subnetworks of the DMN.

- **Results**: Analyzing intervention effects on functional connectivity of each subnetwork showed that the connectivity of the anterior DMN subnetwork with the dorsal anterior cingulate was reduced after the intervention. Moreover, this reduction was correlated with an increase in health-related QOL.

- **Limitations**: We did not compare the findings with healthy participants. Further research should include healthy controls to verify the results of this study.

- **Conclusions**: Mechanisms of behavioral activation might be related to an enhanced ability to independently use the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the DMN, which increases attention control.

### Reinforcement learning disruptions in individuals with depression and sensitivity to symptom change following cognitive behavioral therapy [^111enxYR]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

- **Question**: Are depression symptoms associated with features of reinforcement learning, and if so, is treatment-related symptom change associated with learning changes?

- **Findings**: In this mixed cross-sectional–cohort study including 101 participants, participants with and without depression completed a probabilistic learning task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants with depression were reassessed after cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Computational model–based analyses of behavioral choices and neural data identified associations of learning with symptoms during reward learning and loss learning, respectively. Symptom improvement following CBT was associated with normalization of learning parameters.

- **Meaning**: Mapping reinforcement learning processes to symptoms of depression reveals mechanistic features of these symptoms and points to possible learning-based therapeutic processes and targets.

### Efficacy of bio- and neurofeedback for depression: A meta-analysis [^111o6WZe]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

For many years, biofeedback and neurofeedback have been implemented in the treatment of depression. However, the effectiveness of these techniques on depressive symptomatology is still controversial. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies extracted from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase.

- **Methods**: Two different strings were considered for each of the two objectives of the study: A first group comprising studies of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and a second group including studies targeting depressive symptomatology reduction in other mental or medical conditions.

- **Results**: In the first group of studies including patients with MDD, the within-group analyses yielded an effect size of Hedges' g = 0.717, while the between-group analysis showed an effect size of Hedges' g = 1.050. Moderator analyses indicate that treatment efficacy is only significant when accounting for experimental design, favoring randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in comparison to non-RCTs. The type of neurofeedback, trial design, year of publication, number of sessions, age, sex, and quality of study did not influence treatment efficacy. In the second group of studies, a small but significant effect between groups was found (Hedges' g = 0.303) in favor of bio- and neurofeedback against control groups. Moderator analyses revealed that treatment efficacy was not moderated by any of the sociodemographic and clinical variables.

- **Conclusions**: Heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback and neurofeedback are associated with a reduction in self-reported depression.

### Behavioral activation: Is it the expectation or achievement, of mastery or pleasure that contributes to improvement in depression [^117HvYVh]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Behavioral activation (BA) is receiving renewed interest as a stand-alone treatment or as a component of cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) for depression. However, few studies have examined which aspects of BA most contribute to its efficacy.

- **Methods**: This is a secondary analysis of a 9-week randomized controlled trial of smartphone CBT for patients with major depression. Depression severity was measured at baseline and at the end of treatment using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. All aspects of behavioral activation tasks that participants engaged in, including their expected mastery and pleasure and obtained mastery and pleasure, were recorded on the web server. We examined their contribution to improvement in depression using simple correlations and stepwise multivariable linear regression.

- **Results**: Among the 78 patients who completed at least one behavioral experiment, all aspects of expected or achieved mastery or pleasure correlated with changes in depression severity. The discrepancy between expectation and achievement, representing unexpected gain in mastery or pleasure, was not correlated. In stepwise regression, expected mastery and pleasure, especially the maximum level of the latter, emerged as the strongest contributing factors.

- **Limitations**: The study is observational and cannot deduce cause-effect relationships.

- **Conclusions**: It may be the expected and continued sense of pleasure in planning activities that are most meaningful and rewarding to individuals, rather than the simple level or amount of obtained pleasure, that contributes to the efficacy.

### Cost and outcome of behavioural activation versus cognitive behavioural therapy for depression (COBRA): A randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^112JJ3Pw]. Lancet (2016). Low credibility.

Depression is a common, debilitating, and costly disorder. Many patients request psychological therapy, but the best-evidenced therapy — cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) — is complex and costly. A simpler therapy — behavioural activation (BA) — might be as effective and cheaper than CBT. We aimed to establish the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of BA compared with CBT for adults with depression.

In this randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial, we recruited adults aged 18 years or older meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV criteria for major depressive disorder from primary care and psychological therapy services in Devon, Durham, and Leeds (UK). We excluded people who were receiving psychological therapy, were alcohol or drug dependent, were acutely suicidal or had attempted suicide in the previous 2 months, were cognitively impaired, or who had bipolar disorder or psychosis or psychotic symptoms.

Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) remotely using computer-generated allocation (minimisation used; stratified by depression severity [Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) score of < 19 vs ≥ 19], antidepressant use, and recruitment site) to BA from junior mental health workers or CBT from psychological therapists. Randomisation done at the Peninsula Clinical Trials Unit was concealed from investigators. Treatment was given open label, but outcome assessors were masked. The primary outcome was depression symptoms according to the PHQ-9 at 12 months.

### Validation of the behavioral activation for depression scale (BADS)-psychometric properties of the long and short form [^1128tPid]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

With the development of the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS) by Kanter et al. [1], different behavioral aspects of depression, such as activation, rumination or avoidance, and functional impairment, can be measured. The long and short versions of the BADS, however, show differences in the quality of psychometric properties. We aimed to validate both the short and long forms of the BADS. Therefore, we evaluated the factor structure, psychometric properties, and construct validity of the long version and its subscales in a clinically depressed German sample (n = 258) in study 1. In study 2, we explored the factor structure and psychometric properties of the short version of the BADS in a subsyndromal sample with elevated depressive symptoms (n = 406).

In study 1, our results replicated the four-factor solution of the original BADS-25 version and demonstrated good psychometric properties. However, regarding the BADS-9, only the French factor solution of the short BADS-9 showed an acceptable fit, with low internal consistency of the subscale Avoidance. Thus, only the total score of the short form can be recommended.

### The identification, assessment and management of difficult-to-treat depression: An international consensus statement [^111YRew7]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Many depressed patients are unable to achieve or sustain symptom remission despite serial treatment trials, often termed "treatment-resistant depression". A broader, perhaps more empathic concept of "difficult-to-treat depression" (DTD) was considered.

- **Methods**: A consensus group discussed the definition, clinical recognition, assessment, and management implications of the DTD heuristic.

- **Results**: The group proposed that DTD be defined as "depression that continues to cause significant burden despite usual treatment efforts". All depression management should include a thorough initial assessment. When DTD is recognized, a regular reassessment employing a multi-dimensional framework to identify addressable barriers to successful treatment — including patient-, illness-, and treatment-related factors — is advised. Specific recommendations for addressing these factors are provided. The emphasis of treatment, initially, shifts from a goal of remission to optimal symptom control, daily psychosocial function, and quality of life. This is based on a patient-centered approach with shared decision-making to enhance the timely consideration of all treatment options (including pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, neurostimulation, etc) to optimize outcomes when sustained remission is elusive.

- **Limitations**: The recommended definition and management of DTD is based largely on expert consensus. While DTD appears to have clinical utility, its specificity and objectivity may be insufficient to define clinical populations for regulatory trial purposes, though DTD could define…

### Cost and outcome of behavioural activation versus cognitive behavioural therapy for depression (COBRA): a randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^111iPoXk]. Lancet (2016). High credibility.

Junior mental health workers (MHWs) — graduates trained to deliver guided self-help interventions, but without professional mental health qualifications or formal training in psychological therapies — delivered an individually tailored program. This program involved re-engaging participants with positive environmental stimuli and developing depression management strategies. Participants were encouraged to increase their contact with individually specified positive situations and reduce their avoidance of other situations. Specific behavioural activation (BA) techniques included identification of depressed behaviours, analysis of the triggers and consequences of depressed behaviours, monitoring of activities, development of alternative goal-oriented behaviours, scheduling of activities, and development of alternative behavioural responses to rumination.

Professional or equivalently qualified psychotherapists, accredited as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) therapists with the British Association of Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy, and holding a postgraduate diploma in CBT, delivered a personalised treatment program. This program was based on an assessment of how participants' beliefs lead to emotional distress and ineffectual coping. Participants used cognitive and behavioural exercises to specifically test the accuracy of their beliefs by identifying and modifying negative thoughts and beliefs that give rise to them. Specific techniques included participants monitoring moods and activities, planning exercises to test negative beliefs, and using thought records to identify and examine the accuracy of negative automatic thoughts and underlying beliefs. Follow-up assessments were conducted six months later.

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^115ij3WN]. APA (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for major depressive disorder (MDD), and specifically in relation to maintenance therapy, the APA 2019 guidelines recommend offering psychotherapy — such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, or interpersonal psychotherapy — over antidepressant therapy or usual treatment to prevent relapse in adult patients with MDD in remission.

### How well do patient activation scores predict depression outcomes one year later [^111jrj1j]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

This study examines the relationship between patient activation, a measure of individuals' knowledge, skill, and confidence for managing their health, and rates of depression remission and response among patients with depression.

- **Methods**: Patients from Fairview Health Services in Minnesota with moderate to severe depression in 2011 and a PHQ-9 score in 2012 were included in the analysis (n = 5253). Patient activation in 2011 and other health and demographic features were extracted from the electronic health record. We examined how patient activation predicted depression remission and response rates and changes in depression severity over one year using regression models. We also explored how activation predicted healthy behaviors among depressed patients.

- **Results**: Higher baseline patient activation predicted lower depression severity and higher depression remission and response rates a year later. The most activated patients had PHQ-9 scores in 2012 two points lower than the least activated patients, and they had twice the odds of remission. Activation also predicted an increase in healthy behaviors.

- **Limitations**: We were unable to examine the use of mental health services or control for the number of prior depressive episodes and duration of the depressive episode in the analysis.

- **Conclusions**: We found that higher patient activation predicted better depression outcomes. While we are unable to explore the mechanism of this association, we observed that more activated patients are also engaged in more healthy behaviors, suggesting that the mechanism may be related to these behaviors.

### A cognitive neural circuit biotype of depression showing functional and behavioral improvement after transcranial magnetic stimulation in the B-SMART-fMRI trial [^1175Pb8U]. Nature. Mental health (2024). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and the leading cause of disability. Despite the availability of multiple treatment options, we lack tests for identifying which treatment is most likely to benefit each individual. Most patients cycle through multiple trial-and-error treatment trials, often over years, and some patients become resistant to treatment. The need for precision treatments is especially urgent for veterans given the high prevalence of depression with comorbid conditions and a higher rate of suicide compared with the civilian population. This need was corroborated by the launch of the Scott Hannon Initiative for Precision Mental Health, which directs the US Department of Veterans Affairs to utilize methods such as functional neuroimaging to tailor treatments to individuals.

A growing pool of studies highlights that cognitive impairments occur with depression and are a major contributor to chronic disability across the lifespan of affected individuals. These cognitive impairments can persist despite overall symptom relief during early-to-mid adulthood and similarly predict poor response to antidepressant medication in later-life depression. We previously identified a cognitive biotype of depression in 27% of individuals with depression. At the pretreatment baseline, this biotype is characterized by impaired performance on tests of cognitive control, greater disability, and dysfunction of the brain's cognitive control circuit, in particular in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dLPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC).

### Cost and outcome of behavioural activation versus cognitive behavioural therapy for depression (COBRA): A randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^112hV71c]. Lancet (2016). High credibility.

Statistical analysis

Previous research has suggested that non-inferiority margins should be half of the mean controlled effect size from historical trials. Accordingly, we estimated the non-inferiority margin for the primary outcome using meta-analysis data from trials of behavioral activation (BA) for which BA was superior to controls by a mean of 0.7 standard deviation (SD) units (95% CI 0.39–1) or 3.8 PHQ-9 score units (2.1–5.4). Therefore, our non-inferiority margin was 1.9 PHQ-9 points (i.e. 0.5 × 3.8). We inflated our sample size by 20% to account for participant follow-up attrition. We planned to recruit 220 participants per arm to detect a between-group non-inferiority margin of 1.9 PHQ-9 points with a one-sided 2.5% α. Furthermore, although findings from a trial of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) have shown little effect of outcome clustering by therapists, the presence of a small therapist clustering effect (i.e. an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.01) would still provide the same power.

We conducted all analyses using a statistical analysis plan prepared in the first six months of the trial, agreed upon with the Trial Management Group, Trial Steering Committee, and Data Management Committee. We assessed between-group equivalence of baseline characteristics and outcomes descriptively and performed a descriptive analysis of baseline characteristics by recruitment method.

We compared observed primary and secondary outcomes between groups 12 months after randomisation using linear regression models adjusted for baseline outcome values and stratification variables. We conducted modified intention-to-treat (mITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses to ensure security of inference.

### Behavioral activation treatment for major depression: A randomized trial of the efficacy of augmentation with cognitive control training [^111oSLhg]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with hypoactivation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a brain region involved in emotion regulation and basic cognitive control processes. Recent studies have indicated that computerized interventions designed to activate this region may reduce depressive and ruminative symptoms. In this double-blind randomized controlled trial, we tested whether one such program, called Cognitive Control Training (CCT), enhanced treatment outcomes when used in adjunct to brief behavior therapy for MDD.

- **Methods**: Thirty-four adults with MDD were randomly assigned to complete four sessions of either computerized CCT or a control task, concurrently with four sessions of Brief Behavioral Activation Therapy for Depression (BATD). Post-treatment and one-month follow-up assessments were conducted, with self-reported depressive symptoms as the primary outcome and clinician-rated depressive symptoms and self-reported rumination as secondary outcomes.

- **Results**: In both intent-to-treat and completer analyses, depressive symptoms and rumination decreased significantly over the course of treatment in both treatment conditions. There were no significant differences in treatment outcome depending on the augmentation condition.

- **Limitations**: The sample size was small, hindering secondary analyses and identification of potential predictors or moderators of treatment effect.

- **Conclusions**: Results demonstrate substantial clinical benefit following four sessions of BATD; however, adjunctive CCT did not enhance outcomes.
