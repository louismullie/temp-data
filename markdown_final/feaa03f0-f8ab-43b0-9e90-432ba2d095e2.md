## Question

What treatments are recommended for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what treatments are recommended for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about severity stratification and supportive care fundamentals. Then, I should review antiviral therapy, especially remdesivir, including timing and benefit across oxygen tiers. Next, I will examine immunomodulation with corticosteroids and IL-6 or JAK inhibition. After that, I must evaluate anticoagulation intensity and reconcile conflicting guideline signals. I will also assess antibiotic stewardship and other pharmacologic options to avoid. Finally, I will integrate ventilatory strategies and synthesize a category-based algorithm for Categories A through D, verifying edge cases and exceptions as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and severity anchors before recommending drugs or devices, because misclassifying severity can misalign therapy and harm patients. Hospitalized COVID-19 pneumonia should be stratified by oxygen requirement and trajectory: no oxygen, low-flow, high-flow or noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO. Across all strata, the backbone is supportive care with continuous reassessment of hemodynamics, fluids, and respiratory support; more than three-quarters of hospitalized patients require supplemental oxygen, and a subset progress to ARDS requiring invasive ventilation, so I need to ensure the team is prepared to escalate early rather than late [^1155ncMa] [^113SNDxk].

> Now, on antivirals, I should double-check remdesivir labeling and the strength of outcome data by oxygen tier. The FDA label confirms remdesivir as indicated for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and describes its mechanism as a nucleotide analog RNA polymerase inhibitor, which aligns with using it early in the disease course when viral replication predominates. Real-world comparative effectiveness in 169,965 hospitalized adults initiating remdesivir within two days showed lower adjusted 14-day and 28-day mortality in both patients without oxygen and those on supplemental oxygen; initially, I was going to say "definitive mortality benefit across all strata", but wait, let me verify: RCTs primarily demonstrated faster recovery rather than consistent mortality reduction, so I should frame mortality findings as strongest in real-world analyses and emphasize early initiation for likely benefit [^116z6cao] [^112UxH39] [^114akMNt].

> Next, corticosteroids. I need to ensure dexamethasone is recommended only where it helps and avoided where it harms. The RECOVERY platform supports dexamethasone 6 mg IV or PO daily up to 10 days or until discharge in patients requiring oxygen or mechanical ventilation, with mortality benefit most pronounced in those at the higher end of severity; however, there is no benefit and possible harm in patients not requiring oxygen, so I must not extrapolate its use to Category A. Alternative high-dose regimens have been studied, but standard-dose dexamethasone remains the reference approach in guidelines, so I should anchor on that unless compelling patient-specific considerations emerge [^114KkYdC] [^114akMNt] [^114gueCF].

> For IL-6 receptor blockade, I should confirm selection criteria and dosing for tocilizumab and avoid overgeneralization. The RECOVERY criteria defined progressive COVID-19 with oxygen saturation below 92 percent or receiving oxygen and CRP at least 75 mg/L; the addition of tocilizumab to standard care (predominantly with corticosteroids) improved outcomes in this population. The COVID-19 dosing is 8 mg/kg IV once, with the option to repeat after 8 hours if no improvement or worsening, not to exceed 800 mg per infusion. Hold on, I should verify the heterogeneity across trials: REMDACTA did not show benefit on time to discharge when added to remdesivir, highlighting that patient selection and background therapy matter; thus, I will prioritize tocilizumab for patients with rapid oxygenation deterioration and systemic inflammation, in addition to dexamethasone [^113uiLsW] [^116UGmnc] [^114SAaR5].

> I will now examine JAK inhibition, since some patients may not be ideal candidates for IL-6 blockade or may need an alternative path. Evidence summaries indicate baricitinib confers benefit in certain settings, particularly when layered on background corticosteroids, whereas some head-to-head comparisons with dexamethasone show equipoise. Let me reconsider how to position this: in patients with escalating oxygen needs who are receiving dexamethasone and in whom IL-6 blockade is unavailable or contraindicated, a JAK inhibitor such as baricitinib can be considered, with vigilance for secondary infections and thrombotic risk [^116a8yz1] [^114akMNt].

> Turning to anticoagulation, I need to check prophylactic versus therapeutic intensity by severity and reconcile conflicting guidance. CHEST recommends pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis for acutely ill hospitalized patients absent contraindications, which sets the default. ASH 2025 executive summaries recommend prophylactic-intensity over intermediate intensity for acutely ill patients without confirmed VTE, and also recommend prophylactic-intensity rather than therapeutic-intensity in critically ill patients without another indication; wait, I see a conflicting ASH citation suggesting therapeutic over prophylactic in critical illness, so I should explicitly note this discrepancy and align with the broader totality of evidence favoring prophylactic-intensity in the ICU due to bleeding risk and lack of clear benefit from full-dose anticoagulation. Mechanical prophylaxis should be used when pharmacologic prophylaxis is contraindicated, and I should avoid routinely adding mechanical devices on top of pharmacologic prophylaxis in the critically ill [^114H61PC] [^115SuHFf] [^112WoKj2] [^111kkWzz] [^115N2yZK].

> On antibiotics, I should first confirm how common bacterial co-infection is on admission and how to steward therapy. Multi-hospital data show early bacterial coinfection is uncommon, roughly 3.5 percent on admission, with secondary infections later in the stay up to about 15 percent, so routine empiric antibiotics on admission for COVID-19 pneumonia are not warranted in the absence of specific signs of bacterial infection. If bacterial coinfection is suspected, I need to obtain cultures and de-escalate or discontinue if cultures are negative and the clinical picture does not support bacterial disease, and I should avoid using antibiotics as antiviral or anti-inflammatory agents in COVID-19 outside of trials [^112PAMmw] [^115L1gPn] [^115pqQku].

> I should review other pharmacologic interventions to avoid ineffective or harmful therapies. Convalescent plasma did not improve 30-day mortality or functional outcomes in a blinded RCT of severe pneumonia, so it should not be used routinely. Azithromycin has shown no benefit in large randomized trials and should not be used as an antiviral. Randomized trials of losartan were stopped early for safety concerns, including increased hypotension without mortality benefit, so I should not initiate ARBs solely for COVID-19 treatment. Gohibic remains investigational and may be considered only within trials or appropriate access pathways shortly after initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO [^114ZZb3E] [^111KKMMG] [^113MPkpu] [^115bKUp8] [^111231ZL].

> Next, I should review ventilatory support principles and confirm what is evidence-based. Maintain adequate oxygenation with escalation from low-flow to high-flow nasal cannula or noninvasive ventilation, proceeding to intubation when indicated, while applying ARDS best practices once invasive ventilation is needed. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 update suggests considering a higher PEEP strategy in moderate-to-severe ARDS with careful monitoring for barotrauma, and I should ensure adherence to lung-protective ventilation and proning where appropriate as part of comprehensive ARDS care. Let me verify supportive care scope again: these recommendations align with contemporary ICU guidance for COVID-19 ARDS [^113vhCky] [^113SNDxk].

> For recovery planning, I need to ensure functional rehabilitation is addressed after the acute phase. Pulmonary rehabilitation in survivors of severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation improves forced vital capacity, muscle strength, and functional exercise capacity, so I should embed early mobilization and post-discharge PR referrals into the care pathway for eligible patients to enhance recovery trajectories [^1144nnwL].

> Synthesis for Category A, no supplemental oxygen. Hold on, let me first confirm what to include and what to avoid here. Dexamethasone is not recommended without an oxygen requirement due to potential harm, and tocilizumab should not be used. Remdesivir can be considered in hospitalized patients early in their disease course, particularly if they are at risk for progression, recognizing that the strongest mortality signals come from real-world data and that earlier initiation is preferable. I should provide prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation unless contraindicated, and avoid routine empiric antibiotics in the absence of bacterial features, while maintaining vigilant supportive care and close monitoring for deterioration [^114akMNt] [^116z6cao] [^112UxH39] [^115SuHFf] [^112PAMmw].

> Synthesis for Category B, low-flow oxygen. I should confirm the core combination here. Standard-dose dexamethasone is indicated, and remdesivir has the greatest likelihood of benefit when started early, so combined antiviral and steroid therapy is appropriate. If there is rapid clinical progression with systemic inflammation, defined pragmatically as CRP at least 75 mg/L, adding tocilizumab to dexamethasone is reasonable, with careful screening for contraindications and secondary infection risk. Prophylactic-dose anticoagulation should be continued barring other indications or bleeding risk [^114KkYdC] [^114akMNt] [^116z6cao] [^112UxH39] [^113uiLsW] [^115SuHFf].

> Synthesis for Category C, high-flow nasal cannula or noninvasive ventilation. Let me ensure I do not under-treat the inflammatory phase here. Dexamethasone remains foundational, and I should still consider remdesivir if illness onset is recent, acknowledging diminishing returns later in the course. In patients with escalating oxygen needs and systemic inflammation, add tocilizumab on top of dexamethasone, with JAK inhibition as an alternative strategy where IL-6 blockade is not an option. Continue prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation, and escalate respiratory support and monitoring per ARDS best practices [^114akMNt] [^116z6cao] [^113uiLsW] [^116UGmnc] [^116a8yz1] [^115SuHFf] [^113vhCky].

> Synthesis for Category D, invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO. I should confirm that dexamethasone is still indicated and that remdesivir's role is limited if started late. Dexamethasone should be given, while remdesivir may be of uncertain value if far into the inflammatory phase; however, if illness onset is still early, some clinicians may still consider it. Tocilizumab can be used in select patients with high inflammatory markers and rapid progression despite steroids, recognizing heterogeneity across trials. Anticoagulation should remain prophylactic-intensity unless there is confirmed or strongly suspected VTE, and ventilator management should incorporate higher PEEP strategies with vigilance for barotrauma. Consider investigational therapies such as Gohibic only within appropriate trial or access frameworks early after initiation of invasive support [^114KkYdC] [^114SAaR5] [^115SuHFf] [^113vhCky] [^111231ZL].

> Finally, I should confirm that this algorithm remains responsive to evolving epidemiology and patient risk. Severe outcomes persist in vulnerable populations, so I must individualize decisions based on age, comorbidities, timing of illness, and contraindications, while aligning with updated institutional protocols and living guidelines to maintain best practice in the endemic period [^116zuh6H].

### Repurposed pharmacological agents for the potential treatment of COVID-19: A literature review [^114KkYdC]. Respiratory Research (2021). Low credibility.

Another immunomodulatory option for the potential treatment of severe COVID-19 is the administration of corticosteroids. Although the use of corticosteroids in viral infections is questionable, their anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic actions could have beneficial effects on pneumonia, ARDS, and septic shock. Previous studies evaluating corticosteroids in ARDS and septic shock patients concluded that corticosteroids could reduce mortality and the duration of mechanical ventilation. These insights provide hope for the treatment of severe and mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with corticosteroids to wean patients off respiratory support and reduce mortality.

In a report on the results of a controlled, open-label trial that is part of the RECOVERY trial in the United Kingdom, 6,425 eligible patients were randomized to receive either usual care or usual care with additional dexamethasone. Specifically, 2,104 patients were allocated to receive dexamethasone, 6 mg once per day for 10 days or until hospital discharge, administered orally or intravenously, while 4,321 patients were grouped to receive usual care. Patients eligible for this trial were those with clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and no contraindications for the use of corticosteroids. After a primary outcome assessment of 28-day mortality, the group receiving mechanical ventilation or just supplemental oxygen therapy without mechanical ventilation at the time of randomization in the dexamethasone group had a lower mortality rate than those in the usual care group.

### Actemra ACTPen [^113uiLsW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy) Collaborative Group conducted a study in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVID-19. This randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter platform study took place in the United Kingdom to assess the efficacy and safety of potential treatments for severe COVID-19 pneumonia in hospitalized adult patients. Eligible participants for the ACTEMRA portion of the study had either clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, no medical contraindications to any treatments, and clinical evidence of progressive COVID-19, defined as oxygen saturation below 92% on room air or receiving oxygen therapy, and CRP levels of 75 mg/L or higher. Patients were randomized to receive either standard of care (SoC) or intravenous ACTEMRA with a weight-tiered dosing comparable to the recommended dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], in addition to SoC.

Efficacy analyses focused on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which included 4,116 adult patients randomized to the ACTEMRA + SoC arm (n = 2,022) or the SoC arm (n = 2,094). The mean age of participants was 64 years (range: 20 to 101), with 67% male, 76% White, 11% Asian, 3% Black or African American, and 1% mixed race. At baseline, 0.2% of patients were not on supplemental oxygen, 45% required low-flow oxygen, 41% needed non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen, and 14% required invasive mechanical ventilation; 82% of patients were receiving systemic corticosteroids.

The primary efficacy endpoint was time to…

### Empiric antibacterial therapy and community-onset bacterial coinfection in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A multi-hospital cohort study [^112PAMmw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Study strengths include data from multiple, diverse hospitals across a state that was surging at the time of data collection. The existing infrastructure from prior pneumonia quality-improvement work allowed for rapid, yet rigorous, data collection and analysis by experienced abstractors and analysts.

Our findings have important implications. The known risks associated with unnecessary antibacterial use and the low rate of confirmed early bacterial coinfection in patients with COVID-19 suggest against routinely prescribing antibacterial therapy to patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who present without other risk factors or signs of bacterial infection. The variation in antibacterial use across hospitals suggests an imperfect response to limited data. It is crucial to understand whether existing stewardship or quality infrastructure may help hospitals make better treatment decisions during pandemics. Our findings suggest that faster testing turnaround time is imperative to inform empiric treatment decisions, including antibacterial therapy. Notably, antibacterials were stopped after COVID-19 tests returned positive at higher rates than with other viral pneumonias.

Finally, improved training and understanding of how to incorporate imperfect tests and diagnostic uncertainty into decision-making are needed. In conclusion, we found high use of early empiric antibacterial therapy in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, despite a low prevalence of confirmed community-onset bacterial coinfections.

### A randomized trial of convalescent plasma in Covid-19 severe pneumonia [^114ZZb3E]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). High credibility.

The PlasmAr study, published by Ventura A. Simonovich and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med, focuses on COVID-19 infection. The trial question examined the role of convalescent plasma in severe coronavirus 2019 pneumonia. Conducted as a multi-center, double-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT), it involved 333 patients (108 female, 225 male). The inclusion criteria encompassed hospitalized adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, while key exclusion criteria included pregnancy or lactation, history of blood component allergies, infectious causes of pneumonia other than SARS-CoV-2, requirement for mechanical ventilation, and multiorgan failure.

- **Interventions**: The study participants were divided into two groups: 228 patients received a single administration of COVID-19 convalescent plasma in addition to standard treatment, while 105 patients received a placebo consisting of a normal saline solution plus standard treatment.

- **Primary outcome**: The study found no significant difference in death at 30 days between the two groups (10.96% vs. 11.43%; ARD -0.46, 95% CI -7.8 to 6.8).

- **Secondary outcomes**: These included no significant difference in median time from intervention to hospital discharge (13 days vs. 12 days; subHR 0.99, 99% CI 0.75 to 1.32) and no significant difference in median time from intervention to complete restoration of physical functions (15 days vs. 15 days; subHR 0.89, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.18).

- **Safety outcomes**: There was no significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events between the two groups, highlighting the overall safety of convalescent plasma as a treatment option.

### Surviving sepsis campaign: Guidelines on the management of critically ill adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^113aoGZi]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a rapidly spreading illness, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), affecting thousands of people around the world. Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed.

- **Methods**: We formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries. All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form. The panel proposed 53 questions relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU. We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on managing COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU. We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care. We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Recommendations were either strong or weak or in the form of best practice recommendations.

- **Results**: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which four are best practice statements, nine are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations. No recommendation was provided for six questions. The topics were:
	1) infection control,
	2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens,
	3) hemodynamic support,
	4) ventilatory support, and
	5) COVID-19 therapy.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations based on these findings.

### Public health benefits of applying evidence-based best practices in managing patients hospitalized for COVID-19 [^116zuh6H]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has shifted from pandemic to endemic status, and there is generally reduced interest regarding COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection-related mortality among vulnerable populations remains a concern. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that there were approximately 75,000 COVID-19-related deaths in the United States in 2023, making it one of the top 10 causes of mortality in the country.

The recent rise in the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, driven by KP.2, KP.2.3, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.3.1.1 variants in the United States and BA.2.86 and JN.1 globally, highlights the need for continued management of patients with COVID-19. This should be consistent with the latest treatment guidelines, especially in the most vulnerable hospitalized patients. There is also an opportunity to continue improving institutional treatment protocols to reflect the latest evidence.

### Severe outcomes among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) - United States, February 12-March 16, 2020 [^111fZDCh]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Low credibility.

Since February 12, 4,226 COVID-19 cases have been reported in the United States. Notably, 31% of cases, 45% of hospitalizations, 53% of ICU admissions, and 80% of deaths occurred among adults aged ≥ 65 years, with the highest percentage of severe outcomes among those aged ≥ 85 years. At the time of writing, similar findings were reported in China, indicating that over 80% of deaths occurred among persons aged ≥ 60 years. These preliminary data also demonstrate that severe illness leading to hospitalization, including ICU admission and death, can occur in adults of any age with COVID-19. In contrast, persons aged ≤ 19 years appear to experience milder COVID-19 illness, with almost no hospitalizations or deaths reported in this age group in the United States.

Given the spread of COVID-19 in many U.S. communities, the CDC continues to update recommendations and develop new resources and guidance, including for adults aged ≥ 65 years and those involved in their care. Approximately 49 million U.S. persons are aged ≥ 65 years, and many of these adults, who are at risk for severe COVID-19–associated illness, might depend on services and support to maintain their health and independence. To prepare for potential COVID-19 illness among persons at high risk, family members and caregivers of older adults should be aware of the medications they are taking and ensure that food and necessary medical supplies are available. Long-term care facilities should be particularly vigilant to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19. Additionally, clinicians who care for adults should be aware that COVID-19 can result in a severe course of illness among older adults.

### Management of respiratory distress syndrome due to COVID-19 infection [^112Nc83r]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Low credibility.

The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and its clinical manifestation as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) present an unparalleled worldwide public health problem. As reported on July 14, 2020, the pandemic of COVID-19 has already infected 12,964,809 patients and provoked 570,288 deaths (mortality of 4.39%). The disease introduces a unique pathophysiology and clinical course that puzzles the efficacy of the currently existing therapeutic approaches. This editorial presents an overview of the clinical experience gathered thus far from different centers around the world and is not meant to constitute a guideline nor a standard of care for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, given that the level of evidence behind the clinical approach to these patients is rapidly evolving.

### The association between frailty and severe disease among Covid-19 patients aged over 60 years in China: A prospective cohort study [^1116rxFJ]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

In December 2019, cases of pneumonia with an unknown origin pathogen, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province in China. The clinical manifestations of this novel disease resembled viral pneumonia. The disease rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas in China, and the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of Covid-19 a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 12 May 2020, over 4.0 million confirmed Covid-19 cases and over 270,000 deaths have been reported in over 200 countries.

Data from China have indicated that old age and underlying illnesses are two strong risk factors for illness and death related to Covid-19. Although the majority of reported Covid-19 cases were mild and the overall case-fatality rate was only 2.3%, over 80% of deaths occurred among adults aged ≥ 60 years, and the case-fatality rate increased dramatically from 3.6% among persons aged 60–69 years to 14.8% among those aged ≥ 80 years. Covid-19 has also posed a disproportionately high threat to older adults in other parts of the world, including the United States and Europe. The Covid-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented burden on health systems and forced healthcare professionals to make difficult decisions about how to allocate increasingly scarce resources efficiently. In some places, decisions are being made about who should be prioritized for medical resources, such as ventilators and ICU beds, based on chronological age. However, chronological age may not truly reflect the differences.

### Pharmacologic treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A review [^115EA7jr]. JAMA (2020). Low credibility.

The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), presents an unprecedented challenge to identify effective drugs for prevention and treatment. Given the rapid pace of scientific discovery and clinical data generated by the large number of people rapidly infected by SARS-CoV-2, clinicians need accurate evidence regarding effective medical treatments for this infection.

- **Observations**: No proven effective therapies for this virus currently exist. The rapidly expanding knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 virology provides a significant number of potential drug targets. The most promising therapy is remdesivir. Remdesivir has potent in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 but is not US Food and Drug Administration approved, currently being tested in ongoing randomized trials. Oseltamivir has not been shown to have efficacy, and corticosteroids are currently not recommended. Clinical evidence does not support stopping angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with COVID-19.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: The COVID-19 pandemic represents the greatest global public health crisis of this generation and, potentially, since the pandemic influenza outbreak of 1918. The speed and volume of clinical trials launched to investigate potential therapies for COVID-19 highlight both the need and capability to produce high-quality evidence, even in the middle of a pandemic. No therapies have been shown effective at the time of writing.

### A comparative study between methylprednisolone versus dexamethasone as an initial anti-inflammatory treatment of moderate COVID-19 pneumonia: an open-label randomized controlled trial [^114gueCF]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The most appropriate anti-inflammatory treatment for moderate COVID-19 pneumonia remains uncertain. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of a high-dose methylprednisolone versus a high-dose dexamethasone in hospitalized moderate COVID-19 pneumonia, regarding the WHO clinical progression scales, mortality, and the length of hospitalization.

- **Methods**: In this open-labeled randomized controlled trial, we enrolled patients older than 18 years who were diagnosed with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia, as confirmed by real-time PCR, evidence of pneumonia by chest imaging, and resting oxygen saturation between 90% and 94%. Patients were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive methylprednisolone 250 mg/day or dexamethasone 20 mg/day over the first three days. Then, patients in both groups received dexamethasone 20 mg/day on days 4–5 and 10 mg/day on days 6–10. The primary outcome was assessed using a 10-point WHO clinical progression scale, ranging from uninfected (point 0) to death (point 10) on the fifth day of treatment. Secondary outcomes included 90-day mortality, length of hospitalization, rate of intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, and complications.

- **Results**: Of 98 eligible patients, the mean age was 76.0 ± 13.3 years. The median date of illness at the time of randomization was 3 days (interquartile range 2, 5). Baseline clinical characteristics and severity did not differ between groups. The WHO clinical progression scales were similar between the methylprednisolone and dexamethasone groups at 5 and 10 days of treatment [4.84 (95% confidence interval (CI), 4.35–5.33) vs.

### Lagevrio [^111PKZEt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Approved available alternatives

- **Veklury (remdesivir)**: FDA-approved for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (at least 28 days old and weighing at least 3 kg) with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. Veklury is administered via intravenous infusion for a total treatment duration of 3 days. Although Veklury is an approved alternative to Lagevrio, the FDA does not consider it an adequate substitute for this authorized use, as it may not be feasible or clinically appropriate for certain patients (e.g. it requires a 3-day intravenous treatment duration).

- **Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir tablets and ritonavir tablets co-packaged for oral use)**: FDA-approved for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. Paxlovid is administered orally for a total treatment duration of 5 days. Although Paxlovid is an approved alternative to Lagevrio, the FDA does not consider it an adequate substitute for this authorized use, as it may not be clinically appropriate for patients on medications primarily metabolized by certain enzymes.

### An open-label, randomized trial of the combination of IFN-κ plus TFF2 with standard care in the treatment of patients with moderate COVID-19 [^114avntK]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). High credibility.

The recent emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the novel pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has affected more than 4 million patients, with more than 283,000 deaths in over 230 countries. At present, many therapeutic approaches are being evaluated since no specific treatment has been proven effective. Clinical management includes symptomatic treatment or supportive care, with supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilatory support when indicated. There is an urgent need to identify active antiviral agents.

Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are considered the most promising agents against COVID-19. However, the clinical efficacy of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 patients is controversial. On one hand, several clinical studies have shown that HCQ treatment had a favorable effect, including shortened body temperature recovery time and cough remission time, decreased pneumonia proportion as assessed by computed tomography (CT) scan, alleviated symptoms, and decreased C-reactive protein concentrations. On the other hand, a French study conducted in 181 COVID-19 patients with relatively severe illness showed no difference regarding transfer to the ICU or death. Furthermore, in a large-scale observational study involving hospitalized COVID-19 patients, hydroxychloroquine administration was not associated with either intubation or death. In addition, compassionate use of a nucleotide analog, remdesivir, contributed to clinical improvement.

### Infectious diseases society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 [^1111qPPa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

There are many pharmacologic therapies that are being used or considered for the treatment of COVID-19. There is a need for frequently updated practice guidelines on their use, based on critical evaluation of rapidly emerging literature.

- **Objective**: Develop evidence-based rapid guidelines intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health-care professionals in their decisions about treatment and management of patients with COVID-19.

- **Methods**: IDSA formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel of infectious disease clinicians, pharmacists, and methodologists with varied areas of expertise. The process followed a rapid recommendation checklist. The panel prioritized questions and outcomes. Then a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations.

- **Results**: The IDSA guideline panel agreed on seven treatment recommendations and provided narrative summaries of other treatments undergoing evaluations.

- **Conclusions**: The panel expressed the overarching goal that patients be recruited into ongoing trials, which would provide much-needed evidence on the efficacy and safety of various therapies for COVID-19, given that we could not make a determination whether the benefits outweigh harms for most treatments.

### Management of vulnerable patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with remdesivir: a retrospective comparative effectiveness study of mortality in US hospitals [^112UxH39]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains a major public health concern, with continued resurgences of cases and a substantial risk of mortality for hospitalized patients. Remdesivir has become the standard of care for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Given the continued evolution of the disease, clinical management of COVID-19 relies on evidence from the endemic period.

Using the PINC AI Healthcare Database, remdesivir effectiveness was evaluated among adults hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 between December 2021 and February 2024. Three cohorts were analyzed: adults (≥ 18 years), elderly (≥ 65 years), and those with documented COVID-19 pneumonia. Analyses were stratified by oxygen requirements. Patients who received remdesivir were matched to those who did not using propensity score matching. Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to examine in-hospital mortality.

A total of 169,965 adults hospitalized for COVID-19 were included, of whom 94,129 (55.4%) initiated remdesivir in the first 2 days of hospitalization. Remdesivir was associated with a significantly lower mortality rate compared to no remdesivir among patients with no supplemental oxygen charges (adjusted HR [95% CI]: 14-day, 0.75 [.69–.82]; 28-day, 0.77 [.72–.83]) and those requiring supplemental oxygen (14-day, 0.76 [.72–.81]; 28-day, 0.79 [.74–.83]; P < 0.0001 for all). Similar findings were observed for elderly patients and those hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia.

This evidence builds on what has been learned from randomized controlled trials and supports the use of remdesivir in reducing mortality among vulnerable hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

### Nafamostat in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia: a randomised Phase II clinical trial [^114Nuyvc]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

There is an urgent unmet need for drugs to treat COVID-19, and repurposed drugs are an attractive option as their safety profile is well-established. Several repurposed drugs, including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir-ritonavir, have produced disappointing results in COVID-19. However, based on favorable results in a large placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial, remdesivir was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients who require supplemental oxygen. In addition, dexamethasone reduced 28-day mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 receiving respiratory support (invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone) and was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

Nafamostat has been approved and registered for use as an anticoagulant during hemodialysis in Japan and Korea for over 20 years, and it is reported to reduce disseminated intravascular coagulation in patients with hematological malignancies. In ex vivo experiments, nafamostat inhibited complement activation and improved lung xenograft function. Several clinical case reports also suggested that nafamostat treatment may be beneficial in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

Herein, we report the results of an open-label, randomized Phase 2 trial that evaluated the clinical course of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia who received standard-of-care (SOC; including supplemental oxygen) with or without nafamostat.

### Early short-course corticosteroids in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^113r4AHs]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

As of 9 April 2020, the United States has over 400,000 cases of confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Most patients will have mild illness, but older persons and those with comorbidities may develop severe disease, necessitating hospitalization and time in the intensive care unit (ICU). The disease pathophysiology presents in two distinct overlapping phases: the initial pathogenic viral response followed by a host inflammatory response. These phases have varying grades of severity associated with distinct clinical findings. The pathological progression in severe COVID-19 includes an excessive and unregulated proinflammatory cytokine storm resulting in immunopathological lung injury, diffuse alveolar damage with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and death.

In the absence of any proven antiviral therapy, clinical management is primarily supportive care, supplemental oxygen, and mechanical ventilatory support. Adjunctive therapy with immunomodulatory agents targeting the inflammatory cytokine storm is being evaluated. Studies of corticosteroid therapy for phylogenetically similar coronavirus infections showed no benefit and potential harm. Despite their frequent use in treating patients with COVID-19 in China, the role of corticosteroids is undefined. A more recent observational study reported improved outcomes in patients with COVID-associated ARDS who received corticosteroids.

We postulated that early treatment with a short course of corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19 might…

### Scope, quality, and inclusivity of clinical guidelines produced early in the covid-19 pandemic: Rapid review [^116Ntjhh]. BMJ (2020). Low credibility.

In late 2019, a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing an acute respiratory disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), spread from its origins in China to become a pandemic. As of 26 March 2020, 455,770 cases had been identified worldwide, causing 20,740 deaths. No successful therapeutic intervention for covid-19 has yet been established, so supportive care is the most important aspect of clinical management, supporting the patient's physiology to aid recovery. Optimal provision of supportive care is therefore fundamental both to the well-being of individual patients and to securing the confidence of the general population. To enable the provision of best care, clinicians need evidence-based recommendations developed using accepted methods. Such clinical guidelines must be readily available, of good quality, and inclusive of vulnerable patient groups.

Clinical guidelines are defined as "systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate healthcare for specific clinical circumstances". Widely agreed, rigorous methods now exist for the production and appraisal of clinical guidelines. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II tool is the most widely used guideline appraisal tool, and it has become the international "gold standard" for guideline development.

During times of crisis, guidelines from the World Health Organization may be the only source of direction available to clinicians globally. They may be adopted internationally with only minor adjustments based on local needs.

### Azithromycin for community treatment of suspected COVID-19 in people at increased risk of an adverse clinical course in the UK (PRINCIPLE): a randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial [^111KKMMG]. Lancet (2021). High credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study: We searched PubMed on Jan 24, 2021, using the following search terms: [(randomised OR trial) AND (azithromycin OR macrolide) AND (COVID* OR SARS-CoV-2 OR SARS-CoV)], with no language restrictions, identifying 243 results. Adding a filter for clinical trials limited the results to 16. Of these, we identified two randomised clinical trials with over 100 participants that provided some data on the effectiveness of azithromycin as a treatment for COVID-19 compared with control treatment or usual care. Additional searches of medRxiv and Google Scholar on Jan 24, 2021, using similar search terms with no language restrictions, identified a further randomised clinical trial of azithromycin. All identified trials were in hospitalised patients.

A large randomised trial among patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in the UK found no difference in 28-day mortality, duration of hospital stay, or intensive care unit admissions among 2582 participants randomly assigned to receive azithromycin versus 5181 participants randomly assigned to receive usual care alone. A randomised trial in Brazil among 675 patients admitted to hospital with mild to moderate COVID-19 found no difference in clinical status by 15 days among patients randomly assigned to receive usual care plus azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine versus usual care plus hydroxychloroquine versus usual care alone. A trial by the same group, among 447 patients admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19, found that patients randomly assigned to azithromycin showed similar outcomes to the control groups.

### Applying the lessons learned from coronavirus disease 2019 to improve pneumonia management [^1145T8Ea]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has produced an extraordinary amount of literature in a short time period. This review focuses on what the new literature has provided in terms of more general information about the management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

- **Recent findings**: Measures taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have caused a significant drop in influenza worldwide. Improvements in imaging, especially ultrasound, and the application of rapid molecular diagnosis are likely to have a significant impact on the management of CAP. Therapeutic advances are so far limited.

- **Summary**: COVID-19 has taught us that we can do far more to prevent seasonal influenza and its associated mortality, morbidity, and economic cost. Improvements in imaging and pathogen diagnosis are welcome, as is the potential for secondary benefits of anti-COVID-19 therapies that may affect respiratory viruses other than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. As community transmission is likely to persist for many years, recognition and treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 will need to be incorporated into CAP guidelines moving forward.

### Clinical characteristics and manifestations in older patients with COVID-19 [^111fUh7F]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Low credibility.

COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly during the past several months. As a novel infectious disease, COVID-19 has the ability for human-to-human transmission and can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ dysfunction, and even death. As of April 30, more than three million confirmed cases and more than 200 thousand deaths worldwide were reported by the World Health Organization (WHO).

In China, there are 241 million elderly people aged over 60 years, among whom more than 30 million are over 80 years old. The percentage of older adults (≥ 60 years) is 17.3% of the total population. Globally, the number of older individuals has dramatically increased, leading to a significant rise in the frequency of age-associated diseases, particularly cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Although the entire population is generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, older people show higher morbidity and mortality rates than younger individuals, particularly those with serious underlying comorbidities. Most patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 are over 50 years old, and nearly 80% of deaths occur among individuals aged ≥ 60 years.

Considering the complications and age-related vulnerability in older adults, it poses an enormous challenge to protect multi-organ function and decrease mortality from SARS-CoV-2. Although many studies have focused on the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients, data regarding extrapulmonary organ damage due to SARS-CoV-2 among the elderly is limited.

### A real-world evidence framework for optimizing dosing in all patients with COVID-19 [^116kRzWM]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

Potential treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) are being investigated at an unprecedented speed, and successful treatments will rapidly be used in tens or hundreds of thousands of patients. To ensure the safe and effective use in all these patients, it is essential to develop, at unprecedented speed, a method to provide frequently updated, optimal dosing information for all patient subgroups. Success will require immediate collaboration between drug developers, academics, and regulators.

### Tocilizumab and remdesivir in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia: A randomized clinical trial [^114SAaR5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

In this trial, there was no difference between tocilizumab plus remdesivir and placebo plus remdesivir in the time from randomization to hospital discharge or "ready for discharge" by day 28. There were also no differences between treatment arms in the key secondary outcomes: time to mechanical ventilation or death by day 28, clinical status at day 14 assessed by the investigator on the 7-category ordinal scale, and time to death by day 28. No new safety signals were identified in this trial, and the safety profile was consistent with the known safety profiles of tocilizumab and remdesivir. Adverse events of special interest, including the incidence and types of serious infections, were balanced between the treatment arms and consistent with the known disease course of severe COVID-19.

Compared with other randomized placebo-controlled trials of tocilizumab in severe COVID-19, REMDACTA differed with respect to target patient population and background treatments, partly due to the continuing evolution of standard care. In EMPACTA, which demonstrated a treatment benefit regarding time to mechanical ventilation or death for tocilizumab versus placebo, 64.2% of patients were receiving low-flow oxygen at enrollment, 54.6% received remdesivir, and over 80% received systemic corticosteroids. COVACTA recruited patients with a broader range of disease severity, and fewer patients received effective background therapy (less than 10% of patients received remdesivir, and less than 50% received corticosteroids). These differences in patient selection and treatments may account for the differing outcomes.

### Clinical characteristics and co-infections of 354 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: A retrospective cohort study [^112RH4te]. Microbes and Infection (2020). Low credibility.

From December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, caused an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan City and rapidly spread throughout China and globally. However, the clinical characteristics and co-infection with other respiratory pathogens of patients with COVID-19, and the factors associated with the severity of COVID-19, are still limited. In this retrospective cohort study, we included 354 inpatients with COVID-19 admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from February 4, 2020, to February 28, 2020. We found that levels of interleukin-6, interleukin-10, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, white blood cell count, and neutrophil count were clearly elevated in males and critical cases compared with females and severe and mild cases, respectively. However, lymphopenia was more severe in males than in females, and levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha were significantly reduced in critical cases compared to severe and mild cases.

Moreover, 23.5% of severe cases and 24.4% of critical cases were co-infected with other respiratory pathogens. Stepwise multivariable regression analysis suggested that co-infection, lymphocyte count, and levels of D-dimer were associated with the severity of COVID-19. These findings provide crucial clues for further identification of the mechanisms, characteristics, and treatments of patients with COVID-19.

### Colchicine for community-treated patients with COVID-19 (COLCORONA): a phase 3, randomised, double-blinded, adaptive, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial [^114M5g7P]. The Lancet. Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Accumulating evidence suggests that some patients with COVID-19 experience excessive inflammation. Treatment of this exaggerated inflammatory response has been advocated to address the immediate need to reduce the risk of complications. The steroid dexamethasone reduces mortality in patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, but only if they receive mechanical ventilation or supplemental oxygen. In the open-label STOIC trial, the inhaled steroid budesonide decreased the requirement for urgent medical care in patients with early COVID-19. In addition, the anti-interleukin (IL)-6-receptor antibody tocilizumab has been shown to reduce the likelihood of progression to mechanical ventilation in patients admitted and treated in hospitals for COVID-19 pneumonia. The IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra might also be effective in some patients with COVID-19.

### Gohibic [^111231ZL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus. You can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus. COVID-19 illnesses have ranged from very mild, including some with no reported symptoms, to severe, including illnesses resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illnesses are mild, serious illnesses can occur and may cause some of your other medical conditions to become worse. People of all ages with severe, long-lasting (chronic) medical conditions like heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, for example, seem to be at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19.

The symptoms of COVID-19 may include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which can appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. Serious illness, including breathing problems, can occur and may cause your other medical conditions to become worse.

Gohibic is an investigational medicine used for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults when initiated within 48 hours of receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Gohibic is investigational because it is still being studied. It is not FDA-approved to treat COVID-19.

### Pathophysiology, transmission, diagnosis, and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A review [^1155ncMa]. JAMA (2020). High credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, due to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused a worldwide sudden and substantial increase in hospitalizations for pneumonia with multiorgan disease. This review discusses evidence regarding the pathophysiology, transmission, diagnosis, and management of COVID-19.

- **Observations**: SARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily via respiratory droplets during close face-to-face contact. Infection can be spread by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers. The average time from exposure to symptom onset is 5 days, and 97.5% of people who develop symptoms do so within 11.5 days. The most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Radiographic and laboratory abnormalities, such as lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, are common but nonspecific.

	- Diagnosis is made by detection of SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing, although false-negative test results may occur in up to 20% to 67% of patients, depending on the quality and timing of testing. Manifestations of COVID-19 include asymptomatic carriers and fulminant disease characterized by sepsis and acute respiratory failure. Approximately 5% of patients with COVID-19, and 20% of those hospitalized, experience severe symptoms necessitating intensive care. More than 75% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 require supplemental oxygen. Treatment for individuals with COVID-19 includes best practices for supportive management of acute hypoxic respiratory failure.

### Pharmacologic treatment and management of coronavirus disease 2019 [^114akMNt]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). High credibility.

Over the last two years, there has been gradual and sustained progress toward our understanding of pharmacotherapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a result of large- and small-scale randomized controlled trials. Numerous new and repurposed treatments have been evaluated; some have demonstrated benefit in clinically important outcomes like mortality and hospitalization, and optimism for oral antiviral treatments is growing. Given the rapidly evolving landscape of COVID-19 treatments, frontline clinicians should use treatment and management guidelines to guide their approach to each patient, considering the individual's severity and location of illness to appreciate the nuances in clinical evidence.

### The management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^111gNGJR]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Low credibility.

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan, China. It is an emerging infectious disease with widespread and rapid infectiousness. The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on January 31, 2020. Severe COVID-19 patients should be managed and treated in a critical care unit. Performing a chest X-ray/CT can help judge the severity of the disease.

The management of COVID-19 patients includes considerations of epidemiological risk and patient isolation. Treatment entails general supportive care, respiratory support, symptomatic treatment, nutritional support, and psychological intervention. The prognosis of the patients depends on the severity of the disease, the patient's age, underlying diseases, and the patient's overall medical condition. COVID-19 management should focus on early diagnosis, immediate isolation, general and optimized supportive care, and infection prevention and control.

### Recommendations for antibacterial therapy in adults with COVID-19 - an evidence based guideline [^115L1gPn]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Low credibility.

The Dutch Working Party on Antibiotic Policy assembled a multidisciplinary expert committee to provide evidence-based recommendations for using antibacterial therapy in hospitalized adults with respiratory infections and suspected or confirmed 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

- **Methods**: We performed a literature search to address four key questions. The committee graded the evidence and developed recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology.

- **Questions addressed by the guideline and recommendations**: We evaluated evidence on the risk of bacterial infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the associated bacterial pathogens, how to diagnose bacterial infections, and how to treat them. Bacterial co-infection upon admission was reported in 3.5% of COVID-19 patients, while bacterial secondary infections during hospitalization occurred in up to 15% of cases. No or very low-quality evidence was available to answer the other key clinical questions. Although the evidence base on bacterial infections in COVID-19 is currently limited, available data supports restrictive antibiotic use from an antibiotic stewardship perspective, particularly upon admission. To support restrictive antibiotic use, maximum efforts should be made to obtain sputum and blood culture samples, as well as pneumococcal urinary antigen testing. We suggest discontinuing antibiotics in patients who started antibiotic treatment upon admission if representative cultures and urinary antigen tests show no bacterial involvement.

### Peginterferon lambda-1a for treatment of outpatients with uncomplicated COVID-19: a randomized placebo-controlled trial [^111svWKh]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

These data are in contrast to reports of the benefits of Type I IFN in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Subcutaneous IFN-β, along with ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir, was associated with a shortened duration of symptoms and viral shedding in hospitalized patients in Hong Kong, and a reduction in mortality when given with hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir or atazanavir-ritonavir in Iran. Furthermore, a randomized clinical trial in England also suggests clinical benefits of inhaled IFN-β for COVID-19. Although both Type I and Type III IFN activate the same dominant JAK-STAT signaling pathway, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and have receptors on respiratory epithelia, in vivo activity and efficacy may differ. A recent report found that inborn errors of Type I IFN immunity, including autosomal recessive IFNAR1 deficiency, were enriched in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. Furthermore, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were also more likely to have neutralizing auto-antibodies against Type I, but not Type III, IFNs. These data suggest the possibility that Type I IFN administration may be more beneficial than Type III IFN in preventing adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Routine statins use is associated with less adverse outcome in patients above 70 years of age admitted to hospital with COVID-19 [^114Jnvbk]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). High credibility.

As of March 2022, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has affected over 470,000,000 people and caused more than 6,100,000 deaths worldwide. COVID-19 may lead to multiorgan insufficiency, particularly among the older population and patients with chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Older adults are generally defined as those 70 years of age and older, and they have an increased risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Statins are the most effective treatment for primary prevention and are even more significant regarding the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, having been shown to decrease the risk of both cerebrovascular and coronary artery disease in older adults, similar to their effects in young populations.

A beneficial role of statins was shown in patients with pneumonia, other infectious diseases, and sepsis based on their well-established pleiotropic properties. The association between statins and the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients was recently investigated in several retrospective studies, meta-analyses, and a few randomized controlled trials. Most of those studies found that statin use was associated with improved clinical outcomes, while others reported no such association and even adverse outcomes among statin users. Although some studies included stratification according to age and showed mixed results, only one study directly addressed disease outcomes specifically.

### Treatment patterns in US patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and pulmonary involvement [^1171aMmE]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in China in December 2019 and quickly spread globally, with the first known case in the United States (US) confirmed in January 2020. After initial outbreaks in US states in the Northeast and West, outbreaks in the South followed, spreading to areas throughout the country over the course of the pandemic. As of March 22, 2021, the United States had the most confirmed cases of COVID-19 and COVID-19-related deaths of any country in the world, with over 29,000,000 confirmed cases and over 540,000 deaths.

Patients with COVID-19 may present with illnesses ranging from mild to critical, life-threatening conditions. Severe COVID-19 cases often progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-related respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction and failure, which are associated with high mortality rates. Patients with severe and critical COVID-19 illness have been shown to have elevated levels of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), which are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.

The risk of severe infection increases with age and is higher in individuals with underlying conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Additionally, racial and ethnic minority populations have been shown to have an increased risk of hospitalization and death due to COVID-19. It is important to consider the underlying reasons related to these differences, which are not well understood, but may include health and soc…

### Successful treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and hyperinflammatory syndrome with tocilizumab [^1141ovc6]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

At the time of writing, SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 1,000,000 deaths worldwide. Death is caused by severe respiratory distress following a surge of interleukins and cytokines. Tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin 6 (IL-6) and has shown promise in preliminary studies in blocking cytokine 'storm' and improving patient outcomes in severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

In this case report, we aimed to assess clinical improvement following administration of intravenous tocilizumab in a rapidly deteriorating patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

### Severe outcomes among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) - United States, February 12-March 16, 2020 [^116qRgiy]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Low credibility.

Globally, approximately 170,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported, including an estimated 7,000 deaths in approximately 150 countries. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Data from China have indicated that older adults, particularly those with serious underlying health conditions, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness and death than are younger persons. Although the majority of reported COVID-19 cases in China were mild (81%), approximately 80% of deaths occurred among adults aged ≥ 60 years; only one (0.1%) death occurred in a person aged ≤ 19 years.

In this report, COVID-19 cases in the United States that occurred during February 12-March 16, 2020, and severity of disease (hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit [ICU], and death) were analyzed by age group. As of March 16, a total of 4,226 COVID-19 cases in the United States had been reported to CDC, with multiple cases reported among older adults living in long-term care facilities. Overall, 31% of cases, 45% of hospitalizations, 53% of ICU admissions, and 80% of deaths associated with COVID-19 were among adults aged ≥ 65 years, with the highest percentage of severe outcomes among persons aged ≥ 85 years. In contrast, no ICU admissions or deaths were reported among persons aged ≤ 19 years. Similar to reports from other countries, this finding suggests that the risk for serious disease and death from COVID-19 is higher in older age groups.

### American Society of Hematology living guidelines on use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis for patients with COVID-19: Executive summary [^112WoKj2]. Blood Advances (2025). High credibility.

In the context of medical management for COVID-19 infection, particularly regarding thromboprophylaxis, the ASH 2025 guidelines recommend considering the use of prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation over therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation. This recommendation applies to critically ill patients with COVID-19-related critical illness who do not have suspected or confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) or another indication for anticoagulation.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 management [^1145Hxmg]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute multisystem disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Investigations are ongoing in the search for effective therapeutics, with clinical approaches evolving based upon such evidence.

- **Recent findings**: The antiviral agent, remdesivir, and the immunomodulator, dexamethasone, are the first therapeutics for which there is evidence of efficacy from randomized trials. Subgroup analyses suggest remdesivir is beneficial in hospitalized patients whose severity of illness falls at the lower end of the spectrum, while dexamethasone is more beneficial in hospitalized patients whose severity of illness falls at the higher end of the spectrum. We recommend that inpatients who require supplemental oxygen but are not mechanically ventilated receive both remdesivir and dexamethasone, and inpatients who require mechanical ventilation receive dexamethasone monotherapy. Additional evidence regarding anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, convalescent plasma, and a variety of anti-interleukin therapies is forthcoming.

- **Summary**: The body of evidence related to COVID-19 therapeutics continues to evolve and, as a result, management is likely to change with time. As new evidence is generated and published, the optimal approach to managing patients with COVID-19 should be reconsidered.

### Summary of guidance for minimizing the impact of COVID-19 on individual persons, communities, and health care systems - United States, August 2022 [^1126aaRZ]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). High credibility.

As SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, continues to circulate globally, high levels of vaccine- and infection-induced immunity, and the availability of effective treatments and prevention tools have substantially reduced the risk for medically significant COVID-19 illness (severe acute illness and post-COVID-19 conditions) and associated hospitalization and death. These circumstances now allow public health efforts to minimize the individual and societal health impacts of COVID-19 by focusing on sustainable measures to further reduce medically significant illness as well as to minimize strain on the health care system, while reducing barriers to social, educational, and economic activity. Individual risk for medically significant COVID-19 depends on a person's risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and their risk for developing severe illness if infected. Exposure risk can be mitigated through nonpharmaceutical interventions, including improving ventilation, use of masks or respirators indoors, and testing. The risk for medically significant illness increases with age, disability status, and underlying medical conditions but is considerably reduced by immunity derived from vaccination, previous infection, or both, as well as timely access to effective biomedical prevention measures and treatments. CDC's public health recommendations change in response to evolving science, the availability of biomedical and public health tools, and changes in context, such as levels of immunity in the population and currently circulating variants.

### Quarantine alone or in combination with other public health measures to control COVID-19: A rapid review [^113myzqT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging disease that has been classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). To support WHO with their recommendations on quarantine, we conducted a rapid review on the effectiveness of quarantine during severe coronavirus outbreaks.

- **Objectives**: We conducted a rapid review to assess the effects of quarantine (alone or in combination with other measures) of individuals who had contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19, who traveled from countries with a declared outbreak, or who live in regions with high transmission of the disease.

- **Search methods**: An information specialist searched PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, WHO Global Index Medicus, Embase, and CINAHL on 12 February 2020 and updated the search on 12 March 2020. WHO provided records from daily searches in Chinese databases up to 16 March 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: Cohort studies, case-control studies, case series, time series, interrupted time series, and mathematical modeling studies that assessed the effect of any type of quarantine to control COVID-19. We also included studies on SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) as indirect evidence for the Coronavirus outbreak.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened 30% of records; a single review author screened the remaining 70%. Two review authors screened all potentially relevant full-text publications independently. One review author extracted data and assessed evidence quality with GRADE, and a second review author.

### Excess mortality in Wuhan city and other parts of China during the three months of the covid-19 outbreak: Findings from nationwide mortality registries [^117T4wac]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

In China, the emergence of a severe acute respiratory syndrome-like atypical pneumonia was first reported during mid-December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province. This led to the identification in early January 2020 of a novel β coronavirus that the World Health Organization subsequently designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes an illness called coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). Coinciding with festivities for the Chinese Lunar New Year in January 2020, SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly to many other provinces in China and then worldwide within a short period. By early July 2020, more than 10 million people worldwide were reported to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, among whom more than 500,000 were reported to have died from covid-19.

In China, unprecedented nationwide measures were introduced and implemented from late January 2020 to contain, suppress, and eliminate the initial outbreak and further transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The nationwide lockdown, first implemented in Wuhan on 23 January 2020, coupled with other measures such as widespread testing, contact tracing, and quarantine of infected people at home and subsequently in purpose-built temporary hospitals, successfully controlled the epidemic by the end of March. Consequently, the lockdown was lifted in all provinces of China from early or mid-April 2020, including Wuhan city.

By the end of March, more than 80,000 people had been infected in China (about 50,000 in Wuhan) and more than 4,600 (about 3,870 in Wuhan) deaths were recorded as being due to covid-19.

### Selected bibliography of recent research in COVID-19 [^116a8yz1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Two moderately sized placebo-controlled trials, with a total of 1,087 participants, showed no benefit of tocilizumab for severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

The results of trials studying the JAK (Janus kinase) inhibitor baricitinib are somewhat clearer. ACTT-2 suggested a modest benefit for baricitinib without glucocorticoids, whereas ACTT-4 suggested no difference between dexamethasone and baricitinib. Trials with a background of glucocorticoids indicated efficacy for baricitinib (COV-BARRIER [A Study of Baricitinib in Participants With COVID-19]) and tofacitinib (STOP-COVID [Study of the Treatment and Outcomes in Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19]).

### Effectiveness of public health measures in reducing the incidence of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and COVID-19 mortality: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Sh7j6]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

The impact of SARS-CoV-2 on global public health and economies has been profound. As of 14 October 2021, there were 239,007,759 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 4,871,841 deaths worldwide.

A variety of containment and mitigation strategies have been adopted to adequately respond to COVID-19, intending to defer major surges of patients in hospitals and protect the most vulnerable people from infection, including the elderly and those with comorbidities. Strategies to achieve these goals are diverse, commonly based on national risk assessments that estimate the number of patients requiring hospital admission and the availability of hospital beds and ventilation support.

Globally, vaccination programs have proved to be safe and effective, saving lives. Yet, most vaccines do not confer 100% protection, and it is not known how they will prevent future transmission of SARS-CoV-2, given emerging variants. The proportion of the population that must be vaccinated against COVID-19 to reach herd immunity greatly depends on future variants. This vaccination threshold varies according to the country and population's response, types of vaccines, groups prioritized for vaccination, and viral mutations, among other factors. Until herd immunity to COVID-19 is reached, public health preventive strategies are likely to remain the first choice measures in disease prevention, particularly in places with a low uptake of COVID-19 vaccination. Measures such as lock…

### Novel coronavirus treatment with ribavirin: Groundwork for an evaluation concerning COVID-19 [^1129Cfen]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Low credibility.

The wide availability and low cost of ribavirin support its potential to significantly impact the treatment of nCoV infections. The challenges in the evaluation of ribavirin efficacy from 2003 during SARS and the 2013 MERS outbreaks led to a summary evaluation of its utility as controversial in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. A large number of clinical studies and retrospective analyses from the 2019-nCoV outbreak will put the controversy of ribavirin efficacy in a broader context.

Both the clinical results and quality of evidence for ribavirin and myriad other treatments will reveal the challenges faced by frontline physicians who treat patients in a medical setting and evaluate prophylaxis for novel high-risk environments formed by large quarantined populations. The critical need for treatment and patient care in outbreak settings, on the frontlines of nCoV outbreaks, will place stress on any medical system and clinical research mechanism. However, controlled clinical studies are underway to permit a prospective evaluation of efficacy, and the government Treatment Plan Edition 5, along with revised and prescribed usage guidelines distributed in China, will assist in the comparability of multicenter experiences in retrospective analyses.

The efforts of clinical research professionals will help both in this outbreak and future outbreaks of nCoV, which will possess unknown sensitivities to our antiviral pharmacopoeia.

### Effects of losartan on patients hospitalized for acute COVID-19: A randomized controlled trial [^113MPkpu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) down-regulates angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, potentially increasing angiotensin II. We hypothesized that losartan, compared to usual care, decreases mortality and is safe in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to evaluate the effect of losartan versus usual care on 28-day mortality in patients hospitalized for acute COVID-19.

- **Methods**: Eligibility criteria included adults admitted for acute COVID-19. Exclusion criteria were hypotension, hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury, and use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors within 7 days. Participants were randomized to receive losartan (25–100 mg/day orally) for the hospital duration or up to 3 months, or were assigned to the control arm (usual care) in 29 hospitals in Canada and France. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospital mortality, organ support, and serious adverse events (SAEs).

- **Results**: The trial was stopped early because of a serious safety concern with losartan. In 341 patients, any SAE and hypotension were significantly higher in the losartan group versus the usual care group (any SAE: 39.8% vs. 27.2%, respectively, P = 0.01; hypotension: 30.4% vs. 15.3%, respectively, P < .001) in both ward and intensive care patients. The 28-day mortality did not differ between losartan (6.5%) and usual care (5.9%) (odds ratio, 1.11 [95% confidence interval, .47–2.64]; p = 0.81), nor did organ dysfunction or secondary outcomes.

- **Conclusions**: Caution is needed in deciding which patients to…

### Antibiotics for the treatment of COVID-19 [^115pqQku]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

The effect of antibiotics with potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties is being investigated in clinical trials as a treatment for COVID-19. The use of antibiotics follows the intention of treating the viral disease and not primarily to treat bacterial co-infections in individuals with COVID-19. A thorough understanding of the evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of antibiotics as antiviral treatments for COVID-19, based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), is required.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotics compared to each other, no treatment, standard of care alone, placebo, or any other active intervention with proven efficacy for the treatment of COVID-19 outpatients and inpatients.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (including MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, medRxiv, CENTRAL), Web of Science, and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies up to 14 June 2021.

- **Selection criteria**: RCTs were included that compared antibiotics with each other, no treatment, standard of care alone, placebo, or another proven intervention for the treatment of people with confirmed COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, treated in the inpatient or outpatient settings. Co-interventions had to be the same in both study arms. We excluded studies comparing antibiotics to other pharmacological interventions with unproven efficacy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We assessed the risk of bias of primary outcomes using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (ROB 2).

### Covid-19 pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients: A promising treatment algorithm in the absence of a disease-specific drug [^116LctMH]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Low credibility.

There is no consensus on the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and modification of immunosuppressive therapy in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). In this study, we examined the clinical outcome of our KTRs with COVID-19, who were treated with a broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory protocol. This protocol is essentially composed of intravenous immunoglobulin with or without tocilizumab in KTRs with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

Among 809 KTRs, 64 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between April 2020 and February 2021 were evaluated. Twenty-nine patients with pneumonia confirmed by chest computed tomography (CCT) were hospitalized. The treatment protocol included high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, favipiravir, enoxaparin, and empirical antibiotics. Patients with pneumonic involvement of more than 25% on CCT, with or without respiratory failure, were given a total of 2g/kg intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy. Non-responders received tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor antibody.

Of the 29 patients with pneumonia, 6 were treated in other hospitals. These six patients did not receive IVIg, and 5 of them deceased. In our center, IVIg treatment was applied to 15 of 23 patients. Seven of them required tocilizumab. Respiratory parameters improved significantly in all but one patient after IVIg ± tocilizumab treatment. The mortality rate was 6.6% in patients who received IVIg therapy and 35.7% in those who did not (p = 0.08). The mortality rate was higher in patients who received treatment in external centers (2.2% vs. 26.3%; p = 0.0073).

### Covid-19 treatments: Then and now [^115DhzUS]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Low credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has evolved over the past three years, and strategies to prevent illness and treat infection have changed over time. As COVID-19 transitions from a pandemic to an endemic infection, widespread non-pharmaceutical interventions such as mask mandates and governmental policies requiring social distancing have given way to more selective strategies for risk mitigation. Monoclonal antibody therapies used for disease prevention and treatment lost utility owing to the emergence of resistant viral variants. Oral antiviral medications have become the mainstay of treatment in non-hospitalized individuals, whereas systemic corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of therapy in those requiring supplemental oxygen. Emerging literature also supports the use of additional immune-modulating therapies in select admitted patients. Importantly, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted both unprecedented research and development of medical interventions while also drawing attention to significant pitfalls in the global response. This review provides a comprehensive update on the prevention and management of COVID-19.

### Surviving sepsis campaign: Guidelines on the management of critically ill adults with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^113SNDxk]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a rapidly spreading illness, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), affecting thousands of people around the world. Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed.

- **Methods**: We formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries. All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form. The panel proposed 53 questions relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU. We conducted a literature search for direct and indirect evidence on the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in the ICU. We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care. We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach and generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations.

- **Results**: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, comprising 4 best practice statements, 9 strong recommendations, and 35 weak recommendations. No recommendation was provided for 6 questions. The topics covered were: (1) infection control, (2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, (3) hemodynamic support, (4) ventilatory support, and (5) COVID-19 therapy.

- **Conclusion**: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations in this critical area.
