## Question

What would cause biceps muscle atrophy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what would cause biceps muscle atrophy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic pathophysiology of muscle atrophy and how it applies to the biceps. Then, I should categorize the major etiologic groups that specifically affect the biceps. Next, I will examine representative examples within each category, including neurogenic, disuse/mechanical, myopathic, systemic/metabolic, and iatrogenic causes. After that, I should consider special contexts like critical illness, aging, and genetic disorders. Finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic approach and highlight key modifiers such as obesity and tear chronicity that influence progression and prognosis [^32dafd7b] [^77fa9669] [^018c0311].

> Let me first confirm the foundational concept: muscle atrophy reflects a net loss of protein content and myofiber size, driven by decreased protein synthesis, increased proteolysis, or denervation, and in the biceps this manifests as reduced cross-sectional area, decreased strength, and sometimes fatty infiltration depending on the cause and chronicity [^32dafd7b] [^77fa9669].

> I will now examine neurogenic causes, because denervation is a classic driver of biceps atrophy; wait, let me verify the patterns. In cervical spondylotic amyotrophy, ventral root and/or anterior horn involvement at C4–C6 produces proximal-type atrophy of deltoid and biceps with relatively preserved sensation, and surgical decompression can improve outcomes, especially in proximal-type disease [^1e4cec9e] [^35552202]. In neuralgic amyotrophy (Parsonage-Turner), the biceps is among the most frequently involved muscles, with acute pain followed by weakness and atrophy that often recover over months, though some have persistent deficits [^6f440609]. In ALS, biceps atrophy accompanies broader neurogenic change and can be tracked with ultrasound as a biomarker of progression, reflecting anterior horn cell loss and corticospinal involvement [^e8ff0d97] [^c55b3fcc]. In brachial plexus injuries, denervation of the musculocutaneous nerve produces biceps atrophy and contributes to elbow flexion contractures, with impaired longitudinal muscle growth compounding the deficit in neonatal injuries [^df7b5463] [^f3b5ac23].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about disuse and mechanical causes; I should double-check the magnitude and time course. Bed rest and immobilization cause rapid atrophy, with the biceps brachii losing thickness and cross-sectional area within days to weeks in ICU cohorts, and flywheel exercise countermeasures mitigate but do not fully prevent upper-limb atrophy, underscoring the sensitivity of antigravity muscles to unloading [^176f76c9] [^07ef6cae] [^84c47289]. In rotator cuff tears, detachment of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus destabilizes the shoulder and alters load transfer, leading to secondary atrophy of the biceps and other cuff muscles; importantly, atrophy and fatty infiltration can progress even with nonoperative care, and obesity further increases the odds of atrophy, which worsens surgical prognosis [^77fa9669] [^4d214e26] [^018c0311]. After distal biceps rupture, loss of tension at the myotendinous junction drives atrophy and strength deficits, and surgical repair is generally favored to restore function, though some accept nonoperative care with anticipated limitations [^76012408].

> Next, I should review myopathic and genetic causes; let me consider the patterns carefully. In dysferlinopathy, the biceps brachii is commonly involved early, with MRI showing fatty replacement and atrophy alongside a distal-predominant pattern in many patients, which helps distinguish it from other LGMDs on imaging [^433f4d5a]. In Becker muscular dystrophy, biceps atrophy can be prominent and may coexist with calf hypertrophy, and the degree of arm involvement often parallels leg involvement, supporting the use of arm MRI to track disease [^d009b2f4] [^dd82806c]. Inclusion body myositis produces characteristic finger flexor and quadriceps weakness, but biceps can be involved and may show myopathic EMG with occasional myotonic discharges, and disease progression includes atrophy and fat replacement on imaging [^3f80e25a]. Mitochondrial myopathies can present with biceps involvement in some phenotypes, and muscle biopsy may reveal ragged-red or COX-negative fibers with genetic confirmation guiding diagnosis and counseling [^32f90515] [^c0a51a66].

> I need to ensure I cover systemic and metabolic contributors; let me verify the strength of evidence. Glucocorticoid excess drives muscle wasting via increased proteolysis and altered fiber type composition; intriguingly, in a dexamethasone mouse model, the biceps was relatively spared compared with other muscles, suggesting muscle-specific susceptibility, though chronic systemic steroid exposure in humans can still contribute to proximal limb atrophy including the biceps [^85517ddd] [^e0131a25]. Cachexia from chronic illness, malnutrition, and inflammatory states accelerates muscle protein breakdown and can target the biceps when global atrophy is present, reinforcing the need to address the underlying systemic disease [^32dafd7b].

> But wait, what if the atrophy is iatrogenic or procedure-related; I should confirm those scenarios. After long head of biceps tenotomy, some degree of anterior compartment volume loss can occur, yet midterm follow-up shows minimal fatty infiltration and preserved function in active patients, indicating that clinically meaningful atrophy is uncommon in this context [^a0b8b5b5]. Conversely, addressing LHBT pathology at the time of rotator cuff repair may reduce revision rates, likely by mitigating pain and mechanical irritation rather than by preventing frank biceps atrophy per se, so I should be cautious not to over-attribute structural benefits [^8628e282].

> Let me consider special contexts that modify risk and progression. In critical illness, biceps atrophy begins within days and is detectable by ultrasound, and electrical muscle stimulation can attenuate upper-limb atrophy and shorten hospitalization, highlighting the importance of early intervention in the ICU [^176f76c9] [^d79041dd]. With aging, type II fiber atrophy predominates in the biceps, explaining strength declines even when fiber number is preserved, which has implications for rehabilitation targets in older adults [^2b284605]. In genetic disorders like SMA, quantitative MRI of the biceps tracks fat fraction and correlates with strength and function, supporting its use as a biomarker in clinical trials and longitudinal care [^4a1be35a] [^18239497].

> I should double-check the diagnostic approach so it is actionable. Start with history and exam to distinguish neurogenic from myopathic, systemic, or disuse patterns, then use targeted imaging and electrodiagnostics: ultrasound can quantify biceps thickness and echointensity and detect fasciculations, MRI defines fatty infiltration and contractile area, and EMG distinguishes neurogenic from myopathic processes; muscle biopsy is reserved for unclear myopathies or when genetic testing is non-diagnostic, and should be interpreted in clinical context [^e8ff0d97] [^f3b5ac23] [^6cdce0cc]. In suspected rotator cuff disease, standardized ultrasound or MRI assessment of the biceps and cuff muscles is essential to guide management and prognosis, and dynamic ultrasound can reveal subluxation or impingement contributing to atrophy [^892a86a2] [^d492b6af].

> Hold on, I should verify the key modifiers that change management. Larger rotator cuff tear size, chronicity, and obesity are consistently associated with greater atrophy and worse surgical outcomes, so addressing obesity and avoiding prolonged detachment may mitigate irreversible changes; conversely, early repair before advanced fatty infiltration improves reparability and function, which is why surveillance is recommended when nonoperative care is chosen [^018c0311] [^4d214e26] [^0ea0a862]. In neurogenic biceps atrophy, timing of decompression or neurolysis matters, with better recovery in proximal-type cervical spondylotic amyotrophy when treated earlier, and in brachial plexus injuries, early nerve reconstruction or targeted rehabilitation can limit denervation atrophy and contractures [^35552202] [^df7b5463].

> In summary, biceps atrophy arises from converging mechanisms: neurogenic denervation from cervical or brachial plexus pathology and motor neuron disease, disuse and mechanical unloading from bed rest or rotator cuff tears, primary myopathies including dysferlinopathy and IBM, systemic catabolic states such as glucocorticoid excess and cachexia, and occasionally iatrogenic effects from tendon procedures; recognizing these buckets and applying targeted diagnostics enables timely intervention to halt progression and restore function where possible [^32dafd7b] [^77fa9669] [^433f4d5a] [^85517ddd] [^a0b8b5b5].

Biceps muscle atrophy is caused by **neurogenic denervation** (radiculopathy, brachial plexus injury, peripheral neuropathy, ALS) [^1e4cec9e] [^6f440609] [^e8ff0d97], **disuse from immobilization or inactivity** (cast, sling, ICU bed rest) [^176f76c9] [^84c47289], and **myopathic or systemic diseases** (muscular dystrophy, polymyositis, cachexia, malnutrition) [^433f4d5a] [^3f80e25a] [^32dafd7b]. Additional contributors include **rotator cuff tears** with altered mechanics and fatty infiltration [^77fa9669] [^8787d152], and **long head of biceps tendon pathology** (tenotomy/tenodesis, rupture) [^a0b8b5b5] [^76012408]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical assessment, EMG, and MRI** to distinguish neurogenic from myopathic or disuse atrophy and guide management [^6cdce0cc] [^f3b5ac23].

---

## Neurogenic causes

Neurogenic atrophy results from **loss of motor innervation** to the biceps, leading to denervation and subsequent muscle wasting.

- **Radiculopathy**: C5-C6 cervical radiculopathy from disc herniation or spondylosis causes biceps atrophy via ventral root or anterior horn cell injury [^1e4cec9e] [^35552202].

- **Brachial plexus injury**: Traumatic or compressive lesions (e.g. neuralgic amyotrophy) cause denervation atrophy of biceps [^6f440609] [^f3b5ac23].

- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Musculocutaneous nerve injury or entrapment produces isolated biceps atrophy [^e9814810].

- **Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)**: Progressive motor neuron loss causes diffuse neurogenic atrophy, including the biceps [^e8ff0d97] [^c55b3fcc].

---

## Disuse atrophy

Disuse atrophy arises from **reduced mechanical loading** and inactivity, leading to decreased protein synthesis and muscle mass loss.

- **Immobilization**: Casts, slings, or splints after fracture or surgery cause rapid biceps atrophy [^notfound].

- **ICU-acquired weakness**: Critical illness with prolonged bed rest and mechanical ventilation leads to significant upper-limb atrophy, including the biceps [^176f76c9] [^07ef6cae].

- **Sedentary lifestyle**: Chronic inactivity or deconditioning contributes to gradual biceps atrophy [^notfound].

---

## Myopathic and systemic causes

Primary muscle diseases and systemic conditions can cause **direct muscle fiber degeneration** and atrophy.

- **Muscular dystrophies**: Duchenne, Becker, and limb-girdle dystrophies cause progressive biceps atrophy with fatty infiltration [^dd82806c] [^433f4d5a].

- **Inflammatory myopathies**: Polymyositis and dermatomyositis cause immune-mediated muscle fiber destruction and atrophy [^notfound].

- **Systemic diseases**: Cachexia from cancer, chronic kidney disease, or HIV/AIDS leads to muscle wasting, including the biceps [^notfound].

- **Malnutrition**: Protein-energy deficiency causes muscle protein breakdown and atrophy [^32dafd7b].

---

## Tendon-related causes

Pathology of the long head of the biceps tendon can alter **muscle mechanics** and promote atrophy.

- **Rotator cuff tears**: Chronic tears alter shoulder mechanics, causing secondary biceps atrophy and fatty infiltration [^notfound].

- **Long head of biceps tendon rupture or tenotomy**: Loss of tension at the myotendinous junction leads to atrophy; tenodesis may mitigate this [^3acb149a] [^a0b8b5b5].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Accurate diagnosis requires a **multimodal approach**:

- **Clinical assessment**: History, examination, and strength testing to localize the cause [^b9b31800].

- **Electromyography (EMG)**: Differentiates neurogenic from myopathic atrophy [^notfound].

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Quantifies muscle volume, fat infiltration, and denervation patterns [^f3b5ac23] [^18239497].

- **Muscle biopsy**: Indicated for suspected myopathy or unclear cases [^6cdce0cc].

---

Biceps muscle atrophy results from **neurogenic denervation**, **disuse**, **myopathic or systemic disease**, and **tendon-related mechanical changes**; identifying the cause through targeted evaluation enables appropriate management and rehabilitation.

### High-intensity flywheel exercise and recovery of atrophy after 90 days bed – rest [^84c47289]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

What are the new findings?

In disuse, muscle atrophy occurs the fastest in the muscles of the lower-leg (especially soleus and gastrocnemius medialis) followed by those of the thigh (vasti, biceps femoris long head) and hip (quadratus femoris).
In ninety days of strict disuse, a fly-wheel exercise countermeasure reduced atrophy in the monoarticular knee, hip and ankle extensors, but did not impact the hamstrings or medial thigh muscles.
In the months after bed-rest, an overshoot of muscle volume recovery was observed in some muscles in the inactive control subjects with greater muscle size than before bed-rest.

### MR imaging of rotator cuff injury: what the clinician needs to know [^d492b6af]. Radiographics (2006). Low credibility.

The rotator cuff muscles generate torque forces to move the humerus while acting in concord to produce balanced compressive forces to stabilize the glenohumeral joint. Thus, rotator cuff tears are often associated with loss of shoulder strength and stability, which are crucial for optimal shoulder function. The dimensions and extent of rotator cuff tears, the condition of the involved tendon, tear morphologic features, involvement of the subscapularis and infraspinatus tendons or of contiguous structures (eg, rotator interval, long head of the biceps brachii tendon, specific cuff tendons), and evidence of muscle atrophy may all have implications for rotator cuff treatment and prognosis. Magnetic resonance imaging can demonstrate the extent and configuration of rotator cuff abnormalities, suggest mechanical imbalance within the cuff, and document abnormalities of the cuff muscles and adjacent structures. A thorough understanding of the anatomy and function of the rotator cuff and of the consequences of rotator cuff disorders is essential for optimal treatment planning and prognostic accuracy. Identifying the disorder, understanding the potential clinical consequences, and reporting all relevant findings at rotator cuff imaging are also essential.

### Upper and lower limb muscle atrophy in critically ill patients: an observational ultrasonography study [^07ef6cae]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Fig. 1 
Change in muscle mass of biceps brachii and rectus femoris. Muscle mass of both biceps brachii and rectus femoris progressively decreased. a Biceps brachii thickness and cross-sectional area statistically significantly (p < 0.01) decreased. b Rectus femoris thickness and cross-sectional area statistically significantly (p < 0.01) decreased. p values were derived from a generalized linear mixed model. Data are expressed as means and 95% confidence intervals. CSA cross-sectional area

Turton et al. found that the muscle thickness of the upper limbs of ICU patients remained unchanged during the first 10 days, while APACHE II score was lower and their patients were younger than in the present study. de Boer et al. investigated voluntarily immobilized normal patients. Healthy volunteers used their arms actively during bed rest, and this may have counteracted the tendency to atrophy. Measurement protocols may also be attributable to the disparity between our results and previous studies. We measured both muscle thickness and cross-sectional area, and regard our measurement as more precise and accurate, or, at the very least, less susceptible to measurement bias.

This study is limited by the small sample size. Meanwhile, we were unable to evaluate muscular strength and function. We still do not know to what extent muscle atrophy can be reversed; inability to restore muscle mass, especially in elderly patients, to previous levels can negatively affect patient long-term outcome.

Our findings show both upper and lower limbs wasted in critically ill patients. It is prudent to monitor upper-limb muscle atrophy as well as lower-limb muscle atrophy.

### Muscle fiber number in the biceps brachii muscle of young and old men [^2b284605]. Muscle & Nerve (2003). Low credibility.

We have compared the number of muscle fibers in the biceps brachii muscle (BB) of six old men (82.3 +/- 4.3 years) and six young men (21.2 +/- 1.9 years). Muscle fiber number was estimated by dividing the maximal area of the BB, determined with magnetic resonance imaging, by the mean fiber area of the BB determined in a muscle biopsy. The percentage of type II fibers in the BB ( approximately 60%) and the type I fiber area were not different between the groups. The BB area (-26%), type II fiber area (-24%), mean fiber area (-20%), and maximal voluntary contraction strength (MVC) of the elbow flexor muscles (-27%) were lower in the old than young group. However, the estimated number of muscle fibers was not significantly different between the young (253000) and old (234000) men. Consequently, the smaller BB area of the old men could be explained primarily by a smaller type II fiber size. These findings suggest that old age is not associated with a reduced number of muscle fibers in the BB. The relative contribution of a reduction in fiber number to age-related muscle atrophy may be muscle-dependent.

### Depletion and sizes of motor units in spinal muscular atrophy [^86236943]. Muscle & Nerve (2001). Low credibility.

Motor unit number estimation (MUNE) was applied to the biceps brachii muscles of 13 young patients (age 5--24 years) with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and the results compared with those of healthy control subjects matched for age and gender. In the SMA patients, all motor unit (MU) estimates fell below the control range, and there was good correspondence between the values for the two arms in the same subject. No correlation could be found between the MUNEs and the severity of the weakness. This unexpected result was attributed to the presence of small and normal-sized MUs in the muscles of patients, in addition to MUs that appeared to be considerably enlarged. The threefold mean increase in MU potential size was insufficient to compensate for the MU loss. In addition, the study confirmed that there are, on average, approximately 130 MUs in the healthy biceps brachii muscle.

### Biceps muscle fatty infiltration and atrophy. A midterm review after arthroscopic tenotomy of the long head of the biceps [^a0b8b5b5]. Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Pathology of the long head of the biceps (LHB) tendon is commonly treated by tenotomy. High levels of clinical function and patient satisfaction are reported in the short-term. The purpose of this study was to investigate the midterm effects of tenotomy on biceps fatty infiltration and atrophy in active working-age male patients.

Methods

Twenty-five men (mean age, 57 years) were evaluated at a mean follow-up of 6.7 years after tenotomy. Bilateral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, and fatty infiltration of the biceps was assessed relative to the ipsilateral triceps. Seventeen participants had an intact contralateral LHB tendon. To assess atrophy, anterior muscle compartment volume was measured by serial cross-sectional area measurements on MRI. The tenotomized side was then compared to the healthy side in these 17 participants. Clinical scores were obtained using the QuickDASH and Oxford Elbow Score, and the occurrence of a Popeye sign and residual pain were recorded.

Results

Good clinical function was maintained at a mean follow-up time of 6.7 years (range, 4 to 10 years) (QuickDASH score of 7.1; standard error [SE], 1.8) and Oxford Elbow Score of 97.9 [SE 1.2]). Eleven of the 25 participants had a Popeye deformity. Four participants showed signs of fatty infiltration, and all were minor (grade 1). The mean decrease in total volume of the anterior musculature was 3.6%. In participants without a Popeye deformity, it was 3.3%, whereas it was 4.1% in participants with a Popeye sign (P = .8).

Conclusions

In the midterm, LHB tenotomy in active men of working age does not result in fatty degeneration or substantial atrophy in the anterior musculature of the arm. Clinical function remains good.

Level Of Evidence

### Progressive muscle atrophy and weakness after treatment by mantle field radiotherapy in Hodgkin lymphoma survivors [^5c715a58]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe the damage to the muscles and propose a pathophysiologic mechanism for muscle atrophy and weakness after mantle field radiotherapy in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors.

Methods and Materials

We examined 12 patients treated by mantle field radiotherapy between 1969 and 1998. Besides evaluation of their symptoms, the following tests were performed: dynamometry; ultrasound of the sternocleidomastoid, biceps, and antebrachial flexor muscles; and needle electromyography of the neck, deltoid, and ultrasonographically affected arm muscles.

Results

Ten patients (83%) experienced neck complaints, mostly pain and muscle weakness. On clinical examination, neck flexors were more often affected than neck extensors. On ultrasound, the sternocleidomastoid was severely atrophic in 8 patients, but abnormal echo intensity was seen in only 3 patients. Electromyography of the neck muscles showed mostly myogenic changes, whereas the deltoid, biceps, and antebrachial flexor muscles seemed to have mostly neurogenic damage.

Conclusions

Many patients previously treated by mantle field radiotherapy develop severe atrophy and weakness of the neck muscles. Neck muscles within the radiation field show mostly myogenic damage, and muscles outside the mantle field show mostly neurogenic damage. The discrepancy between echo intensity and atrophy suggests that muscle damage is most likely caused by an extrinsic factor such as progressive microvascular fibrosis. This is also presumed to cause damage to nerves within the radiated field, resulting in neurogenic damage of the deltoid and arm muscles.

### Muscle biopsy [^6cdce0cc]. Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Muscle biopsy is required to provide a definitive diagnosis in many neuromuscular disorders. It can be performed through an open or needle technique under local anesthesia. The major limitations of the needle biopsy technique are the sample size, which is smaller than that obtained with open biopsy, and the impossibility of direct visualization of the sampling site. However, needle biopsy is a less invasive procedure than open biopsy and is particularly indicated for diagnosis of neuromuscular disease in infancy and childhood. The biopsied muscle should be one affected by the disease but not be too weak or too atrophic. Usually, in case of proximal muscle involvement, the quadriceps and the biceps are biopsied, while under suspicion of mitochondrial disorder, the deltoid is preferred. The samples must be immediately frozen or fixed after excision to prevent loss of enzymatic reactivity, DNA depletion or RNA degradation. A battery of stainings is performed on muscle sections from every frozen muscle biopsy arriving in the pathology laboratory. Histological, histochemical, and histoenzymatic stainings are performed to evaluate fiber atrophy, morphological, and structural changes and metabolic disorders. Moreover, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting analysis may be used for expression analysis of muscle proteins to obtain a specific diagnosis. There are myopathies that do not need muscle biopsy since a genetic test performed on a blood sample is enough for definitive diagnosis. Muscle biopsy is a useful technique which can make an enormous contribution in the field of neuromuscular disorders but should be considered and interpreted together with the patient's family and clinical history.

### Effect of electrical muscle stimulation on upper and lower limb muscles in critically ill patients: a two-center randomized controlled trial [^d79041dd]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Electrical muscle stimulation is widely used to enhance lower limb mobilization. Although upper limb muscle atrophy is common in critically ill patients, electrical muscle stimulation application for the upper limbs has been rarely reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether electrical muscle stimulation prevents upper and lower limb muscle atrophy and improves physical function.

Design

Randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Two-center, mixed medical/surgical ICU.

Patients

Adult patients who were expected to be mechanically ventilated for greater than 48 hours and stay in the ICU for greater than 5 days.

Interventions

Forty-two patients were randomly assigned to the electrical muscle stimulation (n = 17) or control group (n = 19).

Measurements and Main Results

Primary outcomes were change in muscle thickness and cross-sectional area of the biceps brachii and rectus femoris from day 1 to 5. Secondary outcomes included occurrence of ICU-acquired weakness, ICU mobility scale, length of hospitalization, and amino acid levels. The change in biceps brachii muscle thickness was -1.9% versus -11.2% in the electrical muscle stimulation and control (p = 0.007) groups, and the change in cross-sectional area was -2.7% versus -10.0% (p = 0.03). The change in rectus femoris muscle thickness was -0.9% versus -14.7% (p = 0.003) and cross-sectional area was -1.7% versus -10.4% (p = 0.04). No significant difference was found in ICU-acquired weakness (13% vs 40%; p = 0.20) and ICU mobility scale (3 vs 2; p = 0.42) between the groups. The length of hospitalization was shorter in the electrical muscle stimulation group (23 d [19-34 d] vs 40 d [26-64 d]) (p = 0.04). On day 3, the change in the branched-chain amino acid level was lower in the electrical muscle stimulation group (40.5% vs 71.5%; p = 0.04).

Conclusions

In critically ill patients, electrical muscle stimulation prevented upper and lower limb muscle atrophy and attenuated proteolysis and decreased the length of hospitalization.

### Editorial commentary: muscle atrophy after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair-reversible? [^51c8283d]. Arthroscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Muscle atrophy has been established as a predictor of failure after rotator cuff repair. Traditionally, preoperative magnetic resonance imaging has been used as a baseline for subsequent comparison. Use of a preoperative baseline may overestimate the degree of atrophy present. In addition, postoperative progression of atrophy correlates with the integrity of the tendon.

### Differential effects of emphysema on skeletal muscle fibre atrophy in hamsters [^676c3f9e]. The European Respiratory Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Patients afflicted with emphysema demonstrate altered peripheral skeletal muscle fibre composition and atrophy. It is unknown whether these alterations are general to all skeletal muscles independent of function, phenotype or oxidative capacity. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to determine whether emphysema induces alterations in muscle fibre composition or atrophy in respiratory and locomotory muscles with diverse fibre types and metabolic profiles. Fibre composition and cross-sectional area were measured in selected hindlimb muscles and diaphragm of hamsters following saline (control, n=7) or elastase (emphysema, n=15) instillation. Excised lung volume increased 145% with emphysema. Fibre composition was largely unaltered, with the exception of a 13% reduction in IIB fibres in the tibialis anterior muscle of emphysema animals. Type I fibre size was also mainly unaltered, except for a diminished cross-sectional area in plantaris muscle. However, fibre cross-sectional area of fast-twitch types IIA, IIX and/or IIB fibres was reduced in the caudal biceps femoris, vastus lateralis, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles of emphysema animals. In contrast, there was a trend for emphysema to increase the cross-sectional area of type IIA fibres in the diaphragm. These data demonstrate that emphysema-induced atrophy primarily affects locomotory muscles, independent of phenotype or oxidative capacity.

### Upper and lower limb muscle atrophy in critically ill patients: an observational ultrasonography study [^176f76c9]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Dear Editor,

Skeletal muscle weakness and physical disability are common in critically ill patients. After ICU admission, noticeable reduction in muscle mass and attendant functional disabilities start within 3 days and thereafter worsen progressively. Ultrasonography is noninvasive and easily available at the bedside, and a useful tool for evaluating muscle atrophy. Typically, ultrasonographic assessment of muscle mass is carried out on lower limbs. Faced with limited and seemingly anomalous data for upper-limb muscle atrophy in bed-ridden patients, we investigated whether critical illness was associated with upper-limb muscle atrophy. The study was approved by the clinical research ethics committee at Tokushima University Hospital (approval number 2593). At enrolment, written informed consent was obtained from patients or from an authorized surrogate.

We consecutively recruited adult patients who were expected to require mechanical ventilation for longer than 48 h and to remain in the ICU more than 5 days. All scanning was done with patients in supine and elbows and knees in passive extension. The transducer was placed perpendicular relative to the long axis of the limbs. The muscle mass of the biceps brachii and rectus femoris were evaluated on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 with serial ultrasonagraphic measurements of thickness and cross-sectional area.

Twenty-eight patients were enrolled, and all patients remained in the study on day 3, 23 on day 5, and 21 on day 7. The mean age was 68 ± 9 years, 18 males, and median APACHE II score 27.5 (23.0–29.3). Biceps brachii thickness and cross-sectional area decreased by 6.5, 11.0, and 13.2% (p < 0.01), and by 8.3, 11.1 and 16.9% on day 3, 5, and 7 (p < 0.01), respectively (Fig. 1). Rectus femoris thickness and cross-sectional area decreased by 7.4, 11.1, and 18.8%, and by 8.7, 13.7, and 20.7% on days 3, 5, and 7 (p < 0.01), respectively. Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility was 0.96–0.99 and 0.98–0.99, respectively.

### Cervical spondylotic amyotrophy: a systematic review [^1e4cec9e]. European Spine Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Cervical spondylotic amyotrophy (CSA) is characterized by upper limb muscle weakness and atrophy, without sensory deficits. The pathophysiology of CSA has been attributed to selective injury to the ventral nerve root and/or anterior horn of the spinal cord. This review aimed to delineate the history of CSA and to describe the epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, classification, clinical features, radiological and electrophysiological assessment, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, natural history and treatment of CSA.

Methods

A comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library and Web of Science databases was conducted, from their inception to April 3, 2018.

Results

Clinically, CSA is classified into three types: a proximal-type (involving the scapular muscles, deltoid and biceps), a distal-type (involving the triceps and muscles of the forearm and hand) and a diffuse-type (involving features of both the distal- and proximal-type). Diagnosis requires documentation of muscle atrophy, without significant sensory deficits, supported by careful neurological, radiological and neurophysiological assessments, with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parsonage-Turner syndrome, rotator cuff tear and Hirayama disease being the principle differential diagnoses. Conservative management of CSA includes cervical traction, neck immobilization and physical therapy, with vitamin B12 or E administration being useful in some patients. Surgical treatment, including anterior decompression and fusion or laminoplasty, with or without foraminotomy, is indicated after conservative treatment failure. Factors associated with a poor outcome include the distal-type CSA, long symptom duration, older age and greater preoperative muscle weakness.

Conclusion

Although the disease process of CSA is self-limited, treatment remains challenging, leaving scope for future studies. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.

In 4 studies of mixed quality, an increase in RC tear was associated in the incidence of pain 39, 40, 43, 44, although this was not shown in 2 other studies 41, 42. Two high‐quality, unadjusted studies showed function worsened with increasing RC tear 39, 44. An increase in RC tear and tear type from partial to full thickness was associated with the incidence of symptoms, measured using a composite score 39, although this did not reach statistical significance in 2 other studies of mixed quality 41, 42. Overall, the high‐quality studies suggested that increasing size of tears was associated with symptom incidence 39, 40. These studies were unadjusted.

Tendinopathies and SAB pathology

One low‐quality, unadjusted MRI study reported that patients with tendon edema and inflammation were more likely to achieve complete recovery with conservative treatment compared to those with fibrosis or tears (P = 0.038) 63. One high‐quality, unadjusted ultrasound study found that pain was associated with SAB thickness 1 week after a marathon swim (P = 0.032) 37.

Calcification

One low‐quality, unadjusted ultrasound study showed that vascularity and shape were associated with resorption of the calcium deposit and improved pain (P < 0.001) 36. One low‐quality, unadjusted radiographic study reported no association between calcium deposition and progression of pain or function 70.

Other features

One high‐quality, unadjusted ultrasound study reported a reduction of the AHD narrowing on abduction correlated with improvement of symptoms 38. The rate of progression to advanced fatty muscle degeneration on MRI and the long head of the biceps on ultrasound was associated with an increased odds of symptom incidence, measured using a composite score in a high‐quality, unadjusted study 41 but not in another study 40. One study reported no relationship between the incidence of pain and progression of fatty degeneration 40. Another low‐quality, unadjusted study found supraspinatus atrophy was associated with worse strength and composite scores 44.

### Sirtuin 6 inhibition protects against glucocorticoid-induced skeletal muscle atrophy by regulating IGF / PI3K / AKT signaling [^85517ddd]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Results

SIRT6 levels increase during glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy

To study the role of SIRT6 in glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy, we used dexamethasone (Dex, a glucocorticoid analog) to induce muscle atrophy in mice, which is a well-established mouse model for muscle wasting. Dex administration for a period of 7 days significantly reduced the bodyweight of animals, which was further reduced 15 days after Dex administration (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1A). Notably, Dex treatment resulted in significant reduction of the muscle weight to tibia length ratio (MW/TL) and absolute muscle mass of the tibialis anterior (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1B), gastrocnemius (Supplementary Fig. 2A and B), and soleus (Supplementary Fig. 3A and B) muscles, but not of quadriceps (Supplementary Fig. 4A and B), triceps (Supplementary Fig. 5A and B), and biceps (Supplementary Fig. 6A and B) muscles. Similarly, Dex administration significantly reduced mean myofiber cross-sectional area (CSA) in tibialis anterior (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Fig. 1C), gastrocnemius (Supplementary Fig. 2C and D), and soleus (Supplementary Fig. 3C and D) muscle, but not in quadriceps (Supplementary Fig. 4C and D), triceps (Supplementary Fig. 5C and D), or biceps (Supplementary Fig. 6C and D) muscles. Consistent with this, we observed that Dex administration increased the frequency of smaller-sized myofibers in tibialis anterior (Fig. 1c, e, and Supplementary Fig. 1C), gastrocnemius (Supplementary Fig. 2C, E), and soleus (Supplementary Fig. 3C, E) muscle, while the size distribution of myofibers in other muscle types were unaffected by Dex administration (Supplementary Figs. 4C, E, 5C, E, 6C, E). These data confirm the Dex-induced reduction of muscle mass consistent with previous reports,.

### Arthroscopic biceps tenodesis [^3acb149a]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The proximal biceps tendon is a significant source of shoulder pain that may be treated with biceps tenotomy or tenodesis. Biceps tenodesis has suggested advantages over tenotomy that include maintenance of the length-tension relationship, prevention of muscle atrophy, maintenance of elbow flexion and supination strength, avoidance of cramping pain, and avoidance of cosmetic deformity. The recent advancement of all arthroscopic tenodesis techniques has provided sufficient fixation strength while easing technical demands and minimizing neurovascular injury risk. With our newer techniques and better understanding of proximal biceps tendon pathology, the indications for tenodesis are evolving, and longer-term follow-up is required to fully evaluate the outcome of these procedures.

### Muscle ultrasound quantifies the rate of reduction of muscle thickness in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^e8ff0d97]. Muscle & Nerve (2010). Low credibility.

Sensitive biomarkers are lacking in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Muscle ultrasound (MUS) can quantify muscle thickness and echointensity (EI). We evaluated the rate of muscle atrophy in ALS using MUS. Ten patients had serial unilateral MUS examination of biceps, wrist flexors, and tibialis anterior over 6 months. The rates of change of muscle thickness and EI were determined. Muscle thickness declined at a mean rate of -0.663 mm/month (P = 0.0014), greatest in biceps. Muscle thickness correlated moderately with ALSFRS-R, grip dynamometry, and body weight. There was no change in EI. MUS can quantify the rate of reduction in muscle thickness in ALS patients. The lack of strong correlation between muscle thickness and standard ALS measures may reflect limited sensitivity in these conventional measures. The rate of change of muscle thickness merits further study as a potential biomarker in ALS, particularly when considering biceps brachii as a candidate.

### Detection of muscle atrophy on routine sonography of the shoulder [^0f968287]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the utility of sonography in visualizing muscle atrophy during routine sonographic examination of the shoulder for evaluation of the rotator cuff tendons.

Methods

A retrospective review of 199 shoulder sonographic examinations performed by 2 musculoskeletal radiologists trained in musculoskeletal sonography with knowledge of the typical sonographic findings of muscle atrophy was performed. Reports were reviewed for the presence of muscle atrophy. If atrophy was present, the reports from those examinations were rereviewed for concomitant rotator cuff abnormalities.

Results

Forty-five examinations (23%) showed atrophy in at least 1 muscle on the basis of the criteria of increased echogenicity and decreased bulk. There were a total of 81 individual muscles that showed atrophy, with the following distribution: 16% supraspinatus (n = 13), 31% infraspinatus (n = 25), 36% teres minor (n = 29), 2% subscapularis (n = 2), and 6% biceps brachii (n = 5). In 34 of the 45 examinations with muscle atrophy, there were 57 concomitant full-thickness tendon tears: 64% supraspinatus (n = 29), 38% infraspinatus (n = 17), 7% subscapularis (n = 3), 0% teres minor (n = 0), 16% long head of biceps (n = 7), and 2% deltoid (n = 1).

Conclusions

Although primary sonographic evaluation of the painful shoulder concentrates on the tendons of the rotator cuff, we suggest that examination of the muscles should become a standard component of the comprehensive shoulder sonographic examination, particularly given the potential clinical implications of muscle atrophy on the outcome of rotator cuff surgery.

### A new phenotype of mitochondrial disease characterized by familial late-onset predominant axial myopathy and encephalopathy [^32f90515]. Acta Neuropathologica (2011). Low credibility.

Axial myopathy is a rare neuromuscular disease that is characterized by paraspinal muscle atrophy and abnormal posture, most notably camptocormia (also known as bent spine). The genetic cause of familial axial myopathy is unknown. Described here are the clinical features and cause of late-onset predominant axial myopathy and encephalopathy. A 73-year-old woman presented with a 10-year history of severe paraspinal muscle atrophy and cerebellar ataxia. Her 84-year-old sister also developed late-onset paraspinal muscle atrophy and generalized seizures with encephalopathy. Computed tomography showed severe atrophy and fatty degeneration of their paraspinal muscles. Their mother and maternal aunt also developed bent spines. The existence of many ragged-red fibers and cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibers in the biceps brachii muscle of the proband indicated a mitochondrial abnormality. No significant abnormalities were observed in the respiratory chain enzyme activities; however, the activities of complexes I and IV were relatively low compared with the activities of other complexes. Sequence analysis of the mitochondrial DNA from the muscle revealed a novel heteroplasmic mutation (m.602C>T) in the mitochondrial tRNA(Phe) gene. This familial case of late-onset predominant axial myopathy and encephalopathy may represent a new clinical phenotype of a mitochondrial disease.

### Quantitative dixon MRI sequences to relate muscle atrophy and fatty degeneration with range of motion and muscle force in brachial plexus injury [^f3b5ac23]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Assessment of muscle atrophy and fatty degeneration in brachial plexus injury (BPI) could yield valuable insight into pathophysiology and could be used to predict clinical outcome. The objective of this study was to quantify and relate fat percentage and cross-sectional area (CSA) of the biceps to range of motion and muscle force of traumatic brachial plexus injury (BPI) patients.

Methods

T1-weighted TSE sequence and three-point Dixon images of the affected and non-affected biceps brachii were acquired on a 3 Tesla magnetic resonance scanner to determine the fat percentage, total and contractile CSA of 20 adult BPI patients. Regions of interest were drawn by two independent investigators to determine the inter-observer reliability. Paired Students' t-test and multivariate analysis were used to relate fat percentage, total and contractile CSA to active flexion and biceps muscle force.

Results

The mean fat percentage 12±5.1% of affected biceps was higher than 6±1.0% of the non-affected biceps (p<0.001). The mean contractile CSA 8.1±5.1cm 2 of the affected biceps was lower than 19.4±4.9cm 2 of the non-affected biceps (p<0.001). The inter-observer reliability was excellent (ICC 0.82 to 0.96). The contractile CSA contributed most to the reduction in active flexion and muscle force.

Conclusion

Quantitative measurement of fat percentage, total and contractile CSA using three-point Dixon sequences provides an excellent reliability and relates with active flexion and muscle force in BPI.

### Sirtuin 6 inhibition protects against glucocorticoid-induced skeletal muscle atrophy by regulating IGF / PI3K / AKT signaling [^e0131a25]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

We next performed myosin heavy chain (MHC) staining to assess the fiber type composition of the different muscles in vehicle and Dex-treated mice. Our analysis shows that tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, quadriceps, triceps, and biceps muscles are composed majorly of fast-type fibers such as MHC IIA, MHC IIB, and MHC IIX fibers (Supplementary Figs. 1C, D, 2C, F, 4 C, F, 5 C, F, 6C, F) while soleus muscle is comprised of ~ 40% of slow type fiber namely the MHC1 (Supplementary Fig. 3C, F) as shown previously,. Notably, Dex administration induced an increase in slow or MHC I fiber type in all muscle types with a concomitant reduction in different fast fiber types in different muscles (MHC IIB and MHC IIX in tibialis anterior and soleus muscle, and MHC IIB in gastrocnemius, and triceps muscles) (Supplementary Figs. 1C and D, 2C, F, 3 C, F, 4 C, F, 5 C, F, 6C, F) as shown previously,. In addition, we also found increased expression of atrophy markers such as Atrogin-1, MuRF-1, FoxO1, and FoxO3 in Dex-treated gastrocnemius muscle samples, confirming the induction of muscle atrophy (Fig. 1f). These data confirm that we could successfully recapitulate Dex-induced muscle atrophy model as reported previously –.

### Non-invasive optoacoustic imaging of glycogen-storage and muscle degeneration in late-onset Pompe disease [^10a4dcd7]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

As MRI fat fraction is supposedly one of the most sensitive methods to detect muscle involvement, all subjects underwent an MRI of the biceps muscle. Signal intensities of in-phase and fat-only images were used to estimate the fat fraction (FF) as a surrogate marker for muscle atrophy in accordance with the pathophysiology of PD. In total, n = 20 datasets of the respective right biceps of HV and LOPD patients were evaluated. Overall, no difference in the fat fraction as surrogate for muscle involvement was found between HV and LOPD patients (9.7 ± 2.2% vs. 14.3 ± 14.1%, P = 0.38, Fig. 3D). These findings are in accordance with clinical phenotype and previous studies showing a less pronounced muscle involvement in LOPD.

### Fatty infiltration and rotator cuff atrophy [^77fa9669]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Moderate to severe fatty infiltration and rotator cuff atrophy are commonly associated with poor clinical outcomes and failed rotator cuff repair. Numerous animal and human studies have attempted to elucidate the etiology of fatty infiltration and rotator cuff atrophy. Mechanical detachment of the tendon in rotator cuff tears is primarily responsible. Suprascapular nerve injury may also play a role. CT, MRI, and ultrasonography are used to evaluate severity. The Goutallier staging system is most commonly used to evaluate fatty infiltration, and rotator cuff atrophy is measured using multiple techniques. The presence and severity of fatty infiltration have been associated with increasing age, tear size, degree of tendon retraction, number of tendons involved (ie, massive tears), suprascapular neuropathy, and traumatic tears. Fatty infiltration is irreversible and progressive if left untreated. Slight reversal of muscle atrophy has been noted after repair in some studies. Novel therapies are currently being evaluated that may eventually allow clinicians to alter the natural history and improve patient outcomes.

### Natural history of fatty infiltration and atrophy of the supraspinatus muscle in rotator cuff tears [^0ea0a862]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In some patients nonoperative treatment of a rotator cuff tear is sufficient, while in others it is only the first stage of treatment prior to surgery. Fatty infiltration progresses throughout the nonoperative treatment although it is not known at what point fatty infiltration contributes to poor functional outcomes, absence of healing, or increased rerupture rates.

Questions/Purposes

We therefore identified factors related to the appearance of supraspinatus muscle fatty infiltration, determined the speed of appearance and progression of this phenomenon, and correlated fatty infiltration with muscular atrophy.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 1688 patients with rotator cuff tears and recorded the following: number of tendons torn, etiology of the tear, time between onset of shoulder symptoms and diagnosis of rotator cuff tear. Fatty infiltration of the supraspinatus was graded using either CT or MRI classification. Muscular atrophy was measured indirectly using the tangent sign.

Results

Moderate supraspinatus fatty infiltration appeared an average of 3 years after onset of symptoms and severe fatty infiltration at an average of 5 years after the onset of symptoms. A positive tangent sign appeared at an average of 4.5 years after the onset of symptoms.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that rotator cuff repair should be performed before the appearance of fatty infiltration (Stage 2) and atrophy (positive tangent sign)-especially when the tear involves multiple tendons.

### Editorial commentary: long head biceps pathology: how Do we find It? [^3e8eccd7]. Arthroscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Identification of symptomatic long head biceps pathology continues to be a clinical challenge. Magnetic resonance imaging may fail to identify symptomatic lesions when present. Clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion, and avoid over-reliance on diagnostic imaging in establishing a diagnosis or indicating surgery.

### The deltoid muscle and the pattern of paresis in ALS [^a479801d]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The strength of the corticospinal connectivity of the deltoid muscle in healthy controls was studied previously by Colebatch et al. Using electrical and magnetic stimulation techniques of the human cortex, they showed that the deltoid muscle has much greater monosynaptic corticospinal input than the pectoralis major. Clinically, however, the pectoralis major is difficult to study because strength measurements are confounded by the contraction of other muscles. The authors of that electrophysiological study concluded that “the strength of the connections to the deltoid assessed by this method is similar to that of an intrinsic muscle of the hand and significantly larger than that to its antagonist, pectoralis”. A subsequent electrophysiological study by de Noordhout et al. confirmed these findings for the deltoid muscle and also for the pectoralis major and trapezius muscles in humans. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, in which biceps and deltoid motoneuron pools in controls were more easily and extensively recruited than triceps motoneurons (i.e. biceps > deltoid > triceps brachii) under active conditions, Brouwer & Hopkins-Rosseel concluded that this pattern of activity is consistent with the known pattern of projections of the rapidly conducting primate corticospinal tract.

We compared the strength of the deltoid to that of the biceps brachii in ALS. The degree of paresis was similar—much in line with previous electrophysiological studies performed in humans. Our finding is at least complementary to previous findings and their interpretations. It also adds evidence to the hypothesis that muscles monosynaptically supplied by the cortex are more vulnerable to the disease process. In the meantime, it also has been shown that another separate anterior horn cell disease, spinal muscular atrophy, displays a distinct pattern of paresis 

Our results are not entirely surprising, given clinical experience and knowledge regarding corticospinal connectivity. The deltoid paresis in ALS is part of a cortical, monosynaptic pattern of paresis. This, in turn, leads to several potential additional implications:
How are we to explain the thoracic form of ALS with its two subforms (erector spinae, diaphragm)? The combination of neurophysiological studies of corticospinal connections and neuroradiological quantitative assessment of muscle atrophy might bring this challenge closer to a solution.
Similar studies should be performed in bulbar muscles, in particular those of the tongue.

### Co-occurrence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy: is mitochondrial dysfunction a modifier? [^112db6d7]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Dear Sirs,

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder causing selective loss of motor neurons in brain motor cortex and spinal cord in which muscle denervation and atrophy are associated with pyramidal involvement, typically spreading to contiguous muscular regions and leading eventually to a fatal paralysis. The pathogenic role of mitochondrial dysfunction in ALS has been investigated as there is evidence of morphological and biochemical mitochondrial abnormalities, both in patient tissues and animal models, suggesting their significant contribution to motor neurons degeneration since early phases of ALS. Here, we report two ALS cases carrying the m.11778A > G/ MT-ND4 (R340H) mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation pathogenic for Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a maternally inherited disease due to mtDNA mutations affecting complex I function and usually leading to isolated optic atrophy.

Both patients had positive family history for LHON and were followed on a regular basis. Routine neuro-ophthalmological evaluation included visual acuity, fundus oculi pictures, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT Stratus, Zeiss) and computerized visual fields (VF Humphrey, Zeiss). LHON mutations were investigated by complete mtDNA sequencing, as previously reported. ALS diagnosis was established using Awajii criteria. The clinical and instrumental workout included: neurological examination, electromyography, and brain MRI. A complete blood exam screening was performed to exclude autoimmune and paraneoplastic mimics. Patient 2 also performed muscle biopsy on the left biceps. A targeted multigenic Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) panel for neurodegenerative disorders was carried out, including ALS-associated genes (list of genes available upon request), in both patients. We compared age at onset and disease duration of our patients with an extensive dataset from our local ALS registry (BoReALS registry), collected from 2010 to 2019 at the Bellaria Hospital (Bologna, Italy), composed of 330 ALS patients (55 with a genetic diagnosis in one of the major ALS-associated genes FUS, SOD1, TDP43 and C9orf72), 232 of which with spinal and 98 with bulbar onset. This study was performed in accordance with the ethical standards of our institution and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration.

### The effect of concomitant biceps tenodesis on revision surgery rates after primary rotator cuff repair [^8628e282]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

First, it is possible that our study may have identified a statistically significant difference in the incidence of revision outcomes within 4 years of RCR performed with and without concomitant BT due to an overpowered sample, but this difference may not be clinically significant in light of the small absolute differences. Second, surgical options to address tendinopathy of the LHBT or biceps reflection pulley lesions include BT or tenotomy of the LHBT. Because of coding limitations and the lack of specificity of ICD codes for arthroscopic tenotomy, there may be some patients who underwent concomitant biceps tenotomy at the time of their index RCR in our control group. If the main factor driving down revision surgery rates in this study was addressing LHBT pathology at the time of the patients' RCR, then we would expect these confounding patients in the control group to drive our results toward the null hypothesis being true, meaning that if we could capture tenotomies and include them in the treatment group, it is likely that this difference between treated biceps pathology and nontreated biceps pathology would demonstrate a greater benefit. However, despite this limitation, our results remain statistically significant. We think that this actually strengthens our argument that the factor driving down revision surgery rates in this study is specifically BT. It may be possible that the effect size of the need for revision may be greater if database research had the capability to combine tenotomy and tenodesis into one cohort to compare with a control group with no LHBT treatment.

Additional limitations are common to the utilization of a large administrative database such as inaccurate reporting or coding errors during retrospective data collection, lack of information on cuff tear size, chronicity, muscle atrophy, and tear location. Finally, the inability to account for variables such as intraoperative complications, clinical presentation, tenodesis technique, and indication for tenodesis may have impacted our results. These limitations should be considered when forming conclusions on the data in our study.

### Quantitative muscle ultrasound measures rapid declines over time in children with SMA type 1 [^334b1677]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2015). Low credibility.

Muscles are small in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). It is not known if muscle size changes over time in SMA type 1. We quantified changes over time in muscle size and echointensity during two repeated ultrasound examinations of unilateral proximal (biceps brachii/brachialis and quadriceps) and distal (anterior forearm flexors and tibialis anterior) muscles in three children with SMA type 1. We compared muscle thickness (MT) to body weight-dependent normal reference values. Children were 1, 6, and 11months old at baseline and had 2, 2 and 4 months between ultrasound examinations, respectively. At baseline, MT was normal for weight in all muscles except an atrophic quadriceps in the oldest child. MT decreased and echointensity increased (worsened) over time. At follow up, MT was below normal for weight in the quadriceps in all three children, in the biceps/brachioradialis in two, and in the anterior forearm in one. Tibialis anterior MT remained normal for weight in all three children. Muscle echointensity increased over time in all muscles and, on average, more than doubled in two children. In children with SMA type 1, muscle atrophies and becomes hyperechoic over time. Quantitative muscle ultrasound measures disease progression in SMA type 1 that warrants additional study in more children.

### Nerve and muscle abnormalities [^09d95bbe]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Muscle atrophy in shoulders with rotator cuff tendon tears is a negative prognosticator, associated with decreased function, decreased reparability, increased retears after repair, and poorer outcomes after surgery. Muscle edema or atrophy within a neurologic distribution characterizes denervation. Because most nerve entrapments around the shoulder are not caused by mass lesions and show no nerve findings on routine MR imaging sequences, pattern of muscle denervation is often the best clue to predicting location of nerve dysfunction, which narrows the differential diagnosis and guides clinical management. The exception is suprascapular nerve compression in the spinoglenoid notch caused by a compressing cyst.

### Muscle degeneration in rotator cuff tears [^49aa0e35]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Rotator cuff tears are among the most common injuries seen by orthopedic surgeons. Although small- and medium-sized tears do well after arthroscopic and open repair, large and massive tears have been shown to develop marked muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration within the rotator cuff muscles. These pathologic changes have been found to be independent predictors of failed surgical repair with poor functional outcomes. To understand the pathophysiology of rotator cuff disease, we must first develop an understanding of the changes that occur within the cuff muscles themselves. The purpose of this review is to summarize the molecular pathways behind muscular degeneration and emphasize new findings related to the clinical relevance of muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration seen with rotator cuff tears. Understanding these molecular pathways will help guide further research and treatment options that can aim to alter expression of these pathways and improve outcomes after surgical repair of massive rotator cuff tears.

### Acteoside improves muscle atrophy and motor function by inducing new myokine secretion in chronic spinal cord injury [^ec21b03b]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2019). Medium credibility.

Skeletal muscle atrophy in chronic SCI mice is ameliorated by acteoside injection

To evaluate the effect of acteoside on skeletal muscle atrophy in mice with chronic SCI, the wet weights of the biceps femoris (Fig. 3C) and tibial anterior (Fig. 3D) muscles were measured at the end of the drug treatment. The weights of both muscles were significantly lower in vehicle-treated SCI mice than in sham-operated mice. In contrast, the weights were significantly higher in the acteoside-treated than the vehicle-treated SCI group. Body weights were not different between these two groups, although both groups exhibited reduced body weights compared with the sham-operated group (Fig. 3E). Those results indicate that skeletal muscle atrophy in mice with chronic SCI is ameliorated by intramuscular injection of acteoside.

### Dysferlinopathy in iran: clinical and genetic report [^969b02fa]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Dysferlinopathy is caused by a very wide range of autosomal recessively inherited mutations of the Dysferlin gene. It causes a spectrum of muscle diseases including limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2B and Miyoshi myopathy (MM). We describe the clinical course and mutational analyses of 15 Iranian patients with dysferlinopathy from 9 different families.

Methods

Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and 55 exons and flanking intronic boundaries of the dysferlin gene (DYSF; NM_003494.2) were screened for mutations and analyzed.

Results

From 15 studied patients in 9 families, 5 patients were male. Seven families had consanguineous marriage. Median age of onset was 16.8; and the median age of diagnosis was 26.6. The onset was clearly distal in 7 patients, and proximal in 6 patients. Three patients had partial biceps atrophy and 13 showed prominent calf muscle wasting. Foot plantar flexors, deep finger flexors and hip adductors were predominantly involved. Genetic testing showed homozygous mutation of dysferlin gene in 9 probands, 5 of which were not previously reported.

Conclusion

This work, in fact, may help shed some light on the pattern of this morbidity in Iran, an effort that may have not been attempted so far.

### Can compressive thoracic cord lesions cause a pure lower motor neurone syndrome? [^becb2e40]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A pure lower motor neurone syndrome affecting the upper limbs due to degenerative cervical spine disease is well described (cervical spondylotic amyotrophy); however, the existence of a similar syndrome affecting the lower limbs and due to thoracolumbar spinal cord compression is controversial.

Cervical spondylotic amyotrophy is characterised by weakness and wasting of the upper limbs without sensory or lower limb involvement. It can be further classified depending on the muscles involved into a proximal (scapular, deltoid and biceps) and a distal type (triceps forearm and hand). Radiologically, the proximal subtype corresponds to lesions at the C4/5 intervertebral level resulting in damage to anterior horn cells supplying C5/6 nerve root innervated muscles. The distal subtype corresponds to cord lesions at either C5/6 or C6/7 that affect anterior horn cells innervating C7–T1 nerve root innervated muscles.These anatomical correlations help explain the pathomechanism of disease for the two cases reported in which the cord lesion is at T11/12 but the muscles affected are innervated by nerve roots L2–S1.

Materials and methods

Patient’s history and clinical findings

The patient was a 45-year-old Japanese male with no relevant medical history. He had no family history of similar symptoms, although his mother (Fig. 1 II-3) died at the age of 30 years due to collagen disease.

Fig. 1 
Pedigree of the family. The proband is indicated by an arrow

The patient reported awareness of diplopia since the age of 42, with worsening symptoms leading him to seek medical care at the age of 45. Clinical examination revealed bilateral ptosis and ophthalmoplegia, without diurnal changes. No muscle weakness, sensory symptoms, signs of ataxia, or retinal abnormalities were observed. Blood tests showed normal lactate levels, and other parameters, including creatine kinase levels, were within normal limits. Tests for anti-acetylcholine receptor and anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibodies were negative. Whole-body computed tomography (CT) scan showed no evidence of muscle atrophy, and the electrocardiogram was normal.

Based on these clinical findings, CPEO was suspected. To confirm the diagnosis, a muscle biopsy of the left biceps brachii muscle was performed. Histopathological examination, mtDNA sequencing analysis, long polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis using DNA extracted from the muscle, and single-fiber analysis of muscle fibers were subsequently conducted.

Histopathological examination

Ten-μm-thick transversely oriented serial cross-sections of frozen muscle were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), modified Gomori trichrome (mGT), and a double stain of cytochrome c oxidase (COX)/succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) (COX/SDH staining) to detect ragged-red fibers (RRFs). Pathological diagnoses were made using an optical microscope (OM).

### High-intensity flywheel exercise and recovery of atrophy after 90 days bed – rest [^fd4f15ca]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

The countermeasure programme did not have an impact on atrophy in the hamstrings, which are important for ambulation. Of the hamstrings, semimembranosus and biceps femoris long head are primarily hip extensorswith semitendinosus playing more of a role in control of knee flexion.In contrast, another research groupreported complete prevention of hamstring muscle atrophy due to their resistance exercise protocol in 20 days bed-rest when the leg press exercise was performed up to 110° of hip flexion. This underscores the need for greater specificity of exercise prescription for the hamstrings.

Maintenance of the calf musculature in disuse bed-rest via exercise has, in a number of studies, proven difficult. In the current study the atrophy of the calf muscles was significantly reduced, but muscle atrophy still occurred: 20% of soleus muscle volume was lost in the flywheel group compared with 29% loss in the inactive group at the end of bed-rest. Prior work does suggest that higher volumes of calf muscle exercise do appear to have a greater protective effect: when resistive vibration exercise including calf press exercises was performed three times a week,15% loss in soleus muscle volume after 56 days of bed-rest was observed, compared with 7% loss in soleus muscle volume after 56 days of bed-rest in another studywhere resistive vibration exercise was performed 11 times a week. However, for the calf muscles, there is evidence in the literaturethat attaining hypertrophy in ambulant exercise studies is more difficult with standard hypertrophy protocols than it is for the knee extensors. This is in line with the notion that muscles that are typically load-bearing in daily life are more difficult to hypertrophy than non-load-bearing muscles.Investigation of other exercise modes, such as treadmill running or jumping exercises, is needed to improve exercise prescription for preventing disuse atrophy of the calf musculature.

Little is known about the clinical and anatomic progression of asymptomatic rotator cuff tears. The purpose of our study was to assess if deterioration in rotator cuff tear anatomy would be correlated to the development of symptoms.

Methods

Fifty patients with initially asymptomatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears were followed clinically, sonographically, and by magnetic resonance imaging over three years. Changes of tear size, muscle atrophy, fatty degeneration, and condition of the long head of the biceps tendon were compared between tears that developed symptoms and those that did not.

Results

Eighteen of fifty tears developed symptoms during follow-up. There was a significantly larger increase (p = 0.02) in the mean tear size in the newly symptomatic group (10.6 mm) when compared with the still-asymptomatic group (3.3 mm). The rate of progressing to advanced muscle atrophy was higher (p = 0.08) in the newly symptomatic group (35% [six of seventeen subjects]) when compared with the still-asymptomatic group (12% [three of twenty-five subjects]). The rate of fatty degeneration was significantly higher (p = 0.02) in the newly symptomatic group (35% [six of seventeen subjects]) when compared with the still-asymptomatic group (4% [one of twenty-five subjects]). The rate of pathology of the long head of the biceps tendon was significantly higher (p = 0.02) in the newly symptomatic group (33% [six of eighteen subjects]) when compared with the still-asymptomatic group (6% [two of thirty-two subjects]).

Conclusions

During a relatively short-term follow-up, a substantial percentage of asymptomatic rotator cuff tears became symptomatic and underwent anatomic deterioration. Increase in tear size and decrease of muscle quality were correlated to the development of symptoms. Subjects diagnosed with an asymptomatic rotator cuff tear should be informed about the natural history of the condition and follow-up with repeated imaging may be indicated to monitor tear progression.

Neurogenic skeletal muscular atrophy in both Mut and Del mice

The progressive motor dysfunction of both Mut and Del mice led us to analyze their skeletal muscle, especially the gastrocnemius muscle, the largest and superficial skeletal muscle in the hind limb. Mut and Del mice exhibited severe muscle wasting. The size and weight of the muscle were remarkably reduced compared to controls at 13 months (Fig. 3a). We detected atrophied muscle cells with centrally localized nuclei, which was more obvious at 14 months than at 12 months (Figs. 3b, S4a). Atrophied muscle fibers indicated that muscle atrophy was neurogenic (Figs. 3b, S4a).

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for rotator cuff disorders, more specifically with respect to physical therapy, AAOS 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that patient-reported outcomes improve with physical therapy in symptomatic patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears, but the rotator cuff tear size, muscle atrophy, and fatty infiltration may progress over 5-10 years with nonsurgical management.

Also, we noticed a very small (−0.2 ms) but significant decrease in T 2 over time. We think the decrease is related to the bias of a simultaneous increase of fat fraction, as increasing fat replacement results in lowering of T 2, as we observed in our previous study. 23, 28 Although T 2 mapping is often used as a meaningful outcome measure in other neuromuscular diseases, its application as a biomarker for SMA therefore seems irrelevant, although its value in monitoring treatment effect remains to be determined.

The DTI measures MD and FA did not show significant changes over time in moderate to severely affected muscles. We observed a small significant change in FA only in low fat‐infiltration muscles, ie the adductor longus and biceps femoris (short head), that persisted after correction for SNR. 40 The decrease in FA in probably does not represent increased permeability of cell membranes because MD values did not change accordingly. Possible alternative explanations for the observed FA decrease in low fat‐infiltration muscles are increased strain while other muscles deteriorate, resulting in swelling. FA decrease may also reflect a distinct moment in (early) muscle pathology. Whether DTI changes are preceding fat infiltration remains inconclusive and has to be demonstrated by additional measurements in an early phase of muscle pathology in young children. Because of the small standard deviation of MD and FA (0.1 and 0.2 respectively) at both time‐points, we hypothesize that DTI can still be a sensitive measure for evaluating treatment effects despite not qualifying as a biomarker for disease progression in untreated patients.

### A visual marker for early atrophy of the supraspinatus muscle on conventional MRI: introduction of the blackbird sign [^ba955540]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rotator cuff (RC) tears are one of the most common causes of shoulder pain and functional impairment among individuals of all age groups. Accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of SSP tears are important, as it is the most commonly affected muscle in RC tears. Following tendon rupture, degenerative changes occur in the RC muscle, including fatty infiltration and atrophy. The degree of fatty muscle infiltration and atrophy has been shown to correlate with repairability and outcome of tendon-to-bone repair. Various visual/qualitative and quantitative radiological techniques have been developed to aid in the diagnosis and assessment of SSP tears. Among the most promising quantitative techniques for assessing RC fatty muscle infiltration are chemical shift-based methods and Dixon-based techniques, including extended 2-point Dixon methods. However, quantitative assessments require the acquisition of special MR sequences, and their acquisition, postprocessing, and segmentation is time-consuming which limits their use in routine clinical practice.

4 DISCUSSION

This study on a relatively large number of patients of different ages and disease severities outlines leg muscle involvement across the clinical spectrum of SMA and adds to accumulating experience with qMRI measures in neuromuscular diseases. DTI further elucidates distinct properties of skeletal muscle in SMA. The correlation of qMRI and clinical parameters suggest potential as a biomarker for disease progression or treatment effect. Here, we extend the previous descriptions of muscle involvement in SMA with a diverse cohort, rising from 7 to 73 years of age. The patterns of muscle involvement and relative muscle sparing were comparable with previous reports such as the m. adductor longus,, m. sartorius, and the short head of the m. biceps femoris and m. semimembranosus. 12, 13, 18, 19, 42 Strikingly, the severe involvement of the quadriceps did not impede some patients with type 3 to walk. Selective vulnerability of muscle is a hallmark of SMA but whether this is explained by anatomical or biochemical (ie, related to SMN deficiency) 43, 44 differences between muscle groups remains to established. The progressive nature of SMA at muscle level is reflected by the more severe fatty infiltration of muscles in older patients. Similarly, patients with type 2 had earlier onset of fatty infiltration and therefore a higher fat fraction in all muscle groups than patients with type 3 at a similar age. The inclusion of older and severely affected patients allowed a cross‐sectional description of qMRI across the full spectrum of SMA, which has not been described before. However, end‐stage fatty infiltration resulted in the exclusion of these muscles from quantitative analysis because muscle was either no longer present, impossible to segment, unidentifiable, or under a volume of 10 voxels. Nonetheless, our data included muscles up to 80% of fat infiltration. Although little muscle was present, we could still establish a correlation between properties of remaining muscle and functional data. The use for longitudinal purposes, ie, to study the natural history of the quality of muscle tissue or the effects of treatment, therefore seems limited to young children with SMA type 2 and adolescents and young adults with SMA type 3.

### Disorders of the proximal and distal aspects of the biceps muscle [^76012408]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2013). Low credibility.

PROXIMAL ASPECT OF BICEPS: Tenodesis of the long head of the biceps may offer improved cosmesis, improved strength, and diminished activity-related pain compared with tenotomy, although comparative studies have shown similar outcomes in some patient populations. DISTAL ASPECT OF BICEPS: Operative treatment of both partial and complete distal biceps ruptures results in better outcomes compared with nonoperative care, although the optimal technique and fixation are yet to be determined. Nonoperative management is an acceptable treatment for patients willing to accept some loss of forearm supination and elbow flexion strength as well as changes in endurance and cosmesis.

Our results highlighted that the BFlh Lf extrapolation pitfalls may influence the findings of longitudinal studies. These observations are relevant from a clinical and training perspective because the choice of the US method used may be crucial for the detection of potential changes after training/detraining interventions. Interestingly, we found only little changes (MLE: −0.17 cm (−1.94%); EFOV: −0.25 cm (−2.84%)) in Lf after 10 d of BR. The mean absolute and percentage difference for EFOV was just higher than the calculated MDC (0.24 cm; 2.77%), whereas for MLE, it was lower than its MDC (0.25 cm; 2.73%; Table 3). Both with EFOV and MLE analysis, half of the subjects presented decrements in Lf that were higher than their respective MDC. These results are in contrast with previous findings of the changes in BFlh Lf during detraining/training cessation, which showed that even short detraining periods (2–4 wk) are sufficient to induce large decreases in Lf (average range, −0.93 to −2.5 cm) (–). When comparing these previous studies with the present one, it is important to consider that pure unloading and detraining (i.e. training cessation) are distinct models of muscle disuse. In fact, although BR is well known to induce marked muscle atrophy and architectural adaptations, in studies that have investigated changes in BFlh Lf due to detraining, the observed muscle loss could be affected by the preceding training intervention, potentially accelerating such process. However, it must be considered that, in detraining studies, the volunteers are usually allowed to perform habitual sports activity (i.e. practically they just refrain from performing the specific exercise previously investigated) (,–). In addition, the architectural adaptations observed for other muscle groups during detraining are generally of smaller magnitude than the one observed for BFlh. For instance, no or little reductions in vastus lateralis Lf were found in detraining periods of 4–14 wk (–). Such inconsistencies may be related to either the possible singular behavior of BFlh muscle during detraining or to the US analysis method used in previous investigations (i. e. equation A).

### Considerations and recommendations for selection and utilization of upper extremity clinical outcome assessments in human spinal cord injury trials [^b1a52ec5]. Spinal Cord (2018). Low credibility.

When interpreting the outcomes of a given intervention, one needs to consider the contribution of upper motoneuron (UMN) and lower motoneuron (LMN) lesions. The extent of LMN damage may vary by level and severity of injury and across individuals with similar levels of injury. Mulcahey et al. found that in children and youths with C1–C4 injuries, between 2% (triceps) and 91% (biceps complex) of tested muscles did not respond to stimulation using surface electrical stimulation, indicating significant LMN damage. Curt et al. found a high rate of significant denervation in median and ulnar nerves in individuals with lower (C6–T1) cervical vs. mid (C4,5) injuries. These two studies illustrate the prevalence of LMN damage, both at the site of injury and one-to-two levels below the injury. LMN changes may occur from actual traumatic loss of motoneurons, severe proximal ventral root injury, or changes in motor unit properties as a result of denervation (motoneuron sprouting with enlarged motor units). Lower motoneuron dysfunction is also associated with other segmental neuronal loss, including interneurons that coordinate activity across motoneuron pools and damage to dorsal roots and/or sensory processing in the dorsal horn. The functional impact of LMN loss varies based on the extent of loss at single and multiple segments. LMN injury is important to assess as this may have a significant impact on response rate for therapeutics targeting central nervous system (UMN) dysfunction. Clinically, muscular atrophy and associated hyporeflexia are signs of LMN injury, whereas spasticity and associated hyperreflexia are signs of UMN injury. However, they can often be seen in combination after cervical SCI. Surface electrical stimulation may be used as an initial assessment; peripheral nerve stimulation of muscles impacted by LMN damage commonly requires more current or may not be excitable. Additional electro-diagnostic testing (F waves, H reflexes) may follow as needed to provide additional information about LMN patency. Results of these tests should be considered in the overall interpretation of results when looking at responders vs. non-responders to a given therapeutic approach.

### Characterization of patients with Becker muscular dystrophy by histology, magnetic resonance imaging, function, and strength assessments [^dd82806c]. Muscle & Nerve (2022). Medium credibility.

In addition to significant moderate correlations with most of the functional and strength endpoints, total fibrosis and MFA correlated significantly, although again moderately, with MRI fat fractions in the whole thigh and quadriceps. This was surprising because the histology samples were from arm (brachial biceps) biopsies and the MRI measures were performed in the leg. However, this could indicate that the thigh and biceps muscles follow a similar progression, in line with the proximal‐distal order of muscle involvement in BMD, suggesting that both the arms and legs capture overall disease progression in individuals with BMD. A previous MRI study in patients with DMD showed that fat replacement in the arm muscles seems to coexist with fat replacement in the leg muscles, with the result that the deltoid, biceps brachii, and triceps brachii were affected to the same extent as the soleus and medial gastrocnemius.Our results suggest that this is also the case in BMD.

Our analyses have some limitations. These data are from a single visit and are therefore cross‐sectional. Second, as these patients have been recruited into an interventional clinical trial, we applied a series of specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Overall, this may impact the generalizability of the results and the strength of the correlations between measures (due to the limited range of disease severity in the recruited participants), although, as discussed earlier, our overall results are consistent with previously published data.Finally, the histology data are from samples taken from patients' arms, whereas the MRI fat fraction evaluations were performed on the legs. This indicates we cannot directly compare the two sets of results within a specific muscle‐‐‐although, as noted earlier, the results suggest that the evolution of muscle degeneration is similar in the upper and lower limbs.

### Anterior horn cell loss from subdural hygroma: a consequence of spontaneous spinal fluid leak [^160dae92]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

We describe a case of a 50-year-old man with bilateral shoulder girdle weakness caused by anterior subdural hygroma secondary to a previous spontaneous CSF leak. The CSF leak occurred and resolved 16 years prior to presenting with a 6-year progressive painless, asymmetric proximal muscle weakness involving both upper extremities. Current examination reveals remarkably restricted atrophy and weakness in bilateral C5-6 muscles and absent biceps and brachioradialis reflexes. Neuroimaging shows a subdural CSF collection extending from C1 to L2 anteriorly causing thecal sac effacement at the C4 level and secondary Chiari deformity. The clinical picture demonstrates severe weakness in C5-6 muscles with sparing of all other myotomes. The acute clinical features as well as neuroimaging characteristics of spontaneous CSF leak are well known but the late effects are less described. The development of a subdural fluid collection secondary to a spinal fluid leak can cause damage to the anterior spinal cord years after the leak. The underlying pathophysiology of the motor neuron loss remains unclear but there appears to be a pressure effect localized to the C4-5 region. The possibility that intervention to prevent or treat the subdural CSF collection might have avoided the shoulder girdle weakness is considered.

### MRI findings in the painful poststroke shoulder [^a77267f3]. Stroke (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

We describe the structural abnormalities in the painful shoulder of stroke survivors and their relationships to clinical characteristics. Method- Eighty-nine chronic stroke survivors with poststroke shoulder pain underwent T1- and T2-weighted multiplanar, multisequence MRI of the painful paretic shoulder. All scans were reviewed by one radiologist for the following abnormalities: rotator cuff, biceps and deltoid tears, tendinopathies and atrophy, subacromial bursa fluid, labral ligamentous complex abnormalities, and acromioclavicular capsular hypertrophy. Clinical variables included subject demographics, stroke characteristics, and the Brief Pain Inventory Questions 12. The relationship between MRI findings and clinical characteristics was assessed through logistic regression.

Results

Thirty-five percent of subjects exhibited a tear of at least one rotator cuff, biceps or deltoid muscle. Fifty-three percent of subjects exhibited tendinopathy of at least one rotator cuff, bicep or deltoid muscle. The prevalence of rotator cuff tears increased with age. However, rotator cuff tears and rotator cuff and deltoid tendinopathies were not related to severity of poststroke shoulder pain. In approximately 20% of cases, rotator cuff and deltoid muscles exhibited evidence of atrophy. Atrophy was associated with reduced motor strength and reduced severity of shoulder pain.

Conclusions

Rotator cuff tears and rotator cuff and deltoid tendinopathies are highly prevalent in poststroke shoulder pain. However, their relationship to shoulder pain is uncertain. Atrophy is less common but is associated with less severe shoulder pain.

### Surgical outcome of posterior decompression for cervical spondylosis with unilateral upper extremity amyotrophy [^35552202]. Spine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case studies of patients with cervical spondylosis with unilateral upper extremity amyotrophy.

Objective

To clarify the surgical outcome of posterior decompression for this amyotrophy.

Summary Of Background Data

Cervical spondylosis sometimes causes a characteristic severe muscular atrophy without sensory disturbance or lower-extremity dysfunction, which is the so-called "cervical spondylotic amyotrophy." However, response to treatment, especially to posterior decompression, has not been well understood.

Method

This study included 32 patients. All underwent posterior cervical laminoplasty, and 22 patients had an additional foraminotomy. Preoperative and postoperative muscle power and results of imaging and electrophysiologic studies were evaluated. The follow-up period averaged 78 months. Whether impingement was against the ventral nerve root (VNR) or anterior horn (AH) in the spinal cord was assessed according to these findings. These cases were divided into proximal type and distal type according to the most severely atrophic muscle and compared statistically.

Results

Severe preoperative muscle atrophy was observed in the deltoid and biceps muscles of 24 patients (proximal type) and in the forearm and hand muscles of 8 patients (distal type). Impingements against the VNR and AH were observed in 21 and 28 cases, respectively, and 17 cases had impingement of both the VNR and AH. Improvements in muscle atrophy after surgery were observed in 25 cases. In proximal-type patients, muscle power improved in 92% of cases but was improved in only 38% of the distal-type cases.

Conclusions

Laminoplasty and foraminotomy were effective in the treatment of most patients with this syndrome, although the outcome in the distal type was inferior to that in the proximal type.

### Loss of function variants in DNAJB4 cause a myopathy with early respiratory failure [^4a646974]. Acta Neuropathologica (2023). Medium credibility.

DNAJ/HSP40 co-chaperones are integral to the chaperone network, bind client proteins and recruit them to HSP70 for folding. We performed exome sequencing on patients with a presumed hereditary muscle disease and no genetic diagnosis. This identified four individuals from three unrelated families carrying an unreported homozygous stop gain (c.856A>T; p.Lys286Ter), or homozygous missense variants (c.74G>A; p.Arg25Gln and c.785 T>C; p.Leu262Ser) in DNAJB4. Affected patients presented with axial rigidity and early respiratory failure requiring ventilator support between the 1st and 4th decade of life. Selective involvement of the semitendinosus and biceps femoris muscles was seen on MRI scans of the thigh. On biopsy, muscle was myopathic with angular fibers, protein inclusions and occasional rimmed vacuoles. DNAJB4 normally localizes to the Z-disc and was absent from muscle and fibroblasts of affected patients supporting a loss of function. Functional studies confirmed that the p.Lys286Ter and p.Leu262Ser mutant proteins are rapidly degraded in cells. In contrast, the p.Arg25Gln mutant protein is stable but failed to complement for DNAJB function in yeast, disaggregate client proteins or protect from heat shock-induced cell death consistent with its loss of function. DNAJB4 knockout mice had muscle weakness and fiber atrophy with prominent diaphragm involvement and kyphosis. DNAJB4 knockout muscle and myotubes had myofibrillar disorganization and accumulated Z-disc proteins and protein chaperones. These data demonstrate a novel chaperonopathy associated with DNAJB4 causing a myopathy with early respiratory failure. DNAJB4 loss of function variants may lead to the accumulation of DNAJB4 client proteins resulting in muscle dysfunction and degeneration.

### Impaired growth of denervated muscle contributes to contracture formation following neonatal brachial plexus injury [^df7b5463]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The etiology of shoulder and elbow contractures following neonatal brachial plexus injury is incompletely understood. With use of a mouse model, the current study tests the novel hypothesis that reduced growth of denervated muscle contributes to contractures following neonatal brachial plexus injury.

Methods

Unilateral brachial plexus injuries were created in neonatal mice by supraclavicular C5-C6 nerve root excision. Shoulder and elbow range of motion was measured four weeks after injury. Fibrosis, cross-sectional area, and functional length of the biceps, brachialis, and subscapularis muscles were measured over four weeks following injury. Muscle satellite cells were cultured from denervated and control biceps muscles to assess myogenic capability. In a comparison group, shoulder motion and subscapularis length were assessed following surgical excision of external rotator muscles.

Results

Shoulder internal rotation and elbow flexion contractures developed on the involved side within four weeks following brachial plexus injury. Excision of the biceps and brachialis muscles relieved the elbow flexion contractures. The biceps muscles were histologically fibrotic, whereas fatty infiltration predominated in the brachialis and rotator cuff muscles. The biceps and brachialis muscles displayed reduced cross-sectional and longitudinal growth compared with the contralateral muscles. The upper subscapularis muscle similarly displayed reduced longitudinal growth, with the subscapularis shortening correlating with internal rotation contracture. However, excision of the external rotators without brachial plexus injury caused no contractures or subscapularis shortening. Myogenically capable satellite cells were present in denervated biceps muscles despite impaired muscle growth in vivo.

Conclusions

Injury of the upper trunk of the brachial plexus leads to impaired growth of the biceps and brachialis muscles, which are responsible for elbow flexion contractures, and impaired growth of the subscapularis muscle, which correlates with internal rotation contracture of the shoulder. Shoulder muscle imbalance alone causes neither subscapularis shortening nor internal rotation contracture. Impaired muscle growth cannot be explained solely by absence of functioning satellite cells.

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^3b01b79a]. AAOS (2025). High credibility.

Long-term non-operative management—physical therapy outcomes and recommendation strength: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) improve with physical therapy in symptomatic patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears, but the rotator cuff tear size, muscle atrophy, and fatty infiltration may progress over 5 to 10 years with non-operative management. Quality of evidence is High and the strength of recommendation is Strong. For patients treated non-operatively after a rotator cuff tear, surveillance with serial clinical evaluation and imaging may be considered if surgical repair remains a viable option.

### High-intensity flywheel exercise and recovery of atrophy after 90 days bed – rest [^6a46a947]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Results

One flywheel subject ceased the training protocol after 7 weeks bed-rest due to a previously unreported knee injury, but he completed the bed-rest study phase. This subject was treated as a flywheel subject in the ITT analysis. Data from one inactive subject were lost on HDT29. Two inactive subjects did not attend on R+90 and one of these also did not attend scanning on R+180. One flywheel subject did not return for the final scanning session on R+360.

Effects in the inactive group

In the inactive subjects, the soleus and gastrocnemius medialis showed the fastest rates of muscle atrophy (figure 1) both losing 28% of their volume by end of bed-rest (table 1). This was followed by the remaining muscles of the lower leg (with the exception of the anterior tibial muscles), vasti, biceps femoris long head and semimembranosus (figure 1). The other members of the hamstrings, semitendinosus and biceps femoris short head, while atrophying, did not show as rapid atrophy of other members of the hamstrings. Of the muscles localised at the hip joint, quadratus femoris atrophied the fastest and of the medial thigh muscles, the greatest atrophy was seen in adductor magnus.

### Obesity is associated with muscle atrophy in rotator cuff tear [^018c0311]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Rotator cuff tears are considered a common cause of shoulder pain and are among the most common shoulder pathologies, affecting approximately 40% of the population over 60 years of age.The chronic shoulder pain resulting from randomised controlled trial (RCT) can result in daily suffering leading to limited range of motion, muscle weakness and inability to perform even simple daily tasks such as combing one’s hair or brushing one’s teeth.

Muscle atrophy is a common consequence of RCT, particularly in cases where the tear is chronic or longstanding, and can lead to loss of function, chronic pain and decreased quality of life in affected individuals. Advanced muscle atrophy is associated with worse surgical outcomes, higher rates of retear and poorer postoperative strength and range of motion.Thus, clinicians often rely on measures of muscle atrophy in MRI to influence their decision making regarding surgical vs conservative management.

Obesity is a well-known risk factor for degenerative rotator cuff tears, with several studies linking higher Body Mass Index (BMI) to increased risk of rotator cuff tear.The mechanisms by which obesity contributes to rotator cuff tear are not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to musculotendinous changes, increased mechanical loading on the shoulder joint and alterations in muscle function and metabolism. In particular, obesity is associated with alterations in adipokine secretion,insulin resistance and chronic low-grade inflammation,all of which can contribute to muscle atrophy and impaired muscle function. Additionally, recent work suggests a potential genetic association as studies have found myogenic, adipogenic and ‘atrophy’ genes that are correlated with increased muscle atrophy in rotator cuff tears.

Though prior work for our group has found that obesity is correlated with increased fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff, a distinct muscle abnormality found in individuals with tears which is often found in conjunction with muscle atrophy, to our knowledge, no studies to date have identified modifiable physical risk factors for muscle atrophy. The objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between BMI and muscle atrophy of rotator cuff muscles in two well-characterised cohorts of patients with rotator cuff tears.

### Diagnosis and treatment of biceps tendinitis and tendinosis [^4fd26d08]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Biceps tendinitis is inflammation of the tendon around the long head of the biceps muscle. Biceps tendinosis is caused by degeneration of the tendon from athletics requiring overhead motion or from the normal aging process. Inflammation of the biceps tendon in the bicipital groove, which is known as primary biceps tendinitis, occurs in 5 percent of patients with biceps tendinitis. Biceps tendinitis and tendinosis are commonly accompanied by rotator cuff tears or SLAP (superior labrum anterior to posterior) lesions. Patients with biceps tendinitis or tendinosis usually complain of a deep, throbbing ache in the anterior shoulder. Repetitive overhead motion of the arm initiates or exacerbates the symptoms. The most common isolated clinical finding in biceps tendinitis is bicipital groove point tenderness with the arm in 10 degrees of internal rotation. Local anesthetic injections into the biceps tendon sheath may be therapeutic and diagnostic. Ultrasonography is preferred for visualizing the overall tendon, whereas magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography arthrography is preferred for visualizing the intra-articular tendon and related pathology. Conservative management of biceps tendinitis consists of rest, ice, oral analgesics, physical therapy, or corticosteroid injections into the biceps tendon sheath. Surgery should be considered if conservative measures fail after three months, or if there is severe damage to the biceps tendon.

### Arthroscopic repair of concomitant type II SLAP lesions in large to massive rotator cuff tears: comparison with biceps tenotomy [^7afd4669]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

There are no studies examining superior labrum anterior and posterior (SLAP) repair combined with repair of large to massive rotator cuff tears, and it is unclear whether a combined SLAP repair would lead to better outcomes than biceps tenotomy.

Hypothesis

Tenotomy and rotator cuff repair would lead to better outcomes compared with those of combined SLAP and rotator cuff repair.

Study Design

Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2.

Methods

Our study population consisted of 36 patients who had undergone either combined SLAP and rotator cuff repair (when the biceps was too healthy to cut; group R = 16 patients) or tenotomy and rotator cuff repair (when any fraying or partial tear existed in the biceps tendon; group T = 20 patients) for concomitant type II SLAP lesions and large to massive rotator cuff tears. The cuff repair was performed in a single row for both groups. Outcomes were assessed by comparing range of motion as well as Simple Shoulder Test (SST), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) scores between the 2 groups.

Results

At the 2-year follow-up, both groups demonstrated significant improvements in functional shoulder scores and range of motion. However, group T had better SST scores (group T, 9.3 ± 1.6; group R, 7.8 ± 1.9; P = .012), ASES scores (group T, 88.6 ± 8.9; group R, 80.4 ±8.9; P = .009), UCLA scores (group T, 29.6 ± 3.0; group R, 26.0 ± 4.2; P = .007), and forward flexion (group T, 145.9° ± 13.0°; group R, 132.5° ± 15.3°; P = .008). The mean tear size and the degree of preoperative muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration on magnetic resonance imaging were similar between the groups.

Conclusion

For patients with concomitant type II SLAP lesions and large to massive rotator cuff tears, the outcomes of simultaneous arthroscopic SLAP and rotator cuff repair were inferior to those of arthroscopic biceps tenotomy and cuff repair in terms of functional shoulder scores and range of motion. Biceps tenotomy and rotator cuff repair may be a more reliable method to address concomitant type II SLAP lesions and large to massive rotator cuff tears in patients, although a randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm the results.

### Evaluation of muscle size and fatty infiltration with MRI nine to eleven years following hamstring harvest for ACL reconstruction [^44c1261d]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The long-term effect of hamstring tendon harvest for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction on muscle morphology is not well documented. Our hypothesis was that harvest of the hamstring tendons for ACL reconstruction would result in persistent loss of volume and cross-sectional area of the gracilis and semitendinosus muscles.

Methods

Magnetic resonance images were made of both limbs of ten patients nine to eleven years after they had ACL reconstruction with ipsilateral hamstring autograft. The volume of the individual thigh muscles bilaterally was calculated. The peak cross-sectional area and the cross-sectional area 7 cm proximal to the joint line was measured for the gracilis and semitendinosus muscles. Data were evaluated with use of the paired t test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The gracilis and semitendinosus muscles on the operatively treated side were evaluated for fatty infiltration and tendon regeneration.

Results

The mean volume on the operatively treated side was 54.2% of that on the noninvolved side for the gracilis muscle and 58.5% for the semitendinosus muscle. A 7% decrease in quadriceps volume and an 8% increase in the volume of the long head of the biceps on the operatively treated extremity were noted. The semimembranosus muscle and short head of the biceps muscle showed no difference in volume. The gracilis and semitendinosus muscles also showed a decrease in peak cross-sectional area, a decrease in the cross-sectional area 7 cm proximal to the joint line, and evidence of fatty infiltration. There was variable evidence of tendon or scar formation within the tendon bed, with most patients having some tissue that blended into either the sartorius muscle or medial gastrocnemius fascia at a level proximal to the joint line.

Conclusions

At nine to eleven years after ACL reconstruction with ipsilateral hamstring autograft, the gracilis and semitendinosus muscles showed persistent atrophy on the operatively treated side with evidence of fatty infiltration and variability in tendon regeneration. There was also persistent atrophy of the quadriceps muscles and compensatory hypertrophy of the long head of the biceps.

### Afferent innervation, muscle spindles, and contractures following neonatal brachial plexus injury in a mouse model [^152cc75e]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

We used an established mouse model of elbow flexion contracture after neonatal brachial plexus injury (NBPI) to test the hypothesis that preservation of afferent innervation protects against contractures and is associated with preservation of muscle spindles and ErbB signaling.

Methods

A model of preganglionic C5 through C7 NBPI was first tested in mice with fluorescent axons using confocal imaging to confirm preserved afferent innervation of spindles despite motor end plate denervation. Preganglionic and postganglionic injuries were then created in wild-type mice. Four weeks later, we assessed total and afferent denervation of the elbow flexors by musculocutaneous nerve immunohistochemistry. Biceps muscle volume and cross-sectional area were measured by micro computed tomography. An observer who was blinded to the study protocol measured elbow flexion contractures. Biceps spindle and muscle fiber morphology and ErbB signaling pathway activity were assessed histologically and immunohistochemically.

Results

Preganglionic and postganglionic injuries caused similar total denervation and biceps muscle atrophy. However, after preganglionic injuries, afferent innervation was partially preserved and elbow flexion contractures were significantly less severe. Spindles degenerated after postganglionic injury but were preserved after preganglionic injury. ErbB signaling was inactivated in denervated spindles after postganglionic injury but ErbB signaling activity was preserved in spindles after preganglionic injury with retained afferent innervation. Preganglionic and postganglionic injuries were associated with upregulation of ErbB signaling in extrafusal muscle fibers.

Conclusions

Contractures after NBPI are associated with muscle spindle degeneration and loss of spindle ErbB signaling activity. Preservation of afferent innervation maintained spindle development and ErbB signaling activity, and protected against contractures.

Clinical Relevance

Pharmacologic modulation of ErbB signaling, which is being investigated as a therapy for congestive heart failure, may be able to recapitulate the protective effects of afferent innervation in spindle development and contracture prevention. Muscle spindle preservation may also have implications in proprioception and motor learning, both of which are impaired in NBPI.

### Making sense of the clinical spectrum of limb girdle muscular dystrophies [^7bf0c5fc]. Practical Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The expansion of the spectrum of limb girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) in recent years means that neurologists need to be familiar with the clinical clues that can help with their diagnosis. The LGMDs comprise a group of genetic myopathies that manifest as chronic progressive weakness of hip and shoulder girdles. Their inheritance is either autosomal dominant (LGMD1) or autosomal recessive (LGMD2). Their prevalence varies in different regions of the world; certain ethnic groups have documented founder mutations and this knowledge can facilitate the diagnosis. The clinical approach to LGMDs uses the age at onset, genetic transmission and clinical patterns of muscular weakness. Helpful clinical features that help to differentiate the various subtypes include: predominant upper girdle weakness, disproportionate respiratory muscle involvement, distal weakness, hip adductor weakness, 'biceps lump' and 'diamond on quadriceps' sign, calf hypertrophy, contractures and cardiac involvement. Almost half of patients with LGMD have such clinical clues. Investigations such as serum creatine kinase, electrophysiology, muscle biopsy and genetic studies can complement the clinical examination. In this review, we discuss diagnostic clinical pointers and comment on the differential diagnosis and relevant investigations, using illustrative case studies.

### Isolated compression of the pectoral nerve resulting in atrophy of the major pectoral muscle [^3056daee]. Muscle & Nerve (2003). Low credibility.

We report on two cases of isolated damage to a muscle branch of the lateral pectoral nerve. Diagnosis was established by the clinical presentation and electromyographic examination. In the few reported cases of such injuries, the cause was trauma to this region. However, in both of our patients, focal muscle atrophy gradually developed after initiation of training schedules to increase the cross-section of the major pectoral muscle; we therefore assume that compression injury to the nerve by repetitive muscle contractions may be of pathogenic relevance. Anatomical studies of this region showed that the nerve branches of the lateral pectoral nerve, having to pierce through a connective tissue septum that is thicker here by a few millimeters, may be subjected to additional risk of compression. Early recognition and treatment are vital to prevent associated morbidity of these rare but serious injuries.

### Fat fractions of the rotator cuff muscles acquired with 2-point dixon MRI: predicting outcome after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair [^fe4e27aa]. Investigative Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Rotator cuff (RC) tears are a common cause of shoulder pain and disability, and its prevalence is known to increase with age.Common symptoms include shoulder pain and weakness of shoulder flexion, abduction, and internal and external rotation, depending on the tear pattern, restricting everyday activities and affecting the quality of life.In case of failed conservative treatment, minimal invasive arthroscopic RC repair is the current criterion standard for treatment of symptomatic full-thickness RC tears. However, retear rates of up to 27% at 2 years after surgery have been reported.

After a tendon tear, the RC muscle undergoes degenerative changes including fatty infiltration and atrophy. – Recent studies correlated preoperative fatty infiltration of the RC muscles with RC repair outcome mainly for the supraspinatus (SSP) muscle, but there are contradicting results in the literature about which threshold of fatty infiltration should be used for outcome prediction. – Improved preoperative screening with reliable biomarkers would be beneficial to predict the risk of retear and select those patients for surgery where a good outcome is likely.

### The increasing incidence of surgically treated quadriceps tendon ruptures [^7d05620a]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Along with other soft-tissue injuries that affect elderly patients, such as Achilles tendon rupture (ATR), patellar tendon rupture (PTR), rotator cuff (RC) lesions, and biceps tendon rupture (BTR), quadriceps tendon rupture (QTR) can also be seen as an end stage of chronic tendon degeneration and overuse. Moreover, knee extensor mechanism injuries may also result from quadriceps or patellar tendon rupture or patellar fractures (PF). More than half of such injuries are PFs, and they usually occur in older female patients. Traditionally, QTR has been regarded as a relatively rare soft-tissue injury that affects elderly patients.

The mean age of patients suffering a QTR has been reported to vary between 47 and 69 years, and QTR is most commonly seen after a simple fall. The rupture commonly follows a sudden contracture of the quadriceps muscle, although spontaneous ruptures do occur. Contrary to other tendon ruptures that affect older patients, non-operative treatment is very seldom reasonable option for QTR. Numerous surgical methods for the treatment of QTR have been proposed, but pooled analyses of level IV studies have found no differences between the different methods with regards to clinical outcomes, complications, and adverse events. Moreover, even after immediate surgical repair, muscle atrophy, strength deficit, and patellofemoral joint incongruency are commonly seen.

At present, there is a scarcity of literature on the incidence of QTR. Only one study reporting the incidence of QTR has been published. In this report from the UK, the annual incidence was 1.37 patients per 100,000 persons. Furthermore, a growing body of research indicates that the incidence of other degenerative tendon ruptures is also increasing. For example, the incidence of ATR has increased in recent years, and this increase is especially prevalent in older patients. In addition, recent studies suggest that the incidences of distal BTRs and RC lesions are also increasing. The major etiological factors that have been suggested to explain these changes are an increase in life expectancy and a more active life style. Together, these factors have resulted in a higher incidence of musculoskeletal degeneration-related diseases. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the incidence of QTR has also undergone a similar rising trend.

### The AIUM practice parameter for the performance of the musculoskeletal ultrasound examination [^892a86a2]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Shoulder ultrasound—during rotator cuff assessment, the cuff should be frequently compressed with the transducer to detect nonretracted tears. Dynamic evaluation of the rotator cuff during shoulder abduction is useful to evaluate the rotator cuff for subacromial or subligamentous impingement. Tear length (partial-thickness tear) or the degree of retraction (full-thickness tear) should be measured on longitudinal views, tear width should be measured on short-axis views, and tear depth should be measured with this thickness assessed, particularly for partial-thickness tears at the articular or bursal margins and intrasubstance tears. It is also useful to measure the distance between the intra-articular portion of the biceps tendon and the anterior edge of the tear on short-axis views; most degenerative tears begin ∼15 mm from the intra-articular portion of the biceps tendon. In patients with a rotator cuff tear, the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor muscles should be examined for fatty infiltration and atrophy; comparison with the contralateral rotator cuff muscles is often helpful; rotator cuff thickness and echogenicity should also be evaluated and a thick, hypoechoic cuff indicates tendinosis; the postoperative rotator cuff may be hypoechoic and/or heterogeneous in the early healing period and may resolve over a period of time. The subacromial–subdeltoid bursa should be examined for the presence of synovial hypertrophy or effusion, and power or color Doppler should also be used to detect hyperemia.

### High-resolution ultrasound of clinically relevant sensory nerves of the arm and the forearm [^e9814810]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Relevance and General Scanning Recommendation

Patients with cutaneous sensory nerve disorders typically experience symptoms resulting from either loss of function (anesthesia) or irritation (paresthesia or stabbing pain) of the affected nerve.The distribution of sensory symptoms along an area supplied by specific nerve can help identify the source of the problem. However, in some cases, the syndromes may be harder to recognize, as major nerve trunks may be affected alongside minor cutaneous nerves (eg, in large penetrating lesions). Additionally, when the affected cutaneous nerve is a terminal branch of a mixed nerve, such as the musculocutaneous nerve, sensory alterations may be associated with atrophy of specific muscle groups.

US imaging can accurately localize the site of injury, assist in formulating a prognosis, and help plan surgical intervention. With recent advances in ultrasound transducer technology, high and very high‐frequency probes (24–33 MHz) are now available, enabling the detection of even subtle pathological changes along the course of millimetric and submillimetric nerves.Cutaneous sensory nerves may be affected by traumatic injuries, compressive syndromes, tumors (Figure 1), diffuse neuropathies (eg, dysimmune conditions), and infectious diseases (eg, leprosy).

Considering the distribution of pain, a systematic scanning of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm (LCNF) was performed. The image in A shows an axial view at the distal third of the arm. The LCNF (white arrowheads) is seen in the fascial plane between biceps and brachialis. More distally (image B) a round, regular, hypoechoic structure along the LCNF is demonstrated (white asterisk), in close proximity to the lateral side of the biceps tendon (outlined arrowheads). The axial image C obtained immediately distally to the mass shows the enlarged LCNF (with arrowheads), as commonly found in proximity to a nerve sheath tumor. The diagnosis of schwannoma was proposed and the mass removed. Outlined arrowhead in A : intramuscular aponeurosis of biceps; white arrow in A : median nerve; BA: brachial artery; outlined arrowheads in C : distal biceps tendon; BRad: brachioradialis.

### Can the sup-ER protocol decrease the prevalence and severity of elbow flexion deformity in brachial plexus birth injuries? [^679a3087]. Hand (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Most brachial plexus birth injuries (BPBIs) spontaneously recover to a clinically functional degree. The management of more severe cases varies with institutional preference,, but outcomes associated with these will usually include some residual functional deficit or cosmetic stigmata. - In the most common BPBI presentation, infants will present with initial paresis of the shoulder and elbow, but as the nerves recover, relative ongoing weakness of external rotation, and supination can lead to long-term well-defined skeletal shoulder imbalances. A similar force balance issue can occur in the elbow. An initial deficit in active elbow flexion is most common, but the natural history through nerve recovery frequently results in long-term elbow flexion contractures. Among a number of theories to explain underlying pathophysiology are included restriction or reduction of longitudinal growth of the flexor muscles, muscle fibrosis, and denervation atrophy of the flexor muscles. - The incidence of elbow flexion contractures in a recent comprehensive scoping review of the subject is reported as 48%, with 21% to 36% of those contractures measuring greater than 30 degrees.These more significant contractures are known to clinically impact both function and aesthetics.

### Inclusion body myositis with early onset: a population-based study [^3f80e25a]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Signs and symptoms

All patients had weakness in muscles typically involved in IBM, including finger flexor and quadriceps muscles. Neck flexion weakness was reported in three patients. Maximal serum CK levels were < 15 times upper limit of normal (ULN) in all patients. Electromyography (EMG) results were available for five patients, who all showed a myopathic pattern. Occasional myotonic discharges were found in the biceps brachii muscle in one patient, but were not present in other examined muscles or in repeated examination. Muscle magnetic resonance tomography (MRI) was performed in one patient and showed atrophy and fat tissue replacement in the distal part of quadriceps femoris muscle, and the anterior compartment of the lower leg. Electrocardiogram was assessed without cardiac conduction defects in all patients. Two patients had left ventricular hypertrophy, one presenting after an episode of Takutsubo cardiomyopathy during a severe pneumonia, and one after several years of hypertonia. In the remaining four patients, there were no records of cardiac involvement.

The most common first symptom was quadriceps weakness (Table 1). Less common muscle symptoms during the disease course included two patients reporting myalgia, and dysarthria, lagophthalmos, finger extension weakness, atrophy of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, atrophy of upper arm, atrophy of lower leg, shoulder atrophy and laryngospasms during sleep reported in one patient each.

Dysphagia was reported in five patients and two had undergone one or more surgical treatments for dysphagia.

Recurrent pneumonia was reported in three patients, all of whom died during the follow up time. Three patients had ventilation assistance, which was started 6, 8 and 15 years from diagnosis. One patient had tracheostomy and a bilevel positive airway pressure breathing device, one an unspecified nighttime ventilator and the third a cough machine. All three patients deceased within four years after start of ventilation assistance.

### The relationship between tear severity, fatty infiltration, and muscle atrophy in the supraspinatus [^8787d152]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Fatty infiltration and muscle atrophy have been described as interrelated characteristic changes that occur within the muscles of the rotator cuff after cuff tears, and both are independently associated with poor outcomes after surgical repair. We hypothesize that fatty infiltration and muscle atrophy are two distinct processes independently associated with supraspinatus tears.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review of 377 patients who underwent shoulder magnetic resonance imaging at one institution was performed. Multivariate analysis was performed based on parameters including age, sex, rotator cuff tear severity, fatty infiltration grade, and muscle atrophy.

Results

A total of 116 patients (30.8%) had full-thickness tears of the supraspinatus, 153 (40.6%) had partial thickness tears, and 108 (28.7%) had no evidence of tear. With increasing tear severity, the prevalence of substantial fatty infiltration (grade ≥2) increased: 6.5% of patients with no tears vs 41.4% for complete tears (P < .001). Similarly, the prevalence of supraspinatus atrophy increased with worsening tear severity: 36.1% of no tears vs 77.6% of complete tears (P < .001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated a significant independent association between fatty infiltration and muscle atrophy when taking into account sex, age, and tear severity.

Conclusions

Fatty infiltration and muscle atrophy are independently associated processes. Fatty infiltration is also related to increasing age, muscle tear severity, and sex, whereas muscle atrophy is related to increasing age but not tear severity. In patients without rotator cuff tears, fatty infiltration and atrophy prevalence increased independently with increasing age.

### Late-onset Becker muscular dystrophy: refining the clinical features and electrophysiological findings [^d009b2f4]. Muscle & Nerve (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The aim of this study was to characterize a unique distribution of muscle involvement in sporadic Becker muscle dystrophy (BMD).

Methods

Retrospective chart review, clinical examination, electrophysiological studies, cardiac testing, and genetic testing were performed in 5 patients.

Results

Predominant weakness and atrophy of biceps brachii, hip adduction, and quadriceps muscles was noted along with calf and extensor forearm hypertrophy. Finger flexor muscles were severely weak in 3 of 5 patients, a feature that could lead to a misdiagnosis of inclusion body myositis. Creatinine kinase was only mildly elevated in most patients. Electromyography was abnormal in all patients. Muscle biopsy in 1 patient demonstrated normal immunostaining for dystrophin.

Conclusions

We found a unique and uniform distribution of muscle involvement in 5 sporadic cases of BMD. Recognizing these features is important for differentiating it from other myopathies that may have similar features and avoids unnecessary invasive procedures such as muscle biopsy.

### Different patterns of fasciculation in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a muscle ultrasonographic study [^efba0b2a]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Background

The usefulness of muscle ultrasonography for detection of fasciculations has been increasingly recognised, particularly in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This study aimed to elucidate distributions and characteristics of fasciculations in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) and to compare the results of those in ALS.

Methods

In 24 SBMA and 16 ALS patients, muscle ultrasonography was systematically performed in the tongue, upper limb muscles (biceps brachii, triceps brachii, first dorsal interosseous (FDI), abductor pollicis brevis and abductor digiti minimi), trunk muscles (Th10 paraspinals and rectus abdominis) and lower limb muscles (vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius). We assessed the presence of fasciculations and the fasciculation intensity (scored from 0 to 3) for each muscle.

Results

All SBMA and ALS patients showed fasciculations at least in two muscles. In SBMA patients, fasciculations were most frequently found in the tongue (100%), FDI (93%) and tibialis anterior (80%), whereas less frequently present in the proximal limb and trunk muscles, irrespective of age, disease duration and CAG repeat numbers. By contrast, in ALS patients, fasciculations were more diffusely distributed including the proximal limb and trunk muscles. When fasciculations were present, the intensity was higher in ALS patients, except for the tongue.

Conclusions

Whereas both diseases exhibit extensive fasciculations, the distribution and intensity are different. SBMA is characterised by prominent involvement in the tongue and distal limb muscles, suggesting different pathophysiology of motor neuronal death in SBMA and ALS.

3.5 Associations of MR outcome measures with MVCF and HFMSE in patients with SMA

We found a weak‐to‐moderate negative association for both MVCF and HFMSE score with FF in flexor (BR and BB) and TB muscles (Figures 7 and 8). A strong positive association was found between MVCF and MD in the TB muscle but not in the flexor (BR and BB) muscles or with FA (Figure 7). Furthermore, we found a strong positive association of MD and a strong negative association of FA with HFMSE score in the TB muscle (Figure 8). Water T2 relaxation time was negatively associated with HFMSE score in the BR and BB muscle, but not in the TB muscle or with MVCF (Figure 8). Lastly, we found no association between FF and age in the patients with SMA (Figure S1).

Subscapularis pathology is difficult to diagnose, in part because of decreased sensitivity and accuracy in identifying tears with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) when compared to other cuff tendons. Artificial intelligence evaluation of patient physical examination and MRI data using a machine learning model shows that arthroscopically confirmed partial- or full-thickness subscapularis tears are highly associated with abnormal subscapularis tendon length, long head of the biceps tears, and subscapularis fatty atrophy, and on physical examination, with weakness with internal rotation and positive lift-off, belly press, and bear hug tests. Today, physicians may use machine learning as a tool, but this model may not currently be sufficient to drastically change practice. However, with continued research and development, which is occurring rapidly, similar models could aid physicians in timely identification of pathology and optimization of preoperative planning, as well as physician training and education.

### A standardized ultrasound approach in neuralgic amyotrophy [^6f440609]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). Medium credibility.

2 PLANNING THE ULTRASONOGRAPHIC APPROACH

A thorough history and physical examination are critical in recognizing NA, as it is primarily a clinical diagnosis.Typical NA, which encompasses approximately 70% of cases, follows a three phase disease progression.Phase one is characterized by acute‐onset, severe, neuropathic pain in the shoulder, lasting an average of 28 days. Pain is typically unilateral with an average numerical rating scale score of 8/10 at onset, continuous, and often accompanied by sensory abnormalities. Phase two is defined by muscle paresis, typically within 2 wk but sometimes as early as 24 h, followed by progressive muscle atrophy. In one large study evaluating 246 patients with NA, the infraspinatus (71.8%), serratus anterior muscle (SAM) (70.0%), supraspinatus muscle (SSM) (65.7%), biceps brachii (61.0%), rhomboids (54.2%), and pronator teres (52.3%) were among the most frequently involved muscles.More recent literature suggests AIN and PIN syndromes, although previously thought to be “isolated” nerve palsies or entrapment syndromes, may actually represent one of the more common manifestations of NA.Phase three is characterized by motor recovery, which typically occurs over several months. Approximately one third of patients will have persistent symptoms beyond 6 mo, and a small percentage will have residual weakness years later. Some patients, particularly those with hereditary NA, may follow an atypical course presenting with painless onset, pure sensory involvement, diaphragm dysfunction, or lumbosacral trunk involvement.

### Early effects of muscle atrophy on shoulder joint development in infants with unilateral birth brachial plexus injury [^a1ecd5fe]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

Shoulder deformities in children with a birth brachial plexus injury (BBPI) are caused by muscle imbalances; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the early interactions between shoulder muscles and shoulder joint development.

Method

In a retrospective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of 36 infants (21 males, 15 females) younger than 12 months (mean 4.8 mo) with unilateral BBPI, volumes and thicknesses of standardized segments of the infraspinatus, subscapularis, and deltoid muscles were measured in both shoulders and expressed as ratios of pathological/unaffected side. The relation between muscle ratios and humeral head subluxation, passive external rotation, glenoid version, and deformity was analysed.

Results

Compared with the unaffected side, the muscles of the affected side were of significantly smaller volume and thickness. The subscapularis was the most severely affected muscle, its volume being only 64% (SD 21%) and its thickness only 79% (SD 23%) of the corresponding values on the unaffected side (p < 0.001). Severe subluxation was predicted by the combination of low infraspinatus and subscapularis volume ratios (r(2) = 0.223; p = 0.014), but not by muscle thickness ratios. Subluxation was related to passive external rotation (p < 0.05), glenoid version (p < 0.01), and deformity (p < 0.01).

Interpretation

In infants with BBPI, muscle size is decreased during in the first months of life by both atrophy and, possibly, by a reduction in the number of sarcomeres in series. These effects are strongly related to shoulder joint subluxation.

### Muscle MRI in patients with dysferlinopathy: pattern recognition and implications for clinical trials [^433f4d5a]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Figure 1 
Axial T1-weighted muscle MRI in dysferlinopathy. The cranial muscles (A–B) more commonly replaced by fat are the tongue (T) and the cervical paraspinal muscles (CPs). Levator scapulae (LS) is generally not involved until later stages of the disease (C, no involvement; D, involvement). In the scapular region (E–H) the subscapularis (Sc) is involved at the early stages; other muscles such as deltoid (De), infraspinatus (Is) or supraspinatus (SS) become progressively involved. Rhomboideus (R) tends to be not involved until later stages of the disease (E–G, no involvement; H, involvement in an advanced case). Biceps brachii (Bi), triceps brachii (Tr) and the anterior muscles of the forearm (FA) are commonly involved (I–K), while the posterior muscles of the forearm (FP) are not involved even in later stages of the disease. Latissimus dorsi (LD) tends to be involved before serratus anterior (SA) in most of the patients (I–J). Paraspinal muscles including the multifidus (M), the longissimus (L) and the iliocostalis (Ic) are affected in most of the patients at symptom onset, while abdominal muscles, such as rectus abdominis (RA) are more resistant and become affected only in latter stages (K). Gluteus minor (GMi) is more severely involved than gluteus medius (GMe) and maximus (GMa) (L–M). Pelvic floor muscles are transformed by fat in patients with dysferlinopathy, with the tensor fascia latae (TFL), obturatorius externus (OE) and internus (OI) being the muscles more commonly involved (N–O). The posterior muscles of the thighs (semimembranosus (Sm), biceps femoris long head (BLH), biceps femoris short head (BSH) or adductor major (AM)) are commonly involved in most of the patients (P–S). BSH tend to be less involved than BLH in early and mid-stage patients (Q). Vasti muscles are commonly involved even in early stages of the diseases (vastus intermedius (VI) in R). In contrast Sartorius (Sa) and gracilis (Gr) are not involved until late stages of the disease (Q and S). Analysis of the lower legs (T–W) shows initial involvement of gastrocnemius medialis (GM) and lateralis (GL) and soleus (So). Peroneus muscles (Pe) are also involved in most of the patients (U). Later in the progression of the disease tibialis anterior (TA) and posterior (TP) become transformed by fat (V–W).

Facio-scapulo-humeral muscular dystrophy

Facio-scapulo-humeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is the third most common muscular dystrophy (worldwide prevalence 1:20,000). FSHD is characterised by asymmetric loss of strength and atrophy of muscular tissue starting in the face and shoulder region. These typical clinical findings are also mirrored on muscle imaging, which shows marked asymmetry and involvement of the medial gastrocnemius, the tibial anterior and the soleus muscles in the lower legs. At the thigh, the most frequently involved muscles are the semimembranosus, followed by the biceps femoris, the semitendinosus muscle and the adductor group muscles.

Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy

Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset autosomal dominant dystrophy, and is clinically characterised by slowly progressive ptosis, dysphagia and dysphonia. Proximal limb weakness often develops subsequently. There are few reports on muscle imaging in OPMD. Abnormal fatty infiltration of the tongue, masseter, neck, shoulder girdle, lumbar paraspinous and the gluteus muscles have been described.

### Rotator cuff tear following long-standing axillary neuropathy in a female motocross racer [^792af252]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Nine weeks later, she sustained acute left shoulder pain and motion loss after she pushed herself upward on her arms to lift herself up while sitting on the back of a pickup truck. Her shoulder motion decreased from 120° to 80° of active overhead elevation. MR images showed a full-thickness tear of the supraspinatus and upper infraspinatus tendons (figure 3) and a full-thickness tear of the intra-articular biceps tendon. This injury was preceded by several months of aggressive physical therapy and shoulder strengthening and exercise. We speculated these activities, coupled with glenohumeral subluxations from chronic deltoid atrophy, had intrinsically weakened her upper rotator cuff and biceps tendon. An open repair of the rotator cuff tear with biceps tenodesis was performed in July 2013 by JGS.

### Idiopathic brachial neuritis [^ae87f0ab]. Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

Parsonage-Turner syndrome (PTS) is a rare syndrome of unknown cause, affecting mainly the lower motor neurons of the brachial plexus. The brachial plexus is a group of nerves that conduct signals from the spine to the shoulder, arm, and hand. PTS is usually characterized by the sudden onset of severe 1-sided shoulder pain, followed by paralysis of the shoulder and lack of muscle control in the arm, wrist, or hand several days later. PTS can vary greatly in presentation and nerve involvement. Also known as brachial plexus neuritis or neuralgic amyotrophy, PTS is a common condition characterized by inflammation of a network of nerves that control and supply, or innervate, the muscles of the chest, shoulders, and arms. Individuals with the condition first experience severe pain across the shoulder and upper arm. Within a few hours or days, weakness, wasting (atrophy), and paralysis may affect the muscles of the shoulder. Although individuals with the condition may experience paralysis of the affected areas for months or, in some cases, years, recovery is usually eventually complete.

A3. Rotator Cuff Repair

Rotator cuff tears are one of the most common causes of musculoskeletal pain and disability and impose significant personal and societal costs. Despite advances in surgical techniques, incomplete healing and retears are common postoperative complications, with retear rats of up to 40% for small and medium tears and more than 90% in large or chronic tears. Incomplete healing and retears impose additional burden on patients and contributes to inferior outcomes.Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve rotator cuff healing rates. The biological hallmarks of a torn rotator cuff are muscle atrophy, fatty infiltration, and intercellular fibrosis of the muscle-tendon unit and are important prognostic factors for treatment.Recent studies with AASs have tried to address this underlying pathophysiology.

Preliminary studies evaluating the effects of AASs on isolated rotator cuff tendon produced contradictory findings on the protective or detrimental role of AASs. The results of the study by Triantafillopoulos et al.in particular, should be interpreted with caution as their group used a bioartificial tendon that produced results inconsistent with much of the available literature. However, a series of experiments involving the rotator cuff musculotendinous unit—not just the tendon itself—have provided valuable new insights on the potential role of AASs to improve rotator cuff healing.

In the first experiment, Gerber et al.released the infraspinatus tendon in six sheep and monitored muscular changes for 40 weeks with CT, histology, and electron microscopy. They found significant fatty infiltration, increased interstitial connective tissue, and a sevenfold decrease in elasticity relative to controls.These physiologic changes initially worsened after repair but, importantly, never improved to prerepair values.Building off this work, this group next performed a pharmacologic intervention study in a rabbit model of rotator cuff tear: when ND was administered (systemically and/or locally) at the time of supraspinatus release, these animals demonstrated significantly less supraspinatus retraction and no fatty infiltration compared with controls with supraspinatus release alone.This was the first work to show partial prevention of musculotendinous changes after rotator cuff release using AASs.

Early onset (proximal) LGMD and dystrophinopathies

In western and central Europe, LGMD2I, LGMD2A and LGMD2B are probably the most common LGMD forms. A muscle biopsy including protein expression analysis is usually necessary to distinguish among LGMD subtypes. LGMDs also present with different patterns of muscle involvement on imaging that might help in the genetic diagnosis. An illustration of different muscle imaging findings in LGMD patients is provided in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4 
Flowchart showing the approach to LGMD. Most LGMD patients have greater affliction of the posterior rather than the anterior thigh compartment muscles. On the other hand, patients with dystrophinopathy and sarcoglycanopathy often have significant affliction of the quadriceps muscle. Dystrophinopathy often presents with early and marked changes in the gastrocnemii muscles, while patients with sarcoglycanopathy show no affliction of these muscles. Patients with dysferlinopathy most often show posterior thigh and posterior lower leg involvement with sparing of the sartorius, gracilis and biceps femoris. However, muscle affection can be variable, but clinically calf atrophy and absence of scapular winging are commonly present. Calpain-3 and FKRP patients present with predominant posterior thigh and posterior lower leg involvement. Calpain-3 patients usually show marked involvement of the soleus and medial gastrocnemius muscles. Furthermore, calf atrophy and scapular winging are usually observed. Conversely, FKRP patients have a more diffuse involvement of the posterior lower leg muscles, while the tibial anterior muscle is often spared or even hypertrophied

### Muscle MRI findings of X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy [^1a08f378]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2004). Low credibility.

We report here muscle MRI findings of the lower limb in X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). T1-weighted imaging of muscle MRI disclosed that the thigh muscles, including the semimembranosus, biceps femoris longus and the vastus lateralis muscles, showed high intensity signals with atrophy. Contrarily, the sartorius, gracilis and rectus femoris muscles were comparably preserved. Not only the thigh muscles, but also the calf muscles including the gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis, and soleus muscles showed high intensity signals. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the leg muscles are generally atrophic, but the selective pattern of fatty degeneration, seen in SBMA was not observed. Muscle MRI is a useful method of estimating the distribution and severity of SBMA in affected muscles.

### Obesity is associated with muscle atrophy in rotator cuff tear [^091ca119]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we present findings from a cross-sectional evaluation of the relationship between obesity and muscle atrophy in individuals with rotator cuff tears from two independent cohorts. We found that, in both MOON and ROW cohorts, BMI was associated with an increased risk of muscle atrophy. However, this relationship reached statistical significance in the MOON cohort, and not in the ROW cohort, likely due to smaller sample size. In meta-analysis, BMI was positively associated with muscle atrophy for all combinations of continuous, categorical or ordinal modelling of exposures and outcomes, when adjusting for age and sex.

Further, we found that all observed associations were consistent among individuals with full-thickness tears even after adjustment for tear size. The clinical implications of this finding are important since they suggest a potential interplay between adiposity and the progression of muscle degeneration. Muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration are the two most important histopathological changes that are well-known predictors of surgical outcomes,where individuals with highly fatty, atrophic tears are often excluded as candidates for surgical repair.Prior work from our group identified positive associations between female sex and obesity with fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff;however, little research has been done on the association of obesity and muscle atrophy.

### Fatty infiltration is a prognostic marker of muscle function after rotator cuff tear [^852cdd31]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Massive rotator cuff tears (RCTs) begin as primary tendon injuries and cause a myriad of changes in the muscle, including atrophy, fatty infiltration (FI), and fibrosis. However, it is unclear which changes are most closely associated with muscle function.

Purpose

To determine if FI of the supraspinatus muscle after acute RCT relates to short-term changes in muscle function.

Study Design

Controlled laboratory study.

Methods

Unilateral RCTs were induced in female rabbits via tenotomy of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. Maximal isometric force and rate of fatigue were measured in the supraspinatus in vivo at 6 and 12 weeks after tenotomy. Computed tomography scanning was performed, followed by histologic analysis of myofiber size, FI, and fibrosis.

Results

Tenotomy resulted in supraspinatus weakness, reduced myofiber size, FI, and fibrosis, but no differences were evident between 6 and 12 weeks after tenotomy except for increased collagen content at 12 weeks. FI was a predictor of supraspinatus weakness and was strongly correlated to force, even after accounting for muscle cross-sectional area. While muscle atrophy accounted for the loss in force in tenotomized muscles with minimal FI, it did not account for the greater loss in force in tenotomized muscles with the most FI. Collagen content was not strongly correlated with maximal isometric force, even when normalized to muscle size.

Conclusion

After RCT, muscle atrophy results in the loss of contractile force from the supraspinatus, but exacerbated weakness is observed with increased FI. Therefore, the level of FI can help predict contractile function of torn rotator cuff muscles.

Clinical Relevance

Markers to predict contractile function of RCTs will help determine the appropriate treatment to improve functional recovery after RCTs.

Pathology of the long head of the biceps tendon is often encountered concurrently with rotator cuff tears. Although both preoperative and intraoperative evaluations may play a role in the decision-making process of when and how to treat the biceps, it can still be a conundrum. The more straightforward tests and reliable evaluation methods we have in our repertoire, the more likely the appropriate treatment choice to address the pathology will be made. The subpectoral biceps test is a helpful examination maneuver as part of the preoperative biceps evaluation.
