## Question

Coronary artery syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about coronary artery syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the terminology and scope because "coronary artery syndrome" is imprecise. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and classification of acute coronary syndromes. Next, I will review clinical presentation and symptom nuances, including sex and age differences. After that, I need to check the diagnostic approach, including ECG, high-sensitivity troponin, and risk stratification. Then, I will examine imaging choices and when to use CCTA, stress testing, or invasive angiography. I should also consider special entities like MINOCA, INOCA, and SCAD. Finally, I will integrate management principles and highlight controversies and evidence gaps, making sure each assertion is supported by guidelines or high-quality studies.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "coronary artery syndrome" is not a standard term. Wait, let me verify the correct nomenclature: the clinical entities are acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and chronic coronary syndromes (CCS), with ACS encompassing unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI, and CCS reflecting stable ischemic heart disease and angina phenotypes, including ischemia with nonobstructive coronary arteries (INOCA) and myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) [^116w8eGK] [^1115ZAZG] [^115E8aFP].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology to anchor classification. ACS is typically triggered by plaque rupture or erosion with superimposed thrombosis and/or microembolism, causing reduced myocardial perfusion and ischemia; unstable angina reflects ischemia without biomarker evidence of necrosis, NSTEMI reflects subendocardial ischemia with necrosis, and STEMI reflects transmural ischemia from complete occlusion, with dynamic progression between these states during evaluation and treatment [^116w8eGK] [^1115ZAZG]. Hold on, I should verify that non-atherosclerotic mechanisms also contribute meaningfully; yes, spontaneous coronary artery dissection, coronary embolism, vasospasm, myocardial bridging, and stress cardiomyopathy are recognized non-atherosclerotic causes of ACS and require different diagnostic and therapeutic strategies [^114mkjkv].

> Next, I should review clinical presentation and symptom patterns. Chest pain or discomfort remains the dominant symptom across sexes, but women more often report accompanying symptoms such as dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting, and are somewhat less likely to report classic chest pain; importantly, there is substantial overlap, so labeling symptoms as "typical" or "atypical" by sex is misleading and should be retired in favor of a unified, symptom-aware approach [^111da6uC] [^1132DNDP] [^111LX9dQ]. I need to ensure I capture age-related nuances: older adults frequently present with dyspnea, fatigue, syncope, confusion, or functional decline, and cognitive impairment or frailty can obscure classic chest pain, delaying recognition and worsening outcomes [^115V5jzk] [^112K3YGc].

> Let me think about the diagnostic approach. I should confirm that the initial assessment hinges on three pillars: clinical history and risk factors, a 12-lead ECG obtained within 10 minutes, and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin with serial measurements using validated 0/1-hour or 0/2-hour algorithms; this combination allows rapid rule-in or rule-out of myocardial infarction in most patients and guides disposition [^1175NKij] [^111da6uC] [^114JBdoX]. Hold on, I should verify the role of repeat ECGs; a single normal ECG does not exclude ACS, and serial ECGs are warranted if symptoms persist or evolve, particularly to detect posterior ischemia or dynamic changes [^114PftFF].

> I should double-check risk stratification tools and thresholds. GRACE and TIMI risk scores help prognosticate and guide intensity of therapy and timing of invasive evaluation; very high-risk NSTE-ACS features mandate immediate invasive angiography, whereas intermediate-risk patients benefit from early invasive management within 24 hours, and low-risk patients may be managed selectively with noninvasive testing prior to discharge [^113fb6dS] [^112SDn2e]. But wait, what if the patient is low risk with normal biomarkers and no ongoing ischemia? In that scenario, a selective invasive approach with stress testing or CCTA prior to discharge is reasonable to refine the need for angiography [^1132XhQ3].

> Next, I should review imaging choices and their evidence base. Coronary CTA is appropriate for low-to-intermediate risk patients with suspected CAD, to exclude obstructive disease and refine pretest probability; however, routine early CCTA in intermediate-risk ED patients with suspected ACS did not improve one-year outcomes in a large RCT, though it reduced invasive angiography use, so patient selection matters [^111p6qne] [^114YC5St]. Let me reconsider functional testing: stress echocardiography, SPECT, PET, and CMR can detect ischemia and help characterize INOCA or myocarditis when anatomy is nonobstructive; CMR is particularly valuable in MINOCA to distinguish myocarditis, Takotsubo, or unrecognized MI patterns [^112FWQvT] [^114qT5NQ]. I should confirm that invasive coronary angiography remains the gold standard when the likelihood of obstructive CAD is high or when very high-risk features are present, and that intravascular imaging or physiologic testing may be needed when angiography is non-diagnostic [^116C5QtS] [^114mkjkv].

> I need to ensure I address special entities. MINOCA accounts for a meaningful fraction of ACS presentations, especially in women, and mandates a structured workup including CMR, echocardiography with strain, and consideration of coronary function testing to identify coronary microvascular dysfunction or vasospasm; management follows secondary prevention principles even when no obstructive lesion is found [^114qT5NQ] [^111doS1Q]. INOCA is common and often underrecognized; functional testing and guideline-directed medical therapy targeting microvascular dysfunction and vasospasm improve symptoms and outcomes, and should be pursued rather than dismissing patients as noncardiac [^1113DhBf] [^116T6SP5]. SCAD predominantly affects younger women and requires a conservative, non-stent-first approach with beta-blockade, avoidance of stressors, and specialist follow-up given recurrence risk and unique pathophysiology [^1164HAvE] [^114mkjkv].

> Let me integrate management principles, and I should confirm they align with contemporary guidelines. For STEMI, immediate reperfusion with PCI is the cornerstone; if PCI is not available within guideline-mandated time frames, fibrinolysis is appropriate, with systems of care optimized to minimize total ischemic time [^116w8eGK] [^116Qcj3X]. For NSTE-ACS, dual antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, high-intensity statin therapy, beta-blockade unless contraindicated, and renin-angiotensin system inhibition are foundational; the intensity and timing of invasive strategy are risk-driven, with very high-risk patients going immediately and intermediate-risk patients proceeding within 24 hours when feasible [^116w8eGK] [^113fb6dS]. Secondary prevention targets LDL-C less than 1.4 mmol/L when possible, blood pressure control, diabetes optimization, smoking cessation, and cardiac rehabilitation, with shared decision-making and patient-reported outcomes informing longitudinal care [^111z7cf6] [^117HCMZo].

> Hold on, I should verify controversies and evidence gaps so I don't overstate certainty. Early routine CCTA in intermediate-risk ED patients did not improve hard outcomes, underscoring the need for selective use rather than blanket adoption; this does not negate CCTA's value in the right patients, but it tempers enthusiasm for routine early use [^114YC5St]. The field is also moving toward a more inclusive "myocardial ischemic syndromes" framework to encompass obstructive and non-obstructive causes, which may reshape diagnostic algorithms and terminology in coming years; clinicians should stay attuned to evolving guidance and trials in INOCA, MINOCA, and coronary function testing [^115E8aFP] [^116kdCgY]. I should double-check that current pathways still emphasize ECG and hs-troponin as the diagnostic backbone while integrating imaging and risk scores judiciously; yes, that remains the consensus across major guidelines [^116w8eGK] [^111da6uC].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical message is precise: "coronary artery syndrome" should be framed as ACS or CCS, with diagnosis grounded in history, ECG, and hs-troponin, followed by risk stratification and imaging tailored to pretest probability and clinical risk; recognizing sex- and age-related symptom patterns, and maintaining vigilance for non-obstructive etiologies like MINOCA, INOCA, and SCAD, are essential to avoid missed diagnoses and to deliver guideline-concordant, patient-centered care [^116w8eGK] [^111da6uC] [^115E8aFP].

Coronary artery syndrome refers to **acute coronary syndromes (ACS)** — STEMI, NSTEMI, and unstable angina — and **chronic coronary syndromes (CCS)** — stable angina and ischemia with nonobstructive coronary arteries (INOCA) [^116w8eGK] [^115E8aFP]. ACS is typically due to **plaque rupture/erosion with thrombosis** [^116w8eGK], causing myocardial ischemia or infarction; CCS reflects fixed epicardial obstruction or microvascular dysfunction [^115E8aFP]. Diagnosis relies on **symptoms, ECG, and high-sensitivity troponin** [^116w8eGK], with imaging (CCTA, stress testing, invasive angiography) guiding risk stratification and management [^113uwCwW]. Immediate reperfusion is lifesaving for STEMI [^116w8eGK]; all ACS requires antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy, risk-based invasive evaluation, and intensive secondary prevention [^111z7cf6]. CCS management focuses on guideline-directed medical therapy, lifestyle change, and revascularization for persistent symptoms or high-risk anatomy [^116pwjaV] [^116C5QtS].

---

## Classification and pathophysiology

ACS is classified as **STEMI, NSTEMI, or unstable angina**, driven by plaque disruption with thrombosis and ischemia [^116w8eGK]; CCS includes stable angina and INOCA, often due to fixed obstruction or microvascular dysfunction [^115E8aFP].

---

## Clinical presentation

ACS typically presents with **chest pain or anginal equivalents** (dyspnea, nausea, syncope) [^111da6uC]; women and older adults more often have atypical symptoms, delaying care [^1132DNDP] [^115V5jzk]. CCS presents with predictable exertional chest discomfort relieved by rest or nitroglycerin [^115zp983].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Initial assessment**: History, risk factors, vitals, and a 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes [^1175NKij].
- **Biomarkers**: High-sensitivity troponin is the standard for myocardial injury; serial testing enables rapid rule-in/rule-out [^111da6uC] [^114JBdoX].
- **Imaging**: CCTA, stress testing, and invasive angiography are used based on risk and pretest probability [^113uwCwW] [^116C5QtS].

---

## Management strategies

### Acute coronary syndromes

- **STEMI**: Immediate reperfusion with PCI or fibrinolysis if PCI is delayed [^116w8eGK].
- **NSTEMI/UA**: Risk-stratified antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy, early invasive evaluation for high-risk patients [^116w8eGK] [^113fb6dS].
- **Secondary prevention**: High-intensity statins, beta-blockers, ACEi/ARBs, lifestyle modification, and cardiac rehabilitation [^111z7cf6].

---

### Chronic coronary syndromes

- **Medical therapy**: Antianginals, risk-factor control, and lifestyle change [^116pwjaV].
- **Revascularization**: PCI or CABG for persistent symptoms or high-risk anatomy despite optimal therapy [^116C5QtS] [^116pwjaV].
- **Follow-up**: Annual review of symptoms, function, adherence, and complications [^111uri5N].

---

## Prognosis and complications

ACS carries high short- and long-term risks of recurrence, heart failure, arrhythmias, and death; outcomes improve with **timely reperfusion and guideline-directed therapy** [^111z7cf6]. CCS prognosis varies with ischemia burden and comorbidities; INOCA is underrecognized and associated with persistent symptoms and adverse outcomes [^116T6SP5].

---

## Emerging trends and controversies

- **High-sensitivity troponin**: Enables earlier detection but increases detection of non-ACS myocardial injury, requiring clinical correlation [^112jFgm9].
- **MINOCA/INOCA**: Highlight the need to evaluate nonobstructive causes and tailor therapy [^114mkjkv] [^1113DhBf].
- **Imaging**: CCTA is expanding in ED pathways, but routine early CCTA did not improve outcomes in intermediate-risk ACS [^114YC5St].

---

Coronary artery syndrome spans ACS and CCS, unified by myocardial ischemia; **early, accurate diagnosis and risk-stratified, guideline-concordant therapy** are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality [^116w8eGK].

When older adults experience acute coronary syndrome (ACS), they often present with what are considered "atypical" symptoms. Because their symptoms less often match the expected presentation of ACS, older patients can have delayed time to assessment, to performance of an electrocardiogram, to diagnosis, and to definitive management. Unfortunately, it is this very group of patients who are at the highest risk for having ACS and for complications from ACS. This article aims to outline presentation, outcomes, and potential solutions of underrecognition of ACS in the older adult population.

### Definition, classification, and pathophysiology of acute coronary ischemic syndromes [^113dfFuX]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is now used to describe a spectrum of clinical presentations that share an underlying pathophysiology, replacing the previous nomenclature of ischemic chest pain. The accurate diagnosis and proper management of patients with these entities require the emergency medicine physician to consider the entire spectrum of ACS, with emphasis placed on early diagnosis and rapid treatment. Each of these syndromes has its own prognosis, pathophysiology, and specific management strategy.

### Typical and atypical symptoms of acute coronary syndrome: time to retire the terms? [^116QNbp2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Symptoms are the trigger that propel individuals with symptoms suspicious of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to seek emergent care for this potentially life‐threatening condition. After 3 decades of research on sex differences in the symptoms of ACS, ample evidence suggests that although sex differences in symptoms exist, they are modest and do not contribute significantly to risk stratification or provide a rationale for diagnostic testing based on sex. In a large prospective study, we found that only 3 of 13 common symptoms were predictive of a diagnosis of ACS versus non‐ACS. The predictive value of shoulder pain (odds ratio: 2.53 [95% CI, 1.29–4.96] versus 1.11 [95% CI, 0.67–1.85]) and arm pain (odds ratio: 2.15 [95% CI, 1.10–4.20] versus 1.21 [95% CI, 0.74–1.99]) for women were nearly twice that of men. Shortness of breath was predictive of a non‐ACS diagnosis for men only. 1

Scores of authors have found some sex differences in symptoms of ACS, 2, 3 but small differences were usually based on frequency and distribution of symptoms, not the type of symptom. In many studies, statistical significance was reached when sex differences were as small as a few percentage points. Kahn et al 4 found, for example, that men reported chest pain more frequently than women (86.3% versus 81%; P = 0.03). We must distinguish between clinical significance (whether the magnitude of difference is large enough to change clinical care) and statistical significance (which is subject to variability in sampling and measurement) in assessing patients for further intervention. A more critical issue than sex differences in symptoms is likely the magnitude of symptom overlap in individuals ruled in and out for ACS. Approximately 10% to 15% of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with symptoms suggestive of ACS are actually experiencing ACS, 5, 6 yet the other 85% of patients look so similar that the same diagnostic testing and resources are required to safely rule them out for ACS. Numerous clinical‐decision aids to assess risk for ACS in the ED have been validated over the years, some with 100% sensitivity. 5 Many of these clinical‐decision or prediction rules have facilitated transfer of low‐risk patients to a chest‐pain or clinical‐decision unit or early discharge from the ED. 7

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain evaluation and diagnosis take-home messages emphasize that clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making and information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed. Clinical decision pathways for chest pain in the emergency department and outpatient settings should be used routinely. Chest pain is the dominant and most frequent symptom for both men and women ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, and women may be more likely to present with accompanying symptoms such as nausea and shortness of breath. Patients with acute or stable chest pain who are at intermediate risk or intermediate to high pre-test risk of obstructive coronary artery disease, respectively, will benefit the most from cardiac imaging and testing. Noncardiac is in and atypical is out; "Noncardiac" should be used if heart disease is not suspected, and "Atypical" is a misleading descriptor of chest pain and its use is discouraged. Structured risk assessment should be used and, for patients presenting with acute or stable chest pain, risk for coronary artery disease and adverse events should be estimated using evidence-based diagnostic protocols.

Patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) remain amongst the highest-risk of all acute medical admissions. Despite significant reductions in morbidity and mortality via refinements in treatment methods in recent years, such individuals remain at a high risk of recurrent ischaemic events and death. Whilst 2012 has brought a wealth of novel data in the field of ACS regarding diagnosis and both medical and invasive management strategies, continued focus on this high-risk patient subset is necessary to further our understanding and improve patient outcomes.

### Diagnosis and management of acute coronary syndrome: an evidence-based update [^112DEibv]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) describes the range of myocardial ischemic states that includes unstable angina, non-ST elevated myocardial infarction (MI), or ST-elevated MI. ACS is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality and places a large financial burden on the health care system. The diagnosis of ACS begins with a thorough clinical assessment of a patient's presenting symptoms, electrocardiogram, and cardiac troponin levels as well as a review of past medical history. Early risk stratification can assist clinicians in determining whether an early invasive management strategy or an initial conservative strategy should be pursued and can help determine appropriate pharmacologic therapies. Key components in the management of ACS include coronary revascularization when indicated; prompt initiation of dual antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation; and consideration of adjuvant agents including β blockers, inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system, and HmG-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors. It is essential for clinicians to take an individualized approach to treatment and consider long-term safety and efficacy when managing patients with a history of ACS after hospital discharge.

### Typical and atypical symptoms of acute coronary syndrome: time to retire the terms? [^111m62Hu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

It is vitally important to remember that symptoms are cues for patients that a problem exists. Symptoms trigger clinicians to obtain ECGs, which drive subsequent clinical decision‐making such as activation of the cardiac catheterization laboratory for emergent percutaneous coronary intervention. 15 Nearly all patients presenting to the ED are undifferentiated. Neither the patient nor the clinician knows what the diagnosis is until testing is complete. Many emergency medical systems now have the capacity to do prehospital ECGs, Nevertheless, we found in our recent study that only 44.6% of patients with ACS arrived at the ED via emergency medical systems. In addition, a minority of patients (24.6%) experienced STEMI, and only 56.3% of patients with STEMI called emergency medical systems. This leaves a large number of patients presenting to the ED without a diagnosis. 13 In addition, individuals presenting to emergency medical systems with chest pain are significantly more likely to receive prehospital ECG compared with those who have nonchest symptoms. Consequently, despite greater availability of prehospital ECG equipment, if the patient does not report chest pain, then they are disadvantaged from even receiving a prehospital ECG. 16 Including patients with STEMI is vital to determining true differences or similarities in symptoms between female and male patients, particularly because STEMI is a true emergency requiring time‐dependent reperfusion therapy.

In the Clinical Perspective section of their article, Ferry et al 8 state that women with MI are at risk of underdiagnosis and undertreatment if "correct" symptom presentations are not recognized. Researchers, including our team, have spent years attempting to identify sex differences in the symptoms of ACS to provide evidence for clinicians to facilitate expeditious diagnosis and for the public to be able to respond quickly to symptoms. To suggest that there is a "correct" presentation implies there is an "incorrect" symptom presentation, which is not supported by numerous previous studies. 1, 17, 18 Assuming a correct presentation can also imply that there is a "standard" symptom presentation, also unsupported by the data to date. The critical question is, are there really typical or atypical symptoms, and if so, who is the reference group? We propose that researchers and clinicians either discontinue using the terms typical and atypical or provide the reference group to which the terms apply (eg, men versus women).

Chest pain evaluation and diagnosis — top take-home messages include that pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. Patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9-1-1, and the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identification or exclusion of life-threatening causes. Clinically stable patients presenting with chest pain should be included in decision-making; information about risk of adverse events, radiation exposure, costs, and alternative options should be provided to facilitate the discussion. For patients with acute or stable chest pain determined to be low risk, urgent diagnostic testing for suspected coronary artery disease is not needed.

Syndromes of cardiac ischemia with nonobstructive coronary arteries have been increasingly recognized as a clinical entity with heterogeneous clinical presentations, commonly encountered in women. Knowledge of pathophysiology and clinical risk factors is key to ensuring appropriate diagnostic evaluation and management for these often-neglected patients. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical presentations of these syndromes. We provide algorithms for diagnosis and management of these entities based on current scientific knowledge and highlight some of the key knowledge gaps and ongoing trials in this emerging field.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chest pain-possible acute coronary syndrome [^116MXEMW]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chest pain is a frequent cause for emergency department visits and inpatient evaluation, with particular concern for acute coronary syndrome as an etiology, since cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Although history-based, electrocardiographic, and laboratory evaluations have shown promise in identifying coronary artery disease, early accurate diagnosis is paramount and there is an important role for imaging examinations to determine the presence and extent of anatomic coronary abnormality and ischemic physiology, to guide management with regard to optimal medical therapy or revascularization, and ultimately to thereby improve patient outcomes. A summary of the various methods for initial imaging evaluation of suspected acute coronary syndrome is outlined in this document. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Stratified medicine for acute and chronic coronary syndromes: a patient-tailored approach [^112ghnSt]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The traditional approach to management of cardiovascular disease relies on grouping clinical presentations with common signs and symptoms into pre-specified disease pathways, all uniformly treated according to evidence-based guidelines ("one-size-fits-all"). The goal of precision medicine is to provide the right treatment to the right patients at the right time, combining data from time honoured sources (e.g., history, physical examination, imaging, laboratory) and those provided by multi-omics technologies. In patients with ischemic heart disease, biomarkers and intravascular assessment can be used to identify endotypes with different pathophysiology who may benefit from distinct treatments. This review discusses strategies for the application of stratified management to patients with acute and chronic coronary syndromes.

### Management of acute coronary syndrome [^115cynDQ]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

One of the most common complaints encountered in the emergency department is chest pain. In many evaluations, the leading diagnostic consideration is an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ACS refers to a spectrum of coronary artery pathologies, including unstable angina, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The distinction between subtypes of ACS guides acute diagnostic and management decisions. Failure to diagnose and manage ACS properly is a frequent cause of medico-legal litigation. In this article, we review the initial identification and critical management steps in patients presenting to the emergency department with ACS.

Patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) remain a challenging medical condition with potential in improving outcome despite major advances over recent years. During the year 2013, progress has been made with respect to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms and diagnosing ACS. In addition, new studies provided fundamental insights the optimal management, particularly with respect to the best antithrombotic regimen.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Sex-specific chest pain presentation — among patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS), a prospective trial of 1941 patients (39% women) reported chest pain in 92% of women and 91% of men, and women with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were more likely to present with "typical" symptoms than men (77% versus 59%; P = 0.007). In younger populations, young men and women (< 50 years of age) were equally likely to present with chest pain, and in those with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) there was no sex difference in the occurrence of chest pain.

Implications for Future Research and Clinical Practice

This review shows that sex differences in symptoms among patients with confirmed ACS have been established in the literature for more than a decade. To address the remaining uncertainties, such as how sex differences in symptom presentation may differ by age or other patient characteristics, future research should focus on standardized data collection and reporting. Our findings suggest that researchers and medical professionals should refrain from labeling symptoms of ACS as "typical" and "atypical", and, instead, consider the established differences and overlap in symptom presentation between men and women in future studies and clinical practice. Consequently, we need to educate medical professionals more to be familiar with the existing sex differences and overlap. Moreover, studies comparing the symptoms of women and men with a suspicion of ACS, but before the clinical diagnosis, are needed to improve the diagnosis of ACS in routine care. The studies included in the present review were conducted among patients with confirmed ACS. As such, our findings alone cannot be used in the development of diagnostic tools, as a comparison of symptoms among women and men with and without confirmed ACS is required.

### Acute coronary syndrome: current treatment [^111wJMV2]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Family physicians need to identify and mitigate risk factors early, as well as recognize and respond to acute coronary syndrome events quickly in any clinical setting. Diagnosis can be made based on patient history, symptoms, electrocardiography findings, and cardiac biomarkers, which delineate between ST elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome. Rapid reperfusion with primary percutaneous coronary intervention is the goal with either clinical presentation. Coupled with appropriate medical management, percutaneous coronary intervention can improve short- and long-term outcomes following myocardial infarction. If percutaneous coronary intervention cannot be performed rapidly, patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction can be treated with fibrinolytic therapy. Fibrinolysis is not recommended in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome; therefore, these patients should be treated with medical management if they are at low risk of coronary events or if percutaneous coronary intervention cannot be performed. Post-myocardial infarction care should be closely coordinated with the patient's cardiologist and based on a comprehensive secondary prevention strategy to prevent recurrence, morbidity, and mortality.

### Early diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome [^112jFgm9]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation of acute chest pain has been augmented in recent years by advances in the sensitivity and precision of cardiac troponin assays, new biomarkers, improvements in imaging modalities, and release of new clinical decision algorithms. This progress has enabled physicians to diagnose or rule-out acute myocardial infarction earlier after the initial patient presentation, usually in emergency department settings, which may facilitate prompt initiation of evidence-based treatments, investigation of alternative diagnoses for chest pain, or discharge, and permit better utilization of healthcare resources. A non-trivial proportion of patients fall in an indeterminate category according to rule-out algorithms, and minimal evidence-based guidance exists for the optimal evaluation, monitoring, and treatment of these patients. The Cardiovascular Round Table of the ESC proposes approaches for the optimal application of early strategies in clinical practice to improve patient care following the review of recent advances in the early diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. The following specific 'indeterminate' patient categories were considered: (i) patients with symptoms and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin < 99th percentile; (ii) patients with symptoms and high-sensitivity troponin < 99th percentile but above the limit of detection; (iii) patients with symptoms and high-sensitivity troponin > 99th percentile but without dynamic change; and (iv) patients with symptoms and high-sensitivity troponin > 99th percentile and dynamic change but without coronary plaque rupture/erosion/dissection. Definitive evidence is currently lacking to manage these patients whose early diagnosis is 'indeterminate' and these areas of uncertainty should be assigned a high priority for research.

### Acute coronary syndromes: initial evaluation and risk stratification [^115J6EpD]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Chest pain, the second most frequent presenting complaint in the emergency department (ED), often poses a challenge to the physicians dealing with these patients owing to the wide spectrum of presentation of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). A majority of the patients presenting with chest pain are usually admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Despite the availability of modern-day tools for diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), about 5% of patients with AMI are missed in the ED with subsequent associated morbidity and mortality and legal consequences. Several centers have adapted critical pathways derived from American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for the management of patients presenting with ACS. We now have some evidence suggesting adherence to the critical pathways derived from ACC/AHA guidelines will optimize the quality of patient care and probably result in better patient outcomes. This article reviews initial evaluation and the importance of risk stratification of the patients presenting with chest pain using the currently available clinical and diagnostic tools. Critical pathways derived from the ACC/AHA guidelines for various presentations of ACS are also reviewed.

### Acute coronary syndrome: diagnostic evaluation [^1175NKij]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Myocardial infarction (MI), a subset of acute coronary syndrome, is damage to the cardiac muscle as evidenced by elevated cardiac troponin levels in the setting of acute ischemia. Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of mortality in the United States. Chest pain is a common presentation in patients with MI; however, there are multiple noncardiac causes of chest pain, and the diagnosis cannot always be made based on initial presentation. The assessment of a possible MI includes evaluation of risk factors and presenting signs and symptoms, rapid electrocardiography, and serum cardiac troponin measurements. A validated risk score, such as the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction score, may also be useful. Electrocardiography should be performed within 10 minutes of presentation. ST elevation MI is diagnosed with ST segment elevation in two contiguous leads on electrocardiography. In the absence of ST segment elevation, non-ST elevation ACS can be diagnosed. An elevated cardiac troponin level is required for diagnosis, and an increase or decrease of at least 20% is consistent with MI. In some patients with negative electrocardiography findings and normal cardiac biomarkers, additional testing may further reduce the likelihood of coronary artery disease. Cardiac catheterization is the standard method for diagnosing coronary artery disease, but exercise treadmill testing, a stress myocardial perfusion study, stress echocardiography, and computed tomography are noninvasive alternatives.

### Relations of sex to diagnosis and outcomes in acute coronary syndrome [^113AnQ1L]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Presentation

Consistent with data of the literature, women in our pooled analysis were older than men on presentation. 1, 3 In contrast to earlier, mostly registry‐based data, we did not observe a higher proportion of cardiovascular risk factors in women with suspected ACS or a final diagnosis of ACS. Elevated body mass index, dyslipidemia, smoking and a history of coronary artery disease were more prevalent in men. These results are similar to more recent data of cohorts with patients suggestive of ACS. 24, 25

Previous studies suggested that women with ACS more often present with "atypical" symptoms, in particular with absence of typical chest pain. 3, 4, 26 In our analyses, the majority of both sexes had some kind of chest pain. In line with prior examinations, other "atypical" symptoms were more often observed in women (dyspnea, nausea and vomiting). It is known that women are more likely to report multiple symptoms in the case of myocardial ischemia. 27 In the overall cohort, women reported more symptoms than men. Thus, atypical symptoms appear to be concurrent to typical presentation with chest pain. In patients with a final diagnosis of ACS, reported symptoms were not significantly different.

A history of coronary artery disease and ST‐segment‐elevation on the first ECG were significantly associated with sex and ACS. Both variables were more frequent in men, which is consistent with the literature. Women more often present with non‐ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction or non‐occlusive coronary disease when diagnosed with ACS. 28 However, if present, prior coronary artery disease or ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction were much more strongly associated with ACS in women and may clearly help in the early differential diagnosis.

Furthermore, there was no significant sex‐specific difference in time from onset of symptoms to admission at the emergency department in our cohort. Former studies consistently showed longer time from onset of symptoms to presentation to emergency department for women, 29, 30, 31 whereas in more recent data, the time delay until hospital admission for women with ACS has diminished and may indicate beneficial trends in ACS management in women. 24

The decision to discharge a patient where ACS cannot be excluded may result in a life‐threatening outcome, while on the other hand, admission in case of atypical chest pain can lead to unnecessary medical treatment and costs. Risk score models may help the physician in making a timely decision in the emergency setting. Patients with an assumed high probability of an ACS should receive their ECG as fast as possible.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Older adults with chest pain — In patients with chest pain who are > 75 years of age, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) should be considered when accompanying symptoms such as shortness of breath, syncope, or acute delirium are present, or when an unexplained fall has occurred. Increased age is a significant risk factor for ACS, and although patients > 75 years of age account for 33% of all cases of ACS, alternative diagnoses are still more common than a cardiac cause of chest pain at presentation. A substudy of the PROMISE trial has shown that patients ≥ 75 years of age with stable symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease (CAD) are more likely to have a positive noninvasive test and more coronary artery calcification than younger people; for these older patients, when compared with anatomic noninvasive testing for obstructive CAD with cardiac CT, a positive stress test result was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction.

3 The ACS Spectrum

In advancing the science and implementation, the 2023 Guidelines offer a conceptual approach of five items: think A.C.S. at the initial assessment, think invasive management, think antithrombotic therapy, think revascularization, and think secondary prevention. To further explain the thinking A.C.S. at the initial evaluation of patients with suspected ACS, "A" relates to an abnormal ECG (performing an ECG urgently to assess for evidence of ischemia or other abnormalities), "C" considers the clinical context and other available investigations, and "S" for stable, performing an examination to assess whether the patient is clinically and vitally stable.

The guidelines (Figure 1) graphically explore the spectrum of clinical presentations such that the patient may initially have had chest pain, but at presentation either has minimal or no symptoms; to the patient with increasing chest pain or other symptoms; to the patient with persistent chest pain or symptoms; to the patient with cardiogenic shock or acute heart failure; and finally, the patient who presents with a cardiac arrest. The ECG may be normal at presentation, may have ST segment depression as potentially an NSTEMI, or may have ST segment elevation leading to the immediate diagnosis of STEMI. If the high‐sensitivity troponin is not elevated, the resultant diagnosis is unstable angina, but the characteristic rise and fall of high‐sensitivity troponin does not differentiate between NSTEMI and STEMI.

### Coronary artery revascularization in the older adult population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112K3YGc]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Atypical presentations of ischemia in older adults — Compared with younger patients, older adults are more likely to present with dyspnea, fatigue, syncope, confusion, or functional decline and less likely to report chest pain; these atypical symptoms may delay diagnosis and contribute to underrecognition of ACS, particularly in the setting of cognitive impairment or frailty. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion and consider early objective testing or consultation when nonspecific symptoms occur in patients with elevated cardiovascular risk.

Figure 1
The spectrum of clinical presentations, electrocardiographic findings, and high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin levels in patients with acute coronary syndrome.

As noted, the initial ACS assessment includes the electrocardiogram, physical examination, clinical history, vital signs, and high‐sensitivity troponin trends. An ST elevation MI is readily apparent from the electrocardiogram, but patients with NSTE‐ACS should be divided into those with very high‐risk features and those without such very high‐risk features. Very high‐risk features include hemodynamic instability or cardiogenic shock; recurrent or ongoing chest pain, refractory to medical management; acute heart failure presumed secondary to ongoing myocardial ischemia; life‐threatening arrhythmias or cardiac arrest after presentation; mechanical complications; or recurrent dynamic electrocardiographic changes suggestive of ischemia.

Patients with STEMI require immediate angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as appropriate (or thrombolysis if timely PCI is not feasible), as do the NSTE‐ACS patients with very high‐risk features. For NSTE‐ACS without very high‐risk features, angiography should be considered within the initial 24 h. The results of angiography determine the need for PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Then warranted is the consideration of long‐term medical therapy and lifestyle measures, with an emphasis on smoking cessation.

### Angina: contemporary diagnosis and management [^116T6SP5]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The optimal management of patients with known or suspected angina begins with establishing the correct diagnosis. Around one half of angina patients have no obstructive coronary disease; many of these patients have microvascular and/or vasospastic angina. Non-invasive assessment with CTCA is a sensitive anatomical test for plaque which assists in initial treatment and risk stratification. Anatomical imaging has fundamental limitations to rule in or rule out coronary vasomotion disorders in patients with symptoms and/or signs of ischaemia but no obstructive CAD (INOCA). Women are disproportionately represented in this group with MVA and/or VSA, the two most common causes of diagnoses. A personalised approach to invasive diagnostic testing permits a diagnosis to be made (or excluded) during the patients' index presentation. This approach helps stratify medical therapy leading to improved patient health and quality of life. Physician appraisal of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) should consider all pathophysiology relevant to symptoms, prognosis and treatment to improve health outcomes for our patients. More research is warranted, particularly to develop disease modifying therapy.

Key points

Angina pectoris is a clinical syndrome occurring in patients with or without obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease.
Diagnostic testing in angina is symptom driven and so should provide patients and their physicians with an explanation for their symptoms and used to stratify management and offer prognostic insights.
Microvascular and/or vasospastic angina are common disorders of coronary artery function that may be overlooked by anatomical coronary testing, leading to false reassurance and adverse prognostic implications.

### Pre-test characteristics of unstable angina patients with obstructive coronary artery disease confirmed by coronary angiography [^116U1zxT]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute chest pain is one of the most common presenting symptoms in emergency departments. It poses a challenge to healthcare systems as critical conditions require prompt diagnosis and treatment, whereas benign disorders need to be identified early to prevent unnecessary and potentially harmful procedures. Suspected acute coronary syndrome refers to patients with chest pain presumably caused by acute myocardial ischaemia and encompasses myocardial infarction (MI) and unstable angina (UA). Patients with UA have no evidence of myocardial injury. New, high-sensitive cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays detect myocardial injury in a group of patients previously diagnosed as UA, thus changing the diagnosis to MI. Consequently, the present UA population have lower mortality and are less likely to have obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD).

Despite this, the fear of missing an impending MI results in a liberal referral practice of patients with presumed UA to acute coronary angiography (CAG). European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndrome in patients without ST elevation recommend performing CAG within 72 hours if there is either an intermediate Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk score (109–140), relevant comorbidity, recurrence of symptoms or a positive ECG or stress test.GRACE risk score predicts the risk of MI and death and is included in the guidelines as a tool to risk stratify these patients.

A better pre-test selection is warranted. We aimed to assess the GRACE risk score, guidelines risk criteria and other clinical factors capability of predicting obstructive CAD in patients referred for acute CAG on the indication of UA.

### Early computed tomography coronary angiography in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome: randomised controlled trial [^115TgsLv]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

This multicentre, randomised controlled trial aimed to establish the clinical effectiveness of early CT coronary angiography in the management and outcome of patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected acute coronary syndrome or with a provisional diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. We found no evidence that CT coronary angiography had an effect on the one year rate of death or subsequent non-fatal myocardial infarction. Also, no evidence of benefit for any of the prespecified subgroup analyses or key secondary outcomes, or length of stay, was found. We conclude that the routine use of early CT coronary angiography is not an appropriate strategy to reduce one year clinical events in intermediate risk patients with acute chest pain.

We recruited a large population of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome or those with a provisional diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome who had a spectrum of risk, reflected in the range of GRACE scores. Our trial population was equally composed of those who had or did not have a final diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome, and those who had or did not have obstructive coronary artery disease, a population that was truly representative of patients with an intermediate level of risk.

### Chest CT examinations in patients presenting with acute chest pain: a pictorial review [^112GwKKo]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute chest pain is one of the most common presenting symptoms at the emergency department (ED), up to 10% of all ED admissions in the United States. The differential diagnosis is vast and includes aortic, coronary artery, pericardial and pulmonary diseases such as pulmonary embolism, thereby frequently providing a diagnostic challenge. Although the primary diagnostic goal is to exclude life threatening causes such as acute coronary artery syndrome (ACS, referred to as a symptomatic coronary artery stenosis or myocardial infarction, i.e. reduced coronary artery flow leading to acute cardiac ischemic states), in only a minority of the patients with acute chest pain ACS is there ultimately a confirmed diagnosis, yielding a substantial number of possible alternative diagnosis. On the contrary, missing the diagnosis of ACS accounts for frequent litigation and is reported in patients with atypical presentations, such as those of younger age or without electrocardiography (ECG) abnormalities. In the last decade, computed tomography (CT) imaging has become a powerful tool in the diagnostic process, aiming to decrease false negative outcomes and providing clues for an alternative diagnosis.

Different modalities have been proposed in the workup of suspected ACS. In the (sub) acute setting the availability and speed of ECG gated CT has lead mainly to an increase in acute thoracic CT exams. A variety of scanning protocols have been developed and extensively studied for this diagnostic question. The expected increase in chest "rule-out" CT scans in patients with acute chest pain stresses the need for radiologists to be aware of an alternative diagnosis. We retrospectively identified patients who presented with acute chest pain at the ED in our hospitals, and selected the most educative cases, not aiming to present a complete overview of all causes of chest pain. The present pictorial essay reviews, thus, some of the alternative diagnoses, focused on aortic, coronary artery, pericardial and pulmonary diseases, which may help the general radiologist in clinical practice.

### Acute coronary syndromes [^111z7cf6]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Although substantial progress has been made in the diagnosis and treatment of acute coronary syndromes, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death globally, with nearly half of these deaths due to ischaemic heart disease. The broadening availability of high-sensitivity troponin assays has allowed for rapid rule-out algorithms in patients with suspected non-ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Dual antiplatelet therapy is recommended for 12 months following an acute coronary syndrome in most patients, and additional secondary prevention measures including intensive lipid-lowering therapy (LDL-C < 1.4 mmol/L), neurohormonal agents, and lifestyle modification, are crucial. The scientific evidence for diagnosis and management of acute coronary syndromes continues to evolve rapidly, including adapting to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted all aspects of care. This Seminar provides a clinically relevant overview of the pathobiology, diagnosis, and management of acute coronary syndromes, and describes key scientific advances.

### Sex differences in symptom presentation in acute coronary syndromes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1132DNDP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta‐analysis of 27 studies including > 1 million patients shows that sex differences exist in the symptom presentation in patients with confirmed ACS, while at the same time overlap in symptoms between men and women with confirmed ACS is substantial. Women with ACS have higher odds of presenting with pain between the shoulder blades, nausea or vomiting and shortness of breath compared with men. In contrast, women with ACS have lower odds of presenting with chest pain and diaphoresis compared with their male counterparts. No significant sex differences were found in presentation with left or right arm and shoulder pain, stomach or epigastric pain and indigestion. The cumulative meta‐analyses show that more recent studies did not add materially to the available evidence. For both sexes, chest pain, diaphoresis, shortness of breath, left arm and left shoulder pain, and nausea or vomiting were found to be the most prevalent symptoms.

This present meta‐analyses updates and importantly extends earlier systematic reviews of sex differences in ACS symptom presentation, 12, 13, 15 by including more recently published studies, with larger sample sizes and more standardized methods of data collection such as the McSweeney Acute and Prodromal Myocardial Infarction Symptom Survey 14 and 13‐item Acute Coronary Syndrome checklist 11 and by investigating a broader range of symptoms. Through cumulative meta‐analyses, we demonstrated that sex differences in symptoms for patients with established ACS have been evident since the early 2000s and hardly changed over time since then. Altogether, our results are consistent with previous systematic reviews, which also concluded that women with ACS are less likely to report chest pain and more likely to report a variety of symptoms than men with ACS. 12, 13, 15

Over the past 2 decades, considerable research has been done on sex differences in the pathophysiology, symptom presentation, and outcomes of IHD. 46 Studies have shown that younger women with ACS present more often with type II ACS, 47, 48 characterized by coronary artery spasms and vascular dysfunction, 16, 47, 48 whereas younger men present more often with type I ACS, caused by coronary artery obstruction. 47, 48 In addition, at all ages, women with ACS less often have plaque ruptures and present more frequently with plaque erosions than men with ACS. 47, 49 Whilst progress in the understanding of sex differences has been made, a recent AHA scientific statement identified several gaps in our understanding of mechanisms for symptoms and pathophysiology of ACS in women. 46 Future research should address these gaps and evaluate sex differences in symptom presentation of type I and type II ACS.

Nonobstructive coronary artery disease (NOCA) care pathway — management emphasis and diagnostic categorization are outlined: medical management of NOCA is imperative for promoting plaque stabilization and regression with the goal of reducing the risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), yet most supporting secondary prevention evidence focuses on obstructive CAD or mixed populations, with fewer data in exclusively NOCA. The text notes that some patients present with true angina and may have ANOCA while others have NOCA with self-resolving noncardiac chest pain, and that risk stratification and treatment are needed for all patients with NOCA. The diagnosis of true ANOCA usually requires typical symptoms plus evidence from noninvasive or invasive testing, such as demonstration of ischemia (INOCA), CMD, abnormal findings of invasive coronary function testing, or demonstration of MI (MINOCA).

### Sex differences in symptom presentation in acute coronary syndromes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111LX9dQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This systematic review with meta‐analysis shows that there are sex differences in symptom presentation in patients with confirmed ACS. Whilst there is also substantial overlap in symptoms of ACS, women with ACS have higher odds of presenting with pain between the shoulder blades, nausea or vomiting and shortness of breath, and lower odds of presenting with chest pain and diaphoresis compared with men with ACS. Sex differences in symptom presentation seem to be well‐established, meaning that the terms "atypical" and "typical" to label symptoms of ACS are outdated.

### Relations of sex to diagnosis and outcomes in acute coronary syndrome [^112PNnep]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The key findings of our study are considerable differences between women and men admitted for suspected ACS in symptoms and clinical presentation. However, these did not translate into different diagnostic accuracy nor outcomes, ie, myocardial infarction or death rates after 2 years. Disease management comprised invasive procedures more frequently in men, and during follow‐up, men more often needed further revascularization therapy and repeated in‐hospital treatment for cardiovascular disease.

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116w8eGK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) — definition and classification — are described as typically caused by the disruption (rupture or erosion) of an unstable coronary artery atherosclerotic plaque with associated partial or complete thrombosis and/or microembolism resulting in myocardial ischemia. ACS includes 3 related clinical conditions that exist along a continuum of severity: unstable angina, non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The initial diagnosis and classification of ACS should be based on the clinical history and symptomatology, interpretation of the ECG, and assessment of cardiac troponin (cTn). Unstable angina is defined by transient myocardial ischemia leading to diminished flow in the absence of significant myonecrosis detected by circulating troponin, whereas patients with NSTEMI may have a partially occluded coronary artery leading to subendocardial ischemia and those with STEMI typically have a completely occluded vessel leading to transmural myocardial ischemia and infarction. The pathophysiology of ACS can be dynamic and patients can rapidly progress from one clinical condition to another during the course of their presentation and initial evaluation and treatment. This guideline will focus on the acute management of ACS presumed to result from atherosclerotic plaque rupture or plaque erosion and subsequent thrombosis, and under the Universal Definition of myocardial infarction these will be classified as type 1 MI events, while diagnostic evaluation of chest pain and the management of type 2 MI, spontaneous coronary artery dissection, and MINOCA are covered in separate documents.

### Questions and answers on workup diagnosis and risk stratification: a companion document of the 2020 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation [^114qT5NQ]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

This patient was discharged without a complete diagnostic work-up assuming NSTEMI to be the most probable cause of MINOCA. CMR was correctly indicated to exclude/confirm possible myocarditis and Takotsubo syndrome but should have been performed earlier to identify the correct diagnosis. It would be useful, therefore, to perform CMR as soon as possible.

Q36. A 75-year-old diabetic woman is referred to the emergency department for chest pain associated with intense and prolonged palpitations a few hours earlier. The ECG shows sinus rhythm, supraventricular extrasystoles, and no significant ST-segment changes. The hs-cTn is 180 ng/L (ULN 14 ng/L) and echocardiography shows a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and a dilated left atrium. Invasive coronary angiography performed the following day is normal. Recurrence of chest pain with concomitant 15 min episodes of high penetrance atrial fibrillation occurs. Your colleague thinks this MINOCA case should be treated as an NSTEMI but you disagree.

It is highly probable that symptoms and myocardial injury are related to the episodes of tachyarrhythmia. It is recommended to manage patients with an initial diagnosis of MINOCA and a final established underlying cause according to the disease-specific guidelines. This patient should be treated according to the atrial fibrillation ESC Guidelines with oral anticoagulation based on stroke risk assessment and preventive treatments of atrial fibrillation episodes.

Q37. How would you diagnose and treat a MINOCA patient suspected for myocarditis that lives in an area where CMR is not available?

CMR is one of the key diagnostic tools in the MINOCA diagnostic algorithm for either differential diagnosis of Takotsubo syndrome, myocarditis, or also true MI. In case intracoronary imaging and the provocative test are negative and CMR is not available, patients should undergo echocardiography to identify left ventricular wall abnormalities, e.g. regional wall motion evaluation, speckle tracking, strain imaging/mapping, real-time myocardial contrast, which may help to identify the underlying cause. If myocarditis is still considered the most probable cause, the patient should be treated according to the specific guidelines. If the final diagnosis is MI of unknown/unclear causes, the pharmacological treatment should follow the secondary prevention guidelines for atherosclerotic disease.

### Single coronary artery syndrome: cardiac computed tomography angiography as a leading imaging modality [^116JezGb]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2011). Low credibility.

Single coronary artery syndrome is usually an asymptomatic condition in most patients; thus most patients are diagnosed when noninvasive imaging (cardiac computed tomography angiography, cardiac magnetic resonance) or invasive coronary angiography is done for evaluation for other cardiac conditions. With advances using cardiovascular imaging in the evaluation and management of single coronary artery syndrome; Cardiac Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) has emerged as a very essential and leading imaging modality. CCTA has the best resolution (spatial and temporal) among the imaging modalities available for analyzing the cardiovascular system for the diagnosis and management of single coronary artery syndrome. We are presenting cases of patients with single coronary artery syndrome with 3 different courses (anterior, septal, inter-arterial), illustrating how CCTA gives a detailed anatomic/structural evaluation of the origin and course of the coronary arteries, and other cardiac structures. Thus in patients diagnosed with single coronary artery syndrome, CCTA can provide vital information on the not only the course, but the associated narrowing of coronary vessels.

Accumulating evidence suggests that influenza and influenza-like illnesses can act as a trigger for acute myocardial infarction. Despite these unprecedented times providers should not overlook acute coronary syndrome (ACS) guidelines, but may choose to modify the recommended approach in situations with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 disease. In this document, we suggest recommendations as to how to triage patients diagnosed with ACSs and provide with algorithms of how to manage the patients and decide the appropriate treatment options in the era of COVID-19 pandemic. We also address the inpatient logistics and discharge to follow-up considerations for the function of already established ACS network during the pandemic.

Acute coronary syndrome is pathologically distinct in women and requires an appreciation of the specific risk factors, presenting symptoms, laboratory findings, and imaging results to treat correctly. Persistent disparities in mortality between men and women may be the result of failure to recognize and intervene, especially in the case of women aged less than 55 years. Protocols which establish criteria for activating the cardiac catheterization laboratory and which empower emergency department physicians to do so without delay show signs of eliminating disparities, as does guideline-directed therapy at the time of discharge from the hospital.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) definition and classification — ACS are typically caused by the disruption (rupture or erosion) of an unstable coronary artery atherosclerotic plaque with associated partial or complete coronary artery thrombosis and/or microemboli, resulting in diminished blood flow to the myocardium and subsequent myocardial ischemia. ACS includes 3 related clinical conditions that exist along a continuum of severity: (1) unstable angina, (2) non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and (3) STEMI. The initial diagnosis and classification of ACS should be based on the clinical history and symptomatology, interpretation of the ECG, and assessment of cardiac troponin (cTn). Unstable angina is defined by transient myocardial ischemia leading to diminished flow in the absence of significant myonecrosis detected by circulating troponin, whereas more prolonged or severe myocardial ischemia is diagnosed as MI with elevated biomarkers of myonecrosis. Patients with NSTEMI may have a partially occluded coronary artery leading to subendocardial ischemia, while those with STEMI typically have a completely occluded vessel leading to transmural myocardial ischemia and infarction. ACS can be dynamic, with rapid progression between unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI during presentation and initial evaluation and treatment. Other, less common causes of myocardial ischemia include coronary artery spasm, embolism, and dissection. This guideline will focus on the acute management of ACS, including unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI, presumed to result from atherosclerotic plaque rupture or plaque erosion and subsequent thrombosis, which under the Universal Definition would be classified as type 1 MI events.

Figure 2.
Multiple causes of acute and non-acute myocardial ischemic syndromes (AMIS and NAMIS): a non-exhaustive list. AMIS indicates acute myocardial ischemic syndromes; and NAMIS, non-acute myocardial ischemic syndromes.

We likewise believe that referring to acute ischemic manifestations (ie, ACS or unstable angina) as a "syndrome" while depicting the chronic manifestations of exertional angina and ischemia as a "disease" is dyssynchronous. The ultimate mechanism by which MACE — unstable angina, MI, and death, including sudden cardiac (arrhythmic) death — occur is myocardial ischemia, whether this is due to epicardial coronary plaque rupture, erosion, or to a host of other alternative or complementary non-obstructive mechanisms occurring in up to 12% of patients. Similarly, among "stable angina" patients, recent trials, have compared non-invasive functional versus anatomic testing in patients with suspected CAD, confirming low-to-modest rates of epicardial coronary obstruction, ranging from 20% to 45%. In the CCTA arm of SCOT-HEART (n = 2073), 1239 patients (60%) had anginal symptoms by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence criteria, including 737 (36%) with typical angina and 502 (24%) with atypical angina, while only 452 patients (25%) among 1778 patients with an available CCTA result had obstructive CAD.

The 2019 CCS ESC guidelines also acknowledged that among patients with typical angina in the most common age range for detecting stable CAD (age 50–59 years), 68% of men and 87% of women did not have obstructive coronary stenoses, while the CorMicA trial (Coronary Microvascular Angina) revealed that ~45% of patients presenting with angina or ischemia did not have CAD at angiography. Finally, in a large US registry of almost 400 000 patients with suspected CAD referred to coronary angiography for documented myocardial ischemia on stress testing, coronary obstruction > 70% was found in only 38% of patients, while in a similar percentage of patients (37%) with atypical symptoms, obstructive CAD was found in only 25%. Overall, non-obstructive CAD (< 20% stenosis in all vessels) was found in almost 40% of subjects. Such findings underscore that a high proportion of such INOCA patients display objective evidence of coronary vasomotor dysfunction or abnormalities of myocardial microcirculation, which reinforces the need for adopting a comprehensive, unifying nomenclature that centers on the ischemic myocardium rather than on obstructed coronary arteries alone.

Electrocardiogram interpretation and repeat testing — supportive points: A normal or unchanged electrocardiogram (ECG) is reasonably useful but not sufficient at ruling out acute coronary syndrome (ACS), decision-making should not be based solely on a single normal or nondiagnostic ECG, and up to 6% of patients with evolving ACS are discharged from the emergency department (ED) with a normal ECG; when the initial ECG is normal or without ST elevation, hyperacute T waves, left bundle branch block, or ST depression, serial ECGs should be performed and the timing for repeat ECG should be guided by symptoms; when ST-elevation is present on the initial ECG, management should follow the prescribed STEMI treatment algorithms, and if ST depression is identified on the initial ECG, management should follow the NSTE-ACS guidelines; a normal ECG may be associated with left circumflex or right coronary artery occlusions and posterior wall ischemia, therefore right-sided ECG leads should be considered when such lesions are suspected; an initial normal ECG does not exclude ACS and patients with an initial normal ECG should have a repeat ECG if symptoms are ongoing until other diagnostic testing rules out ACS.

A writing subcommittee conducted a systematic review of the literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to answer the following clinical questions: (1) In adult patients without evidence of ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome, can initial risk stratification be used to predict a low rate of 30-day major adverse cardiac events? (2) In adult patients with suspected acute non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome, can troponin testing within 3 hours of emergency department presentation be used to predict a low rate of 30-day major adverse cardiac events? (3) In adult patients with suspected non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome in whom acute myocardial infarction has been excluded, does further diagnostic testing (eg, provocative, stress test, computed tomography angiography) for acute coronary syndrome prior to discharge reduce 30-day major adverse cardiac events? (4) Should adult patients with acute non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction receive immediate antiplatelet therapy in addition to aspirin to reduce 30-day major adverse cardiac events? Evidence was graded and recommendations were made based on the strength of the available data.

### Imaging diagnoses and outcome in patients presenting for primary angioplasty but no obstructive coronary artery disease [^115m6hdB]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is made from a history of acute-onset chest pain, ST-elevation on ECG and subsequent release of cardiac biomarkers suggesting myocardial necrosis. Guidelines recommend urgent revascularisation, ideally with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) of the culprit artery. The levels of biomarkers such as troponin are generally not available at the time of revascularisation.

A subset of patients (2.6%–14%) with suspected STEMI do not have a culprit lesion or obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) on the initial diagnostic coronary angiogram (DCA). Some of these patients may have other non-atheromatous cardiac or non-cardiac causes for their symptoms and ECG abnormalities as well as biomarker release. In the last few years, there has been an increasing interest in alternative causes of acute chest pain associated with troponin rise particularly with non-invasive diagnosis of myocarditis on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) or demonstration of myocardial infarction (MI) in the presence of recanalised arteries. However, such studies have mainly focused on small series of patients presenting within a broader spectrum of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with raised troponin with the aim of evaluating the usefulness of CMR. The prevalence of non-coronary causes of acute chest pain and their prognosis, particularly those presenting with suspected STEMI, is less well described.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and outcome of different cardiac and non-cardiac conditions as identified on multimodality imaging in a large cohort of patients presenting with suspected STEMI, who had no culprit lesion on the angiogram.

NSTE-ACS patient selection — noninvasive management and selective invasive approach: Patients who are at prohibitively high risk from angiography or who have known coronary anatomy or preferences that preclude revascularization (PCI or CABG) may be managed noninvasively. In addition, some low-risk patients with normal cardiac biomarkers in whom a diagnosis of an ACS is questioned should be considered for a "selective invasive" approach that includes further noninvasive risk stratification prior to consideration of coronary angiography. These low-risk patients should still undergo noninvasive stress testing or coronary CT angiography prior to hospital discharge, and patients with higher risk findings on noninvasive testing or who have recurrent ischemic symptoms should be referred for invasive coronary angiography prior to hospital discharge in the absence of contraindication.

### Non-atherosclerotic causes of acute coronary syndromes [^114mkjkv]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Atherosclerosis and plaque disruption have a central pathological role in the majority of patients who present with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but non-atherosclerotic processes are also important contributors to a substantial number of ACS events and require different diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease, intravascular imaging techniques might be needed to delineate the underlying aetiology, together with a high index of suspicion for other important causes of ACS. In this Review, we discuss five non-atherosclerotic causes of ACS, including spontaneous coronary artery dissection, coronary artery embolism, vasospasm, myocardial bridging and stress-induced cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo syndrome). Important diagnostic findings, management strategies and prognostic data for these non-atherosclerotic mechanisms of ACS are reviewed.

This patient has a high likelihood for pneumonia and a low likelihood for NSTEMI. To answer the question whether he has concomitant NSTEMI, you need to know the exact value of hs-cTn at presentation as well as the dynamics after 1 h or 2 h. If the hs-cTn levels are only mildly elevated (e.g. according to the assay 18 ng/L if ULN is 14 ng/L), then the mild elevation in hs-cTn in this specific patient can be attributed to cardiac causes other than NSTEMI (e.g. pre-existing CAD/MI or hypertensive heart disease plus some degree of cardiomyocyte injury related to sepsis/pneumonia) and no specific treatment is needed. A rise or fall in hs-cTn is required for the diagnosis of NSTEMI, and most NSTEMIs have higher concentrations 7 h after the onset of acute chest pain.

Q16. You are the cardiology consultant responsible for the training of residents starting their rotation in the emergency department. When discussing patient pathways, a resident asks you whether the majority of patients presenting with acute chest pain to the emergency department ultimately require hospitalization to reliably rule-out or rule-in acute MI (AMI).

No. Using either a hs-cTn T/I 0 h / 1 h-algorithm or a hs-cTn T/I 0h/2 h-algorithm, the majority of patients (75%) can be reliably ruled-out or ruled-in within the first hours in the emergency department (sections 3.3.2 and 3.3.3). Ultimately, the majority of patients (> 60%) can be discharged after rapid rule-out of AMI and managed as outpatients using these algorithms.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Acute chest pain — intermediate-risk with no known coronary artery disease (CAD), anatomic testing: For intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain and no known CAD eligible for diagnostic testing after a negative or inconclusive evaluation for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is useful for exclusion of atherosclerotic plaque and obstructive CAD (1 A). For intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain, moderate-severe ischemia on current or prior (≤ 1 year) stress testing, and no known CAD (as established by prior anatomic testing), invasive coronary angiography (ICA) is recommended (1 C-EO). For intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain with evidence of previous mildly abnormal stress test results (≤ 1 year), CCTA is reasonable for diagnosing obstructive CAD (2a C-LD).

Pivoting Away From the Terms "Coronary" and From "Disease" to "Syndrome"

The term "ischemic syndrome" better characterizes and captures the many pathogenetic causes of angina and ischemia more inclusively and accurately than the narrower terms "coronary" and "disease". We certainly recognize that coronary obstruction or epicardial coronary stenosis remains an important mechanistic cause of ACS and accounts also for many clinical presentations of CCS or CCD. However, the very same term 'coronary' fails to encompass the many non-coronary processes that may also cause myocardial ischemia, such as microvascular dysfunction, extramural microcirculatory compression, microvascular embolization and rarefaction, and myocardial bridges (Figure 2). Thus, an unforeseen consequence of disproportionately focusing on epicardial coronary obstruction is that other pathogenetically important causes of angina and ischemia too often fail to be considered. A purely anatomical diagnostic approach using invasive coronary angiography or coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) may likewise fail to diagnose microvascular and/or vasospastic angina as treatable causes of angina — a situation in which many patients in whom no obstructive coronary lesions are identified may be falsely reassured that ischemia is not present. Often such patients are discharged from cardiology settings, at which point a myriad of potential (and costly) non-cardiac causes are probed rather than pursuing a more diligent evaluation of non-coronary causes of angina and ischemia. Because treatment differs according to the different aetiologies, a more comprehensive classification system should promote a more diversified and personalized approach to therapy. We acknowledge that myocardial injury (eg, with traumas, hypoxaemia, anaemia, or some poisonings) may also occur because of non-cardiac causes and mimic myocardial ischemic syndromes, but these are out of the scope of the present Frontiers report.

### Acute coronary syndromes and acute heart failure: a diagnostic dilemma and high-risk combination. A statement from the acute heart failure committee of the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^117LKkra]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome is a precipitant of acute heart failure in a substantial proportion of cases, and the presence of both conditions is associated with a higher risk of short-term mortality compared to acute coronary syndrome alone. The diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome in the setting of acute heart failure can be challenging. Patients may present with atypical or absent chest pain, electrocardiograms can be confounded by pre-existing abnormalities, and cardiac biomarkers are frequently elevated in patients with chronic or acute heart failure, independently of acute coronary syndrome. It is important to distinguish transient or limited myocardial injury from primary myocardial infarction due to vascular events in patients presenting with acute heart failure. This paper outlines various clinical scenarios to help differentiate between these conditions and aims to provide clinicians with tools to aid in the recognition of acute coronary syndrome as a cause of acute heart failure. Interpretation of electrocardiogram and biomarker findings, and imaging techniques that may be helpful in the diagnostic work-up are described. Guidelines recommend an immediate invasive strategy for patients with acute heart failure and acute coronary syndrome, regardless of electrocardiographic or biomarker findings. Pharmacological management of patients with acute coronary syndrome and acute heart failure should follow guidelines for each of these syndromes, with priority given to time-sensitive therapies for both. Studies conducted specifically in patients with the combination of acute coronary syndrome and acute heart failure are needed to better define the management of these patients.

### Prevalence and prognosis of non-specific chest pain among patients hospitalized for suspected acute coronary syndrome-a systematic literature search [^114TpnKM]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Patients with NSCP represent a large, heterogeneous and important group. Due to co-existing CHD in nearly 40% of these patients, their prognosis is not necessarily benign, but still far better than those with ACS. The introduction of new markers and sensitive essays for cardiac necrosis may reduce the problematic subset of non-ACS patients with CHD and instead convert them to a diagnosis of ACS with optimal management. The remaining patients may be offered a comprehensive non-cardiac evaluation of their symptoms in order to explore possible causes of their pain.

This review has highlighted the general shortcoming of NSCP studies; a considerable selection bias within and across studies. Guidelines for the management of patients with NSCP are necessary.

1 Introduction

Recognizing that acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) constitute a spectrum encompassing unstable angina, non‐ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the 2023 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines for the management of ACSs addressed all three. This differs from the prior US guidelines that individually addressed unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI. The 2023 ESCACS Guidelines thus encompass comprehensive patient management from admission to long‐term care, again including what in prior US guidelines would have been a secondary prevention guideline. In addition, the task force included a patient member who provided a patient perspective that is highlighted in the European publication.

The clinical conundrum of angina

Classically, angina is considered to be due to flow-limiting CAD, which by definition results in a supply-demand mismatch in myocardial perfusion. Anatomical thresholds for CAD severity vary. A widely used cut-off for obstructive CAD is taken as a stenosis of 70% in a main coronary artery (> 2.5 mm) in one angiographic projection, or 50% in two projections, and 50% of the left main coronary artery. The management of patients with angina appropriately centres on the detection of obstructive epicardial CAD, which may be challenging to diagnose objectively (e.g.mild tandem lesions in series may cause flow-limiting disease). Systemic problems including anaemia and aortic stenosis also influence the propensity to angina and should be considered. In patients with obstructive epicardial CAD, the treatment involves optimal medical therapy and consideration of myocardial revascularisation with either percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). However, this paradigm fails to account for one-third or more patients with angina in whom obstructive CAD is excluded. A US registry of 398 978 patients referred for coronary angiography demonstrated that 39.2% of patients had no evidence of epicardial CAD. Also, angina may persist following PCI and CABG. The reasons for 'negative' coronary angiography are multifactorial. However, a growing body of evidence supports the use of coronary function tests, especially since a disorder of coronary artery function may be the unifying diagnosis in a patient with symptoms not explained by anatomical imaging.

Historically described as cardiac syndrome X, the term coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is used to describe abnormalities that result in microvascular angina (MVA). CMD is classified into five groups (table 1). The pathophysiology of CMD involves functional and/or structural abnormalities in the coronary microcirculation. MVA is prognostically important, and given the challenges in diagnosing and treating this problem in daily clinical practice, it is a condition of unmet need.

### Sex differences in symptom presentation in acute coronary syndromes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113QYjis]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the world's leading cause of eath accounting for an estimated 9 million deaths in 2015. 1, 2 Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is an umbrella term for unstable angina (UA), non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and is a substantial component of IHD. 3 In recent decades ACS mortality has decreased, because of advancements in treatment, lifestyle changes, and a focus on primary prevention, but rates remain high. 1, 4

Effective treatment of ACS is available with reperfusion therapies, preferably with percutaneous coronary intervention and if not available thrombolysis or coronary artery bypass grafting. 3 The efficacy of ACS treatment depends on timely initiation of the required treatment to minimize myocardial damage. 3 Delayed symptom recognition, both by patients and medical professionals, is an important contributor to delay in treatment and subsequent ACS mortality. 5 Despite several awareness campaigns, referral delay in women with ACS has persisted over time. 6, 7

Previous studies, but not all, have reported that women with ACS experience different symptoms compared with men with ACS. 8, 9, 10 Additionally, other studies emphasize the overlap in symptoms between men and women with ACS. 11 Symptoms experienced by women with ACS are often labeled as "atypical" if these are different to those experienced by men. Previous systematic reviews of sex differences in symptoms of patients with ACS have been inconsistent, with varying in‐ and exclusion criteria and studies lacking standardized data collection. 12, 13 Recent studies have attempted to solve these issues, with the development of standardized data collection surveys. 11, 14

The purpose of this systematic review and meta‐analysis is to assess the presence and extent of sex differences in symptom presentation in patients with confirmed ACS. It updates and extends earlier meta‐analyses on this topic. 12, 15 Furthermore, through cumulative meta‐analyses in which studies are added to the pooled findings in order of publication date, we aim to determine for how long evidence, where it exists, has been established in the literature. As much has been published on this topic, we hypothesize that recent studies have mainly been confirmatory. Throughout this review, "sex" will be used when referring to differences between men and women. "Gender" is not used, as social and cultural differences are not examined.

Used in conjunction with clinical assessment and the 12-lead ECG – mandatory additional sources of information – the 0 h/1 h-algorithm allows the early detection of patients who are candidates for early invasive coronary angiography, particularly as most of the rule-in patients with a diagnosis other than acute MI will have conditions that also usually require inpatient coronary angiography for accurate diagnosis, including Takotsubo syndrome, myocarditis, and unstable angina. This patient should undergo early invasive coronary angiography.

Q19. The measurement of hs-cTn T/I is mandatory in all patients presenting with suspected NSTE-ACS. Is it necessary to routinely measure other cardiovascular biomarkers in addition to hs-cTn T/I? If yes, which ones?

It is NOT necessary to routinely measure other cardiovascular biomarkers in addition to hs-cTn T/I.

Q20. Your colleague from the emergency room asks you if adding copeptin to the blood sample of a patient arriving with acute chest pain might help for the early rule-out of MI.

The added value of copeptin depends on the sensitivity of the cTn assay used. If using a cTn assay with poor sensitivity, copeptin does provide incremental diagnostic value and is advised as an aid for the rapid rule-out of MI within a dual marker strategy. However, if using, as recommended in the ESC Guidelines, a hs-cTn T/I assay within a hs-cTn T/I 0 h/1 h-algorithm or hs-cTn T/I 0 h/2 h-algorithm, copeptin does not have added value and should not be used.

### The internet tracking registry of acute coronary syndromes (I*trACS): a multicenter registry of patients with suspicion of acute coronary syndromes reported using the standardized reporting guidelines for emergency department chest pain studies [^117UH4wP]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Observational studies of well-described patient populations presenting to emergency departments (EDs) with suspicion of acute coronary syndrome are necessary to understand the relationships between patients' signs and symptoms, cardiac risk profile, test results, practice patterns, and outcomes. We describe the methods for data collection and the ED population enrolled in a multicenter registry of patients with chest pain.

Methods

Patients older than 18 years, presenting to one of 8 EDs in the United States or 1 ED in Singapore, and with possible acute coronary syndrome were enrolled in the Internet Tracking Registry of Acute Coronary Syndromes between June 1999 and August 2001. Prospective data, including presenting signs and symptoms, ECG findings, and the ED physician's initial impression of risk, were systematically collected. Medical record review or daily follow-up was used to obtain cardiac biomarker results, invasive and noninvasive testing, treatments, procedures, and inhospital outcomes. Thirty-day outcomes were determined by telephone follow-up and medical record review.

Results

The registry includes 15,608 patients, with 17,713 visits. Chest pain was the chief complaint in 71% of visits. The ECG was diagnostic of ischemia or infarction in 10.1% and positive cardiac biomarkers were observed in 10% of visits. Forty-three percent of patients were sent home directly from the ED. Of admitted patients, 5% died by 30 days, and 3% had documented coronary artery disease or had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting within 30 days. For patients discharged directly from the ED, 0.4% died or had a documented myocardial infarction within 30 days. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention, or a diagnosis of coronary artery disease was found in 0.5% of discharged patients.

Conclusion

A unique description of undifferentiated ED chest pain patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome is provided. The data set can be used to generate and explore hypotheses to improve understanding of the complex relationships between presentation, treatment, testing, intervention and outcomes.

### Stable coronary syndromes: pathophysiology, diagnostic advances and therapeutic need [^115zp983]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) persists as the leading global cause of death and lost life years in adults. Reductions in morbidity and mortality are not consistent across subgroups, with mortality being persistently high in younger women. Overall, stable ischaemic heart disease (SIHD) remains a worldwide public health problem of unmet need.

Stable coronary artery disease (CAD), or SIHD, refers to the syndrome of recurrent, transient episodes of chest pain reflecting demand-supply mismatch, that is, angina pectoris. In this article, we reappraise the causes of angina based on new insights into coronary pathophysiology. We focus on disorders of coronary artery function and their clinical relevance.

Taxonomy

Given the unmet need of IHD, recent advances in diagnostics and the need for further improvements in primary and secondary prevention, we propose the term 'stable coronary syndromes' (SCS) to succinctly reflect the heterogeneous pathophysiology of epicardial, microvascular and endothelial abnormalities in patients with stable angina. SCS aligns with terminology for acute coronary syndromes, and helps to standardise the hierarchy of IHD endotypes, including ischaemia with no obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA)and myocardial infarction with no obstructive CAD (figure 1).

### Comparison between National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of stable angina: implications for clinical practice [^116poHox]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Comparison of guidelines

Guideline development

NICE published separate guidelines for diagnosis in 2010, and for the management of stable angina in 2011 (table 1). Its recommendations regarding lipid modification and hypertension are specified in its own (separate) guidelines in these areas, both of which have been updated since the publication of the NICE guidance on stable angina. The ESC guidance incorporates diagnosis and management into a single document, which was published in 2013. It refers to its own guidelines on myocardial revascularisation, which were updated in 2014.

Table 1
Summary of methodology used in the development of the clinical practice guidelines for the management of stable angina/stable coronary artery disease from NICE and the ESC

NICE includes in its diagnostic guideline adults with or without a prior diagnosis of cardiovascular disease who have recent onset chest pain suspected to be stable angina. Its management guideline is for adults who have been diagnosed with stable angina due to atherosclerotic disease. The ESC guidance incorporates a broader group which also includes patients with asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) and low-risk acute coronary syndromes.

In its guideline development, NICE posed 'key clinical questions', undertook a review of the relevant literature, critically appraised the quality of evidence, and made recommendation statements. The ESC made recommendations supported by a class of recommendation and level of evidence. Analyses of health economic data were considered by NICE but not by the ESC.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2022). High credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) — pathophysiology and non-invasive imaging modalities — myocardial ischemia and infarction caused by epicardial coronary atherosclerosis are described as the main manifestations of CAD, with stenotic or occluded coronary arteries impairing downstream blood flow, reducing myocardial perfusion, causing contractile dysfunction, and ultimately leading to angina or, in acute syndromes, myocardial infarction. The distinctive pathophysiological characteristics of CAD can be evaluated with imaging modalities such as echocardiography, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), or coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA), and combining anatomical and functional imaging by sequential stand-alone tests or hybrid approaches (e.g. SPECT/computed tomography [CT], PET/CT) would allow a more comprehensive characterization of obstructive CAD. The preferred imaging technique to confirm the diagnosis of acute or chronic CAD and guide treatment will depend on the clinical presentation and characteristics of the patient, the local availability and expertise at the clinical centre, and the document aims to provide guidance on selecting the optimal imaging approach for individual patients.

4 Delays in Care

The guidelines explore the potential delays for patients presenting with STEMI. These include patient self‐presentation delay or emergency medical system (EMS) delay and systems of care delay within the receiving medical center, all adding to the total ischemic time. Analysis of these components may improve the delivery of care for patients with STEMI and will involve patient education for prompt presentation, the EMS system efficiency, the emergency room contact in the hospital, and transfer to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, ideally in under 90 min. The guidelines further detail the recommendations for patients presenting to a non‐PCI center, scheduling transfer to an appropriate more intensive level facility.

### Nonobstructive versus obstructive coronary artery disease in acute coronary syndrome: a meta-analysis [^111Qu64b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This meta‐analysis confirms that ACS patients with and without obstructive CAD are significantly different. NObCAD patients have a significantly lower cardiovascular risk at baseline and a subsequent lower rate of death or a main cardiovascular event. However, these subjects are still at high risk for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, suggesting potential undertreatment and calling for a specific management. Our findings, other than demonstrating a significant medical treatment gap, highlight an important opportunity for improving the quality of care and, in turn, the outcomes of patients being diagnosed with NObACS. 50 In the context of NObCAD, no differences in prognosis were noted between zero stenosis versus mildly obstructive stenosis (1–49%), but such analyses require validation.

### Emergency department presentation of patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection [^1127Hfcn]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an infrequently recognized but potentially fatal cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) that disproportionately affects women. Little is currently known about how patients with SCAD initially present.

Objectives

We sought to describe patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) with symptoms of SCAD to improve providers' awareness and recognition of this condition.

Patients and Methods

We performed a retrospective medical record review of all patients who presented to the ED of a single academic medical center from January 1, 2002 through October 31, 2015 and were subsequently diagnosed with SCAD by angiography. These patients were identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes and a Boolean search of the diagnosis field of the medical record. Data regarding patients' presentations and course were abstracted by two independent reviewers.

Results

We identified 20 episodes of SCAD involving 19 patients, all of whom were female. The majority of patients had 0–1 conventional cardiovascular disease risk factors. Most patients had chest pain (85%), initial electrocardiograms without evidence of ischemia (85%), and elevated initial troponin (72%). The most common diagnosis in providers' differential was acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Conclusion

Patients with SCAD present with similar symptoms compared to patients with ACS caused by atherosclerotic disease, but have different risk profiles. Providers should consider SCAD in patients presenting with symptoms concerning for ACS, especially in younger female patients without traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors, as their risk may be significantly underestimated with commonly used ACS risk-stratifiers.

7 Person‐Centered Approach

A person‐centered approach to the ACS journey includes considering the physical and psychosocial needs of the patient at every stage. Before the ACS, all risk factors should have been considered, medical history and prior medications should have been established, and there should have been consideration of psychosocial factors. Hospital admission should entail individualized care at triage, a person‐centered clinical assessment, and the employment of shared decision‐making. Preparing for discharge requires explanations regarding long‐term treatment, education about lifestyle modification, and consideration of mental and emotional health. Important are patient expectations. ACS patients expect their ACS symptoms to be recognized; their physical, mental, and emotional well‐being to be considered; and that there be consideration of support for their family and carers. They further expect high quality, effective, and safe care to be delivered by professionals; clear and comprehensive information to be delivered; and attention to both their physical and environmental needs. This involves the right care at the right times; shared‐decision making and respect for patient preferences; and a clean and safe hospital environment.

### Is it time to retire the diagnosis "Hypertensive emergency"? [^1159bcEu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute Coronary Syndromes

According to hypertension guidelines, unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction are traditionally listed as criteria to diagnose a hypertensive emergency. Unlike the detailed recommendations for managing high BP in patients with stroke, the hypertension guidelines superficially address BP management in patients with acute cardiac ischemia.

There are no clinical trials of major cardiovascular outcomes assessing the benefits of different strategies to reduce BP in the context of acute coronary syndromes. Differently from guidelines for hypertension, guidelines for acute coronary syndromes focus on revascularization therapies, which are firmly based on the results of randomized clinical trials and do not include BP in the flow charts and algorithms for the management.

Physicians are more often concerned with low BP values in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes, which can signal incipient cardiogenic shock. High BP is usually secondary to pain (reversal causality), particularly in patients with previous hypertension, and is evidence of preserved cardiac output. These patients are treated with nitrates, drugs that have a BP‐lowering effect as one of their mechanisms to reduce myocardial ischemia, while the procedures to promote coronary reperfusion are prepared.

### Acute coronary syndrome without ST elevation: implementation of new guidelines [^116JW4hu]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Unstable angina and non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction have in recent years been recognised as frequent and important clinical manifestations of coronary-artery disease. The European (ESC) and American (ACC/AHA) professional societies last year released guidelines on diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of these disorders. These guidelines summarise similarly the current evidence and translate them to clinical practice. Most important changes relate to the inclusion of troponins into the risk stratification algorithm, the addition of low-molecular-weight heparin and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists to medical treatment, and the role of invasive management for improved long-term outcome. Guidelines are constantly challenged by newly emerging study results. Recently, early invasive management and clopidogrel have been found to exert further benefit to this high-risk group of patients. Accordingly, the societies on both sides of the Atlantic will work together closely to update and implement these guidelines.

### Early computed tomography coronary angiography in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome: randomised controlled trial [^114YC5St]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objectives

To establish if the use of early computed tomography (CT) coronary angiography improves one year clinical outcomes in patients presenting to the emergency department with acute chest pain and at intermediate risk of acute coronary syndrome and subsequent clinical events.

Design

Randomised controlled trial.

Setting

37 hospitals in the UK.

Participants

Adults with suspected or a provisional diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome and one or more of previous coronary heart disease, raised levels of cardiac troponin, or abnormal electrocardiogram.

Interventions

Early CT coronary angiography and standard of care compared with standard of care only.

Main outcome measures

Primary endpoint was all cause death or subsequent type 1 or 4b myocardial infarction at one year.

Results

Between 23 March 2015 and 27 June 2019, 1748 participants (mean age 62 years (standard deviation 13), 64% men, mean global registry of acute coronary events (GRACE) score 115 (standard deviation 35)) were randomised to receive early CT coronary angiography (n = 877) or standard of care only (n = 871). Median time from randomisation to CT coronary angiography was 4.2 (interquartile range 1.6–21.6) hours. The primary endpoint occurred in 51 (5.8%) participants randomised to CT coronary angiography and 53 (6.1%) participants who received standard of care only (adjusted hazard ratio 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.62 to 1.35), P = 0.65). Invasive coronary angiography was performed in 474 (54.0%) participants randomised to CT coronary angiography and 530 (60.8%) participants who received standard of care only (adjusted hazard ratio 0.81 (0.72 to 0.92), P = 0.001). There were no overall differences in coronary revascularisation, use of drug treatment for acute coronary syndrome, or subsequent preventive treatments between the two groups. Early CT coronary angiography was associated with a slightly longer time in hospital (median increase 0.21 (95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.40) days from a median hospital stay of 2.0 to 2.2 days).

Conclusions

In intermediate risk patients with acute chest pain and suspected acute coronary syndrome, early CT coronary angiography did not alter overall coronary therapeutic interventions or one year clinical outcomes, but reduced rates of invasive angiography while modestly increasing length of hospital stay. These findings do not support the routine use of early CT coronary angiography in intermediate risk patients with acute chest pain and suspected acute coronary syndrome.
