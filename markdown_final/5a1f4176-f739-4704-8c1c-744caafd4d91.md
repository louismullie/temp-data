## Question

Can cefepime be used to treat cryptococcal meningitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether cefepime can be used to treat cryptococcal meningitis, so let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what cefepime is indicated for and whether it has any antifungal activity. Then, I should confirm the nature of cryptococcal meningitis and the standard evidence-based treatments. Next, I will review guideline-backed regimens and supportive measures like intracranial pressure management. After that, I need to consider any edge cases such as mixed infections where antibacterial therapy might be used alongside antifungals. Finally, I should evaluate risks of inappropriate cefepime use and synthesize a clear conclusion that aligns with authoritative guidelines.

> Let me first confirm what cefepime actually treats, because I need to ensure I'm not conflating antibacterial coverage with antifungal needs; cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin antibiotic indicated for a range of serious bacterial infections, with labeled or described use in bacterial meningitis dosing at 6 g/day in three divided doses, but it is explicitly an antibacterial without antifungal activity, and patient counseling materials emphasize it should only be used for bacterial infections, not viral or other pathogens, which by extension includes fungi [^117DzHQp].

> Wait, let me verify the pathogen we are treating: cryptococcal meningitis is caused by Cryptococcus species (C. neoformans or C. gattii), i.e., it is a fungal meningitis typically occurring in advanced immunosuppression such as HIV, and its management paradigm is antifungal therapy, not antibacterial therapy, confirming this is not a bacterial meningitis scenario by default [^111H9GLs] [^112PxHJh] [^112FfW9N].

> Hold on, I should verify the pharmacologic mismatch, because that is the crux: cefepime inhibits bacterial peptidoglycan cell wall synthesis, whereas Cryptococcus is a yeast with distinct cell wall components (chitin, glucans, mannoproteins) and requires antifungal targets; thus, cefepime lacks any mechanistic antifungal activity against Cryptococcus, making it pharmacologically inappropriate for cryptococcal meningitis [^114yd9oe].

> Next, I should review guideline-backed therapy to ensure no step is missed: all major guidelines endorse antifungal induction therapy with amphotericin B plus flucytosine when available, followed by fluconazole consolidation and maintenance, and none recommend cefepime; WHO 2022 and IDSA 2010 explicitly endorse amphotericin B–flucytosine combinations, with DHHS OI guidance similarly recommending continuing amphotericin B plus flucytosine until CSF cultures are negative when patients are not yet clinically improved, and NEJM and FDA data support efficacy of AmBisome regimens and downstream fluconazole use in CM, which further underscores that cefepime has no role in CM treatment algorithms [^112ctCLw] [^1129qE4p] [^115F8xPP] [^117RA18u] [^11413de7] [^115qxFDG].

> I need to ensure supportive care elements are addressed, because missing these would undercut best practice: raised intracranial pressure is common in cryptococcal meningitis, and DHHS guidance recommends therapeutic lumbar punctures to reduce CSF pressure (e.g., halve the opening pressure or to < 20 cm H₂O, or remove 20–25 mL if no manometer), which is independent of antimicrobial choice but essential to outcomes, and still does not create any indication for cefepime [^113pSnhB] [^112Bh3dA].

> But wait, what if the presentation is uncertain at the outset or there is coinfection; let me consider empiric coverage: in suspected acute bacterial meningitis, empiric ceftriaxone or cefotaxime-based regimens are recommended by WHO and EFNS, with meropenem as an alternative in IDSA guidance, and in rare mixed infections such as documented C. gattii meningitis with Listeria coinfection, antibacterial therapy is targeted per bacterial meningitis protocols while antifungal therapy continues for CM; even in these edge cases, cefepime is not a treatment for cryptococcal disease itself, and antibacterial choices should follow bacterial meningitis guidelines rather than attempting to use cefepime as an antifungal surrogate [^1141yKyc] [^1162iHCg] [^114Dq4Tj] [^115iNitU].

> I should double-check the risks of using cefepime inappropriately because harm without benefit must be avoided: labels warn about antimicrobial resistance selection when used without a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection and highlight risks including C. difficile–associated diarrhea and neurotoxicity, so using cefepime for a fungal meningitis would expose patients to these risks without therapeutic effect against Cryptococcus [^111StBrG] [^114yd9oe].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure alignment with evidence and guidelines: cryptococcal meningitis is a fungal CNS infection requiring antifungal induction with amphotericin B plus flucytosine followed by fluconazole consolidation and maintenance, with careful management of intracranial pressure, and cefepime — an antibacterial cephalosporin — has no antifungal activity and no role in CM therapy, except that separate antibacterial therapy might be added if a concurrent bacterial meningitis is proven or strongly suspected, but never as treatment for Cryptococcus itself [^113o8LfT] [^115F8xPP] [^1129qE4p].

---

Cefepime is not effective for **cryptococcal meningitis** [^114yd9oe] because it lacks **antifungal activity** [^114yd9oe] and is not recommended by any guideline for this indication [^113o8LfT] [^1129qE4p]. The standard of care is **induction with amphotericin B plus flucytosine** [^113o8LfT] [^117RA18u], followed by **fluconazole** consolidation and maintenance [^115qxFDG] [^112AfSLu]. Cefepime should only be used if there is a confirmed or strongly suspected bacterial co-infection, and even then, it must be dose-adjusted for renal function [^113Z4xcD] due to neurotoxicity risk [^111StBrG].

---

## Pharmacological properties of cefepime

Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin with **broad-spectrum antibacterial activity** against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^117LaNJb]. It is **bactericidal via inhibition of cell wall synthesis** and is used to treat severe bacterial infections, such as pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, and complicated urinary tract infections [^114yd9oe].

---

## Antifungal activity of cefepime

Cefepime has **no antifungal activity** [^114yd9oe] and is ineffective against Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii, the causative agents of cryptococcal meningitis. No evidence or guidelines support its use for **fungal infections**, including **cryptococcal meningitis** [^1129qE4p] [^113o8LfT].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current WHO and DHHS guidelines recommend **induction with amphotericin B plus flucytosine, followed by fluconazole** for consolidation and maintenance [^113o8LfT] [^115F8xPP] [^115qxFDG]. Cefepime is not mentioned in any guideline for cryptococcal meningitis [^1129qE4p].

---

## Clinical evidence and outcomes

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting the use of cefepime for cryptococcal meningitis [^111H9GLs]. Its use would likely result in treatment failure, persistent infection, and increased mortality [^117RA18u].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Cefepime carries **significant risks**, particularly in patients with renal impairment:

- **Neurotoxicity**: Encephalopathy, seizures, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus, particularly without renal dose adjustment [^111StBrG] [^113Z4xcD].
- **Clostridioides difficile infection**: Risk of severe colitis [^111StBrG] [^114yd9oe].
- **Antimicrobial resistance**: Use without a proven bacterial infection increases resistance risk [^111StBrG] [^114yd9oe].

---

## Situations where cefepime might be considered

Cefepime may be appropriate **only with a confirmed or strongly suspected bacterial co-infection** (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa) alongside cryptococcal meningitis. Even then, it must be dose-adjusted for renal function [^113Z4xcD] due to neurotoxicity risk [^111StBrG].

---

## Alternative antifungal therapies

Effective **antifungal therapies** for cryptococcal meningitis include the following:

| **Therapy** | **Indication** |
|-|-|
| Amphotericin B + flucytosine | Induction therapy |
| Fluconazole | Consolidation and maintenance therapy [^115qxFDG] |
| Liposomal amphotericin B | Alternative induction therapy [^11413de7] |

---

Cefepime is not effective for **cryptococcal meningitis** and is not recommended by any guideline [^1129qE4p]. It should only be used for confirmed bacterial co-infections, with careful renal dose adjustment [^113Z4xcD] due to neurotoxicity risk.

Cryptococcal meningitis: The recommended dosage for treatment of acute cryptococcal meningitis is 400 mg on the first day, followed by 200 mg once daily. A dosage of 400 mg once daily may be used based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy. The recommended duration of treatment for initial therapy of cryptococcal meningitis is 10 to 12 weeks after the cerebrospinal fluid becomes culture negative. The recommended dosage of Diflucan for suppression of relapse of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with AIDS is 200 mg once daily.

- **Prophylaxis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation**: The recommended Diflucan daily dosage for the prevention of candidiasis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation is 400 mg once daily. Patients who are anticipated to have severe granulocytopenia (less than 500 neutrophils cells/mm³) should start Diflucan prophylaxis several days before the anticipated onset of neutropenia and continue for 7 days after the neutrophil count rises above 1000 cells/mm³.

### Ambisome [^11413de7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-infected patients was evaluated in Study 94–0–013, a randomized, double-blind, comparative multi-center trial. The study assessed the efficacy of Ambisome at doses of 3 and 6 mg/kg/day compared with amphotericin B deoxycholate at 0.7 mg/kg/day. The trial included 266 adult and one pediatric HIV-positive patients, with the pediatric patient receiving amphotericin B deoxycholate. Of the 267 treated patients, 86 received Ambisome at 3 mg/kg/day, 94 received 6 mg/kg/day, and 87 received amphotericin B deoxycholate. Cryptococcal meningitis was documented by a positive CSF culture at baseline in 73, 85, and 76 patients, respectively.

Patients received the study drug once daily for an induction period of 11 to 21 days. Following induction, all patients switched to oral fluconazole at 400 mg/day for adults and 200 mg/day for patients less than 13 years of age to complete 10 weeks of protocol-directed therapy. For mycologically evaluable patients — defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug, had a positive baseline CSF culture, and had at least one follow-up culture — success was evaluated at week 2 (i.e. 14 ± 4 days). Success was defined as CSF culture conversion. Success rates at 2 weeks for Ambisome and amphotericin B deoxycholate are summarized in the following table.

### SPL drug information for cefepime hydrochloride [^111StBrG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of cefepime hydrochloride IV (also known as Maxipime):

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of cefepime in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.

- **C. difficile infection**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea is reported with the use of cefepime hydrochloride and may present as mild diarrhea to more severe colitis.

- **Increased urine glucose**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as cefepime has been reported to cause false-positive results for urine glucose tests using copper reduction.

- **Neurotoxicity**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as cefepime has been associated with an increased risk of neurotoxicity, including encephalopathy, aphasia, myoclonus, seizures, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus, mostly occurring in patients with renal impairment who did not receive appropriate dosage adjustment.

- **Positive direct Coombs test**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as positive direct Coombs tests with or without hemolysis have been reported during treatment with cefepime.

### Leave no one behind: Response to new evidence and guidelines for the management of cryptococcal meningitis in low-income and middle-income countries [^112AfSLu]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

In 2018, WHO issued guidelines for the diagnosis, prevention, and management of HIV-related cryptococcal disease. Two strategies are recommended to reduce the high mortality associated with HIV-related cryptococcal meningitis in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs): optimized combination therapies for confirmed meningitis cases and cryptococcal antigen screening programs for ambulatory people living with HIV who access care.

WHO's preferred therapy for the treatment of HIV-related cryptococcal meningitis in LMICs is one week of amphotericin B plus flucytosine; the alternative therapy is two weeks of fluconazole plus flucytosine. In the ACTA trial, one week (short course) of amphotericin B plus flucytosine resulted in a 10-week mortality of 24% (95% CI -16 to 32), and two weeks of fluconazole and flucytosine resulted in a 10-week mortality of 35% (95% CI -29 to 41). However, with widely used fluconazole monotherapy, mortality due to HIV-related cryptococcal meningitis is approximately 70% in many African LMIC settings. Therefore, the potential to transform the management of HIV-related cryptococcal meningitis in resource-limited settings is substantial. Sustainable access to essential medicines, including flucytosine and amphotericin B, in LMICs is paramount and the focus of this personal view.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112Bh3dA]. ClinicalInfo (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for cerebral edema, especially concerning patients with cryptococcal meningitis, DHHS 2025 guidelines recommend removing a volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to at least halve the opening pressure or normalize the pressure to less than 20 cmH₂O. If a manometer is unavailable, remove 20–25 mL of CSF.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of cryptococcal disease: 2010 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1129qE4p]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for cryptococcal meningitis, particularly in pediatric patients, the IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend initiating amphotericin B deoxycholate at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day IV, plus flucytosine at 100 mg/kg/day PO in four divided doses for two weeks. This should follow the treatment length schedule for adults in non-HIV-infected, non-transplant patients. This is to be followed by fluconazole at 10–12 mg/kg/day PO for eight weeks as induction and consolidation therapy in pediatric patients with CNS disease.

### Primary antifungal prophylaxis for cryptococcal disease in HIV-positive people [^112p8ePK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Cryptococcal disease occurrence was assessed after excluding unconfirmed and suspected cases of the disease from our analysis. Hakim 2017 measured the occurrence of cryptococcal disease and used enhanced prophylaxis, which included co-interventions described in Table 2. These co-interventions were not deemed active against cryptococcal disease; therefore, this study was included in the pooled estimate.

Seven studies that measured cryptococcal disease identified 91 cases. Most studies did not report the source of the cryptococcal infection, referring simply to invasive cryptococcal disease. In Chetchotisakd 2004, all 10 cases were confirmed as cryptococcal meningitis, while Smith 2001 reported one case of cryptococcal pneumonia and one case of cryptococcal meningitis. Parkes-Ratanshi 2011 confirmed 11 cases of cryptococcal meningitis, five participants with invasive cryptococcal disease and positive blood cultures, and three participants who became CrAg-positive after starting prophylaxis. Hakim 2017 reported 32 new cases of cryptococcal infection: 22 cases of cryptococcal meningitis and one case of cryptococcal fungaemia in the standard prophylaxis arm, and nine cases of cryptococcal meningitis in the enhanced prophylaxis arm.

Meta-analysis showed a substantial reduction in the risk of developing cryptococcal disease in those who received antifungal prophylaxis. Participants on antifungal prophylaxis were 71% less likely to develop cryptococcal disease than those receiving placebo or standard care (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.49; seven trials, 5000 participants; Analysis 1.7).

### Outcomes of flucytosine-containing combination treatment for cryptococcal meningitis in a South African national access programme: A cross-sectional observational study [^112Wz1QG]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Although flucytosine is a key component of WHO-recommended induction treatment for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis, this antifungal agent is not widely available in low-income and middle-income countries due to limited production and cost. In 2018, a national flucytosine access programme was initiated in South Africa. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of flucytosine-containing induction regimens in routine care to motivate for the urgent registration of flucytosine and its inclusion in treatment guidelines.

- **Methods**: In this cross-sectional study, we compared outcomes of adults aged 18 years and older with incident laboratory-confirmed cryptococcal meningitis treated with or without flucytosine-containing regimens at 19 sentinel hospitals in South Africa. A case of cryptococcosis was defined as illness in an adult with: (1) positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) India ink microscopy, (2) a positive CSF cryptococcal antigen test, or (3) culture of Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii from CSF or any other specimen. We excluded patients without a case report form, those with an unknown or negative HIV serology result, those with a repeat episode, and those who did not receive antifungal treatment in the hospital. We assessed cumulative in-hospital mortality at 14 days and 30 days and calculated the overall crude in-hospital case-fatality ratio. We used random-effects logistic regression to examine the association between treatment group and in-hospital mortality.

### Emerging concepts in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis [^112QDaWL]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis remains a significant contributor to AIDS-related mortality despite widened access to antiretroviral therapy. Even in clinical trial settings, 10-week mortality is roughly 40%. A number of important clinical trials have either recently concluded or are actively recruiting.

The global burden of disease estimates suggests that cryptococcal meningitis causes 181,100 deaths annually. Screening blood for cryptococcal antigen in HIV-infected individuals with CD4 cell counts less than 100 cells/μl and preemptive antifungal treatment for those with detectable cryptococcal antigen reduces the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis and is likely to reduce mortality.

- **Treatment with amphotericin**: Cryptococcal meningitis treatment with conventional 14-day courses of amphotericin is associated with high toxicity and mortality; however, they can be reduced to 7 days if given alongside flucytosine. Flucytosine is a significantly superior adjunct to amphotericin treatment compared with fluconazole. In settings without amphotericin B, dual oral antifungal combinations of flucytosine and fluconazole offer an effective alternative treatment.

- **New approaches under trial**: A single, high dose of liposomal amphotericin is effective at reducing fungal burden and is being tested in a phase III trial.

Recently completed and ongoing clinical trials are increasing our understanding of how to optimize induction therapy for cryptococcal meningitis. Advocacy efforts are needed to broaden access to amphotericin formulations and flucytosine.

### Continuous infusion of amphotericin B deoxycholate in the treatment of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis: Analysis of safety and fungicidal activity [^116vQtAL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

We measured the fungicidal activity of a continuous infusion of amphotericin B deoxycholate plus 5-flucytosine using quantitative cultures of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from lumbar punctures of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with neurocryptococcosis during 14 days of treatment. Glomerular renal function was preserved in all patients. Mycological efficacy, with a progressive reduction in CSF cryptococcal colony-forming units, was comparable to the standard 4-hour infusion of amphotericin B.

### Treatment for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis [^111H9GLs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Cryptococcal meningitis is a severe fungal infection that occurs primarily in the setting of advanced immunodeficiency and remains a major cause of HIV‐related deaths worldwide. The best induction therapy to reduce mortality from HIV‐associated cryptococcal meningitis is unclear, particularly in resource‐limited settings where management of drug‐related toxicities associated with more potent antifungal drugs is a challenge.

The objective of this review is to evaluate the best induction therapy to reduce mortality from HIV‐associated cryptococcal meningitis and to compare the side effect profiles of different therapies.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), LILACS (BIREME), African Index Medicus, and Index Medicus for the South-East Asia Region (IMSEAR) from January 1, 1980, to July 9, 2018. Additional searches were conducted in the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the ISRCTN registry, as well as abstracts of select conferences published between July 1, 2014, and July 9, 2018.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials that compared antifungal induction therapies for the first episode of HIV‐associated cryptococcal meningitis. Comparisons included different individual or combination therapies, or the same antifungal therapies with differing durations of induction (less than two weeks or two or more weeks, the latter being the standard of care). Data were included regardless of age, geographical region, or drug regimen.

### Guidelines for diagnosing, preventing and managing cryptococcal disease among adults, adolescents and children living with HIV [^112PxHJh]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for cryptococcal meningitis, more specifically concerning indications for screening, the WHO 2022 guidelines recommend evaluating for signs and symptoms of meningitis carefully. Perform a lumbar puncture, if feasible, with a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination and India ink or a CSF cryptococcal antigen assay to exclude meningitis in all patients with HIV who have a positive cryptococcal antigen screening. Confirm a negative result on India ink by CSF cryptococcal antigen testing or CSF culture, as India ink has low sensitivity.

### Addition of flucytosine to fluconazole for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in Africa: A multicountry cost-effectiveness analysis [^117AqYXe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Mortality from cryptococcal meningitis remains very high in Africa. In the Advancing Cryptococcal Meningitis Treatment for Africa (ACTA) trial, two weeks of fluconazole (FLU) plus flucytosine (5FC) was as effective and less costly than two weeks of amphotericin-based regimens. However, many African settings treat with FLU monotherapy, and the cost-effectiveness of adding 5FC to FLU is uncertain.

- **Methods**: The effectiveness and costs of FLU+5FC were taken from ACTA, which included a costing analysis at the Zambian site. The effectiveness of FLU was derived from cohorts of consecutively enrolled patients, managed in respects other than drug therapy, as were participants in ACTA. FLU costs were derived from costs of FLU+5FC in ACTA by subtracting 5FC drug and monitoring costs. The cost-effectiveness of FLU+5FC versus FLU alone was measured as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). A probabilistic sensitivity analysis assessed uncertainties, and a bivariate deterministic sensitivity analysis examined the impact of varying mortality and 5FC drug costs on the ICER.

- **Results**: The mean costs per patient were US $847 (95% confidence interval [CI] $776–927) for FLU+5FC, and US $628 (95% CI $557–709) for FLU. The 10-week mortality rate was 35.1% (95% CI 28.9–41.7%) with FLU+5FC and 53.8% (95% CI 43.1–64.1%) with FLU. At the current 5FC price of US $1.30 per 500 mg tablet, the ICER of 5FC+FLU versus FLU alone was US $65 (95% CI $28–208) per life-year saved. Reducing the 5FC cost to between US $0.80 and US $0.40 per 500 mg resulted in an ICER between US $44 and US $28 per life-year saved.

### Early versus delayed antiretroviral treatment in HIV-positive people with cryptococcal meningitis [^111Hixtf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

HIV/AIDS remains one of the world's most significant public health challenges, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has substantially improved HIV prognosis by reducing associated morbidity and mortality. However, uncertainty remains regarding the optimal time for ART initiation when an HIV-positive person is co-infected with an opportunistic infection, particularly cryptococcal meningitis.

Cryptococcal meningitis is an important opportunistic AIDS-defining infection and a major contributor to high mortality before and after ART is initiated. It is caused by the encapsulated yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, which is inhaled as small yeast cells. Patients may present with headache, fever, malaise, and altered mental status; they may also have signs of meningism, papilledema, and focal neurological deficits. Raised intracranial pressure likely results from poor absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is usually responsible for the central nervous system manifestations. In addition to clinical history and physical examination, laboratory investigations assist accurate and timely diagnosis; recommended laboratory investigations include cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) in CSF or serum, India ink microscopy of CSF, or culture.

The case fatality rate in people with cryptococcal meningitis, the most common presentation of HIV-related cryptococcal disease in adults, remains unacceptably high, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where it is between 35%.

### Combination antifungal therapies for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis: a randomised trial [^112fKTfC]. Lancet (2004). Low credibility.

It frequently takes more than two weeks for drug treatments for cryptococcal meningitis to sterilize cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In-vitro and animal studies lend support to the use of combinations of amphotericin B, flucytosine, and fluconazole for the treatment of cryptococcosis. We compared the fungicidal activity of combinations of these drugs for the initial treatment of patients with cryptococcal meningitis.

- **Methods**: Sixty-four patients with a first episode of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis were randomized to initial treatment with: amphotericin B (0.7 mg/kg daily); amphotericin B plus flucytosine (100 mg/kg daily); amphotericin B plus fluconazole (400 mg daily); or triple therapy with amphotericin B, flucytosine, and fluconazole. Our primary endpoint was fungicidal activity, measured by the rate of reduction in CSF cryptococcal colony-forming units (CFU) from serial quantitative CSF cultures on days 3, 7, and 14 of treatment.

- **Findings**: Baseline CSF CFU counts were an important prognostic factor. Clearance of cryptococci from the CSF was exponential and was significantly faster with amphotericin B plus flucytosine than with amphotericin B alone (p = 0.0006), amphotericin B plus fluconazole (p = 0.02), or triple therapy (p = 0.02).

- **Interpretation**: At these doses, amphotericin B plus flucytosine is the most rapidly fungicidal regimen. Quantification of CSF cultures provides a powerful new means to accurately assess the fungicidal activity of new treatment regimens for cryptococcal meningitis.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^113pSnhB]. ClinicalInfo (2025). High credibility.

For therapeutic procedures concerning cryptococcal meningitis, particularly regarding CSF drainage, the DHHS 2025 guidelines recommend measures to decrease intracranial pressure (ICP) in all patients exhibiting confusion, blurred vision, papilledema, lower extremity clonus, or other neurological signs indicative of increased ICP. The initial management should include CSF drainage via lumbar puncture.

### Early versus delayed antiretroviral treatment in HIV-positive people with cryptococcal meningitis [^113z7eEs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Adverse events were not reported consistently across trials, preventing meta-analysis. Bisson 2013 noted that all 14 participants in the early ART arm and 13 out of 14 participants in the delayed ART arm experienced at least one grade 3 to 5 adverse event. Boulware 2014 reported the cumulative incidence of grade 3 to 5 adverse events as 84% (95% CI 74% to 90%) in the early ART group and 84% (95% CI 75% to 91%) in the delayed ART group. Makadzange 2010 described one episode of desquamating skin rash related to nevirapine, with liver function tests remaining normal throughout the trial. Zolopa 2009 did not report adverse events specifically for participants with cryptococcal meningitis.

- **All-cause mortality by antifungal therapy**: We subgrouped the primary outcome of all-cause mortality according to the type of antifungal therapy used. Among trials combining amphotericin B therapy with fluconazole (Bisson 2013; Boulware 2014), there was substantial unexplained heterogeneity (I² = 66%), thus effect estimates were not pooled. Another trial assessed fluconazole monotherapy (Makadzange 2010), showing increased mortality for those who initiated ART early compared to later (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.42; 54 participants; Analysis 1.9). Zolopa 2009 did not specify the antifungal therapy used (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.08 to 8.44; 35 participants; Analysis 1.9) and showed no overall difference in mortality.

### Mycamine [^113j82ax]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The treatment of candidemia, acute disseminated candidiasis, candida peritonitis, and abscesses with meningoencephalitis and/or ocular dissemination in pediatric patients younger than 4 months of age has not been established for safety and effectiveness. In a rabbit model of hematogenous Candida meningoencephalitis (HCME) with Candida albicans (minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.125 mcg/mL), a decrease in mean fungal burden in central nervous system (CNS) compartments was observed. This was assessed as the average of the combined fungal burden in the cerebrum, cerebellum, and spinal cord relative to untreated controls, with increasing micafungin dosages administered once daily for 7 days.

Data from the rabbit model suggest that a micafungin dose regimen of 4 mg/kg once daily is inadequate to treat meningoencephalitis. A dose regimen of approximately 10 to 25 mg/kg once daily may be necessary to lower the fungal burden in the CNS in pediatric patients younger than 4 months of age [see Microbiology (12.4)]. In this rabbit model, micafungin concentrations could not be reliably detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Due to limitations of the study design, the clinical significance of a decreased CNS fungal burden in the rabbit HCME model is uncertain.

### Cryptococcal meningitis treatment beyond HIV: Recognizing the need for individualized immune-based strategies [^114xPzFi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

The promising results of the Ambition-CM trial in persons with HIV have sparked interest in treating non-HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis with single 10 mg/kg liposomal amphotericin B, combined with oral flucytosine and fluconazole. However, caution is warranted when applying this approach to non-HIV organ transplant recipients, whose immune status may vary due to the effects of immunosuppressive drugs. In these patients, cryptococcal disease, which generally occurs after initial immunosuppressant doses are reduced, may be driven by fungal growth, an immune response to cryptococcal antigens, or both.

The latter is particularly relevant as potent antimicrobial therapy can lyse Cryptococcus, releasing antigens that trigger inflammation and cause host-mediated damage. Reducing iatrogenic immunosuppression may enhance host immune responses, which, in the context of neuro-infections, may be fatal. This highlights the importance of understanding the immune status of non-HIV organ transplant recipients within the context of the Damage-Response Framework to guide personalized treatment strategies.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116pnsXj]. ClinicalInfo (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventive measures for cryptococcal meningitis, specifically concerning primary prophylaxis, the 2025 guidelines from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) recommend that HIV-positive patients with a serum cryptococcal antigen titer greater than 1:640, as determined by lateral flow assay, be treated as if they have central nervous system (CNS) disease. This recommendation applies regardless of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture results or clinical signs or symptoms if CSF sampling is not available.

Several influential studies in this review were recently completed and not included in previous reviews of the best treatment for HIV‐associated cryptococcal meningitis. These include studies by Beardsley in 2016, Jarvis in 2018, and Molloy in 2018. A previous network meta-analysis (NMA) did not find evidence for a mortality benefit with two weeks of AmBd and 5FC compared to AmBd alone. This review had important methodological differences, such as the inclusion of both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, as well as studies with re‐treatment cases.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^117MBEKQ]. ClinicalInfo (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for cryptococcal meningitis, specifically in the context of primary prophylaxis, the DHHS 2025 guidelines for HIV-positive individuals recommend treating patients with a serum cryptococcal antigen titer of ≥ 1:640 by lateral flow assay (or > 1:160 by enzyme immunoassay or latex agglutination). This approach should be taken even in the absence of meningitis, treating them similarly to patients with CM, as the risk for mortality and/or progression to meningitis increases with fluconazole monotherapy alone.

### Treatment for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis [^114svc4h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Measures of treatment effect - **RCT analysis**: In the analysis of RCTs, we displayed mortality at each endpoint for interventions using forest plots. For dichotomous outcome measures, such as two-week mortality, we obtained risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, like the rate of fungal clearance, we calculated pairwise mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs.

- **Relative ranking**: We generated ranking probabilities for each intervention, considering each possible rank and cumulative ranking probabilities. We summarized the cumulative ranking probabilities using the surface under the cumulative ranking area (SUCRA) values. The SUCRA value represents the probability that a treatment will present the best outcome without uncertainty and was used to develop a hierarchy of treatments for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis.

- **Unit of analysis issues**: Our unit of analysis was HIV-positive individuals treated for an initial episode of cryptococcal meningitis.

- **Cluster-randomized trials**: Cluster-randomized trials were eligible for inclusion if methods were used that adjusted for clustering of data to analyze effect estimates at the individual level. We did not find studies with cluster-randomized designs.

- **Cross-over randomized clinical trials**: We excluded any cross-over randomized clinical trials.

- **Repeated observations on participants**: We assessed individual-level mortality outcomes for different periods of follow-up, including short-term (two-week) and medium-term (up to 10 weeks) durations.

### Usefulness of intraventricular infusion of antifungal drugs through Ommaya reservoirs for cryptococcal meningitis treatment [^116dAQ42]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2015). Low credibility.

Cryptococcal meningitis is a severe infection among immunosuppressed individuals, with a high mortality rate. Although amphotericin B is the first-choice drug for treatment, its use is restricted when adverse effects are clinically problematic. The usefulness of intraventricular infusion of antifungal drugs through Ommaya reservoirs for cryptococcal meningitis treatment has been unconfirmed. We evaluated the efficacy of intraventricular infusion of amphotericin B through Ommaya reservoirs.

- **Materials and methods**: We retrospectively analyzed 10 consecutive patients with cryptococcal meningitis who were refractory to systemic administration of antifungal drugs.

- **Results**: Fever or nausea occurred in most patients. However, no patient complained of serious complications such as renal toxicity. Seven patients recovered completely or partially, whereas three patients died.

- **Conclusions**: To establish the efficacy of the intraventricular infusion of antifungal drugs through Ommaya reservoirs for cryptococcal meningitis, a prospective investigation should be designed to compare those treated according to the updated guidelines and those treated with antifungal drugs through the Ommaya reservoirs.

### The global burden of HIV-associated cryptococcal infection in adults in 2020: A modelling analysis [^112FfW9N]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common cause of meningitis in adults living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. The estimates of national, regional, and global burden of cryptococcal meningitis are essential to guide prevention strategies and determine needs for diagnostic tests and treatments. We present a 2020 estimate of the global burden of HIV-associated cryptococcal infection (antigenaemia), cryptococcal meningitis, and cryptococcal-associated deaths.

- **Methods**: We defined advanced HIV disease as adults with a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/μL, as this group is at highest risk for cryptococcosis. We used UNAIDS estimates (2019–20) and population-based HIV impact assessment surveys (2016–18) to estimate the number of adults with CD4 counts of less than 200 cells/μL at risk for cryptococcosis, by country and region. Secondly, we summarised cryptococcal antigenaemia prevalence in those with a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/μL by reviewing published literature. Thereafter, we calculated the number of cryptococcal antigen (CrAg)-positive people in each country and region by multiplying the number with advanced HIV disease at risk for cryptococcal infection by the cryptococcal antigenaemia prevalence of the respective country or region. We estimated progression from cryptococcal antigenaemia to meningitis or death based on estimates from the published literature.

- **Findings**: We estimated that there were 4.3 million (IQR 3.0–4.8) adults with HIV and CD4 counts of less than 200 cells/μL globally in 2020. We calculated a mean global cryptococcal antigenaemia prevalence.

A prospective, multicenter, randomized study was conducted with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who were successfully treated for acute cryptococcal meningitis, were receiving secondary prophylaxis, and were naive for antiretroviral therapy. Patients were randomized to continue or discontinue secondary prophylaxis when the CD4 cell count had increased to > 100 cells/microL and an undetectable HIV RNA level had been sustained for 3 months. At a median of 48 weeks after randomization, there were no episodes of cryptococcal meningitis in either group.

### Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis: Time for action [^114LQhy9]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis was first described over a century ago. This fungal infection is preventable and treatable yet continues to be associated with excessive morbidity and mortality. The largest burden of the disease resides in people living with HIV in low-income and middle-income countries. In this group, mortality with the best antifungal induction regimen — 7 days of amphotericin B deoxycholate (1.0 mg/kg per day) and flucytosine (100.0 mg/kg per day) — in a clinical trial setting was 24% at 10 weeks.

The world is now at an inflection point in terms of recognition, research, and action to address the burden of morbidity and mortality from cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. However, the scope of interventional programs needs to increase, with particular attention to implementation science that is specific to individual countries.

This review summarizes causes of excessive mortality, interventions with proven survival benefits, and gaps in knowledge and practice that contribute to the ongoing high death toll from cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. For the Vietnamese and Chichewa translations of the abstract, see the Supplementary Materials section.

### Recent antiretroviral therapy initiation is associated with increased mortality risk in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis: An analysis of clinical trial data from Africa [^116sNkfQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Cryptococcal meningitis causes up to 19% of all AIDS-related deaths globally. In recent studies of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated cryptococcal meningitis, more than half of participants were antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced, either currently receiving or having previously received ART, when developing meningitis.

The evidence base for ART management among ART-naïve individuals presenting with cryptococcal meningitis is clear, with a causal association between early ART initiation following antifungal treatment and excess mortality. The COAT trial showed that ART initiation should be delayed for 4–6 weeks in ART-naïve individuals presenting with cryptococcal meningitis. However, the implications of being on ART at the time of diagnosis with cryptococcal meningitis, and the optimal ART management strategies in individuals presenting with cryptococcal meningitis after ART initiation, are less well understood.

Studies have consistently shown no overall mortality difference between ART-naïve and ART-experienced individuals with cryptococcal meningitis. Nonetheless, a secondary analysis from the Adjunctive Sertraline for Treatment of Cryptococcal Meningitis trial suggested an increased risk of mortality in people with HIV who presented with cryptococcal meningitis within 14 days of initiating ART compared with those on ART for longer (hazard ratio [HR], 1.90 [1.2–2.9]; P < 0.01). A similar finding was observed in the Antifungal Combinations for Treatment of Cryptococcal Meningitis in Africa (ACTA) trial (HR, 1.70 [0.85–3.39]).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116pXWjT]. ClinicalInfo (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for cryptococcal meningitis, more specifically concerning primary prophylaxis, the HIV-positive DHHS 2025 guidelines recommend considering treatment for patients with isolated or asymptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia without meningitis and low serum cryptococcal antigen titers (< 1:320 using lateral flow assay). This treatment should be similar to that for patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms and only focal pulmonary cryptococcosis, using fluconazole at 400–800 mg/day.

### Cefepime [^114yd9oe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Patient counseling information**: Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs, including Cefepime for Injection, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When Cefepime for Injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be informed that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance, making them not treatable by Cefepime for Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

- **Diarrhea**: Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs, which usually resolves when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Inform patients that they may develop watery and bloody stools, with or without stomach cramps and fever, during treatment and as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. Patients should be advised to contact their physician as soon as possible if this occurs.

- **Neurological adverse events**: Advise patients of neurological adverse events that could occur with Cefepime for Injection use. Instruct patients or their caregivers to inform their healthcare provider at once of any neurological signs and symptoms, including encephalopathy (disturbance of consciousness, such as confusion, hallucinations, stupor, and coma), aphasia (disturbance of speaking and understanding spoken and written language), myoclonus, or seizures.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of cryptococcal disease: 2010 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114k3FQj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). High credibility.

For specific circumstances of cryptococcal meningitis, particularly in patients with cerebral cryptococcomas, the IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend initiating amphotericin B deoxycholate at 0.7–1 mg/kg/day IV, liposomal amphotericin B at 3–4 mg/kg/day IV, or amphotericin B lipid complex at 5 mg/kg/day IV. These should be administered in combination with flucytosine at 100 mg/kg/day PO in four divided doses for a minimum of six weeks as induction therapy in patients with cerebral cryptococcosis.

### Early versus delayed antiretroviral treatment in HIV-positive people with cryptococcal meningitis [^112ctCLw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

The treatment of cryptococcal meningitis is usually initiated with a combination of antifungal agents during the induction phase, followed by a single oral antifungal in the consolidation phase [NIH 2017a; NIH 2017b; WHO 2018]. The preferred induction regimen is amphotericin B combined with flucytosine, followed by oral fluconazole for the consolidation phase until immune reconstitution occurs with ART. Guidelines recommend initiating ART within four to six weeks after cryptococcal meningitis treatment has commenced [WHO 2018].

There remains uncertainty as to when ART should be initiated in people with cryptococcal meningitis. This uncertainty is due to reports of higher mortality rates among patients who initiate ART early in cryptococcal meningitis treatment [Njei 2013]. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), an exaggerated inflammatory response that can cause a paradoxical clinical deterioration soon after ART initiation, has frequently been described in association with cryptococcal meningitis. Some reports suggest that IRIS may contribute to higher mortality among HIV-positive people who initiate ART early following a cryptococcal meningitis diagnosis compared to starting later. However, there is no clear evidence of such an association [Bicanic 2009; Müller 2010; Shelburne 2005]. Additionally, in many settings where cryptococcal meningitis is prevalent, amphotericin B and flucytosine are unavailable due to resource constraints. In such settings, the use of suboptimal cryptococcal meningitis treatment regimens is common.

### Meropenem [^1124X2Rm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Four hundred forty-six patients, including 397 pediatric patients aged 3 months to less than 17 years, were enrolled in four separate clinical trials. They were randomized to treatment with meropenem (n = 225) at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or a comparator drug, cefotaxime (n = 187) or ceftriaxone (n = 34), at the approved dosing regimens. A comparable number of patients were found to be clinically evaluable, ranging from 61% to 68%, with a similar distribution of pathogens isolated on initial CSF culture.

Patients were defined as clinically not cured if any of the following criteria were met:

- **At the 5 to 7 week post-completion of therapy visit**: The patient had moderate to severe motor, behavior, or development deficits, hearing loss greater than 60 decibels in one or both ears, or blindness.
- **During therapy**: The patient's clinical status necessitated the addition of other antibacterial drugs.
- **Either during or post-therapy**: The patient developed a large subdural effusion needing surgical drainage, or a cerebral abscess, or a bacteriologic relapse.

Using this definition, the following efficacy rates were obtained per organism, as noted in Table 10. The values represent the number of patients clinically cured/number of clinically evaluable patients, with the percent cure in parentheses.

Table 10: Efficacy rates by Pathogen in the Clinically Evaluable Population with Bacterial Meningitis

Sequelae were the most common reason patients were assessed as clinically not cured.

### Healthcare costs and life-years gained from treatments within the advancing cryptococcal meningitis treatment for Africa (ACTA) trial on cryptococcal meningitis: A comparison of antifungal induction strategies in sub-Saharan Africa [^112Y6n2K]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Statistical analysis was conducted to evaluate the economic aspects of various treatments for cryptococcal meningitis. Total cost, defined as observed use of resources multiplied by a specific unit price and increased for specific overhead costs, was adjusted using a Kaplan–Meier average estimator to account for censoring from death or loss to follow-up. Individual patient costs were calculated, and non-parametric bootstrapping was used to draw a stable sample — defined as the percentage change in standard deviation between two subsequent samples — from patient records by treatment arm to accommodate the skewed distribution of costs and the correlation between costs and effectiveness.

The 95% confidence intervals for the total cost per patient and the probability of death were calculated using the bias-corrected percentile acceleration method. The five ACTA treatments were ranked by their increasing costs. Strategies that were less effective and more costly than the comparator were ruled out (less economically attractive or dominated in economic terms), as were strategies that were less effective and had a higher incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (extended dominance). Of the remaining strategies, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated for each strategy, relative to the standard treatment and the next best alternative.

Costs per life-year saved were estimated by dividing mean incremental costs by the mean number of life-years saved. Cost-effectiveness planes and an acceptability curve were used to illustrate the uncertainties surrounding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. A series of one-way sensitivity analyses were performed, varying one parameter at a time to address uncertainty.

### Prevalence, correlates, and outcomes of cryptococcal antigen positivity among patients with AIDS, United States, 1986–2012 [^1148skLo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is one of the most common causes of AIDS-related mortality worldwide, accounting for 33%-63% of all cases of adult meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa and over 500,000 deaths annually. In sub-Saharan Africa, the World Health Organization recommends routinely screening AIDS patients with a CD4 count ≤ 100 cells/µL for cryptococcal infection. In the United States, there are no recommendations for routine screening. We aimed to determine the prevalence of cryptococcal infection and outcomes of those infected among people living with advanced AIDS in the United States to inform updates in the prevention and management of CM.

- **Methods**: Using stored sera from participants in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study and the Women's Interagency HIV Study from 1986 to 2012, we screened 1,872 specimens with CD4 T-cell counts ≤ 100 cells/µL for cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) using the CrAg lateral flow assay.

- **Results**: The overall prevalence of CrAg positivity within the study population was 2.9% (95% confidence interval, 0.2%-3.8%). Results from multivariable analysis revealed that a previous diagnosis with CM and a CD4 count ≤ 50 cells/µL were significantly associated with CrAg positivity. Participants who were CrAg positive had significantly shorter survival (2.8 years) than those who were CrAg negative (3.8 years; p = 0.03).

- **Conclusions**: The prevalence of cryptococcal infection among advanced AIDS patients in the United States was high and above the published cost-effectiveness threshold for routine screening. We recommend routine CrAg screening among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients with advanced AIDS.

### The effect of therapeutic lumbar punctures on acute mortality from cryptococcal meningitis [^112vd3x5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Further investigation of therapeutic lumbar punctures (LPs) during cryptococcal meningitis therapy is warranted to see if the beneficial effect is uniformly experienced in different settings and to better understand the role of multiple therapeutic LPs. In our cohort, therapeutic LPs were considered based on baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure and symptoms of raised intracranial pressure (ICP), whereas other studies have used a systematic approach by conducting scheduled therapeutic LPs for phase II trials to document early fungicidal activity. These studies with scheduled LPs have failed to find associations between raised baseline ICP and increased mortality.

Future trials should examine whether survival differs between a strategy to perform therapeutic LPs based on CSF opening pressures > 250 mmH₂O versus a strategy using a predefined schedule of lumbar punctures (e.g. on days 1, 3, 7, and 14) for all patients.

In conclusion, our analysis supports the call for continued vigilance of ICP management during the window of high mortality shortly after diagnosis with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis, including improved access to manometers to monitor CSF pressures and the use of therapeutic LPs to reduce CSF pressure during antifungal therapy.

### Treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in resource limited settings [^111KGzfJ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Cryptococcal meningitis most commonly occurs in advanced HIV. Although diminishing in the developed world with antiretroviral therapy (ART), it remains a major problem in resource-limited settings. ART rollout will improve long-term HIV survival if opportunistic infections are effectively treated. Considering cryptococcal meningitis in that context, this review addresses excess morbidity and mortality in developing countries, treatment in areas of limited drug availability, and challenges posed by combined anticryptococcal and HIV therapy.

- **Recent findings**: From early fungicidal activity (EFA) studies, amphotericin B-flucytosine is the best induction therapy but is often unavailable. High-dose amphotericin B monotherapy may be feasible in some settings. Where fluconazole is the only option, higher doses are more fungicidal. Serum cryptococcal antigen testing may identify patients at the highest disease risk, and primary prophylaxis is effective. The clinical role of such interventions needs to be established. Timing of ART introduction remains controversial; early initiation risks immune reconstitution disease (IRD), while delays may increase mortality.

- **Summary**: Amphotericin B-based treatment is appropriate where possible. More studies are needed to optimize fluconazole monotherapy doses. Other research priorities include the management of raised intracranial pressure, appropriate ART initiation, and IRD treatment. Studies should focus on developing countries where problems are greatest.

### Steroid responsive late deterioration in Cryptococcus neoformans variety gattii meningitis [^114hXXi4]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

The authors describe the clinical course of Cryptococcus neoformans variety gattii infection in a young immunocompetent man who had a late deterioration characterized by headaches, subarachnoid inflammation, hydrocephalus, and stroke that reproducibly responded to steroids. These findings, in combination with declining markers of CSF infection, are consistent with the late deterioration being caused by sterile arachnoiditis rather than ongoing infection.

### Treatment for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis [^112N6TUc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Cryptococcal meningitis is a severe fungal infection that occurs primarily in the setting of advanced immunodeficiency and remains a major cause of HIV-related deaths worldwide. The best induction therapy to reduce mortality from HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis is unclear, particularly in resource-limited settings where managing drug-related toxicities associated with more potent antifungal drugs is a challenge.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the best induction therapy to reduce mortality from HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis and to compare side effect profiles of different therapies.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), LILACS (BIREME), African Index Medicus, and Index Medicus for the South-East Asia Region (IMSEAR) from 1 January 1980 to 9 July 2018. We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the ISRCTN registry; and abstracts of select conferences published between 1 July 2014 and 9 July 2018.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials that compared antifungal induction therapies used for the first episode of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis. Comparisons could include different individual or combination therapies, or the same antifungal therapies with differing durations of induction (less than two weeks or two or more weeks, the latter being the standard of care). We included data regardless of age, geographical region, or drug dosage.

### Fluconazole [^116qznf9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Clinical studies**: Cryptococcal meningitis: In a multicenter study comparing fluconazole (200 mg/day) to amphotericin B (0.3 mg/kg/day) for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with AIDS, a multivariate analysis revealed three pretreatment factors that predicted death during the course of therapy: abnormal mental status, cerebrospinal fluid cryptococcal antigen titer greater than 1:1024, and cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count of less than 20 cells/mm³. Mortality among high-risk patients was 33% and 40% for amphotericin B and fluconazole patients, respectively (p = 0.58), with overall deaths 14% (9 of 63 subjects) and 18% (24 of 131 subjects) for the two arms of the study (p = 0.48). Optimal doses and regimens for patients with acute cryptococcal meningitis and at high risk for treatment failure remain to be determined.

- **Pediatric studies**: Oropharyngeal candidiasis: An open-label, comparative study of the efficacy and safety of fluconazole (2 to 3 mg/kg/day) and oral nystatin (400,000 I.U. 4 times daily) was conducted in immunocompromised pediatric patients from 6 months to 13 years of age with oropharyngeal candidiasis. Clinical and mycological response rates were higher in the children treated with fluconazole.

Clinical cure at the end of treatment was reported for 86% of fluconazole-treated patients compared to 46% of nystatin-treated patients. Mycologically, 76% of fluconazole-treated patients had the infecting organism eradicated compared to 11% for nystatin-treated patients.

### Global burden of disease of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis: an updated analysis [^1116gYA5]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Cryptococcus is the most common cause of meningitis in adults living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. Global burden estimates are crucial to guide prevention strategies and to determine treatment needs, and we aimed to provide an updated estimate of global incidence of HIV-associated cryptococcal disease.

- **Methods**: We used 2014 Joint UN Programme on HIV and AIDS estimates of adults (aged > 15 years) with HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage. Estimates of CD4 counts less than 100 cells per μL, virological failure incidence, and loss to follow-up were obtained from published multinational cohorts in low-income and middle-income countries. We calculated those at risk for cryptococcal infection, specifically those with CD4 counts less than 100 cells/μL not on ART, and those with CD4 counts less than 100 cells per μL on ART but lost to follow-up or with virological failure. Cryptococcal antigenaemia prevalence by country was derived from 46 studies globally. Based on cryptococcal antigenaemia prevalence in each country and region, we estimated the annual numbers of people developing and dying from cryptococcal meningitis.

- **Findings**: We estimated an average global cryptococcal antigenaemia prevalence of 6.0% [95% CI 5.8–6.2] among people with a CD4 cell count of less than 100 cells per μL, with 278,000 [95% CI 195,500–340,600] people positive for cryptococcal antigen globally and 223,100 [95% CI 150,600–282,400] incident cases of cryptococcal meningitis globally in 2014. Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 73% of the estimated cryptococcal meningitis cases in 2014, equating to 162,500 cases [95% CI 113,600].

### Primary antifungal prophylaxis for cryptococcal disease in HIV-positive people [^111sG3sr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Cryptococcal disease is an opportunistic infection that is common among people who are HIV-positive with low cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cell counts. In 2014, the global prevalence was 6%. It is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, both before and after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in patients with low CD4 counts. It is mostly caused by infection with *Cryptococcus neoformans*; *Cryptococcus gattii* is responsible in some cases. Patients may present with meningitis, pneumonia, or, in some rare cases, cutaneous, ophthalmic, or prostatic lesions. Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common presentation of HIV-related cryptococcal disease in adults. It is the leading cause of meningitis in adults in sub-Saharan Africa and accounts for 15% of HIV-related deaths globally. The case fatality rate in sub-Saharan Africa ranges from 35% to 65%, compared with 10% to 20% in most high-income countries. While high-income countries have seen a considerable reduction in the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis following increased access to ART, low-income countries have not experienced the same decline. This may be attributed to the late diagnosis of HIV and delays in starting ART in these settings. In some settings, over 50% of HIV-positive people presenting with cryptococcal meningitis are ART-experienced.

### Addition of flucytosine to fluconazole for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in Africa: A multicountry cost-effectiveness analysis [^1126UWQj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Mortality from cryptococcal meningitis remains very high in Africa. In the Advancing Cryptococcal Meningitis Treatment for Africa (ACTA) trial, two weeks of fluconazole (FLU) plus flucytosine (5FC) was as effective and less costly than two weeks of amphotericin-based regimens. However, many African settings treat with FLU monotherapy, and the cost-effectiveness of adding 5FC to FLU is uncertain.

The effectiveness and costs of FLU+5FC were taken from ACTA, which included a costing analysis at the Zambian site. The effectiveness of FLU was derived from cohorts of consecutively enrolled patients, managed in respects other than drug therapy, as were participants in ACTA. FLU costs were derived from costs of FLU+5FC in ACTA, by subtracting 5FC drug and monitoring costs. The cost-effectiveness of FLU+5FC vs. FLU alone was measured as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). A probabilistic sensitivity analysis assessed uncertainties and a bivariate deterministic sensitivity analysis examined the impact of varying mortality and 5FC drug costs on the ICER.

The mean costs per patient were US $847 (95% confidence interval [CI] $776–927) for FLU+5FC, and US $628 (95% CI $557–709) for FLU. The 10-week mortality rate was 35.1% (95% CI 28.9–41.7%) with FLU+5FC and 53.8% (95% CI 43.1–64.1%) with FLU. At the current 5FC price of US $1.30 per 500 mg tablet, the ICER of 5FC+FLU versus FLU alone was US $65 (95% CI $28–208) per life-year saved. Reducing the 5FC cost to between US $0.80 and US $0.40 per 500 mg resulted in an ICER between US $44 and U.S.

### Treatment for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis [^116aebb7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

- **Selection of studies**: We aggregated articles obtained from the electronic database via the search strategy and de-duplicated them in EndNote (EndNote 2013). Two review authors (MWT and AES) independently screened the titles and abstracts for potential eligibility. They obtained and assessed the full texts of potentially eligible articles and completed study eligibility forms (Appendix 2). Both authors evaluated articles for possible duplicate reporting, with one author (MWT) contacting study authors for additional information as needed. Discrepancies regarding the eligibility of individual studies were resolved through discussion or adjudication by additional review authors (NF and JNJ) when necessary. Search results were documented using a flow diagram following PRISMA recommendations, including the number of unique articles retrieved from the initial search, the number of titles excluded by review of the title and abstract, and the number of articles retrieved in full text. We listed excluded RCTs, with a brief justification for exclusion, in the 'Characteristics of excluded studies' table. No studies were excluded based on language.

- **Data extraction and management**: Two review authors (MWT and AES) independently used a standardized data extraction form to obtain study information, including data outlined in Appendix 3.

- **Assessment of risk of bias in included studies**: We assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. Studies were graded as 'low', 'high', or 'unclear'.

### Combination antifungal therapy for cryptococcal meningitis [^117RA18u]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Combination antifungal therapy, involving amphotericin B deoxycholate and flucytosine, is the recommended treatment for cryptococcal meningitis. However, it has not been demonstrated to reduce mortality compared to amphotericin B alone. We performed a randomized controlled trial to determine whether the combination of flucytosine or high-dose fluconazole with high-dose amphotericin B improves survival at 14 and 70 days.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized, three-group, open-label trial of induction therapy for cryptococcal meningitis in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. All patients received amphotericin B at a dose of 1 mg per kilogram of body weight per day. Patients in group 1 were treated for 4 weeks, whereas those in groups 2 and 3 were treated for 2 weeks. Patients in group 2 concurrently received flucytosine at a dose of 100 mg per kilogram per day for 2 weeks, and those in group 3 concurrently received fluconazole at a dose of 400 mg twice daily for 2 weeks.

- **Results**: A total of 299 patients were enrolled. Fewer deaths occurred by days 14 and 70 among patients receiving amphotericin B and flucytosine than among those receiving amphotericin B alone (15 vs. 25 deaths by day 14; hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.30 to 1.08; unadjusted P = 0.08; and 30 vs. 44 deaths by day 70; hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.97; unadjusted P = 0.04). Combination therapy with fluconazole had no significant effect on survival compared to monotherapy (hazard ratio for death by 14 days, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.44 to 1.41; P = 0.42; hazard ratio for death by 70 days, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.45 to.

### Primary antifungal prophylaxis for cryptococcal disease in HIV-positive people [^114aEdrq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

There are two broad approaches to preventing cryptococcal disease. The first method, primary prophylaxis, consists of treating all those with a low CD4 count with prophylactic antifungals while simultaneously initiating ART. This approach prevents cryptococcal disease during the period of immune recovery. The second method of controlling cryptococcal disease involves screening and pre-emptive treatment, which has been recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). It relies on the ability to detect cryptococcal antigen in the blood. Patients who are HIV-positive and have severe disease with low CD4 counts are tested for the presence of cryptococcal antigen in the blood. If positive, they are investigated for cryptococcal disease and treated with antifungals.

Both methods offer distinct advantages and disadvantages. Primary prophylaxis has been shown to be effective at reducing the incidence of cryptococcal meningitis at a population level, but it is less cost-effective. Prior to this review, the use of prophylactic antifungals in cryptococcal antigen-negative patients with low CD4 counts was only recommended by the WHO if a prolonged delay in ART initiation was likely. This recommendation was based on several factors: the lack of a consistent survival benefit associated with primary prophylaxis, the costs of providing prophylaxis to a large number of people, and concerns over drug resistance and congenital anomalies.

The focus of this review was solely on the effects of primary prophylaxis with an antifungal agent.

### Treatment for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis [^111sdDKV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Risk of bias in included studies is summarized in Figure 2 and Figure 3.

- **Risk of bias graphs**: Review authors' judgments about each risk of bias item are presented as percentages across all included studies.

- **Risk of bias summary**: Review authors' judgments about each risk of bias item for each included study.

- **Allocation**: All trials were randomized, but two studies did not state whether random sequence generation was used and were therefore assessed as at unclear risk of bias (van der Horst 1997; Mayanja‐Kizza 1998). Similarly, five studies were at unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment because the method of allocation concealment was not clearly stated (van der Horst 1997; Pappas 2009; Nussbaum 2010; Jackson 2012; Loyse 2012).

- **Blinding**: Most studies did not blind participants, personnel, and outcome assessors and were at high risk of bias for both domains. Only one study was at low risk of bias for both domains (Beardsley 2016). We did not downgrade GRADE assessments for performance or detection bias for the other included studies, as we judged that measurement of the primary outcome (mortality) was unlikely to be biased due to lack of blinding.

- **Incomplete outcome data**: All but one study was at low risk of attrition bias due to very low loss to follow-up. One included study was at high risk of bias due to 14% (8/58) loss to follow-up by six months (Mayanja‐Kizza 1998).

- **Selective reporting**: All but one study was at low risk of reporting bias and reported on all prespecified primary and secondary outcomes.

### Cryptococcus gattii meningitis complicated by Listeria monocytogenes infection [^115iNitU]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Among immunocompetent persons with cryptococcal disease, infection with a second organism is rare; all reported cases have involved concomitant mycobacterial infections. Immunosuppression is not a necessary precondition for infection with Cryptococcus gattii, and among immunocompetent persons, C. gattii infection confers high mortality rates, up to 24% according to a large case series. In addition, cryptococcomas are frequently observed in patients with C. gattii, as opposed to C. neoformans, infection, commonly necessitating longer courses of treatment. We report a fatal case of C. gattii and Listeria monocytogenes co-infection in an immunocompetent woman with cryptococcomas.

The patient was a previously healthy 23-year-old Hispanic woman who was hospitalized in 2009 after weeks of headache and recent-onset diplopia. Lumbar puncture revealed elevated opening pressure of 52 cm H₂O; elevated leukocytes (1,030 cells/μL: 31% neutrophils, 55% lymphocytes, 14% monocytes); elevated protein concentration (117 g/L); and decreased glucose concentration (30 mg/dL). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) titer was 1:64, and culture grew C. gattii. HIV antibody test result was negative. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated scattered enhancing round lesions within the cerebrum and cerebellum, consistent with cryptococcomas. The patient was prescribed intravenous amphotericin B (1 mg/kg/d) and intravenous flucytosine (2 g/6 h); after 5 days of therapy, culture of a repeat lumbar puncture sample was negative. The patient was then gi…

### Recent antiretroviral therapy initiation is associated with increased mortality risk in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis: An analysis of clinical trial data from Africa [^115w6qAf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

In addition to the group of individuals started on ART within 14 days before their diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis, with probable active cryptococcal meningitis at the time of ART start, a further proportion diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis may have had asymptomatic or early subclinical cryptococcal infection at the time of ART initiation and present with "unmasking" immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), typically within two months of ART initiation. There are also individuals taking effective ART but who have not yet achieved significant reconstitution of CD4 counts, leaving them vulnerable to cryptococcal disease. Finally, a proportion have been on ART for longer durations but may have virological nonsuppression due to challenges with ART adherence or HIV drug resistance. The population developing cryptococcal meningitis after ART initiation is therefore a heterogeneous group who need different ART management strategies.

To address these evidence gaps, we performed a secondary analysis of Ambisome Therapy Induction Optimisation (AMBITION) trial data and another analysis combining AMBITION data with the preceding ACTA trial to:

- **Examine whether patients with cryptococcal meningitis diagnosed within 14 days of ART initiation are at higher mortality risk**: We compared these patients to those not on ART or on ART for longer durations.

- **Describe the baseline characteristics of individuals with cryptococcal meningitis according to ART status**: This involved a detailed comparison of the different groups of ART recipients.

- **Determine the impact of interrupting ART at the diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis**: This analysis aimed to provide insights into whether ART interruption affects outcomes in these patients.

### Clinical treatment of cryptococcal meningitis: An evidence-based review on the emerging clinical data [^112yrD7k]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a fatal fungal central nervous system (CNS) infection caused by Cryptococcus infecting the meninges and/or brain parenchyma. The primary clinical manifestations include fever, headache, neck stiffness, and visual disturbances. Both immunocompromised individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or those who have undergone organ transplantation, as well as immunocompetent individuals, can be susceptible to CM. Without treatment, patients with CM may experience a mortality rate of up to 100% after hospital admission. Even after receiving therapy, CM patients may still face challenges such as difficulty in curing the infection, poor prognosis, and high mortality. Therefore, timely and effective treatment is essential to improve the mortality and prognosis of CM patients.

Currently, the clinical outcomes of CM are frequently unsatisfactory due to limited drug choices, severe adverse reactions, drug resistance, and other issues. This review examines the research progress of CM treatment strategies and discusses suitable options for managing CM. The aim is to provide a reference for physicians to select the most appropriate treatment regimens for CM patients.

### Cryptococcal meningitis: Improving access to essential antifungal medicines in resource-poor countries [^114y2sFj]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Cryptococcal meningitis is the leading cause of adult meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa and contributes up to 20% of AIDS-related mortality in low-income and middle-income countries every year. Antifungal treatment for cryptococcal meningitis relies on three old, off-patent antifungal drugs: amphotericin B deoxycholate, flucytosine, and fluconazole. Widely accepted treatment guidelines recommend amphotericin B and flucytosine as the first-line induction treatment for cryptococcal meningitis.

However, flucytosine is unavailable in Africa and most of Asia, and safe amphotericin B administration requires patient hospitalization and careful laboratory monitoring to identify and treat common side effects. Therefore, fluconazole monotherapy is widely used in low-income and middle-income countries for induction therapy, but this treatment is associated with significantly increased rates of mortality.

We review the antifungal drugs used to treat cryptococcal meningitis with respect to clinical effectiveness and access issues specific to low-income and middle-income countries. Each drug poses unique access challenges: amphotericin B through cost, toxic effects, and insufficiently coordinated distribution; flucytosine through cost and scarcity of registration; and fluconazole through challenges in maintaining local stocks, such as the sustainability of donations or insufficient generic supplies.

We advocate for ten steps that need to be taken to improve access to safe and effective antifungal therapy for cryptococcal meningitis.

### Treatment for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis [^116aGavx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

The relative effects of treatment combinations are derived from network meta-analysis. The data, presented in a league table, illustrate the relative effects of each treatment combination. Treatment effects derived from network meta-analysis were generally similar to those derived from pairwise meta-analysis.

- **Ten-week mortality treatment effect estimates**: The values in the table are risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals. Bolded values represent statistically significant effects. The bottom half of the table represents network meta-analysis-derived treatment effects, while the top half represents results from direct comparisons alone. For network meta-analysis-derived effects, RR < 1 favors the treatment combination in the column. For effects derived from pairwise meta-analysis, RR < 1 favors the treatment combination in the row. Treatment combinations are ordered by surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) rankings.

Most treatment effects had low precision for the 10-week mortality estimates. Using two weeks of AmBd and FLU as reference, the RR (95% CI) of 10-week mortality for each treatment combination in order of SUCRA ranking is as follows: one week of AmBd and 5FC 0.56 (0.38 to 0.82), two weeks of AmBd and 5FC and FLU 0.60 (0.19 to 1.85), two weeks of 5FC and FLU 0.83 (0.63 to 1.07), two weeks of L-AmB 0.54 (0.05 to 5.35), two weeks of AmBd and 5FC and IFNg 0.82 (0.41 to 1.64), two weeks of AmBd and 5FC 0.89 (0.70 to 1.13), one week of AmBd and 5FC and FLU 0.98 (0.38 to 2.50), FLU 1.18 (0.72 to 1.94), one week of AmBd and FLU 1.14 (0.87 to 1.50), AmBd and FLU and steroids 1.15.

### Guidelines for diagnosing, preventing and managing cryptococcal disease among adults, adolescents and children living with HIV [^113o8LfT]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis, specifically with respect to indications for screening, the WHO 2022 guidelines recommend screening for cryptococcal antigen followed by preemptive antifungal therapy in cryptococcal antigen-positive patients. This is to prevent the development of invasive cryptococcal disease before initiating or reinitiating antiretroviral therapy in adult and adolescent patients with HIV who have a CD4 cell count of less than 100 cells/mm³. Screening should be considered at a higher CD4 cell count threshold of less than 200 cells/mm³.
