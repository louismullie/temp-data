## Question

treating acute blood loss anemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step management plan for acute blood loss anemia with citations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate hemodynamic stabilization and bleeding control. Then, I should determine an evidence-based transfusion strategy using restrictive thresholds and a single-unit approach. Next, I will evaluate and treat iron deficiency with an oral-first strategy while defining clear indications for IV iron. After that, I need to integrate patient blood management principles pre-, intra-, and post-operatively. Then, I should consider special populations such as cardiovascular disease, CKD, and cancer. Finally, I will outline monitoring, follow-up, and common pitfalls to avoid, ensuring each step is grounded in current guidelines and trials [^11528u41] [^111kHxR1] [^1174U4w4].

> Let me first confirm the initial priorities: in acute blood loss anemia, I need to rapidly assess hemodynamics, control the bleeding source, and initiate resuscitation while remembering that early hemoglobin values can lag due to hemodilution, so clinical signs of hypoperfusion and organ ischemia must guide urgent decisions rather than a single Hb value alone [^11528u41]. Wait, let me verify transfusion indications in true emergencies: in acute hemorrhage or unstable coronary syndromes, rapid RBC transfusion is appropriate when benefits outweigh risks, concurrent with source control and standard shock management, which is consistent with KDIGO's acute-use guidance and ESAIC perioperative recommendations [^113G3P1E] [^11528u41].

> I will now examine transfusion thresholds and strategy using a restrictive approach because that consistently shows equivalent or better outcomes than liberal thresholds across many settings; generally, Hb less than 7 g/dL triggers transfusion in stable adults, and between 7–8 g/dL I should individualize based on symptoms, ongoing bleeding, and cardiopulmonary reserve, avoiding transfusion above 8 g/dL unless there is critical ischemia or compelling physiology [^1174U4w4] [^11528u41]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: I almost stated a universal 8 g/dL threshold, but that would ignore substantial RCT and guideline support for 7–8 g/dL triggers with clinical context and exceptions for high-risk states like active coronary ischemia where 8–9 g/dL may be reasonable, consistent with perioperative and hematology guidance for comorbid cardiovascular disease [^1174U4w4] [^11528u41] [^111zj53d].

> Next, I should confirm the unit-by-unit transfusion tactic to avoid overtransfusion: a single-unit strategy with reassessment of Hb and clinical status after each unit is recommended, especially postoperatively, and aligns with physiologic, symptom-guided decision-making rather than automatic multi-unit orders [^11528u41]. Wait, I should double-check that this applies broadly beyond the postoperative setting: yes, the principle of reassessment after each unit is a general good practice to minimize unnecessary exposure and is embedded in multiple transfusion algorithms and PBM pathways [^11528u41].

> I need to ensure the underlying cause and iron status are evaluated once the patient is stabilized: order ferritin, transferrin saturation, and consider reticulocyte count to gauge marrow response; if expected reticulocytosis is absent, I should check B12 and folate and reassess for ongoing bleeding or other causes, using reflex pathways where available to reduce delays [^111kHxR1] [^114B7TJR] [^115Stthx]. Hold on, I should verify the lab panels in CKD or complex comorbidity: UKKA recommends CBC with indices, reticulocyte parameters or TSAT/ferritin, and CRP when inflammation is suspected to interpret iron studies correctly, which helps avoid misclassification of absolute versus functional iron deficiency [^112sp2gt].

> Let me consider iron repletion strategy: oral iron is first-line for confirmed absolute iron deficiency when time and tolerance allow; ferrous sulfate is preferred for cost reasons, once-daily or every-other-day dosing improves tolerance without sacrificing absorption, and adding vitamin C can improve uptake; if ferritin and Hb fail to respond or time is short, I should switch to IV iron, with a preference for formulations that can correct deficits in 1–2 infusions, particularly in perioperative or postoperative contexts where IV iron is favored over oral [^115DLfwi] [^1171HNcN] [^112vuts9] [^113R5eoF]. Wait, I need to check whether IV iron should be used indiscriminately in all anemic patients preoperatively: no, BSH explicitly cautions against indiscriminate IV iron and recommends it for confirmed deficiency with intolerance, suboptimal response, or insufficient time to await oral response, which I must adhere to [^115CKpak]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost forgot the timing expectations: ESAIC notes allowing about 1–2 weeks after parenteral stimulation and 3–8 weeks for oral correction depending on complexity, which matters for scheduling surgery and setting expectations [^1128uafv].

> I will now examine patient blood management integration: the three pillars are optimizing red cell mass, minimizing blood loss, and optimizing tolerance of anemia; practically, that means screening major elective surgical patients early, targeting Hb less than 130 g/L as a trigger to evaluate and treat deficiencies, employing antifibrinolytics like tranexamic acid and cell salvage, and postponing elective surgery in non-cancer patients until anemia is corrected when feasible to reduce transfusion and complications [^111jFZne] [^111rqp4D] [^116biouZ]. Let me verify the PBM framework definition and multidisciplinary implementation: consensus statements emphasize PBM as a patient-centered, evidence-based approach embedded into perioperative pathways, with turnkey order sets facilitating standardized adoption in cardiac surgery, which I should leverage when building institutional flows [^116oCUnG] [^116hGhgC].

> But wait, what if the patient falls into a special population where thresholds or adjuncts shift: in active cardiovascular disease or acute coronary syndromes, a higher transfusion threshold such as 8–9 g/dL can be reasonable to mitigate ischemia; in CKD, after iron optimization, consider ESA therapy with targets for Hb rise around 10–20 g/L per month and dose individualization; in cancer, transfuse promptly for Hb below 7–8 g/dL or severe symptomatic anemia needing rapid improvement, and schedule IV iron before or after cytotoxic cycles but not on chemotherapy day; for bariatric or other malabsorption states, IV iron is often required due to impaired duodenal absorption [^1142Vq2q] [^116ZNK3B] [^113phhGj] [^113747FM] [^1166Qywe]. Hold on, I should verify that in acute hemorrhage KDIGO also supports transfusion when rapid correction is needed, which aligns with my earlier emergency note and reinforces individualization by physiology and urgency [^113G3P1E].

> Next, I should review monitoring and response: I expect a reticulocyte rise within 3–5 days of effective iron therapy and a hemoglobin increase of at least 10 g/L by about 2 weeks with daily oral iron; failure to meet that early benchmark predicts poor subsequent response and should prompt a switch to IV iron, evaluation for nonadherence, malabsorption, continued bleeding, or alternate diagnoses; complete iron repletion usually requires 1000–1500 mg elemental iron, and I should continue until ferritin and TSAT indicate restored stores, with hematology referral for persistent unexplained anemia based on severity thresholds [^114wkrGu] [^111kHxR1]. Let me double-check that early monitoring is explicitly recommended: yes, BSG emphasizes prompt, measurable response and early action if the 2-week Hb rise threshold is not met, which operationalizes our follow-up plan [^114wkrGu].

> I need to ensure common pitfalls are avoided: do not transfuse solely based on Hb when it is greater than 8 g/dL without clinical justification; do not ignore ongoing bleeding sources while focusing on anemia correction; do not use IV iron without confirmed deficiency or clear indications; and do not delay necessary procedures unnecessarily when anemia is mild and can be corrected shortly thereafter, always balancing risk, urgency, and physiology [^1174U4w4] [^115CKpak] [^11528u41]. Hold on, I should verify one more thing: I initially considered starting iron repletion during active exsanguination, but that's not the immediate priority; stabilization and hemostasis come first, with iron therapy instituted as soon as the patient is hemodynamically safe to benefit from erythropoiesis, which is consistent with guideline sequencing [^11528u41].

> To synthesize the bedside flow: if unstable, prioritize fluids, hemorrhage control, and emergent transfusion guided by physiology; once stable, apply restrictive thresholds with single-unit reassessment; evaluate iron status and treat deficiency, starting with oral iron when feasible and switching to IV iron when time is limited or response is inadequate; embed PBM measures to prevent, detect, and treat anemia early; adapt thresholds and adjuncts for special populations; and monitor for a reticulocyte rise by day 3–5 and a hemoglobin increase of at least 10 g/L by two weeks, escalating promptly if the response is suboptimal [^11528u41] [^1174U4w4] [^114wkrGu].

Treating acute blood loss anemia requires **immediate hemostasis** and **rapid volume resuscitation** with crystalloids or colloids to restore perfusion. Transfuse RBCs when **hemoglobin < 7 g/dL** in stable patients, or at **7–8 g/dL** if symptomatic or with cardiovascular disease, using a **single-unit strategy with reassessment** [^1174U4w4] [^111iu7p9]. For massive hemorrhage, activate an MTP with balanced RBC:plasma:platelets and give **tranexamic acid within 3 hours**. Correct coagulopathy with plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate as indicated [^117N2vKK]. After stabilization, address the cause and replete iron — prefer IV iron when rapid correction is needed or oral iron is not tolerated [^115DLfwi].

---

## Immediate stabilization and hemostasis

- **Airway and breathing**: Ensure airway patency and provide supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO₂ ≥ 94%.

- **Circulation**: Establish two large-bore IV lines or intraosseous access for rapid infusion.

- **Hemostasis**: Identify and control bleeding with direct pressure, tourniquets, surgical intervention, or endovascular techniques [^112KHCko].

---

## Volume resuscitation

Use **isotonic crystalloids** (normal saline or lactated Ringer's) for initial volume replacement; consider colloids (e.g. albumin) if large crystalloid volumes are required, although crystalloids are generally preferred.

---

## Red blood cell transfusion

Transfuse RBCs when **hemoglobin < 7 g/dL** in stable patients, or **7–8 g/dL** if symptomatic or with cardiovascular disease [^1174U4w4] [^111zj53d], using a **single-unit strategy with reassessment after each unit** [^11528u41] [^111iu7p9].

---

## Massive transfusion protocol (MTP)

- **Activation**: Activate MTP for massive hemorrhage (≥ 10 units RBCs in 24 hours or ≥ 4 units in 1 hour).

- **Balanced transfusion**: Administer RBCs, plasma, and platelets in a 1:1:1 ratio.

- **Tranexamic acid**: Administer within 3 hours of injury to reduce mortality.

---

## Correction of coagulopathy

- **Plasma**: Administer fresh frozen plasma for INR > 1.5 or active bleeding [^117N2vKK].

- **Platelets**: Transfuse platelets if count < 50,000/µL in actively bleeding patients.

- **Cryoprecipitate**: Use for fibrinogen < 1.5 g/L.

---

## Iron supplementation

Oral iron is **first-line therapy** for stable patients with absolute iron deficiency anemia [^112vuts9]. Prefer IV iron [^111kHxR1] when rapid correction is needed or when oral iron is not tolerated [^1115AV6R] [^116wp4dY].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regularly monitor **hemoglobin, hematocrit, and coagulation parameters**, and assess for signs of ongoing bleeding, transfusion reactions, and complications [^116oCUnG]. Identify and treat the underlying cause of anemia to prevent recurrence.

---

Management of acute blood loss anemia entails **immediate hemostasis**, volume resuscitation, RBC transfusion, MTP activation, correction of coagulopathy, iron supplementation, and ongoing monitoring [^112KHCko].

### Is there a "magic" hemoglobin number? Clinical decision support promoting restrictive blood transfusion practices [^112AF6Kw]. American Journal of Hematology (2015). Low credibility.

Blood transfusion has been identified as one of the most frequently performed therapeutic procedures, with a significant percentage of transfusions deemed inappropriate. Recent key clinical trials in adults have provided Level 1 evidence to support restrictive red blood cell (RBC) transfusion practices. However, some advocates have attempted to identify a "correct" Hb threshold for RBC transfusion, whereas others assert that managing anemia, including transfusion decisions, must take into account clinical patient variables rather than relying solely on a single diagnostic laboratory test. The heterogeneity of guidelines for blood transfusion by various medical societies reflects this controversy. Clinical decision support (CDS) employs a hemoglobin threshold number in a smart Best Practices Alert (BPA) upon physician order to trigger a utilization self-review regarding the appropriateness of blood transfusion therapy. This review summarizes Level 1 evidence from seven key clinical trials in adults that support restrictive transfusion practices, along with strategies enabled by CDS that have demonstrated value in improving blood utilization by promoting restrictive transfusion practices.

### Red blood cell transfusion for hematologic disorders [^113xmEQh]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have determined, in surgical and critically ill patients, relatively safe hemoglobin (Hb) thresholds of 7–8 g/dL to guide restrictive transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs). However, in patients with various hematologic disorders, strong evidence in support of such an approach is sparse, and the optimal transfusion practice is yet to be defined.

This review focuses on RBC transfusion practice in three hematologic diseases and a treatment strategy, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia, thalassemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These entities manifest in a broad spectrum of anemia, acute or chronic, in patients with different comorbidities and degrees of transfusion requirement. Thus, the nuances in the indications of RBC transfusion and the goals to achieve in these specific situations may have been underappreciated. The limited data available highlight the importance of titrating RBC transfusion based on the clinical context and patient characteristics.

Future RCTs are necessary to firmly establish the Hb thresholds associated with improved outcomes relevant to these specific patient populations, which will facilitate personalized decision-making in RBC transfusion.

- **Peripheral blood smear and bone marrow examination**: These tests are advised in some cases to assess for abnormal blood cell morphology and bone marrow pathology.

- **TIBC, transferrin saturation, ferritin, folate, and vitamin B12 tests**: These tests help evaluate iron status and rule out vitamin deficiencies.

- **Hemoglobinopathy screening**: Conducted where indicated, to check for inherited conditions affecting hemoglobin structure.

- **Reticulocyte count**: Useful for assessing marrow response to anemia.

- **Occult blood loss and assessment for renal insufficiency**: These assessments are critical in evaluating anemia causes.

- **Baseline EPO level**: Establishing erythropoietin levels provides insight into anemia etiology.

- **Serum TSH**: This test is administered where thyroid dysfunction is suspected.

- **Direct Coombs test**: Recommended for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or a history of autoimmune disease, to evaluate hemolytic anemia.

### Iron replacement therapy: Do we need new guidelines [^114JkrER]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to address the global issue of anemia, which affects approximately one-third of the world's population. At least half of these cases are attributed to iron deficiency. The advent of new intravenous iron preparations over the past decade has led to uncertainty about when these compounds should be administered and under what circumstances oral therapy remains an appropriate and effective treatment.

Recent findings indicate that numerous guidelines exist, yet none provide detailed information on therapeutic start and endpoints or the best approach to treating iron-deficiency anemia based on underlying causes or concurrent diseases.

The study highlights significant aspects to be considered in revising future guidelines for optimal iron replacement therapy. These include assessing the need for treatment, determining the appropriate timing to start and stop treatment, scheduling follow-ups for potential relapses, recommending correct dosages and types of therapy, and identifying patients who may not require treatment.

### Alternative blood transfusion triggers: A narrative review [^115wQkb8]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Low credibility.

Anemia, characterized by low hemoglobin levels, is a global public health concern. Anemia is an independent factor worsening outcomes in various patient groups. Blood transfusion has been the traditional treatment for anemia; its triggers are primarily based on hemoglobin levels. However, hemoglobin level is not always an ideal trigger for blood transfusion. Additionally, blood transfusion can worsen clinical outcomes in certain patient groups. This narrative review explores alternative triggers for red blood cell transfusion and their physiological basis.

The review delves into the physiology of oxygen transport and highlights the limitations of using hemoglobin levels alone as a transfusion trigger. The main aim of blood transfusion is to optimize oxygen delivery, necessitating an individualized approach based on clinical signs of anemia and the balance between oxygen delivery and consumption, reflected by the oxygen extraction rate. The narrative review covers different alternative triggers. It presents insights into their diagnostic value and clinical applications, emphasizing the need for personalized transfusion strategies.

Anemia and blood transfusion are significant factors affecting patient outcomes. While restrictive transfusion strategies are widely recommended, they may not account for the nuances of specific patient populations. The search for alternative transfusion triggers is essential to tailor transfusion therapy effectively, especially in patients with comorbidities or unique clinical profiles.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^114wkrGu]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Blood transfusion is rarely required to treat iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) because most patients with slowly developing anaemia adapt to the resulting physiological stress. Parenteral iron reliably produces a clinically meaningful hemoglobin (Hb) response within a week, making it a viable alternative. Transfusion should therefore be reserved for those with severe symptomatic and/or circulatory compromise. If used, packed red cells should be transfused in accordance with established good practice guidelines, and a target Hb of 70–90 g/L (80–100 g/L in those with unstable coronary artery disease) would be reasonable. Since a unit of packed red cells contains about 200 mg of elemental iron, it will not replenish the iron store deficit in severe IDA, so restrictive transfusion should be followed by adequate iron replacement.

There should be a prompt and measurable haematological response to the initiation of iron replacement therapy (IRT), and early monitoring should detect patients not responding to or intolerant of oral iron. Failure to respond to oral iron has many causes, including non-compliance, malabsorption, systemic disease, bone marrow pathology, haemolysis, continued bleeding, and deficiency of vitamin B12 or folic acid.

The absence of an Hb rise of at least 10 g/L after 2 weeks of daily oral IRT is strongly predictive of subsequent failure to achieve a sustained haematological response (sensitivity 90.1%, specificity 79.3% for adequate subsequent response). In this situation, parenteral iron is more effective than continuing traditional oral therapy.

Logistically, it may be difficult to manage all cases effectively.

### Return on investment of preoperative anemia management programs in cardiac surgery: An advisory from the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists Clinical Practice Improvement Committee with endorsement by the Society for the Advancement of Patient Blood Management [^114UTbS7]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Low credibility.

Despite multiple recent guidelines recommending the diagnosis and treatment of anemia before elective cardiac surgery, few institutions have formal programs or methods in place to accomplish this. A major limitation is the perceived financial shortfall and the leadership buy-in required to undertake such an initiative. The purpose of this advisory from the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists (SCA) Clinical Practice Improvement Committee with endorsement by the Society for the Advancement of Patient Blood Management (SABM) is to provide an overview of preoperative anemia management programs with an emphasis on the associated financial implications.

- **Bolded bullet points**: This advisory reviews the evidence for preoperative anemia management programs in both cardiac and noncardiac surgery, discusses options for managing preoperative anemia, provides novel financial modeling regarding the implementation of preoperative anemia management programs, and describes implementation challenges, potential solutions, and opportunities for improvement.

### Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill children: a narrative review [^111THkCf]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

To review the pathophysiology of anemia, as well as transfusion-related complications and indications for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, in critically ill children. Although allogeneic blood has become increasingly safer from infectious agents, mounting evidence indicates that RBC transfusions are associated with complications and unfavorable outcomes. As a result, there has been growing interest and efforts to limit RBC transfusion, and indications are being revisited and revamped. Although a so-called restrictive RBC transfusion strategy has been shown to improve morbidity and mortality in critically ill adults, there have been relatively few studies on RBC transfusion performed in critically ill children.

- **Data sources**: Published literature on transfusion medicine and outcomes of RBC transfusion. After a brief overview of the physiology of oxygen transportation, anemia compensation, and transfusion guidelines based on available literature, risks and outcomes of transfusion in general and in critically ill children are summarized in conjunction with studies investigating the safety of restrictive transfusion strategies in this patient population.

- **Conclusions**: The available evidence does not support the extensive use of RBC transfusions in general or critically ill patients. Transfusions are still associated with risks, and although their benefits are established in limited situations, the associated negative outcomes in many more patients must be closely addressed.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: Expert review [^115DLfwi]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

In this Clinical Practice Update (CPU), we provide Best Practice Advice (BPA) guidance on the appropriate management of iron deficiency anemia.

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to deliver timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. The document underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through the standard procedures of Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. These BPA statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Since systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations.

- **Best practice advice 1**: No single formulation of oral iron has any advantages over any other. Ferrous sulfate is preferred as the least expensive iron formulation.

- **Best practice advice 2**: Give oral iron once a day at most. Every-other-day iron dosing may be better tolerated for some patients with similar or equal rates of iron absorption as daily dosing.

- **Best practice advice 3**: Add vitamin C to oral iron supplementation to improve absorption.

- **Best practice advice 4**: Intravenous iron should be used if the patient does not tolerate oral iron, ferritin levels do not improve with a trial of oral iron, or the patient has a condition in which oral iron is not likely to be absorbed.

- **Best practice advice 5**: Intravenous iron formulations that can replace iron deficiency.

### Alternative blood transfusion triggers: a narrative review [^116NRyyK]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Low credibility.

A strong association between decreased hemoglobin values and adverse events and mortality has been established even before a critical level of oxygen delivery is reached. Mortality rises sharply as hemoglobin decreases below 5–6 g/dl, while oxygen consumption may become dependent on delivery at even lower hemoglobin levels. In clinical practice, anemia treatment is usually initiated well above this critical threshold, as anemia-induced organ injury due to a reduction of organ-specific tissue oxygenation might be a more relevant mechanism for unfavorable outcomes.

The relationship between the delivery and consumption of oxygen is complex. There is an increase in the level of lactate and a further increase in oxygen extraction with a decrease in the saturation of hemoglobin in venous blood when reaching the critical oxygen delivery [DO₂ - oxygen delivery, VO₂ - oxygen consumption, SvO₂ - saturation of hemoglobin in mixed/central venous blood, OER - oxygen extraction ratio, DO₂crit - critical level of oxygen delivery].

- **Blood transfusion triggers**: The main purpose of blood transfusion is to increase the oxygen-binding capacity of the blood and, consequently, oxygen delivery to organs and tissues. From a physiological perspective, the isolated hemoglobin level does not always reflect adequate oxygen delivery, which has led to the search for alternative blood transfusion triggers.

- **Modern requirements for an "ideal trigger"*: The search for an ideal blood transfusion trigger continues as the medical community seeks better ways to gauge and ensure adequate oxygen delivery.

Patient blood management is the timely application of evidence-based medical and surgical concepts designed to maintain hemoglobin concentration, optimize hemostasis, and minimize blood loss to improve patient outcomes. Conceptually similar to a "bundle" strategy, it is designed to improve clinical care using comprehensive evidence-based treatment strategies to manage patients with potential or ongoing critical bleeding, bleeding diathesis, critical anemia, and/or a coagulopathy.

Patient blood management includes multimodal strategies to screen, diagnose, and properly treat anemia and coagulopathies and to minimize bleeding using goal-directed therapy. It leverages a patient's physiologic ability to adapt to anemia while definitive treatment is undertaken. Allogeneic blood component transfusion is one traditional therapeutic modality among many for managing blood loss and anemia. While it may be the best choice in certain situations, other effective and more appropriate options are available and should be used in conjunction or alone.

Therefore, comprehensive patient blood management is the new standard of care to prevent and manage anemia and optimize hemostasis. It has been recommended by the World Health Organization, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the European Society of Anaesthesiology, and the Australian National Blood Authority. While there is a plethora of expert consensus and good practice guidelines published for blood component transfusion from multiple professional organizations and societies, there remains a need for more comprehensive and broader strategies.

### Summary of the KDIGO guideline on anemia and comment: reading between the (guide)line(s) [^112K6LAb]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is designed to assist health-care providers in treating CKD patients with anemia. A guideline is not intended to define a standard of care and should not be construed as one, nor should it be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management. It is intended to provide information and to allow the practitioner to make an informed decision based on evidence and expert judgment. Every health-care professional making use of these recommendations is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of applying them in any particular clinical situation.

Owing to the general nature of a guideline, it is sometimes difficult to translate it to an individual patient's condition. As the primary goal is to improve patient care, we have decided to focus on practical clinical aspects of the KDIGO anemia guideline.

### Role of red blood cells in clinically relevant bleeding tendencies and complications [^115HM89X]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). High credibility.

The multiple roles of red blood cells (RBCs) are often neglected as contributors in hemostasis and thrombosis. Proactive opportunities to increase RBC numbers, either acutely or subacutely in the case of iron deficiency, are critical as RBCs are the cellular elements that initiate hemostasis together with platelets and stabilize fibrin and clot structure. RBCs also possess several functional properties to assist hemostasis: releasing platelet agonists, promoting shear force-induced von Willebrand factor unfolding, procoagulant capacity, and binding to fibrin. Additionally, blood clot contraction is important to compress RBCs to form a tightly packed array of polyhedrocytes, making an impermeable seal for hemostasis.

All these functions are important for patients having an intrinsically poor capacity to cease bleeds (i.e. hemostatic disorders), but, conversely, can also play a role in thrombosis if these RBC-mediated reactions overshoot. One acquired example of bleeding with anemia is in patients treated with anticoagulants and/or antithrombotic medication because upon initiation of these drugs, baseline anemia doubles the risk of bleeding complications and mortality. Moreover, anemia is a risk factor for reoccurring gastrointestinal and urogenital bleeds, pregnancy, and delivery complications.

This review summarizes the clinically relevant properties and profiles of RBCs at various steps of platelet adhesion, aggregation, thrombin generation, and fibrin formation, including both structural and functional elements. Regarding patient blood management guidelines, they support minimizing…

### A global definition of patient blood management [^116oCUnG]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Low credibility.

While patient blood management (PBM) initiatives are increasingly adopted across the globe as part of standard care, there is a need for a clear and widely accepted definition of PBM. To address this, an expert group representing PBM organizations from the International Foundation for Patient Blood Management (IFPBM), the Network for the Advancement of Patient Blood Management, Haemostasis and Thrombosis (NATA), the Society for the Advancement of Patient Blood Management (SABM), the Western Australia Patient Blood Management (WAPBM) Group, and OnTrac (Ontario Nurse Transfusion Coordinators) convened and developed this definition: "Patient blood management is a patient-centered, systematic, evidence-based approach to improve patient outcomes by managing and preserving a patient's own blood, while promoting patient safety and empowerment". The definition emphasizes the critical role of informed choice.

PBM involves the timely, multidisciplinary application of evidence-based medical and surgical concepts aimed at:

1. Screening for, diagnosing, and appropriately treating anemia.
2. Minimizing surgical, procedural, and iatrogenic blood losses and managing coagulopathic bleeding throughout the care.
3. Supporting the patient while appropriate treatment is initiated.

We believe that having a common definition for PBM will assist all those involved, including PBM organizations, hospital administrators, individual clinicians, and policy makers, to focus on the appropriate issues when discussing and implementing PBM. The proposed definition is expected to continue to evolve.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^114QSS9c]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline 3.5 - Treatment of anaemia - initial ESA dose

We recommend that the initial ESA dose should be determined by the patient's Hb level, the target Hb level, the observed rate of increase in Hb level, and clinical circumstances.

- **Rationale**: For initiation of ESA therapy, several points are to be considered:
	- Type(s) of licensed ESAs available
	- Initial ESA dose
	- **ESA dose adjustment**: dose required for Hb correction vs. maintenance
	- Route of ESA administration
	- Frequency of ESA administration that best fits patient requirements and achieves maximal convenience
	- Patient monitoring for the anticipated response in terms of Hb rise, rate of Hb rise, possible adverse effects (e.g. hypertension)

In general, the aim of initial ESA therapy is to achieve a rate of increase in Hb levels of 10 to 20 g/L per month. This rate of rise is considered safe as evidenced from interventional trials on ESA naïve patients. In CKD patients with initial Hb levels less than the target range, these trials have shown the mean initial rate of Hb level increase to be in the range of 7 to 25 g/L in the first 4 weeks. This rate of Hb increase is affected by the patient population, iron status, initial ESA dose, and the frequency and route of ESA administration.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to patients undergoing surgery, the ESAIC 2023 guidelines recommend administering iron supplementation at weight-based dosing for the treatment of IDA. They prefer intravenous iron over oral iron.

---

### Anemia, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease [^1152Ey6V]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The management of anemia starts with the evaluation of its underlying cause. If absolute iron deficiency is detected, patients should be treated with either oral or intravenous iron therapy. Various oral iron preparations are available, including ferrous gluconate, fumarate, and sulfate. These can be administered in doses of 300–325 mg three times daily, which can significantly increase hemoglobin (Hb) levels. However, significant gastrointestinal side effects may lead to poor adherence and compliance with oral iron. As an alternative, intravenous iron can be given periodically.

Several studies have shown that intravenous iron preparations are both effective and safe in patients not on dialysis. In a study by Dahdah et al, intravenous iron dextran was administered to anemic, iron-deficient patients (with serum ferritin < 100 ng/ml or transferrin saturation < 20%) and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 50 ml/min. The dosages were 200 mg weekly for five weeks or 500 mg weekly for two weeks, resulting in significant increases in Hb within two weeks. All patients tolerated the infusions without serious adverse reactions. Available intravenous iron preparations include ferric sodium gluconate, iron sucrose, and iron dextran. Among these, iron dextran has the highest incidence of adverse reactions, though the actual incidence is low across all three preparations. Some studies suggest that intravenous iron is generally more efficacious than oral iron in increasing Hb levels in patients.

### Transfusion strategy [^111iu7p9]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2001). Low credibility.

As is often the case in medicine, the risk-to-benefit ratio of blood transfusion requires careful examination. The decision to transfuse a patient cannot be based solely on haemoglobin or haematocrit concentration. In a given clinical situation, tolerance to anaemia will depend on the patient's ability to recruit compensatory mechanisms in accordance with their metabolic demand. Maintenance of circulating volume is of paramount importance. In the absence of a universal transfusion trigger, the decision to transfuse a patient with a haemoglobin concentration between 7.0 and 10.0 g dL-1 depends primarily on clinical judgement. With the exception of emergency situations, blood transfusion should be conducted on a unit-by-unit basis, and the efficacy of treatment should be evaluated after each transfused unit.

### Transfusion thresholds for guiding red blood cell transfusion [^1174U4w4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

The optimal haemoglobin threshold for the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients remains an active field of research. Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe due to inadequate testing for viral pathogens. If a liberal transfusion policy does not improve clinical outcomes or proves equivalent, then adopting a more restrictive approach could be recognized as the standard of care.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this review update was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes for participants randomized to restrictive versus liberal RBC transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all clinical conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin concentration as a trigger for transfusion (most commonly, 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL), while the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin concentration as a trigger (most commonly, 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL).

- **Search methods**: We identified trials through updated searches in several databases: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1946 to November 2020), Embase (1974 to November 2020), Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to November 2020), Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to November 2020), and trial registries (November 2020). We checked the reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify additional trials. We were aware of one trial identified in earlier searches that was in the process of publication (in February 2021), and we were able to include it.

### Alternative blood transfusion triggers: A narrative review [^113cs2ER]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Low credibility.

Anemia is a clinical hematological syndrome characterized by low levels of hemoglobin and, in most cases, red blood cells (RBCs). The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies anemia as a global public health problem. Based on prevalence data from 1993–2005, an estimated 24.8% of the global population was affected by this pathology. Anemia is notably prevalent among children, and both pregnant and non-pregnant women. By 2010, the global anemia prevalence had risen to 32.9%, affecting more than 2.2 billion people. The most common cause of anemia was iron deficiency. Therefore, anemia is considered the most common hematological syndrome in clinical practice.

According to WHO classification, anemia is defined as a hemoglobin concentration below 129 g/l in men and 119 g/l in women at sea level.

### Identification and management of preoperative anaemia in adults: A British Society for Haematology guideline update [^115Gjpto]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for red blood cell transfusion, specifically in relation to the correction of preoperative anaemia and the assessment and timing of surgery, the BSH 2024 guidelines recommend considering the referral of patients with unexplained anaemia without iron deficiency. This consideration should be based on the severity of anaemia, defined as hemoglobin levels below 120 g/L for males and below 100 g/L for females, or according to locally agreed criteria. It is important to recognize that the risk of a serious cause or haemoglobinopathy is proportional to the severity of anaemia.

### Preoperative anemia-screening clinics [^115qzz8p]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Low credibility.

Preoperative anemia is associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality, as well as an increased risk of perioperative transfusion. It is an important and modifiable risk factor for surgical patients. For high-blood-loss surgery, preoperative anemia is defined as hemoglobin less than 13 g/dL for both male and female patients. Preoperative anemia is common, appearing in 25% to 40% of patients in large observational studies.

The most common treatable cause of preoperative anemia is iron-deficiency anemia. Initial laboratory tests should focus on diagnosing this condition. Management involves iron supplementation, with intravenous (IV) iron therapy indicated when oral iron is ineffective or not tolerated, when there is severe anemia, or if the time before surgery is less than four weeks. In other situations, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents may be considered, particularly for patients with multiple alloantibodies or religious objections to transfusion.

To facilitate the diagnosis and management of preoperative anemia, establishing preoperative anemia-screening clinics is essential. The goals of managing preoperative anemia are to treat the condition, reduce the need for transfusion, and improve patient outcomes.

### Perioperative patient blood management to improve outcomes [^112KHCko]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is common in elective surgery and is an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Historically, management of anemia has focused on the use of allogeneic blood transfusion, but this in itself is not without risk; it has been independently associated with morbidity and mortality, in addition to the costs and relative shortage of this resource. In recognition of this, patient blood management (PBM) shifts the focus from the product to the patient and views the patient's own blood as a resource that should be conserved and managed appropriately as a standard of care.

- **Three pillars of PBM**: PBM consists of three pillars: the optimization of red blood cell mass, reduction of blood loss and bleeding, and optimization of the patient's physiological tolerance toward anemia. Integration of these three pillars in the form of multimodal care bundles and strategies into perioperative pathways should improve care processes and patient outcomes.

- **Preoperative anemia management**: Preoperative anemia is most commonly caused by functional iron deficiency and should be treated with oral iron, intravenous iron, and/or recombinant erythropoietin.

- **Assessment of thrombotic risk**: An individualized assessment of the thrombotic risk of discontinuing anticoagulant and antiplatelet medication should be balanced against the risk of perioperative bleeding. Neuraxial anesthetic techniques should be considered, and minimally invasive surgery should be undertaken where appropriate.

- **Blood loss management**: Cell salvage should be used if significant blood loss is anticipated, and pharmacological treatments such as tranexamic acid and fibrin sealants have been shown to reduce blood loss.

- **Use of point-of-care tests**: Point-of-care tests can guide the perioperative process.

### Physiopathology of anemia and transfusion thresholds in isolated head injury [^115vY66R]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Blood transfusion strategies among patients with critical illness use a restrictive hemoglobin threshold. However, among patients with head injury, no outcome differences have been shown between either liberal or restrictive strategies. Several studies and literature reviews suggest that anemia is associated with markers of tissue ischemia. The paucity of prospective data confuses the association between surrogates of tissue ischemia and neurological outcome.

- **Methods**: A narrative review of transfusion practices among patients in the acute phase of head injury was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases. A total of 104 articles were reviewed.

- **Results**: There are few data to guide clinical practice. Clinicians use blood hemoglobin concentrations to trigger transfusion. Markers of potential cerebral injury are not in regular use despite experimental and observational data arising from histologic examination, microdialysis, oximetry, and flow-based multimonitoring systems recommending their use to titrate blood transfusion in neurotrauma.

The generalization of transfusion triggers is common practice. Evidence-based approaches to transfusion strategies in head injury are lacking and not based on an understanding of cerebral physiopathology.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: Update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^112sp2gt]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, specifically with respect to the initial evaluation, the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining the following tests in the laboratory evaluation of patients with anemia associated with CKD:

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: This should include MCH, MCV, platelet count, and hemoglobin concentration.
- **Absolute reticulocyte count**: Useful to assess bone marrow responsiveness, if indicated.
- **Assessment of iron status**: This could involve measuring the percentage of hypochromic RBCs (only if the processing of the blood sample is possible within 6 hours), reticulocyte hemoglobin count, or equivalent tests such as reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent. As an alternative, a combination of transferrin saturation and serum ferritin is recommended if the previous tests are unavailable, or if the patient has thalassemia or thalassemia trait.
- **Serum ferritin**: To assess iron stores.
- **Serum CRP**: To assess possible inflammation.

Blood product transfusions are an essential component of the practice of emergency medicine. From acute traumatic hemorrhage to chronic blood loss necessitating transfusion for symptomatic anemia, familiarity with individual blood products and their indications for transfusion is an essential tool for every emergency physician (EP). Although the focus of this article is primarily on the transfusion of red blood cells, many of the concepts are applicable to the transfusion of all blood products. EPs must be fully familiar with both the individual blood components and the potential reactions and complications of these transfusions.

### Alternative blood transfusion triggers: A narrative review [^117QMqDo]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Low credibility.

Anemia, characterized by low hemoglobin levels, is a global public health concern and an independent factor that worsens outcomes in various patient groups. Blood transfusion has been the traditional treatment for anemia, with its triggers primarily based on hemoglobin levels; however, hemoglobin level is not always an ideal trigger for blood transfusion. Additionally, blood transfusion worsens clinical outcomes in certain patient groups. This narrative review explores alternative triggers for red blood cell transfusion and their physiological basis.

The review delves into the physiology of oxygen transport and highlights the limitations of using hemoglobin levels alone as a transfusion trigger. The main aim of blood transfusion is to optimize oxygen delivery, necessitating an individualized approach based on clinical signs of anemia and the balance between oxygen delivery and consumption, reflected by the oxygen extraction rate. The narrative review covers different alternative triggers and presents insights into their diagnostic value and clinical applications, emphasizing the need for personalized transfusion strategies.

Anemia and blood transfusion are significant factors affecting patient outcomes. While restrictive transfusion strategies are widely recommended, they may not account for the nuances of specific patient populations. The search for alternative transfusion triggers is essential to tailor transfusion therapy effectively, especially in patients with comorbidities or unique clinical profiles.

### Transfusion of blood and blood products: Indications and complications [^117N2vKK]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Red blood cell transfusions are used to treat hemorrhage and to improve oxygen delivery to tissues. Transfusion of red blood cells should be based on the patient's clinical condition. Indications for transfusion include symptomatic anemia, which causes shortness of breath, dizziness, congestive heart failure, and decreased exercise tolerance; acute sickle cell crisis; and acute blood loss of more than 30 percent of blood volume. Fresh frozen plasma infusion can be used for the reversal of anticoagulant effects. Platelet transfusion is indicated to prevent hemorrhage in patients with thrombocytopenia or platelet function defects. Cryoprecipitate is used in cases of hypofibrinogenemia, which most often occurs in the setting of massive hemorrhage or consumptive coagulopathy. Transfusion-related infections are less common than noninfectious complications. All noninfectious complications of transfusion are classified as noninfectious serious hazards of transfusion. Acute complications occur within minutes to 24 hours of the transfusion, whereas delayed complications may develop days, months, or even years later.

### Transfusion thresholds and other strategies for guiding allogeneic red blood cell transfusion [^115ypWsB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

There is considerable uncertainty regarding the optimal haemoglobin threshold for the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients. Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than others due to a lack of testing for viral pathogens. Therefore, reducing the number and volume of transfusions would benefit patients.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this review was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes in participants randomized to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin level to trigger transfusion (most commonly 7 g/dL or 8 g/dL), whereas the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin level (most commonly 9 g/dL to 10 g/dL).

- **Search methods**: We identified trials by searching CENTRAL (2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1946 to May 2016), Embase (1974 to May 2016), the Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to May 2016), the Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to May 2016), and ongoing trial registries (27 May 2016). We also checked reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify any additional trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized trials where intervention groups were assigned based on a clear transfusion 'trigger', described as a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) level below which a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion was to be administered.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We pooled risk ratios from the trials for analysis.

### Kidney disease: Improving global outcomes guidelines on anaemia management in chronic kidney disease: A European renal best practice position statement [^116GXUQA]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Recently, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) group has produced comprehensive clinical practice guidelines for the management of anaemia in CKD patients. These guidelines addressed all of the important points related to anaemia management in CKD patients, including therapy with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA), iron therapy, ESA resistance, and blood transfusion use.

Because most guidelines were 'soft' rather than 'strong', and because global guidelines need to be adapted and implemented into the regional context where they are used, on behalf of the European Renal Best Practice Advisory Board, some of its members and other external experts in this field, who were not participants in the KDIGO guidelines group, were invited to participate in this anaemia working group to examine and comment on the KDIGO documents in this position paper.

In this article, the group concentrated only on those guidelines which we considered worth amending or adapting. All guidelines not specifically mentioned are fully endorsed.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^112H74YU]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Red blood cell transfusion: transfusion thresholds for whom and when?

Allogeneic red cell transfusion is associated with a significant increase in peri‐operative morbidity and mortality. In addition, there is a worldwide shortage of blood, with substantial associated costs to both the manufacturer and health systems. Moreover, red cell transfusion poses risks such as infectious, immunological, haemolytic, non‐haemolytic adverse reactions, and cardiac and pulmonary complications. Despite the successful implementation of Patient Blood Management (PBM) programs, red cell transfusion remains a default treatment for most patients with acute postoperative anaemia.

Historically, the standard for red cell transfusion was a liberal transfusion threshold, specifically a haemoglobin level of less than 100 g/l (or haematocrit < 30%). This arbitrary transfusion threshold has been gradually lowered towards a haemoglobin level of 70–80 g/l, according to several Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) that evaluate the impact of restrictive versus more liberal red cell transfusion strategies across various clinical settings. When pooled in several systematic reviews and meta‐analyses, data from these RCTs show that, concerning morbidity and mortality, a restrictive red cell transfusion strategy is either equivalent to or more beneficial than a liberal strategy.

In addition, evidence‐based guidelines have translated the results of these RCTs and meta‐analyses into clinical practice.

### Transfusion in the intensive care unit [^11121faR]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The incidences of anemia and blood transfusions in critically ill patients are summarized to assess their comparative risks and benefits. The study briefly speculates on the potential effects of leukoreduction and blood storage concerning the need to reevaluate transfusion triggers.

A review of the literature was performed, highlighting that anemia is common among intensive care unit patients and is associated with increased mortality. Approximately 20–53% of these patients receive a blood transfusion during their stay, and these transfusions have also been linked to worse outcomes. Leukoreduction may mitigate some infectious and immunomodulatory risks associated with blood transfusions.

Data on the risks and benefits of blood transfusion are conflicting. With recent changes in blood transfusion practices, including the widespread introduction of leukoreduction, it is time to reevaluate transfusion triggers.

### Alternative blood transfusion triggers: A narrative review [^1141TgDu]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Low credibility.

The main aim of blood transfusion administration is the optimization of oxygen delivery rather than targeting a specific hemoglobin level. Consequently, many authors and guidelines suggest an individualized approach to blood transfusions based not only on the hemoglobin level — which often does not clearly reflect the need for oxygen delivery — but also on clinical signs of anemia and the balance between oxygen delivery and consumption.

One of the indications for blood transfusion may also be its physiological effect of increasing intravascular volume and consequently increasing blood pressure. Thus, sustained perioperative hypotension and increased vasopressor support might represent triggers for more liberal administration of blood components. The concept of physiological triggers for blood transfusion is based on correcting anemia in terms of the oxygen delivery/consumption ratio.

The aim of our narrative review is to summarize the role of alternative triggers for RBC transfusion, such as the oxygen extraction ratio, blood lactate level, central venous/mixed venous oxygen saturation, oxygen content arterial-venous difference, and ischemic signs on the electrocardiogram. We provide insights into the physiology of oxygen transport and emphasize the importance of oxygen delivery optimization regarding decision-making in transfusion therapy. Furthermore, we give an overview of studies that explore alternative triggers and their limitations in clinical practice and blood transfusion guidelines.

### Patient blood management to reduce surgical risk [^114xtiqX]. The British Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Preoperative anaemia and perioperative blood transfusion are both identifiable and preventable surgical risks. Patient blood management is a multimodal approach to address this issue. It focuses on three pillars of care: the detection and treatment of preoperative anaemia; the reduction of perioperative blood loss; and harnessing and optimizing the patient-specific physiological reserve of anaemia, including restrictive haemoglobin transfusion triggers. This article reviews why patient blood management is needed and strategies for its incorporation into surgical pathways.

- **Methods**: Studies investigating the three pillars of patient blood management were identified using PubMed, focusing on recent evidence-based guidance for perioperative management.

- **Results**: Anaemia is common in surgical practice. Both anaemia and blood transfusion are independently associated with adverse outcomes. Functional iron deficiency (iron restriction due to increased levels of hepcidin) is the most common cause of preoperative anaemia and should be treated with intravenous iron. Intraoperative blood loss can be reduced with antifibrinolytic drugs such as tranexamic acid, and cell salvage should be used. A restrictive transfusion practice should be the standard of care after surgery.

- **Conclusion**: The significance of preoperative anaemia appears underappreciated, and its detection should lead to routine investigation and treatment before elective surgery. The risks of unnecessary blood transfusion are increasingly being recognized.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^116BGimw]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Despite numerous guidelines on the management of anaemia in surgical patients, there is no pragmatic guidance for the diagnosis and management of anaemia and iron deficiency in the postoperative period. A number of experienced researchers and clinicians took part in a two-day expert workshop and developed the following consensus statement. After the presentation of our own research data and local policies and procedures, appropriate relevant literature was reviewed and discussed. We developed a series of best-practice and evidence-based statements to advise on patient care with respect to anaemia and iron deficiency in the postoperative period.

- **Diagnostic approach**: A diagnostic approach to iron deficiency and anaemia in surgical patients was established.
- **Identification of patients**: Identification of patients appropriate for treatment was addressed.
- **Practical management and follow-up**: Practical management and follow-up advice that is easy to implement was provided.

Available data allow the fulfilment of the requirements of Pillar 1 of Patient Blood Management. We urge national and international research funding bodies to take note of these recommendations, particularly in terms of funding large-scale prospective, randomised clinical trials that can most effectively address the important clinical questions and this clearly unmet medical need.

### Intra-operative red blood cell transfusion and mortality after cardiac surgery [^111qnBUx]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Low credibility.

Blood loss reduces the oxygen delivery capacity due to hypovolemia and anemia. Healthy patients can compensate with increased tissue oxygenation through a physiological increase in cardiac output and enhanced oxygen extraction from erythrocytes. However, in patients with coronary disease, these compensatory mechanisms are limited, and without treatment, anemia may lead to myocardial ischemia and subsequent myocardial infarction. Anemia in cardiac surgery patients is common and has been associated with poor outcomes.

During surgery, ongoing blood loss and hemodilution, due to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), cause low hemoglobin (Hb) levels. Transfusion of red blood cells (RBC) is the standard practice for perioperative anemia, but it is not without risks. Historical cohort studies evaluating the influence of RBC transfusion in patients with perioperative anemia have reported an increased risk for adverse events, including mortality. Additionally, the optimal transfusion trigger in cardiac surgery patients remains largely unknown. Particularly during surgery, patients may temporarily tolerate lower Hb levels as metabolism is low and oxygen needs are reduced due to hypothermia and anesthesia.

Further insight into the risk of intra-operative RBC transfusion to treat anemia may aid cardiac anesthetists in improving patient blood management. This study aimed to investigate the association between intraoperative RBC transfusion and mortality in patients undergoing coronary surgery.

### Managing anemia in the cancer patient: Old problems, future solutions [^115F1WNT]. The Oncologist (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia and associated symptoms commonly manifest in cancer patients and may have a considerable impact on outcomes. Preliminary studies suggest that overall survival and locoregional control following radiation therapy may be compromised by anemia, and recent preliminary data also suggest that anemia may be related to poorer outcomes following chemotherapy. Health-related quality of life for cancer patients is also significantly reduced by anemia. Treatment of anemia with recombinant human erythropoietin can improve these health-related quality-of-life outcomes. However, despite this knowledge, anemia remains under-recognized and under-treated in the cancer patient population.

A number of issues may be determinants of this suboptimal management of anemia. These include limitations of therapies for anemia, varying practice strategies, and the lack of guidelines on how to treat anemia. Additionally, clinicians may underestimate the importance of health-related quality of life for their patients. It is vital that these issues are addressed, which, together with the development of novel erythropoietic agents, a review of the guidelines for anemia management, and consideration of further outcomes such as survival and cognitive function, may help to ensure that the cancer patient receives the best possible course of supportive care.

### Eras cardiac society turnkey order set for patient blood management: Proceedings from the AATS ERAS Conclave 2023 [^116hGhgC]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2024). High credibility.

There are multiple published guidelines on comprehensive patient blood management (PBM), centered on the three pillars of PBM: managing preoperative anemia, minimizing blood loss, and tolerating intraoperative/postoperative anemia. We sought to create an order set to facilitate widespread implementation of evidence-based PBM for cardiac surgery patients.

- **Methods**: Subject matter experts were consulted to translate existing guidelines and literature into a sample turnkey order set (TKO) for PBM. Orders derived from consistent class I, class IIA, or equivalent recommendations across referenced guidelines and consensus manuscripts appear in the TKO in bold type. Selected orders that were inconsistently class I or IIA, class IIB, or supported by published evidence are presented in italic type.

- **Results**: Preoperatively, there are strong recommendations to screen and treat preoperative anemia with iron replacement and erythropoietin and to discontinue dual antiplatelet therapy if the patient can safely wait for surgery. Intraoperative orders outline the routine use of an antifibrinolytic agent, cell saver, point of care viscoelastic testing, and use of a standard transfusion algorithm. The order set also reflects strong recommendations intraoperatively and postoperatively for agreed-upon hemoglobin thresholds to consider transfusion of packed red blood cells. A hemoglobin threshold should be adopted according to local team consensus and should trigger a discussion regarding transfusion.

The benefit of a multidisciplinary PBM care pathway in cardiac surgery has…

### Management of iron deficiency [^1177mVnZ]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) affects billions of people worldwide and remains the leading cause of anemia with significant negative impacts on health. Our approach to ID and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) involves three steps (I3):

- **Identification of ID/IDA**: This represents the first step in managing the condition.

- **Investigation and management of the underlying etiology of ID**: This is crucial to address the root causes of ID.

- **Iron repletion**: This can be achieved through oral and intravenous (IV) iron formulations. Oral iron remains a therapeutic option for the treatment of ID in stable patients, but there are many populations for whom IV iron is more effective. IV iron should be considered when there are no contraindications, when poor response to oral iron is anticipated, when rapid hematologic responses are desired, and/or when there is availability of and accessibility to the product.

Judicious use of red cell blood transfusion is recommended and should be considered only for severe, symptomatic IDA with hemodynamic instability. Identification and management of ID and IDA is a central pillar in patient blood management.

### What is really dangerous: Anaemia or transfusion [^116Qxyrx]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

While complex physiological mechanisms exist to regulate and optimize tissue oxygenation under various conditions, clinical and experimental evidence indicates that anaemia, if unchecked, is associated with organ injury and unfavorable outcomes. More data, especially from human studies, are needed to answer questions regarding the optimal approaches to the treatment of acute and chronic anaemia. In the meantime, allogeneic blood transfusions remain the most common treatment, particularly in surgical or trauma patients and those with moderate-to-severe anaemia.

Clinical studies emphasize the paradox that both anaemia and transfusion are associated with organ injury and increased morbidity and mortality across a wide span of disease states and surgical interventions. Further characterization of the mechanisms of injury is needed to appropriately balance these risks and to develop novel treatment strategies that will improve patient outcomes.

- **Understanding of the physiological mechanisms**: The physiological mechanisms of tissue oxygen delivery, utilization, adaptation, and survival in the face of anaemia need further exploration.

- **Evidence on the impact of anaemia and transfusion**: Both anaemia and transfusion often have an independent and synergistic deleterious impact on patient outcomes.

The risks of anaemia and transfusion, in light of substantial variations in transfusion practices, increasing costs, shrinking pool of donated resources, and ambiguity about the actual clinical benefits of banked allogeneic blood, demand better management strategies targeted at improving patient outcomes.

### Role of red blood cells in clinically relevant bleeding tendencies and complications [^114Eakpo]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). High credibility.

In acute settings, the patient blood management program focuses on the avoidance of unnecessary blood transfusions. The highest RBC transfusion targets have been advocated for patients having cardiovascular disease, especially in acute forms, ischemia, and massive bleeds. The program wisely urges the prevention of anemia, but if prevention has not occurred, transfusions provide an acute solution. These acute blood transfusion guidelines lack specific guidance on inherited bleeding disorders, which carry a permanent risk for bleeds at low factor levels. Therein, the conservative RBC transfusion limits do not necessarily apply, and the correction of coagulation factor levels alone is not sufficient, as hemostasis relies on the synergistic actions of several mechanisms.

To sum up, in clinics, whatever the nature of the bleeding disorder, early primary hemostasis impairment by reduced RBC numbers and the presence of anemia are to be avoided if possible. The cause of anemia needs to be clarified and managed accordingly, with iron deficiency most often being the hematological background. The active evaluation of RBCs and implementation of specific laboratory diagnoses for anemia should be considered a priority rather than an afterthought in the follow-up of patients with hemostasis and thrombosis issues. To close the circle, this review continues to further discuss what clinicians can learn from basic science and some of the latest observations that can be translated into patient management whenever possible.

### International consensus statement on the peri-operative management of anaemia and iron deficiency [^115gJnkj]. Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Despite recommendations on the management of pre-operative anaemia, there is no pragmatic guidance for the diagnosis and management of anaemia and iron deficiency in surgical patients. A number of experienced researchers and clinicians took part in an expert workshop and developed the following consensus statement. After presentation of our own research data and local policies and procedures, appropriate relevant literature was reviewed and discussed. We developed a series of best-practice and evidence-based statements to advise on patient care with respect to anaemia and iron deficiency in the peri-operative period.

- **Diagnostic approach**: This includes diagnosing anaemia and iron deficiency in surgical patients.
- **Identification of patients**: Recognizing patients appropriate for treatment.
- **Practical management and follow-up**: Offering advice on the management and monitoring of patients.

We urge anaesthetists and peri-operative physicians to embrace these recommendations. Additionally, hospital administrators are encouraged to facilitate the implementation of these concepts by allocating adequate resources.

### Role of red blood cells in clinically relevant bleeding tendencies and complications [^11122GS8]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). High credibility.

The multiple roles of red blood cells (RBCs) are often neglected as contributors in hemostasis and thrombosis. Proactive opportunities to increase RBC numbers, either acutely or subacutely in the case of iron deficiency, are critical as RBCs are the cellular elements that initiate hemostasis together with platelets and stabilize fibrin and clot structure. RBCs also possess several functional properties to assist hemostasis: releasing platelet agonists, promoting shear force-induced von Willebrand factor unfolding, procoagulant capacity, and binding to fibrin. Additionally, blood clot contraction is important to compress RBCs to form a tightly packed array of polyhedrocytes, making an impermeable seal for hemostasis.

All these functions are important for patients having intrinsically poor capacity to cease bleeds (i.e. hemostatic disorders) but, conversely, can also play a role in thrombosis if these RBC-mediated reactions overshoot. One acquired example of bleeding with anemia is in patients treated with anticoagulants and/or antithrombotic medication because upon initiation of these drugs, baseline anemia doubles the risk of bleeding complications and mortality. Anemia is also a risk factor for reoccurring gastrointestinal and urogenital bleeds, pregnancy, and delivery complications.

This review summarizes the clinically relevant properties and profiles of RBCs at various steps of platelet adhesion, aggregation, thrombin generation, and fibrin formation, including both structural and functional elements. Regarding patient blood management guidelines, they support minimizing unnecessary transfusions and optimizing anemia management to mitigate bleeding risks.
