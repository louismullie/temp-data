## Question

infected pimple treatments

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage an "infected pimple", essentially a skin and soft tissue infection centered on a folliculitis or small abscess, with attention to diagnosis, severity, source control, antibiotics, and follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes an "infected pimple" and how to classify it within SSTI taxonomy. Then, I should verify severity and indications for incision and drainage versus antibiotics alone. Next, I will review empiric antibiotic choices by scenario, including MRSA risk, and confirm durations. After that, I need to check special populations and contraindications. Finally, I will outline follow-up, recurrence prevention, and when to escalate care, ensuring each step aligns with guideline strength and evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and classification. An "infected pimple" most commonly reflects a localized purulent SSTI such as a furuncle or small abscess arising from folliculitis, with typical pathogens being Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) and beta-hemolytic streptococci; distinguishing features include fluctuance, pain, erythema, and sometimes purulent drainage, and classification should follow IDSA SSTI categories to guide management decisions [^115sNUpw] [^114pSATx].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics. I need to check severity and the primacy of source control. For small, uncomplicated furuncles or abscesses under about 5 cm without systemic signs, incision and drainage (I&D) is the primary therapy and systemic antibiotics are usually unnecessary. Larger lesions, carbuncles, or those with systemic features warrant I&D plus antibiotics, and recurrent abscesses should be drained and cultured early in the course [^115aUj6s] [^116CGGQm] [^1146M1nq].

> Wait, let me verify the role of antibiotics after I&D in uncomplicated cases. Contemporary guidance suggests that adding TMP-SMX or clindamycin to I&D can modestly improve short-term outcomes in some settings, but shared decision-making is appropriate because benefits are modest and resistance risks exist; thus, I should present both options and tailor to patient preference, lesion size, and local epidemiology [^111VtADd].

> I will now examine empiric antibiotic choices when antibiotics are indicated. For mild nonpurulent cellulitis or spreading erythema without abscess, an agent active against streptococci is recommended, with many clinicians also covering MSSA; for purulent infections or MRSA risk factors (prior MRSA, penetrating trauma, injection drug use, SIRS), vancomycin or another MRSA-active agent is recommended; typical durations are 5 days, extending if not improved, with MRSA-active oral options including TMP-SMX, clindamycin, or doxycycline where appropriate [^114pSATx] [^115p3xNL] [^117HEqj8].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said doxycycline is FDA-approved for skin infections broadly. I should double-check the labeled indications. Oracea (doxycycline) is indicated only for inflammatory papules and pustules of rosacea and explicitly should not be used for treatment or prevention of infections, so I should not imply an infection indication; however, doxycycline remains a reasonable MRSA-active oral option for SSTI in guidelines when clinically indicated off-label, with counseling on risks and alternatives [^115rSLsb] [^117HEqj8].

> Let me consider special populations and contraindications. In pregnancy, tetracyclines are contraindicated due to fetal risks. In children under 8 years, tetracyclines should be avoided because of tooth staining. In patients with significant renal impairment, dose adjustments and agent selection should be individualized. And in immunocompromised hosts, lower thresholds for I&D, broader empiric coverage, and closer follow-up are warranted [^114bcKRS] [^115rSLsb] [^117HEqj8].

> Next, I should review follow-up and reassessment. I need to ensure improvement within 48–72 hours. If not, I should verify adherence, reassess for undrained collections, consider culture if not previously obtained, and broaden therapy if MRSA was not initially covered. For recurrent abscesses, I should search for local causes (pilonidal disease, hidradenitis, foreign material), obtain cultures, and consider decolonization with intranasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine, along with decontamination of personal items [^116CGGQm] [^1146M1nq] [^116udS1D].

> But wait, what if the "pimple" is not a simple bacterial abscess? I should confirm the diagnosis and keep mimics in mind. Nonhealing or atypical lesions warrant reconsideration of alternative diagnoses such as deep fungal infection, atypical mycobacteria, or even neoplasia; biopsy and appropriate cultures should be pursued when the course is atypical or refractory to standard care [^114vfauV] [^115sNUpw].

> I need to ensure supportive measures are addressed. Warm compresses can promote drainage, analgesia improves comfort, and patient education on hygiene and avoiding manipulation reduces recurrence. I should also counsel on completing the antibiotic course if prescribed to mitigate resistance, while avoiding unnecessary antibiotics when I&D alone suffices [^115aUj6s] [^115M96x7].

> Let me summarize the practical algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Assess severity and presence of fluctuance. Perform I&D for abscesses. Reserve systemic antibiotics for larger lesions, systemic signs, immunocompromise, or failure of local therapy. Choose empiric therapy based on purulence and MRSA risk. Use 5 days of therapy and extend if not improved. Arrange close follow-up and pursue cultures and decolonization for recurrences. Escalate evaluation if the course is atypical or refractory [^115sNUpw] [^114pSATx] [^111VtADd].

Infected pimples are best managed with **incision and drainage** for fluctuant lesions [^115aUj6s], as antibiotics alone are insufficient without source control [^116VEGCz]. For small, non-fluctuant lesions, **topical antibiotics** (mupirocin 2% [^117VLZ74] or clindamycin 1%) are first-line; if there is surrounding cellulitis or systemic symptoms, use oral antibiotics active against MRSA (clindamycin 300–450 mg TID, doxycycline 100 mg BID, or TMP-SMX DS 1–2 tabs BID) for 5–7 days [^114pSATx]. Avoid squeezing; use warm compresses, cleanse gently, and monitor for progression. Escalate care for rapid spread, immunocompromise, or failure to improve in 48–72 hours [^114NgcMq].

---

## Clinical assessment and diagnosis

Clinical assessment should distinguish simple folliculitis from **furuncles, carbuncles, or cellulitis** by evaluating for fluctuance, pain, erythema, warmth, and systemic signs (fever, malaise) [^116VEGCz]. Obtain cultures for recurrent or severe infections, or when MRSA is suspected [^116CGGQm].

---

## General principles of management

- **Source control**: Incision and drainage (I&D) is the primary treatment for abscesses or fluctuant lesions [^115aUj6s]; antibiotics alone are insufficient without drainage [^116VEGCz].

- **Antibiotic stewardship**: Use antibiotics judiciously to minimize resistance and adverse effects [^1166WGJ8].

- **Patient education**: Avoid squeezing or picking lesions; maintain hygiene; monitor for progression [^1117wTGV].

---

## Topical treatments

Topical antibiotics are appropriate for mild, localized infections without systemic symptoms. Mupirocin 2% is effective against MRSA and is **first-line for localized impetiginized lesions** [^114mS8a4]. Clindamycin 1% is an alternative for **MRSA coverage** [^116VEGCz]. Benzoyl peroxide 2.5–5% has antimicrobial effects and can be combined with topical antibiotics to reduce resistance [^111HXBaj].

---

## Systemic antibiotic therapy

Systemic antibiotics are indicated for:

- Moderate to severe infections (surrounding cellulitis, systemic symptoms) [^114pSATx].

- Immunocompromised patients [^114pSATx].

- Failure of topical therapy or rapid progression [^notfound].

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Clindamycin | 300–450 mg PO TID | MRSA coverage |
| Doxycycline | 100 mg PO BID | MRSA coverage |
| TMP-SMX | 1–2 DS tablets PO BID | MRSA coverage |
| Cephalexin | 500 mg PO QID | MSSA coverage |
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | 875/125 mg PO BID | Broad-spectrum coverage |

---

Duration is typically **5–7 days**, extended if there is slow response or immunocompromise [^114pSATx].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

- **Warm compresses**: Apply for 10–15 minutes 3–4 times daily to promote drainage and reduce pain.

- **Analgesics**: Acetaminophen or NSAIDs for pain control.

- **Wound care**: Cleanse gently with mild soap; avoid harsh chemicals or vigorous scrubbing [^notfound].

---

## Indications for escalation of care

Escalate care or seek specialist referral if:

- Rapid progression of infection (spreading erythema, necrosis) [^notfound].

- Immunocompromised status or chronic medical conditions [^114pSATx].

- Failure to improve after 48–72 hours of appropriate therapy [^notfound].

- Suspected necrotizing infection or deep tissue involvement [^114NgcMq].

---

## Prevention of recurrence

Prevention focuses on **hygiene measures** — regular cleansing, avoiding shared towels or razors, and prompt treatment of minor skin trauma [^1146M1nq]. For recurrent MRSA, consider decolonization with intranasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine baths [^111dXsxU]. Address modifiable risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, and immunosuppression [^114NgcMq].

---

## Potential complications of untreated infected pimples

Untreated infected pimples can lead to **abscess formation** with localized collections of pus requiring drainage [^115aUj6s]. They may progress to cellulitis with spreading skin infection and systemic involvement [^114pSATx]. Severe cases can develop bacteremia, endocarditis, or osteomyelitis, particularly in immunocompromised hosts [^notfound]. Chronic or recurrent infections may occur, especially with biofilm formation or inadequate source control [^1173rk6M].

---

## Special considerations

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Lower threshold for systemic antibiotics and specialist referral [^114pSATx].

- **Pediatric patients**: Avoid tetracyclines under 8 years; consider clindamycin or cephalexin [^115rSLsb].

- **Pregnancy**: Avoid tetracyclines; prefer beta-lactams or clindamycin [^114bcKRS].

---

Effective management of infected pimples requires **source control**, appropriate antibiotics, and patient education. Escalate care for severe or refractory cases, and prioritize prevention to reduce recurrence.

Malaria treatment in people with HIV — Because Plasmodium falciparum malaria can progress within hours from mild symptoms or low-grade fever to severe disease or death, all HIV-infected patients with confirmed or suspected P. falciparum infection should be admitted to the hospital for evaluation, initiation of treatment, and observation of response to therapy (AIII). When suspicion of malaria is low, antimalarial treatment should not be initiated until the diagnosis has been confirmed by laboratory investigations, but treatment should not be delayed when malaria is strongly suspected but laboratory services are unavailable or results will be delayed (AIII). When malaria is strongly suspected, but not yet confirmed, clinicians are advised to consider and initiate treatment for other possible diagnoses in addition to malaria. Treatment recommendations for HIV-infected patients are the same as HIV-uninfected patients (AIII), and choice of therapy is guided by the degree of parasitemia, the species of Plasmodium, the patient's clinical status, and the likely drug susceptibility of the infected species; for region-specific treatment recommendations, clinicians should refer to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) malaria website: https://www.cdc.gov/malaria.

Future research

Key research questions to inform decision makers and future guidelines are:

What is the impact of different types of antibiotics in settings where MRSA is rare (prevalence < 10%)?
Do antibiotics have different effects in different populations, such as people who are immunocompromised or in people with recurrent skin abscesses?
What are the long term effects (such as > 6 months) of antibiotics on abscess recurrence, Clostridium difficile infection, and MRSA resistance to TMP-SMX or clindamycin?
Is a shorter course of antibiotics (such as 5 days) as effective as a longer course (10 days)?
Is topical therapy (such as iodine, honey, silver, other antimicrobials) effective for treating uncomplicated skin abscesses compared with systemic therapy? Do other adjunctive measures, such as nasal decontamination or antisepsis for the body, reduce the risk that skin abscesses will recur?

### Pimecrolimus [^111gVeK7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3	Bacterial and Viral Skin Infections

Before commencing treatment with Pimecrolimus Cream, 1%, bacterial or viral infections at treatment sites should be resolved. Trials have not evaluated the safety and efficacy of Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% in the treatment of clinically infected atopic dermatitis.

While patients with atopic dermatitis are predisposed to superficial skin infections including eczema herpeticum (Kaposi's varicelliform eruption), treatment with Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% may be independently associated with an increased risk of varicella zoster virus infection (chickenpox or shingles), herpes simplex virus infection, or eczema herpeticum.

In clinical trials, 15/1544 (1%) cases of skin papilloma (warts) were observed in subjects using Pimecrolimus Cream, 1%. The youngest subject was age 2 and the oldest was age 12. In cases where there is worsening of skin papillomas or they do not respond to conventional therapy, discontinuation of Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% should be considered until complete resolution of the warts is achieved.

5.4	Patients with Lymphadenopathy

In clinical trials, 14/1544 (0.9%) cases of lymphadenopathy were reported while using Pimecrolimus Cream, 1%. These cases of lymphadenopathy were usually related to infections and noted to resolve upon appropriate antibiotic therapy. Of these 14 cases, the majority had either a clear etiology or were known to resolve. Patients who receive Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% and who develop lymphadenopathy should have the etiology of their lymphadenopathy investigated. In the absence of a clear etiology for the lymphadenopathy, or in the presence of acute infectious mononucleosis, Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% should be discontinued. Patients who develop lymphadenopathy should be monitored to ensure that the lymphadenopathy resolves.

5.5	Sun Exposure

During the course of treatment, it is prudent for patients to minimize or avoid natural or artificial sunlight exposure, even while Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% is not on the skin. The potential effects of Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% on skin response to ultraviolet damage are not known.

5.6	Immunocompromised Patients

The safety and efficacy of Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% in immunocompromised patients have not been studied.

Failure of an acute inflammatory response to resolve a wound infection heralds a cascade of events that affects the host and pathogens, culminating in a chronic, refractory condition. The factors contributing to this outcome include immune compromise of the host, antimicrobial resistance, wound-healing deficiencies, and the adherence of pathogens to themselves and wound surfaces via an impenetrable, resistant biofilm. To eradicate chronic infection, the pathogens, biofilm, surfaces available for adherence, and compromised tissue must be removed.

Recurrent skin abscesses — appropriate treatment includes the following recommendations: A recurrent abscess at a site of previous infection should prompt a search for local causes such as a pilonidal cyst, hidradenitis suppurativa, or foreign material (strong, moderate). Recurrent abscesses should be drained and cultured early in the course of infection (strong, moderate). Culture recurrent abscess and treat with a 5- to 10-day course of an antibiotic active against the pathogen isolated (weak, low). Consider a 5-day decolonization regimen twice daily of intranasal mupirocin, daily chlorhexidine washes, and daily decontamination of personal items such as towels, sheets, and clothes for recurrent S. aureus infection (weak, low). Adult patients should be evaluated for neutrophil disorders if recurrent abscesses began in early childhood (strong, moderate).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112eavHt]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV opportunistic infection guideline rating system — prevention and treatment recommendations are graded by strength and quality: A: Strong recommendation for the statement, B: Moderate recommendation for the statement, and C: Weak recommendation for the statement; evidence quality is I: One or more randomized trials with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints, II: One or more well-designed, non-randomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes, and III: Expert opinion. Recommendations are rated according to this system in which the letters A, B, or C signify the strength of the recommendation and the Roman numerals I, II, or III indicate the quality of the evidence, and when there are no data in people with HIV but relevant data from people without HIV exist, the recommendation is rated II or III but is assigned A, B, or C depending on the strength of the recommendation. The document also notes the presence of six summary tables at the end of the document (Tables 1–6).

### Evaluating the impact of antiretroviral therapy on HIV transmission [^114kpvLd]. AIDS (2008). Low credibility.

As global efforts proceed to scale up the delivery of antiretroviral therapy (ART) to HIV-infected persons in most urgent need, it is essential to understand the potential impact of treatment expansion on the transmission of new HIV infections. In this study, we use a series of simple mathematical models to explore the direction and magnitude of treatment effects on the sexual transmission of HIV. By defining the circumstances under which ART can reduce the number of new infections transmitted by treated patients, we provide critical benchmarks to aid in prioritizing efforts to maximize the population health impact of treatment and in evaluating the performance of different treatment programmes. We find that, based on the best currently available evidence of possible treatment effects on patient infectiousness, survival and behavior, the potential remains for either positive or negative changes in overall transmission. In relation to the total number of expected secondary infections caused by each infected person, however, these net treatment effects are relatively modest, particularly if treatment is initiated at advanced stages of the disease. This finding implies that treatment alone should not be expected to alter the population-level incidence of new infections dramatically, in the absence of changes in other factors including possible behavioral responses among uninfected persons and among infected persons who are not yet treatment candidates.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevention after exposure — adults and adolescents with HIV: There is no available vaccine or recommended post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent HCV infection. Following acute HCV infection, chronic infection can be prevented within the first 6 to 12 months after infection through antiviral treatment; high rates of viral clearance have been observed with HCV treatment during the acute phase of infection. Because most patients with acute HCV infection may transmit to others and are at risk for loss to follow-up, immediate treatment with the same regimens recommended for chronic HCV should be offered (AIII), and specific treatment regimens in acute infection are the same as those recommended for chronic HCV infection.

Diabetes-related foot infection (DFI) adjuncts — The guideline states: "We suggest not using the following treatments to address DFIs: (a) adjunctive G-CSF treatment or (b) topical antiseptics, silver preparations, honey, bacteriophage therapy, or negative-pressure wound therapy (with or without instillation)". Rationale indicates that "G-CSF to a diabetes-related foot treatment does not significantly affect the likelihood of resolution of infection, healing of the wound, or the duration of systemic antibiotic therapy", although "It does seem to be associated with a reduced likelihood of lower extremity surgical interventions (including amputation) and a reduced duration of hospital stay, although the profile of patients who might benefit is unclear, especially in relation to the costs and potential adverse effects". For topical agents, "the available evidence does not support any beneficial effect for most of them", and "Silver compounds do not offer benefits in ulcer healing (as described in the IWGDF wound healing guidelines) and there is no evidence to support their effectiveness in the treatment of the infectious aspects of a DFU".

### Are antibiotic nails effective in the treatment of infected tibial fractures? [^114vbs8p]. Injury (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic-impregnated cement nails are used to treat postoperative deep infections after primary intramedullary nail insertion for the treatment of tibial fractures. Few data exist regarding the efficacy of this treatment strategy. We hypothesized that such treatment with antibiotic nails results in a high rate of infection clearance at intermediate follow-up.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review at our Level I trauma center. Patients who received intramedullary nails to stabilize tibial fractures (from 2000 to 2011) and subsequently required antibiotic nails to treat deep postoperative infection (n = 55) were considered for study inclusion. Patients with less than 6 months of follow-up were excluded, leaving 41 patients in the study group (average age, 41 years; average follow-up, 20 months).

Results

Thirty-one patients (76%) had no evidence of infection after treatment. The 10 patients for whom treatment failed were shown to have infection within the first 6 months. Two experienced persistent infection after antibiotic nail removal, necessitating massive débridement and ring fixator placement. Four patients underwent repeat antibiotic nail insertion after persistent infection. Three infections resulted in eventual above-knee amputations, and one chronic infection resulted in the need for multiple débridement and saucerization procedures. No complications associated with use of the antibiotic nails were observed.

Conclusion

The use of antibiotic nails for treatment of tibial infections seems to be a reasonable option, clearing 76% of infections at the 6-month time frame. Further investigation is needed to compare this treatment algorithm with other strategies, such as antibiotic treatment without nail removal and massive débridement with ring fixator placement.

Conclusion

Thus we may need to revise the available guidelines to include the option where the best possible treatment of an infection may no longer be geared towards blindly eradicating all infected patients (search and destroy) but be directed towards a selective eradication strategy (find and destroy only virulent strains). However this requires the implementation of effective strategies to identify virulent strains as well as awareness amongst physicians that treatment of all individual patients may severely limit the treatment options for our future patients.

### Treatment challenges in the management of complicated skin and soft-tissue infections [^115yRNDe]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTIs) are a significant clinical problem, partially owing to increasing resistance of infecting bacteria to current antibiotic therapies. Two case studies that illustrate complications that can arise when treating cSSTIs are outlined, and methods that can be used to address the problem and the final treatment outcome are detailed. Although these are specific examples, intolerance of and bacterial resistance to current antibacterial therapies are problems that are often seen in the clinical setting and must be addressed appropriately. The use of new antibiotic agents is one potential solution to these problems, and some of these agents are highlighted. Selecting the most appropriate therapy for an infection is often crucial for patient welfare. This article presents some potential approaches to the treatment of cSSTIs.

### The impact of blood transcriptomic biomarker targeted tuberculosis preventive therapy in people living with HIV: a mathematical modelling study [^115rApna]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Parameter ranges used in model. 3HP, weekly isoniazid and rifapentine for 12 weeks. IPT, isoniazid preventive therapy; ART, antiretroviral therapy status

A proportion (C) of the population is offered preventive therapy (C will depend on the strategy being considered (see below)). A proportion, U, of those offered treatment initiate treatment and amongst those treatment is effective in a proportion E. Those who are effectively treated move to on treatment states (S P and L P for those who were susceptible or infected respectively). While on treatment (for a duration D p), individuals are protected from infection or progression to disease. After treatment susceptible people return to the S state. People who were previously infected enter a post-treatment state P. These individuals are not at risk of progressing to disease but can be re-infected (at a rate pλ, i.e. they retain the same protection as latently infected individuals).

Zygomycosis is an increasingly common infection in immunocompromised patients. Advances in the understanding of Zygomycetes pathobiology and the introduction of new drugs with improved activity and tolerability for treatment of zygomycosis have improved the prospects of effectively controlling this devastating infection. Further reductions in mortality will require improved diagnostic and novel therapeutic approaches for this group of aggressive opportunistic molds.

### Use of appropriate antimicrobials in wound management [^1166WGJ8]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

The primary goal of wound management is to achieve a functional closure with minimal scarring. Preventing infection is important to facilitate the healing process. Most simple, uncomplicated wounds do not need systemic antibiotics but benefit from the use of topical antibiotics. Judicious use of antibiotics reduces unnecessary adverse events and helps reduce the development of resistance. Although antibiotics can help reduce infection risk and promote healing, they are not a substitute for good local wound care, in particular irrigation and surgical débridement. This article reviews the role of antibiotics in emergency department wound management.

Although a long course of therapy is prudent, especially for mycelial fungal infections, excessively and unnecessarily extended courses of treatment incur a risk of toxicity and the expense of the therapeutic regimen. On the basis of existing reports on the pathogenesis and the effect of duration of therapy and other variables on outcome and response rate in fungal infections, this review proposes guidelines that may facilitate a rational approach to decision-making about the duration of antifungal therapy.

### Recurrence of skin and soft tissue infections: identifying risk factors and treatment strategies [^114We2eu]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

RSSTIs are common but challenging clinical entities, with an important burden in terms of morbidity and healthcare-related costs. Recognizing modifiable risk factors and applying both pharmacological and nonpharmacological preventive strategies, along with a tailored approach, are effective in reducing the incidence of these conditions. A growing amount of new therapeutic options, both oral and parenteral, and the chance of out-patients administration are probably meant to change RSSTIs management in the near future.

### It's not just the antibiotics, it's the treatment [^112KSqzp]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

At its core, the narrow-focused debate surrounding the timing of antimicrobial therapy is inherently flawed. The appropriate treatment of the septic patient requires a rapid multimodal response including fluid resuscitation, source control, and pressors (if required). Antimicrobials are only one part of this equation. In cases of life threatening septic shock, broad-spectrum empiric therapy should be initiated as soon as possible. However, the harmful effects of inappropriate antimicrobials should be mitigated, whenever possible, by using culture-guided therapy and delayed initiation. In all cases, resuscitation and source control should be the highest priority. Bloos and colleagues' study is a reminder that antimicrobials, while important, are not the only tools in our arsenal against infectious disease.

### Verrucous plaque on the face [^114vfauV]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

History

A healthy, Hispanic, 23-year-old woman living in Illinois, presented with 10-month history of a verrucous plaque on the left lower face. She had been treated for a pneumonia just prior to the plaque developing. The patient stated the lesion had started as a "pimple" and has continued to enlarge. Treatment with over-the-counter triple antibiotic ointment and hydrocortisone cream yielded no improvement. Over the next 10 months, the lesion continued to grow and she ultimately sought medical care. Physical exam revealed a 12-cm plaque on the L lower cheek and neck with central crusting, erosions, and a verrucous, hyperkeratotic border; no other lesions or salient physical findings were otherwise present. Skin biopsy was performed with the findings in Fig 1, Fig 2, Fig 3.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Keratoacanthoma-type/squamous cell carcinoma
B. Vegetative pyoderma gangrenosum
C. Verruca vulgaris
D. Blastomycosis
E. Hypertrophic lichen planus

### The infected or exposed breast implant: management and treatment strategies [^113SGiGk]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Among the potential complications associated with the use of breast implants are the risks of periprosthetic infection and device extrusion. There is little published information about the effective management of these situations. Conservative recommendations include antibiotic therapy and removal of the implant until resolution of the infection or until the wound has healed. A retrospective review identified patients with periprosthetic infection or threatened or actual device exposure treated by the senior author. Twenty-four patients encompassing 26 affected prostheses were available for review and were classified into seven groups based on initial presentation as follows: group 1, mild infection (n = 8); group 2, severe infection (n = 4); group 3, threatened exposure without infection (n = 3); group 4, threatened exposure with mild infection (n = 3); group 5, threatened exposure with severe infection (n = 1); group 6, actual exposure without clinical infection (n = 5); and group 7, actual exposure with infection (n = 2). To salvage the prosthesis in these patients, various treatment strategies were utilized. All patients with a suspected infection or device exposure were started immediately on appropriate antibiotic therapy (oral antibiotics for mild infections and parenteral antibiotics for severe infections). Salvage methods included one or more of the following: antibiotic therapy, débridement, curettage, pulse lavage, capsulectomy, device exchange, primary closure, and/or flap coverage. Twenty (76.9 percent) of 26 threatened implants with infection or threatened or actual prosthesis exposure were salvaged after aggressive intervention. The presence of severe infection adversely affected the salvage rate in this series. A statistically significant difference exists among those patients without infection or with mild infection only (groups 1, 3, 4, and 6); successful salvage was achieved in 18 (94.7 percent) of 19 patients, whereas only two of seven of those implants with severe infection (groups 2, 5, and 7) were salvaged (p = 0.0017). Ten (90.9 percent) of 11 devices with threatened or actual exposure, not complicated by severe infection (groups 3, 4, and 6), were salvaged. Several treatment strategies were developed for periprosthetic infection and for threatened or actual implant exposure. Patients with infection were placed on oral or intravenous antibiotics; those who responded completely required no further treatment. For persistent mild infection or threatened or actual exposure, operative intervention was required, including some or all of the following steps: implant removal, pocket curettage, partial or total capsulectomy, débridement, site change, placement of a new implant, and/or flap coverage; the menu of options varied with the precise circumstances. No immediate salvage was attempted in five cases, due to either severe infection, nonresponding infection with gross purulence, marginal tissues, or lack of options for healthy tissue coverage. Based on the authors' experience, salvage attempts for periprosthetic infection and prosthesis exposure may be successful, except in cases of overwhelming infection or deficient soft-tissue coverage. Although an attempt at implant salvage may be offered to a patient, device removal and delayed reinsertion will always remain a more conservative and predictable option.

### Impetigo: diagnosis and treatment… [^117VLZ74]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment Treatment options for impetigo include topical antibiotics, systemic antibiotics, and topical disinfectants. 8 Topical antibiotics are more effective than placebo and preferable to oral antibiotics for limited impetigo. 8, 11 Systemic antibiotics are often reserved for more generalized or severe infections in which topical therapy is not practical. Clinicians sometimes may choose both topical and systemic therapy. 8 The ideal treatment should be effective, be inexpensive, have limited adverse effects, and should not promote bacterial resistance. 2, 4, 8. TOPICAL ANTIBIOTICS Topical antibiotics have the advantage of being applied only where needed, minimizing antibiotic resistance and avoiding gastrointestinal and other systemic adverse effects. 4, 8 The length of time of topical treatment varies based on product, but in clinical trials, a seven-day course was more effective than placebo for resolution of impetigo.

8, 11 Local allergic reactions, skin sensitization, and difficulty with application to areas such as eyelids, mouth, and back are potential disadvantages of topical treatments. Three topical antibiotic preparations recommended for impetigo are mupirocin 2% cream or ointment, retapamulin 1% ointment, and fusidic acid. Retapamulin is a novel pleuromutilin antibacterial and the first new topical antibacterial in nearly 20 years. ORAL ANTIBIOTICS Oral antibiotic therapy can be used for impetigo with large bullae or when topical therapy is impractical. 6 Although trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is effective for S. aureus infection, including most MRSA infections, its use for impetigo is limited by inadequate coverage of streptococcal bacteria. Oral clindamycin penetrates skin and skin structures and should be considered if MRSA infection is suspected.

NATURAL THERAPIES The evidence is insufficient to recommend or dismiss popular herbal treatments for impetigo. Future Treatments Future treatments for impetigo might include minocycline foam, which has successfully completed phase II trials, and Ozenoxacin, a topical quinolone that has successfully completed phase III clinical trials. 27, 28 Few controlled clinical trials have had their results published and most are methodologically weak. This area seems to merit further study through rigorous clinical trials.

### Treatment of the infected hip replacement [^113UVSHw]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2004). Low credibility.

Selection of the suitable treatment method for an infected hip arthroplasty requires careful assessment of patient-related variables and expected treatment goals. The basic treatment options include antibiotic suppression, open debridement, resection arthroplasty, arthrodesis, reimplantation of another prosthesis, and amputation. Successful treatment of infection requires complete debridement of all infected and foreign material and appropriate antimicrobial therapy. When possible, the preferred treatment approach is insertion of another prosthesis with a delayed reconstructive treatment technique. Patients now are presenting with an increasing incidence of resistant organisms and severe bone loss, which increases the difficulty of treatment.

### It's not just the antibiotics, it's the treatment [^111wHH6t]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The recent study by Bloos and colleagues demonstrates that early initiation of antimicrobial therapy is not associated with improved survival in sepsis. We contend that these findings should not be surprising. This study is yet another part of the growing case against early and aggressive antimicrobial therapy and highlights the important roles resuscitation and source control play in the management of the septic patient. We suggest that, whenever possible, antimicrobial therapy should we withheld until objective evidence of infection has been obtained.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons' clinical practice guidelines for the management of pilonidal disease [^114mbsif]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). High credibility.

Antibiotic use in pilonidal disease — perioperative, postoperative, and topical findings are mixed: In a randomized prophylactic trial for excision with primary closure, antibiotics showed no benefit for wound infection (32% vs 36%) or 4‑week healing (69% vs 64%). In a small randomized perioperative study, wound infections at 4 weeks were lower with antibiotics (12% vs 44%), but a comparison of short versus longer perioperative courses showed no difference in healing after excision and primary closure (77% vs 73%). For topical therapy, packing with an absorbable, gentamicin‑impregnated, collagen‑based sponge plus primary closure reported higher wound‑healing rates (86% vs 35%; p < 0.001), yet a systematic review found a nonsignificant trend toward fewer wound infections and no significant influence on wound healing or disease recurrence. Adjunctive use should be considered in the setting of severe cellulitis, underlying immunosuppression, or concomitant systemic illness despite limited evidence in this specific venue.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for basic wound management in the austere environment: 2014 update [^1117wTGV]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Wilderness wound infection prophylaxis and prevention — whether or not prophylactic antibiotics are given, wounds should be monitored closely because complications can develop rapidly or in an indolent manner. With the exception of certain specific wound categories, there is scant evidence to support the routine use of systemic antibiotics for prophylaxis against wound infection, with a notable exception of an open fracture in which acute antibiotic administration significantly lowers the rate of infection. Virtually all open wounds are colonized with microorganisms, but this is usually without clinical consequences, and the presence of colonizing bacteria does not constitute infection. A systematic review of mammalian bites showed a statistically significant reduction in infection with prophylactic antibiotics after bites by humans but not after bites by cats or dogs, except bites of the hand; there was also a statistically significant reduction in infection after mammalian bites to the hand. Although dated, there is evidence to support the use of topical antibiotics to promote wound healing and decrease infection.

### Treatments for acne vulgaris based on severity… [^111HXBaj]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Nondermatologists often manage acne vulgaris. Treatments depend on severity, which can be influenced by genetics, stress, and, possibly, diet. Haider and Shaw evaluated data from the past four decades to determine which treatments are most effective and how they can be administered with the fewest complications. the authors studied 29 randomized, double-blind trials that documented reductions in lesions, and several systematic reviews. They note that methods of assessing acne severity are highly inconsistent, although conclusions still can be drawn. Treatments under consideration were topical retinoids, topical antimicrobials, oral antibiotics, hormonal therapy, and isotretinoin. Topical retinoids include tretinoin, adapalene, and tazarotene. Tretinoin and adapalene reduce total lesions by more than 50 percent, with adapalene being less irritating to skin. One trial showed similar lesion reduction with tazarotene gel. Overall, retinoids reduce lesions by 40 to 70 percent.

Topical antibiotics include clindamycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline. Benzoyl peroxide and azelaic acid also have antimicrobial activity. Original studies show that clindamycin and erythromycin reduce lesions to a similar degree as retinoids. Products that combine antibiotics with benzoyl peroxide are more effective than either product alone. Antimicrobials also can be used in combination with retinoids, with combination products being more successful than a topical antibiotic alone. Because the onset of action is slow, patients must be treated for six to eight weeks with these agents to observe an effect. Topical antibiotics and benzoyl peroxide can cause skin irritation. While conventional antibiotics often create bacterial resistance, this has not been reported with benzoyl peroxide or azelaic acid. Hormonal treatments include oral contraceptives and androgen-receptor blockers.

One trial showed a 50 percent reduction of lesions in patients treated with oral contraceptives, compared with 30 percent in those given placebo. In Europe, newer progesterone-estrogen combinations have been shown to be effective. Androgen-receptor blockers include spironolactone and flutamide. These agents must be used in high doses to be effective in the treatment of acne. All agents in this class also are effective when used in combination with an oral contraceptive. In conclusion, the authors emphasize that treatment of acne should take into account fluctuations in severity and should be adjusted according to tolerance and response. In many cases, combination therapy is warranted.

### Guidelines for the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection: recommendations from the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association and CDC, 2020 [^111Q3gwt]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

One fourth of the global population (approximately 2 billion persons) is estimated to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, including approximately 13 million in the United States. Most infected persons are asymptomatic and classified as having latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). If untreated, approximately 5%–10% of persons with LTBI progress to tuberculosis (TB) disease during their lifetime. Progression from untreated LTBI accounts for approximately 80% of U.S. TB disease cases. Treatment of LTBI is effective in preventing progression to TB disease. The most recent comprehensive guidelines for treatment of LTBI in the United States were published in 2000. In 2003, CDC and the American Thoracic Society recommended against use of the 2-month regimen of rifampin plus pyrazinamide because of the risk for severe hepatotoxicity. Since then, several new regimens have been evaluated in clinical trials. To update the 2000 and 2003 treatment guidelines, the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association (NTCA) and CDC convened a committee to conduct a systematic literature review of clinical trials for the treatment of LTBI. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria were applied to the evidence of effectiveness, a network meta-analysis of selected evidence was performed, and the evidence was used to support 2020 LTBI treatment guidelines.

These updated 2020 LTBI treatment guidelines apply to persons with LTBI who live in the United States. In addition, these guidelines apply to persons infected with M. tuberculosis that is presumed to be susceptible to isoniazid or rifampin; they do not apply when evidence is available that the infecting M. tuberculosis strain is resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin. Local and state TB programs in the United States answer questions about diagnosing and treating persons with LTBI in their jurisdictions.­

### Infectious diseases: what you may have missed in 2024 [^115WZxkr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2024, infectious disease literature focused on advancements in the treatment of severe infections and prevention of high-burden diseases. Building on prior data, further evidence supports both the use of shorter courses of antibiotics and the earlier transition to oral antibiotics, including for severe infections, such as bacteremia. A new medication has demonstrated significant, high-impact findings in the long-acting category of drugs for the prevention of HIV infection. Antibiotic resistance continues to be a growing threat, and research this year has demonstrated significant advances for new agents helping to combat resistant gram-negative organisms. Research on the long-term sequelae of COVID-19 continues to expand, with a living systematic review providing us a better understanding of symptom management. Novel treatment regimens for Helicobacter pylori infection are being studied, and the evidence is reviewed for these new regimens. Finally, several emerging infections are highlighted to raise awareness of new or concerning outbreaks that may cause significant effects in the coming year.

### Achieving elimination as a public health problem for schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium: when is community-wide treatment required? [^115r577g]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

To achieve EPHP, these modeling insights show that school-based treatment (of 75% SAC only) is sufficient in low- to moderate-prevalence settings for both S. mansoni and S. haematobium (Table 1). In certain high-prevalence settings, 75% SAC-only treatment remains sufficient for achieving EPHP; however, once the prevalence rises above a certain threshold, an increase in SAC treatment coverage and/or expansion to adult treatment is needed. This prevalence threshold decreases as the burden of infection in adults relative to SAC rises (Figure 1B). Overall, the optimal treatment strategy will depend on the setting, including factors such as the species present, prevalence prior to treatment, age profile of infection, and school enrolment levels.

Note that these insights derived from the predictions of mathematical models should not be overgeneralized to all settings. In addition to treatment coverage, individual adherence to treatment is also important. Our model assumes that 75% of SAC are treated at random in each round of MDA, hence SAC not adhering to treatment and SAC with no access to treatment (eg, schools with low enrolment) have not been considered. In settings with such challenges present, community-wide treatment may be more beneficial. Additionally, the S. haematobium age profile of infection studied (informed by previous model fitting to data work) has a low adult burden of infection but in areas with higher adult levels of infection, adult treatment will likely be needed.

Caveats to These Analyses: The Skewed Distribution of Worms in Different Communities

Understanding the nonlinear relationship between prevalence of infection and heavy-intensity infections is key, particularly if the EPHP goal is changed to a goal that is based on prevalence of infection (Figure 2). This relationship varies with the degree of worm aggregation within a defined community (where a high worm aggregation corresponds to most individuals harboring zero or few worms and a few individuals harboring many). We know that the uneven distribution of worms across a community is common, but there are few measures of how variable it is in different places, and how it changes after treatment and during resurgence. Following multiple rounds of MDA, the degree of worm aggregation may increase, particularly if there are a few systematic nonadherers and/or nonaccess individuals remaining with heavy-intensity infections. Such individuals will reduce the potential impact of a treatment program and result in persisting infections, thereby increasing the risk of resurgence.

### Vancomycin [^115M96x7]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibacterial Resistance

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including vancomycin, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When vancomycin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by vancomycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

### It's not just the antibiotics, it's the treatment [^1167uYXv]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Should these findings have been surprising? We think not. The author's cite a meta-analysis by Barochia and colleagues that suggests that timely administration of antimicrobials is associated with improved survival. However, this finding was only significant after removing the effects from Rivers and colleagues' study on early goal-directed therapy. Another meta-analysis conducted on studies of outpatient respiratory infections found no difference between immediate or delayed antibiotic therapy. Puskarich and colleagues demonstrated that, in the setting of appropriate resuscitation, the timing of antimicrobial therapy appears to have little effect on mortality. Similarly, Hranjec and colleagues found that, assuming resuscitation and source control occur in a timely manner, intentionally withholding antimicrobial therapy until infection can be objectively proven to result in improved patient outcomes compared with early and aggressive initiation. These studies focused on emergency department and ICU management, respectively. Bloos and colleagues' study confirms the findings of Hranjec and colleagues and Puskarich and colleagues, while spanning the entire spectrum of hospitalization.

This trial also suffers from the most common deficit in most studies of timing of antimicrobial therapy in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock: the lack of a proper control group. The question faced by the clinician is not whether a patient with proven infection should have the rapid initiation of antimicrobials, but whether a patient who might be infected should receive therapy. Missing in this study is the group of patients who received antimicrobials for suspected infection but were not infected, and what the consequences of this unnecessary exposure to antibiotics were. However, the data are reassuring to us who believe that it is prudent to wait until there is objective microbiological data to support the diagnosis of infection before initiating therapy. Even among these patients with significant disease, the exact timing of antimicrobial therapy did not appear to be the main driver of outcomes.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Treating malaria in HIV-infected patients — because Plasmodium falciparum malaria can progress within hours from mild symptoms or low-grade fever to severe disease or death, all HIV-infected patients with confirmed or suspected P. falciparum infection should be admitted to the hospital for evaluation, initiation of treatment, and observation of response to therapy (AIII). When suspicion of malaria is low, antimalarial treatment should not be initiated until the diagnosis has been confirmed by laboratory investigations, but treatment should not be delayed when malaria is strongly suspected but laboratory services are unavailable or results may be delayed (AIII). Treatment recommendations for HIV-infected patients are the same as HIV-uninfected patients (AIII), choice of therapy is guided by the degree of parasitemia, the species of Plasmodium, the patient's clinical status, and the likely drug susceptibility of the infected species, and for region-specific recommendations clinicians should refer to the CDC malaria website and the CDC Malaria Hotline.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a diverse human disease caused by more than 20 Leishmania species transmitted by the bite of an infected sand fly. Diagnostic testing is recommended to confirm infection and determine the infecting species. Treatment decisions are complex and providers should consider infecting species, patient comorbidities, extent and location of lesions, and previous treatments. There is no single universal treatment for CL and some treatment can have toxicity. Treatment should be individualized and factors, such as self-healing nature of this infection, risk of metastatic complications (ie, mucosal leishmaniasis), and patient wishes, need to be included in individual risk-benefit treatment decisions.

Question 3: Which treatment gives the greatest survival benefit for mucormycosis?
A. Surgical intervention
B. Liposomal amphotericin B and surgical intervention
C. Posaconazole
D. Liposomal amphotericin B
E. Liposomal amphotericin B and posaconazole

Answers:
A. Surgical intervention – Incorrect. Although limited, cutaneous-only involvement may be amenable to surgical treatment; however, given the severity depicted in the picture and history of pulmonary infiltrate, this case would not be adequately treated with a surgical method alone.
B. Liposomal amphotericin B and surgical intervention – Correct. The combination of liposomal amphotericin B and surgical intervention gives the greatest survival benefit for patients.
C. Posaconazole – Incorrect. Posaconazole is typically used for secondary coverage or salvage therapy. Amphotericin B is the preferred first-line agent, specifically, the liposomal formulation because of its greater efficacy.
D. Liposomal amphotericin B – Incorrect. Although the liposomal amphotericin B is the preferred first-line therapy, studies show the greatest survival rate is with surgical intervention in combination with liposomal amphotericin B.
E. Liposomal amphotericin B and posaconazole – Incorrect. Although primary therapy of liposomal amphotericin B with secondary coverage of posaconazole may be a therapeutic regimen for patients who are not surgical candidates, this therapy has an increased mortality rate when compared with surgical therapy in combination with liposomal amphotericin B. Of note, initial treatment with the combination of amphotericin B and posaconazole did not reduce mortality compared with amphotericin B as monotherapy.

Although commonly encountered by hand surgeons and other physicians, fingertip infections have several mimics, and diagnosis and management is not always straightforward. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to success. As with all infections, they are more common and are more aggressive in immunosuppressed patients. This article reviews fingertip anatomy, common and uncommon fingertip infections and their mimics, and recommendations for management.

Erysipelas and cellulitis — Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cultures and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent; Figure 1), systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients as defined in question 13 (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem/meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infections (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high).

### The status and progress of first-line treatment againstinfection: a review [^113QNWWk]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This review summarizes the current situation and progress of first-line treatment of HP. To overcome the general increase in antibiotic resistance globally, many studies have proposed good improvements on the basis of the treatment recommended by international guidelines. These improved methods often achieve good effectiveness and safety by changing the type of antibiotics and the frequency, sequence, and dose of administration. The most fundamental approach remains personalized treatment based on drug sensitivity tests as studies have shown that triple therapy is effective against sensitive bacteria even in areas of high drug resistance. In order to solve the problem of antibiotic resistance, we not only need to avoid the misuse of antibiotics, develop new drugs, and propose new treatment regimens, but also develop new techniques to detect drug sensitivity.

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence — The grading framework includes categories such as "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" where "Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa" and "Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies", with the implication that "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". For "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence", "Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects" and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient's or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect". Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence", where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available", and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence", where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain".

### Treatment of acute HCV infection [^111wsZ3q]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

In developed nations, the majority of new HCV infections are acquired by injection drug users. Acute HCV infection is generally asymptomatic and is followed by spontaneous viral clearance in approximately 25% of individuals. However, given the asymptomatic nature of infection and difficulties in identifying and following those at risk of acquiring infection, our knowledge of treatment for acute HCV infection has been hampered. Much of what is known about the timing, optimal regimen and duration of therapy comes from small, prospective, observational studies and randomized, controlled trials in selected populations. Furthermore, data on the treatment of acute HCV infection among injection drug users and patients co-infected with HCV and HIV are limited. Genetic testing for variations in IL28B may provide an additional diagnostic tool for the optimal management and treatment of acute HCV infection. This Review highlights current knowledge of the epidemiology, diagnosis, natural history and treatment of acute HCV infection, including proposed recommendations for the assessment and treatment of this infection.

Erysipelas and cellulitis — evaluation and treatment recommendations are as follows: Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cutaneous and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent SSTI; Figure 1) systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against MSSA (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients (as defined in question 13), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem-meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infection (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high). Elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). Hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112X4A5b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Impetigo and ecthyma — clinical features describe that impetigo can be either bullous or nonbullous, with bullous impetigo caused by strains of S. aureus producing a toxin that cleaves the dermal-epidermal junction to form fragile, thin-roofed vesiculopustules that may rupture into crusted, erythematous erosions; nonbullous impetigo may be due to β-hemolytic streptococci or S. aureus and begins as erythematous papules that evolve into vesicles and pustules forming honey-colored crusts. Ecthyma is a deeper infection than impetigo caused by S. aureus and/or streptococci, with lesions that rupture into circular, erythematous ulcers with adherent crusts and surrounding edema, and unlike impetigo, ecthyma heals with scarring.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^117R9M4E]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection — treatment-naive patients: In treatment-naive patients with H. pylori infection, optimized bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT) is recommended as a first-line treatment option (strong recommendation; moderate quality evidence). BQT typically comprises a bismuth salt, a nitroimidazole, tetracycline (which is preferred over doxycycline), and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). BQT is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration when prescribed separately in its 4 components, and Pylera is dispensed only as a 10-day regimen, whereas Helidac was initially approved with an H2-receptor antagonist for 14 days. We do not recommend the use of H2RAs in treatment regimens for H. pylori infection and do not recommend restricting treatment to those infected patients who have peptic ulcer; therefore, this preparation was not further considered.

### How long should we treat this infection for? [^112Yz2zv]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2013). Low credibility.

Infection accounts for approximately half of all paediatric admissions to hospital and an even greater proportion of primary care. Guidelines on duration of antibiotic therapy exist, but antibiotic therapy for children needs to be individualised. If a child is not improving the clinical condition and treatment should be reviewed and/or discussed with an expert. However, slavishly completing the recommended course of antibiotics in a child who is well, may not be appropriate. Recent studies on treatment duration advocate shortened courses with certain caveats, but guidelines and clinical practice do not always follow the evidence from the few randomised trials of treatment duration of infection.

Treating disease — management of suspected or confirmed Plasmodium falciparum in HIV: All HIV-infected patients with confirmed or suspected P. falciparum infections should be admitted to the hospital for evaluation, initiation of treatment, and observation of response to treatment (AIII), and treatment should not be delayed when malaria is strongly suspected but laboratory services are unavailable or results will be delayed (AIII). Choice of treatment is guided by the degree of parasitemia, the species of Plasmodium, the patient's clinical status, and likely drug susceptibility, and for HIV-infected patients who acquire Plasmodium infection, treatment recommendations are the same as for HIV-uninfected patients (AIII).

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^116VEGCz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of superficial infections (impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis, and superficial abscesses)?

We recommend that impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis should be managed by antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Empiric therapy for community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to first line therapy (recommendation 1C).

Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for simple abscesses or boils. We recommend not to use antibiotics for simple abscesses or boils (recommendation 1C).

Superficial infections encompass either superficial spreading infection and inflammation within the epidermis and dermis that may be treated with antibiotics alone or a well-circumscribed abscess that may be treated by drainage alone.

Physical examination usually reveals erythema, tenderness, and induration. The majority of superficial SSTIs are caused by Gram-positive bacteria, particularly streptococci and S. aureus. The three common presentations of superficial infections consist of impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis. They are managed by antibiotic therapy against Gram-positive bacteria.

Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the superficial layers of the epidermis. Impetigo predominantly affects children, and it is one of the most common SSTI in children worldwide. It is characterized by discrete purulent lesions nearly always caused by β-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. and/or S. aureus. Moreover, of particular concern is the rising role of CA-MRSA as impetigo's etiological agent.

Erysipelas is a fiery red, tender, painful plaque with well-demarcated edges and is commonly caused by streptococcal species, usually Staphylococcus pyogenes. S. aureus rarely causes erysipelas. Streptococci are the primary cause of erysipelas. Most facial infections are attributed to group A Streptococcus (GAS), with an increasing percentage of lower extremity infections being caused by non-GAS. The role of S. aureus, and specifically MRSA, remains controversial.

### Acne vulgaris: treatment guidelines from the AAD… [^115TrYKP]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- First-line treatment for mild acne vulgaris includes benzoyl peroxide or a topical retinoid, or a combination of topical medications including topical antibiotics.
- Tetracyclines are the preferred oral antibiotic, and doxycycline and minocycline have been shown to be more effective than tetracycline. First-line and Alternative Treatment Options First-line treatment for mild acne vulgaris includes benzoyl peroxide or a topical retinoid, or a combination of topical medications consisting of benzoyl peroxide and an antibiotic, retinoid, or both. An alternative treatment would include the addition of a topical retinoid or benzoyl peroxide if not already prescribed; a different retinoid; or topical dapsone.

First-line treatment for moderate acne vulgaris includes a combination of benzoyl peroxide and a topical antibiotic, topical retinoid, or both; benzoyl peroxide, an oral antibiotic, and topical retinoid; or benzoyl peroxide, oral and topical antibiotics, and a topical retinoid. Alternative treatments to be considered include a different combination of medications; changing the oral antibiotic; adding a combined oral contraceptive or spironolactone in females; or oral isotretinoin. First-line treatment for severe acne vulgaris includes an oral antibiotic, benzoyl peroxide, and a topical antibiotic, topical retinoid, or both. Oral isotretinoin can also be considered as a first-line option. Alternative treatment options to consider include changing the oral antibiotic; adding a combined oral contraceptive or spironolactone in females; or starting oral isotretinoin.

Antibiotics should be prescribed for the briefest possible time frame, and their use should be assessed after three to four months to reduce the risk of developing a resistance. As with topical antibiotics, systemic antibiotics should not be used alone. To maintain results after antibiotic treatment has concluded, benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid should be used. Severe adverse effects of systemic antibiotics in persons treated for acne are uncommon. In the short term, adding an oral corticosteroid when initiating the usual acne therapy in persons with severe inflammatory acne can be beneficial. Low-dose oral corticosteroids are recommended for persons with adrenal hyperandrogenism.

### Advances in the medical management of skin and soft tissue infections [^115csuj1]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections are some of the most common infectious disease diagnoses in both inpatient and outpatient settings. With bacterial resistance to antimicrobials growing, decision making on empiric antibiotics is becoming increasingly difficult. Additionally, the most recent guidance from a professional society on the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections was published in 2014 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and is now two years old. New antimicrobial agents have been developed and approved for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections since then, and more are in the pipeline. This review summarizes the evidence on treatments that are new or in development and the potential repurposing of old antimicrobials. The clinical utility of these treatments is also discussed.

HIV and Plasmodium falciparum malaria — treatment: Because P. falciparum malaria can progress within hours from mild symptoms or low-grade fever to severe disease or death, all HIV-infected patients with confirmed or suspected P. falciparum infections should be admitted to the hospital for evaluation, initiation of treatment, and observation of response to treatment (AIII). Diagnosis prior to treatment should always be pursued; however, treatment should not be delayed when malaria is strongly suspected but laboratory services are unavailable or results will be delayed (AIII). For HIV-infected patients who do acquire Plasmodium infection, treatment recommendations are the same as for HIV-uninfected patients (AIII), and CDC posts current treatment recommendations on its website and has clinicians on call 24 hours to provide advice to clinicians on diagnosing and treating malaria.

### Emerging antimicrobial therapies for Gram-negative infections in human clinical use [^115B1zb2]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the plethora of successful case studies published, confirming efficacy remains challenging due to heterogeneity in the administration, concentration of phage, number of phages (i.e. single versus cocktail), and duration of the therapy across studies. Publication bias should also be considered with reports of unfavorable outcomes being less likely to be published than those with favorable outcomes. Indeed, a recent retrospective study of 100 consecutive PT cases revealed that clinical improvement and eradication of the targeted bacteria were reported in only 77.2% and 61.3% of infections, respectively. They also identified the importance of concurrent antibiotics for improved outcomes of the therapy. Thus, quality randomized controlled trials are vital to determine the efficacy and best practices for PT in the future.

### Assessing uncertainty in the burden of hepatitis C virus: comparison of estimated disease burden and treatment costs in the UK [^112hod9D]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2018). Low credibility.

There are other important gaps in knowledge that require further empirical study. As progression from chronic HCV infection through disease states can take decades, the life expectancy of infected individuals could be an important determinant of the cost‐effectiveness of treatment. People who inject drugs (PWID) are an important risk group for HCV infection and make up the majority of those infected with HCV in the UK. 15, 16 Treatment as Prevention (TasP) has been advocated for this group, although there are important uncertainties in its likely effectiveness, which depends upon the structure of the network of injecting partners, the coverage of testing and proportion of infected patients who are treated and cured, and the frequency of behaviour change preventing re‐infection after successful treatment. 21 Further studies of all of these are required, including analysis of potential synergistic effects 22 of combining HCV TasP with needle and syringe programmes (which reduce the infection risk of injecting) and opiate substitution therapy (which assist PWID in stopping injecting). Use of transmission dynamic models to analyse surveillance data is important in assessing population‐level impacts of interventions; 23 in the case of PWID, it is important to use models that account for the injecting network structure and dynamics. 21 In some marginalised populations, proactive "find and treat" services may be cost‐effective or even cost‐saving, as has been found for tuberculosis. 24, 25 Past history of drug injection may reduce life expectancy independent of HCV infection; if so, then this would reduce the cost‐effectiveness of treatment for chronic HCV in that patient group. However, if comorbidities associated with a history of drug injection increase rates of progression to later‐stage disease, then this would tend to increase cost‐effectiveness of treatment. Factors that should also be taken into consideration when calculating the cost‐effectiveness of treatment are alcohol consumption, gender and co‐infection, as each have been found to vary HCV disease progression rates, 26, 27 and also affect life expectancy. We recommend studies of patient health records to determine the rates of health service utilization — both primary and secondary care — by patients in different stages of disease and with different comorbidities. Importantly, actual patient pathways can be different from idealised pathways typically used in economic evaluations, and there can be considerable variation between patients (eg see Ref. 28). Finally, the impact on disease progression and health service utilization in individuals treated with direct acting antivirals (DAAs), which are highly efficacious and well‐tolerated but are also expensive, requires further study to determine how to use DAAs in a cost‐effective manner. However, if the price paid for DAAs is too high, then this damages overall population health because the money could be used in another way to obtain a greater health gain.

### Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of foot infection in persons with diabetes (IWGDF 2019 update) [^115KJ172]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has published evidence-based guidelines on the prevention and management of diabetic foot disease since 1999. This guideline is on the diagnosis and treatment of foot infection in persons with diabetes and updates the 2015 IWGDF infection guideline. On the basis of patient, intervention, comparison, outcomes (PICOs) developed by the infection committee, in conjunction with internal and external reviewers and consultants, and on systematic reviews the committee conducted on the diagnosis of infection (new) and treatment of infection (updated from 2015), we offer 27 recommendations. These cover various aspects of diagnosing soft tissue and bone infection, including the classification scheme for diagnosing infection and its severity. Of note, we have updated this scheme for the first time since we developed it 15years ago. We also review the microbiology of diabetic foot infections, including how to collect samples and to process them to identify causative pathogens. Finally, we discuss the approach to treating diabetic foot infections, including selecting appropriate empiric and definitive antimicrobial therapy for soft tissue and for bone infections, when and how to approach surgical treatment, and which adjunctive treatments we think are or are not useful for the infectious aspects of diabetic foot problems. For this version of the guideline, we also updated four tables and one figure from the 2016 guideline. We think that following the principles of diagnosing and treating diabetic foot infections outlined in this guideline can help clinicians to provide better care for these patients.

### Antibiotics for the treatment of COVID-19 [^115pqQku]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The effect of antibiotics with potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties are being investigated in clinical trials as treatment for COVID-19. The use of antibiotics follows the intention-to-treat the viral disease and not primarily to treat bacterial co-infections of individuals with COVID-19. A thorough understanding of the current evidence regarding effectiveness and safety of antibiotics as anti-viral treatments for COVID-19 based on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is required.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotics compared to each other, no treatment, standard of care alone, placebo, or any other active intervention with proven efficacy for treatment of COVID-19 outpatients and inpatients. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (including MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, medRxiv, CENTRAL), Web of Science and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 14 June 2021.

Selection Criteria

RCTs were included that compared antibiotics with each other, no treatment, standard of care alone, placebo, or another proven intervention, for treatment of people with confirmed COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, treated in the in- or outpatient settings. Co-interventions had to be the same in both study arms. We excluded studies comparing antibiotics to other pharmacological interventions with unproven efficacy.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed risk of bias of primary outcomes using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (ROB 2) for RCTs. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence for the following primary outcomes: 1. to treat inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19: mortality, clinical worsening defined as new need for intubation or death, clinical improvement defined as being discharged alive, quality of life, adverse and serious adverse events, and cardiac arrhythmias; 2. to treat outpatients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19: mortality, clinical worsening defined as hospital admission or death, clinical improvement defined as symptom resolution, quality of life, adverse and serious adverse events, and cardiac arrhythmias.

Main Results

We included 11 studies with 11,281 participants with an average age of 54 years investigating antibiotics compared to placebo, standard of care alone or another antibiotic. No study was found comparing antibiotics to an intervention with proven efficacy. All studies investigated azithromycin, two studies investigated other antibiotics compared to azithromycin. Seven studies investigated inpatients with moderate to severe COVID-19 and four investigated mild COVID-19 cases in outpatient settings. Eight studies had an open-label design, two were blinded with a placebo control, and one did not report on blinding. We identified 19 ongoing and 15 studies awaiting classification pending publication of results or clarification of inconsistencies. Of the 30 study results contributing to primary outcomes by included studies, 17 were assessed as overall low risk and 13 as some concerns of bias. Only studies investigating azithromycin reported data eligible for the prioritised primary outcomes. Azithromycin doses and treatment duration varied among included studies. Azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 compared to placebo or standard of care alone in inpatients We are very certain that azithromycin has little or no effect on all-cause mortality at day 28 compared to standard of care alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.06; 8600 participants; 4 studies; high-certainty evidence). Azithromycin probably has little or no effect on clinical worsening or death at day 28 (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03; 7311 participants; 1 study; moderate-certainty evidence), on clinical improvement at day 28 (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.11; 8172 participants; 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence), on serious adverse events during the study period (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.40; 794 participants; 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence), and cardiac arrhythmias during the study period (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.15; 7865 participants; 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard of care alone. Azithromycin may increase any adverse events slightly during the study period (RR 1.20; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.57; 355 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence) compared to standard of care alone. No study reported quality of life up to 28 days. Azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 compared to placebo or standard of care alone in outpatients Azithromycin may have little or no effect compared to placebo or standard of care alone on all-cause mortality at day 28 (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.06 to 15.69; 876 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence), on admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.56; 876 participants; 3 studies; low-certainty evidence), and on symptom resolution at day 14 (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.12; 138 participants; 1 study; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether azithromycin increases or reduces serious adverse events compared to placebo or standard of care alone (0 participants experienced serious adverse events; 454 participants; 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported on adverse events, cardiac arrhythmias during the study period or quality of life up to 28 days. Azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19 compared to any other antibiotics in inpatients and outpatients One study compared azithromycin to lincomycin in inpatients, but did not report any primary outcome. Another study compared azithromycin to clarithromycin in outpatients, but did not report any relevant outcome for this review.

Authors' Conclusions

We are certain that risk of death in hospitalised COVID-19 patients is not reduced by treatment with azithromycin after 28 days. Further, based on moderate-certainty evidence, patients in the inpatient setting with moderate and severe disease probably do not benefit from azithromycin used as potential antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment for COVID-19 regarding clinical worsening or improvement. For the outpatient setting, there is currently low-certainty evidence that azithromycin may have no beneficial effect for COVID-19 individuals. There is no evidence from RCTs available for other antibiotics as antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment of COVID-19. With accordance to the living approach of this review, we will continually update our search and include eligible trials to fill this evidence gap. However, in relation to the evidence for azithromycin and in the context of antimicrobial resistance, antibiotics should not be used for treatment of COVID-19 outside well-designed RCTs.

HIV-associated malaria treatment failure — risk and management — is addressed as follows: HIV-infected individuals are at increased risk of malaria treatment failure; management of treatment failure is the same in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients except for considerations about drug interactions between antiretroviral therapy and antimalarial drugs; and drug-resistant malaria and possible concomitant infections should be considered in HIV-infected patients whose malaria fails to respond to therapy.

### Treatment of Mycobacterium abscessus infection [^114JLSi5]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Mycobacterium abscessus infections are challenging to treat because multidrug resistance necessitates prolonged intravenous (IV) therapy and side effects are perceived to be common. For the best chance of pulmonary disease cure, guidelines from the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA) recommend multidrug macrolide-based therapy based on susceptibility testing results and surgical resection. However, these guidelines also state that there are no drug combinations with proven efficacy. Similarly for extrapulmonary disease, macrolide-based treatment regimens based on susceptibility testing results are recommended. Inducible macrolide resistance in many strains of M. abscessus further complicates treatment. Given the lack of evidence-based therapies, we hypothesized that treatment regimens have no clear pattern and that medication changes and toxicities occur frequently.

Recurrent skin abscesses — A recurrent abscess at a site of previous infection should prompt a search for local causes such as a pilonidal cyst, hidradenitis suppurativa, or foreign material (strong, moderate). Recurrent abscesses should be drained and cultured early in the course of infection (strong, moderate). After obtaining cultures of recurrent abscess, treat with a 5- to 10-day course of an antibiotic active against the pathogen isolated (weak, low). Consider a 5-day decolonization regimen twice daily of intranasal mupirocin, daily chlorhexidine washes, and daily decontamination of personal items such as towels, sheets, and clothes for recurrent S. aureus infection (weak, low). Adult patients should be evaluated for neutrophil disorders if recurrent abscesses began in early childhood (strong, moderate).

Erysipeloid — Beta-lactam therapy is recommended with specified dosing and duration. Penicillin (500 mg qid) or amoxicillin (500 mg 3 times daily [tid]) for 7–10 days is recommended for treatment of erysipeloid (strong, high).

Table 4 — empirical antibiotic therapy according to clinical presentation and microbiological data aligns infection severity and risk factors with likely pathogens and candidate agents. For mild infection with no complicating factors targeting gram‑positive cocci (GPC), potential regimens include semisynthetic penicillinase‑resistant penicillin (cloxacillin) or 1st generation cephalosporins (cephalexin). For mild infection with β‑lactam allergy or intolerance (GPC), options include clindamycin, fluoroquinolone (levo/moxi‑floxacin), trimethoprim‑sulfamethoxazole, or doxycycline. For moderate or severe infection without complicating factors (GPC ± GNR), options include β‑lactam; β‑lactamase inhibitor regimens (amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam), 2nd or 3rd generation cephalosporins (cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone), or group 1 carbapenem (ertapenem). For moderate or severe infection with MRSA risk factors, the table states to "consider adding, or substituting with" glycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin), linezolid, daptomycin, fusidic acid, trimethoprim‑sulfamethoxazole, or doxycycline. Footnotes specify practical use: antibiotics enclosed in boxes are cited as examples; "where more than one agent is listed, only one of them should be prescribed unless otherwise indicated"; "oral antibiotic agents should generally not be used for severe infections, except as a follow‑on (switch) after initial parenteral therapy"; and clinicians should "consider modifying doses or agents selected for patients with comorbidities such as azotaemia, liver dysfunction, and obesity".

Cellulitis — local care and disposition state that elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower-extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate), and hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).
