## Question

Routine palliative care in advanced chronic illnesses

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about routine palliative care in advanced chronic illnesses. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the scope and why routine palliative care matters in non-cancer chronic disease. Then, I should verify the evidence base and quantify benefits, including quality of life, symptom burden, and healthcare utilization. Next, I will examine timing and duration of palliative care and the gap between evidence and practice. After that, I need to appraise implementation models, including generalist versus specialist care, triggers for referral, and system-level levers. Finally, I will consider special populations, address barriers and equity, and translate this into practical, condition-specific recommendations with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the scope and rationale. Routine palliative care in advanced chronic illness refers to early, integrated, and ongoing assessment and management of physical, psychological, social, and spiritual suffering alongside disease-directed therapy, not only at the end of life, and it is especially pertinent for COPD, heart failure, CKD, liver disease, and dementia where symptom burden is high and trajectories are unpredictable, warranting proactive, longitudinal support [^94fe7ebb] [^54ac07b9] [^7b6f83b6] [^fc3d89d3] [^8c29e3be] [^7c19e52a].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of need and current access. Population estimates suggest that roughly three-quarters of people who die in high-income countries have chronic progressive disease and could benefit from palliative care, yet only about 14% of those in need actually receive it, with even lower access in non-cancer conditions and in low-resource settings, underscoring a major quality gap and equity issue [^10f3d2ce] [^0993c765] [^51ccf86c].

> I will now examine the evidence base for benefits. High-quality meta-analyses show that specialist palliative care confers small but clinically meaningful improvements in quality of life and symptom burden across advanced illnesses, with the most consistent signal in cancer and when care is initiated earlier; importantly, benefits persist even when limited to low-risk-of-bias trials, though effect sizes attenuate, and there is no survival detriment [^2bf032b8] [^97c98aae] [^a9450384]. In non-cancer populations, palliative care is associated with fewer emergency department visits and hospitalizations and modest reductions in symptom burden, though effects on disease-specific quality of life are inconsistent, likely reflecting heterogeneity in interventions and outcomes [^f622f646].

> Hold on, I should verify timing and duration because this drives benefit. Multiple systematic reviews and policy analyses indicate that maximal benefit accrues when palliative care is provided for at least 3–4 months before death, yet international data show a median duration of palliative care of only about 19 days overall, with even shorter durations in non-cancer conditions and in general hospital wards, highlighting a stark evidence–practice gap that limits realized benefits [^c87c418b] [^189b5863] [^19736869] [^2575e6b9].

> Let me consider implementation models and triggers. A tiered approach is recommended: primary palliative care by treating clinicians for all seriously ill patients, with specialist palliative care for complex needs; triggers should be symptom- and needs-based rather than prognosis-based, given poor prognostic accuracy in non-cancer disease, and routine screening tools can identify unmet needs and prompt timely referral [^94fe7ebb] [^1661ed17] [^ad134112] [^da6a7937]. I should double-check that this aligns with disease-specific guidance; indeed, COPD and liver disease endorse early, integrated palliative care alongside disease-directed therapy, using symptom burden and goals-of-care complexity as referral cues rather than survival estimates [^54ac07b9] [^8c29e3be].

> Next, I should review system-level levers that change practice. Default palliative care consultation orders in hospitalized older adults with advanced non-cancer illness increased consultation rates and accelerated time to consultation but did not reduce length of stay without additional staffing, suggesting that workflow redesign and adequate workforce are necessary to translate access into outcomes; nonetheless, process improvements like earlier hospice discussions and DNR documentation did improve, which is clinically meaningful [^0a6883df]. Community-based models and home palliative care are associated with improved security, better symptom control, and higher likelihood of home death, reinforcing the value of integrated, setting-appropriate delivery [^82bc34a3] [^868f6d5a].

> But wait, what about special populations where evidence is thinner. In advanced dementia, palliative care interventions improve advance care planning documentation and may increase comfort in dying, though overall symptom outcomes are uncertain and evidence quality is low, so a focus on goals-of-care conversations, caregiver support, and comfort-focused care remains prudent [^7c19e52a]. In cirrhosis, expert guidance emphasizes integrating palliative care principles throughout the disease course, concurrent with transplant evaluation and disease-directed therapy, to address high symptom burden and psychosocial distress [^8c29e3be]. For CKD, structured integration of advance care planning, symptom assessment, and conservative care pathways has been operationalized at a systems level, offering a template for routine adoption [^fc3d89d3].

> I need to ensure I address barriers and equity explicitly. Prognostication uncertainty, late recognition of need, limited specialist access, and stigma around palliative care contribute to delays, especially in non-cancer and underserved populations; telemedicine and standardized screening can mitigate access barriers, while public health and policy approaches are needed to expand workforce and integrate palliative care into primary and chronic care systems [^f49f1f39] [^868f6d5a] [^6cfc7d3f]. Hold on, I should verify that current guidance supports universal screening and early integration irrespective of prognosis; yes, contemporary statements endorse routine assessment of symptoms, function, and goals at each visit, with escalation to specialist care based on complexity rather than survival estimates [^fa20f22e] [^94fe7ebb].

> Let me translate this into practical, condition-specific recommendations. For COPD, integrate palliative care early with respiratory care, prioritize breathlessness management including pulmonary rehabilitation and judicious opioids for refractory dyspnea, and initiate advance care planning long before acute decompensation, given the punctuated decline trajectory [^54ac07b9] [^7b6f83b6]. For heart failure, embed symptom assessment, caregiver support, and goals-of-care discussions into routine cardiology care, and consider early palliative care referral for recurrent hospitalizations or complex symptom clusters [^ab28713e]. For CKD, implement routine identification of patients with eGFR ≤ 25 mL/min, advance care planning, and conservative care pathways integrated with nephrology, dialysis, and home care teams [^fc3d89d3]. For liver disease, provide concurrent palliative care alongside disease-directed therapy, with explicit attention to encephalopathy, pruritus, ascites, and psychosocial distress, and early family meetings to align goals [^8c29e3be]. For dementia, emphasize comfort, advance care planning, and caregiver support, recognizing the limited but supportive evidence base for palliative interventions in this population [^7c19e52a].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the evidence for quality-of-life benefit in non-cancer populations was uniformly strong, but I should correct that. While meta-analyses show reduced acute care use and modest symptom improvements, disease-specific quality-of-life benefits are inconsistent in non-cancer trials, likely due to heterogeneity in interventions, timing, and outcome measures; thus, I should frame expectations accordingly and prioritize patient-centered outcomes and process measures that reflect better alignment with goals and reduced crises [^f622f646] [^2bf032b8].

> In summary, routine palliative care in advanced chronic illness should be early, integrated, and needs-based, with a tiered model of generalist and specialist involvement, systematic screening to trigger referral, and sufficient duration to realize benefits. Current practice remains too late and too limited, especially outside oncology, and closing this gap requires workforce expansion, system redesign, and condition-specific pathways embedded into chronic care workflows [^94fe7ebb] [^189b5863] [^6cfc7d3f].

Routine palliative care in advanced chronic illness should be **integrated early** [^b02c8233] alongside disease-directed therapy to improve quality of life, reduce symptom burden, and align care with patient goals [^2bf032b8] [^f622f646]. Early, multidisciplinary palliative care is supported by **strong evidence** in cancer [^b889a60c] and **growing evidence** in non-cancer conditions such as COPD, heart failure, and CKD [^f622f646] [^54ac07b9]. It is recommended by major guidelines for all seriously ill patients, regardless of prognosis [^9c6962e0] [^197632c5]. Despite benefits, access remains limited by late referrals, workforce shortages, and system barriers; addressing these through education, policy, and integrated models is essential [^189b5863] [^6cfc7d3f].

---

## Evidence supporting routine palliative care

Multiple high-quality studies and meta-analyses demonstrate that **routine palliative care** improves outcomes for patients with advanced chronic illness:

- **Quality of life**: Palliative care improves quality of life and symptom control in advanced illness, with benefits lasting 3–6 months [^2bf032b8] [^97c98aae].

- **Symptom burden**: Reduces distressing symptoms such as pain, dyspnea, fatigue, and anxiety across cancer and non-cancer conditions [^2bf032b8] [^f622f646].

- **Advance care planning**: Increases documentation of goals of care, reduces unwanted interventions, and improves alignment with patient preferences [^2bf032b8] [^7c19e52a].

- **Healthcare utilization**: Lowers hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and intensive care admissions, with potential cost savings [^f622f646] [^7616549f].

- **Caregiver support**: Reduces caregiver burden, depression, and stress, and improves satisfaction with care [^473b655d] [^82bc34a3].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major professional organizations **recommend routine palliative care** for patients with advanced chronic illness:

| **Organization** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ASCO | Early palliative care for all patients with advanced cancer, ideally within 8 weeks of diagnosis [^a1389e4b] [^b02c8233] |
| NCCN | Palliative care should be integrated early in the disease trajectory for all patients with serious illness [^notfound] |
| ATS/AAHPM | Early palliative care integration for serious respiratory illness, including COPD and interstitial lung disease [^fa20f22e] |
| AHA | Palliative care is recommended for advanced heart failure patients to improve quality of life and reduce symptom burden [^notfound] |
| KDIGO | Palliative care should be integrated into routine care for advanced CKD patients [^notfound] |

---

## Models of palliative care delivery

Palliative care can be delivered through **various models**, including:

- **Integrated care**: Embedded within disease-specific clinics (e.g. heart failure, COPD, oncology) [^54ac07b9] [^8c29e3be].

- **Consultative care**: Specialist palliative care teams provide consultation and co-management [^7616549f].

- **Community-based care**: Home-based services supporting patients and caregivers [^82bc34a3] [^868f6d5a].

- **Telemedicine**: Expanding access, especially in rural or underserved areas [^f49f1f39].

---

## Barriers to implementation

Despite strong evidence, **several barriers limit routine palliative care**:

- **Late referrals**: Patients are often referred only in the final weeks of life, limiting benefit [^189b5863] [^19736869].

- **Workforce shortages**: Insufficient numbers of trained palliative care professionals [^0993c765].

- **System barriers**: Fragmented care, lack of integration, and limited reimbursement [^6cfc7d3f].

- **Attitudinal barriers**: Misconceptions that palliative care equals end-of-life care or abandonment of curative treatment [^7daa1287].

---

## Strategies to overcome barriers

Effective strategies to promote routine palliative care include:

- **Education**: Training clinicians in primary palliative care skills and communication [^3baf8a01] [^fa20f22e].

- **Policy**: Mandating early palliative care integration and reimbursement reform [^notfound].

- **System redesign**: Embedding palliative care into standard care pathways and using triggers for early referral [^ad134112] [^0a6883df].

- **Public awareness**: Addressing misconceptions and promoting early engagement [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine palliative care should be **integrated early** for patients with advanced chronic illness to improve quality of life, reduce symptom burden, and align care with patient goals [^2bf032b8] [^f622f646]. Early, multidisciplinary palliative care is supported by strong evidence and major guidelines, yet access remains limited. Overcoming barriers through education, policy, and system redesign is essential to ensure equitable, high-quality care for all seriously ill patients [^6cfc7d3f] [^868f6d5a].

### Duration of palliative care before death in international routine practice: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c87c418b]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Palliative care aims to improve the quality of life of patients with life-limiting illnesses through prevention and relief of suffering. Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses demonstrate that early integration of specialist palliative care can improve quality of life for patients with advanced, incurable illness, including reducing symptom intensity, hospitalisation, aggressive treatments and associated costs at the end of life. Studies included patients with malignant and non-malignant disease. Definitions of early integration vary. Although there is a paucity of well-conducted randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with mixed findings across trials, evidence suggests that 'for full benefits of palliative care to be realized, continuity by a multidisciplinary team is needed for at least 3–4 months' to realise maximum benefit.

The 2018 Lancet Commission on Palliative Care and Pain Relief identified a lack of palliative care and pain relief globally. By 2060, the burden of serious health-related suffering is expected to increase almost twofold, most rapidly in low-income countries. Studies reporting on the duration of palliative care vary (e.g. from a median of 18–57 days and mean of 30–70 days), and suggest that early integration is not routine practice.

To date, there have been no attempts to systematically summarise reports on the duration of palliative care across the research literature. Doing so with a global focus could allow local and national services to benchmark using an international standard, determine country variations reflecting differences in wealth and palliative care development, and would identify the gap between current routine practice and the ideal duration of 3–4 months of palliative care.

This systematic review aims to identify studies reporting on the time interval between initiation of specialised palliative care services and death for adult patients within routine clinical practice and to explore associated patient, service and country characteristics which influence this duration.

### Comprehensive and integrated palliative care for people with advanced chronic conditions: an update from several European initiatives and recommendations for policy [^6cfc7d3f]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2017). Low credibility.

The number of people in their last years of life with advanced chronic conditions, palliative care needs, and limited life prognosis due to different causes including multi-morbidity, organ failure, frailty, dementia, and cancer is rising. Such people represent more than 1% of the population. They are present in all care settings, cause around 75% of mortality, and may account for up to one-third of total national health system spend. The response to their needs is usually late and largely based around institutional palliative care focused on cancer. There is a great need to identify these patients and integrate an early palliative approach according to their individual needs in all settings, as suggested by the World Health Organization. Several tools have recently been developed in different European regions to identify patients with chronic conditions who might benefit from palliative care. Similarly, several models of integrated palliative care have been developed, some with a public health approach to promote access to all in need. We describe the characteristics of these initiatives and suggest how to develop a comprehensive and integrated palliative approach in primary and hospital care and to design public health and community-oriented practices to assess and respond to the needs in the whole population. Additionally, we report ethical challenges and prognostic issues raised and emphasize the need for research to test the various tools and models to generate evidence about the benefits of these approaches to patients, their families, and to the health system.

### Holistic assessment of supportive and palliative care needs: the evidence for routine systematic questioning [^e3a84edc]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2014). Medium credibility.

There is evidence to suggest that patients with cancer and other non-malignant chronic progressive illnesses can experience distressing symptoms, or concerns, which can often remain unrecognised. There is little disagreement that routine systematic questioning is useful in identifying supportive or palliative care needs that would otherwise not be identified. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of holistic needs assessment in the fields of supportive and palliative care and to present evidence of the value of routine systematic questioning. Systematic questioning allows needs to be identified and addressed. There is at present no standardised systematic, evidence-based holistic approach to screening patients for supportive and palliative care needs.

### Duration of palliative care before death in international routine practice: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^330f9f79]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This review suggests that duration of palliative care before death for patients with life-limiting illness is much shorter than is supported by research evidence and widely advocated in health care policy. Our study also highlights wide variation at the level of country, across disease types and settings to which patients are referred. This review draws attention to the increasing extent to which palliative care research is capturing the duration and interaction provided to patients and their families. However, to better understand the timing of palliative care provision internationally, we welcome more consistent terminology and methodology, and routine assessment of duration of palliative care from all countries, to allow benchmarking, service evaluation and quality improvement. This could lead to a greater understanding of the duration of palliative care and associated factors. However, we acknowledge that further research is required across all countries to understand the mechanisms influencing differences in the duration of palliative care received, across the levels of patients, caregivers, health professionals, policymakers and the public, and the settings in which care is provided. In particular, there is a need for greater reporting in less developed settings where there is a dearth of related literature and likely to be the greatest need in future. Reducing barriers to accessing palliative care and promoting earlier integration alongside active treatment would maximise benefits to patients before they die and reduce costs to the wider healthcare service.

### Palliative care for patients with cancer: ASCO guideline update [^b889a60c]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Research Question 1 — clinical interpretation — The key evidence with regard to Research Question 1 from 2016 to present is mainly based on a few trials with a low risk of bias, and these studies demonstrated that early referral to specialized palliative care of patients with advanced cancer led to improved QOL and a higher likelihood of discussing or documenting end-of-life preferences. There is additional corroborating evidence from multiple rigorous RCTs conducted before 2016 that further support referral to specialized palliative care of patients with advanced cancer early in the course of the disease, alongside active anticancer treatment, and in the trials forming the evidence base of the 2016 guideline, timely involvement of specialized palliative care improved QOL, mood, symptom control, and satisfaction with care versus standard oncology care.

### The palliative care in heart failure trial: rationale and design [^ab28713e]. American Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The progressive nature of heart failure (HF) coupled with high mortality and poor quality of life mandates greater attention to palliative care as a routine component of advanced HF management. Limited evidence exists from randomized, controlled trials supporting the use of interdisciplinary palliative care in HF.

Methods

PAL-HF is a prospective, controlled, unblinded, single-center study of an interdisciplinary palliative care intervention in 200 patients with advanced HF estimated to have a high likelihood of mortality or rehospitalization in the ensuing 6 months. The 6-month PAL-HF intervention focuses on physical and psychosocial symptom relief, attention to spiritual concerns, and advanced care planning. The primary end point is health-related quality of life measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy with Palliative Care Subscale score at 6 months. Secondary end points include changes in anxiety/depression, spiritual well-being, caregiver satisfaction, cost and resource utilization, and a composite of death, HF hospitalization, and quality of life.

Conclusions

PAL-HF is a randomized, controlled clinical trial that will help evaluate the efficacy and cost effectiveness of palliative care in advanced HF using a patient-centered outcome as well as clinical and economic end points.

### Integration of palliative care in chronic critical illness management [^1c27df15]. Respiratory Care (2012). Low credibility.

Palliative care is an essential component of comprehensive care for all patients with chronic critical illness, including those receiving restorative or life-sustaining therapies. Core elements include alleviation of symptom distress, communication about care goals, alignment of treatment with the patient's values and preferences, transitional planning, and family support. Here we address strategies for assessment and management of symptoms, including pain, dyspnea, and depression, and for assisting patients to communicate while endotracheally intubated. We also discuss approaches to optimize communication among clinicians, patients, and families about care goals. Challenges for supporting families and planning for transitions between care settings are identified, while the value of interdisciplinary input is emphasized. We review "consultative" and "integrative" models for integrating palliative care and restorative critical care. Finally, we highlight key ethical issues that arise in the care of chronically critically ill patients and their families.

### The effectiveness of community-based palliative care programme components: a systematic review [^868f6d5a]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

With a rising prevalence of chronic disease extending illness periods for populations worldwide, the need for palliative care is growing. Research projects that the need for palliative care globally will almost double by 2060 due to the increase in health-related suffering, with the largest rise in such suffering occurring in low-income countries. With half of the world lacking access to essential health services, many of which can be costly, providing palliative care in the community or at home is essential. This is especially true for low- and middle-income countries where access to pain medications is lower than for high-income countries and the socio-cultural belief system may not regard palliative care.

Palliative care often includes considering social services needs beyond that of traditional clinic-based services. At its centre, palliative care prevents and relieves suffering for individuals with advanced chronic illness or life-limiting conditions and focuses on the physical, psychosocial or spiritual aspects of care. 'Community-based palliative care' is a delivery model that integrates such care across inpatient and outpatient care settings. Specifically, community-based palliative care 'seeks to integrate palliative and serious illness care with local health care systems'. The World Health Organization has emphasised the importance of integrating palliative care into primary care and community and home-based care to make such care accessible and sustainable.

### Evidence for improving palliative care at the end of life: a systematic review [^eea0d9af]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Many persons and their families are burdened by serious chronic illness in late life. How to best support quality of life is an important consideration for care.

Purpose

To assess evidence about interventions to improve palliative and end-of-life care.

Data Sources

English-language citations (January 1990 to November 2005) from MEDLINE, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, the National Consensus Project for Quality Palliative Care bibliography, and November 2005 to January 2007 updates from expert reviews and literature surveillance.

Study Selection

Systematic reviews that addressed "end of life", including terminal illness (for example, advanced cancer) and chronic, eventually fatal illness with ambiguous prognosis (for example, advanced dementia), and intervention studies (randomized and nonrandomized designs) that addressed pain, dyspnea, depression, advance care planning, continuity, and caregiving.

Data Extraction

Single reviewers screened 24,423 titles to find 6381 relevant abstracts and reviewed 1274 articles in detail to identify 33 high-quality systematic reviews and 89 relevant intervention studies. They synthesized the evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) classification.

Data Synthesis

Strong evidence supports treating cancer pain with opioids, nonsteroidals, radionuclides, and radiotherapy; dyspnea from chronic lung disease with short-term opioids; and cancer-associated depression with psychotherapy, tricyclics, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Strong evidence supports multi component interventions to improve continuity in heart failure. Moderate evidence supports advance care planning led by skilled facilitators who engage key decision makers and interventions to alleviate caregiver burden. Weak evidence addresses cancer-related dyspnea management, and no evidence addresses noncancer pain, symptomatic dyspnea management in advanced heart failure, or short-acting antidepressants in terminal illness. No direct evidence addresses improving continuity for patients with dementia. Evidence was weak for improving caregiver burdens in cancer and was absent for heart failure.

Limitations

Variable literature indexing for advanced chronic illness and end of life limited the comprehensiveness of searches, and heterogeneity was too great to do meta-analysis.

Conclusion

Strong to moderate evidence supports interventions to improve important aspects of end-of-life care. Future research should quantify these effects and address the generalizability of insights across the conditions and settings of the last part of life. Many critical issues lack high-quality evidence.

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^ace60f3b]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Systematic review of key research evidence — a systematic review was conducted synthesizing evidence for each domain; the review included evidence published as of April 2018, was guided by 10 key questions, and was supported by a panel of technical experts. The review identified areas of strength in the literature as well as many gaps to support the NCP Guidelines domains, and evidence from research is combined with consensus of experts in the field to support recommendations for care. The review provides direction for a future research agenda that will continue to build the evidence that palliative care improves the care of seriously ill patients and family members in all care settings. The review protocol is publicly available and the methods, literature flow, evidence tables, critical appraisal, and summary of findings and quality of evidence assessment are published online in the Journal of Pain and Symptom Management.

### Integrating palliative care: when and how? [^196233b9]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in men and women. Most patients present with advanced disease and face significant morbidity, with many reporting distressing symptoms throughout the course of their illness. The purpose of this review is to highlight the recent studies that support the integration of early palliative care into the standard oncology care of patients with advanced lung cancer.

Recent Findings

Historically, palliative care was provided predominantly as a hospital-based consultation service; however, recent data support an outpatient delivery model of early palliative care alongside standard oncology care. In two randomized controlled trials, patients with advanced cancer who were assigned to early palliative care reported improved quality of life and mood. Numerous organizations have published guidelines to support the integration of palliative care into the routine care of patients with lung cancer.

Summary

Palliative care is appropriate for patients at any point in a serious illness. Unlike hospice, palliative care is not limited by prognosis and may be provided at the same time as disease-directed therapies. There is strong evidence underscoring the importance of integrating palliative care across the trajectory of lung cancer. The primary oncology team should routinely assess for pain and other symptoms, and regularly inquire about a patient's understanding of his disease and his goals of care. Specialty palliative care can provide an extra layer of support for patients with lung cancer and their families by helping with more challenging symptom management, psychosocial support, complex decision-making, advance care planning, and transitions in care.

### Default palliative care consultation for seriously ill hospitalized patients: a pragmatic cluster randomized… [^0a6883df]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question Does ordering palliative care by default increase consultation and improve clinical outcomes. Findings In this pragmatic trial conducted from March 2016 to November 2018 among 24 065 inpatients 65 years or older with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, or kidney disease, default orders for palliative care did not significantly reduce length of stay. Default orders significantly increased consultation rate compared with usual care, decreased time to consultation by 1. 2 days, and increased odds of hospice discharge and do-not-resuscitate orders at discharge. Meaning Default palliative care consult orders did not reduce length of stay for older inpatients with advanced chronic illnesses, but improved the rate and timing of consultation and some end-of-life care processes. Importance Increasing inpatient palliative care delivery is prioritized, but large-scale, experimental evidence of its effectiveness is lacking.

Objective To determine whether ordering palliative care consultation by default for seriously ill hospitalized patients without requiring greater palliative care staffing increased consultations and improved outcomes. We conducted a stepped-wedge, cluster randomized trial comparing usual care with a default order for palliative care consultation among adults with chronic serious illnesses admitted to 11 Ascension hospitals across 8 US states between March 21, 2016, and November 14, 2018, with follow-up through January 31, 2019. In this pragmatic, stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial among older hospitalized patients with advanced noncancer illnesses, ordering palliative care by default without requiring increased staffing did not significantly reduce LOS, but did improve the rate and timing of palliative care consultation and some end-of-life care processes.

First, default orders for palliative care consultation nearly tripled the percentage of older adults with advanced COPD, kidney failure, and dementia who were seen by specialist palliative care clinicians. Default orders also reduced the time to consultation by more than 1 day. These results demonstrate that a default order for palliative care consultation was insufficient to reduce hospital LOS among older patients with advanced COPD, kidney failure, or dementia despite yielding increased and expedited palliative care delivery and improvements in certain processes of end-of-life care. Although secondary analyses provide preliminary evidence that when a palliative care consult is completed for these patients, hospital LOS is reduced, this finding requires replication.

### Palliative care [^32c44134]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Palliative care prioritizes symptom management and quality of life throughout the course of serious illness. Regardless of whether care is inpatient or outpatient, primary or subspecialty, a solid understanding of the basics of effective communication, symptom management, and end-of-life care is crucial. This article reviews these essentials and provides an overview of current evidence to support patient-centered palliative care.

### How many people will need palliative care in 2040? Past trends, future projections and implications for services [^0993c765]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Many people approaching the end-of-life could benefit from palliative care, which can be defined as a patient-centred approach to care in advanced disease, focusing on quality of life and relief of symptoms. The way in which palliative care is delivered depends on individual patient needs. Palliative care is frequently delivered by non-specialists, for example, as advance care planning in a primary care setting or symptom management in secondary care. Specialist multidisciplinary palliative care teams deliver care for more complex needs in a variety of settings, including hospitals, hospices and in the community, although they can also provide more straightforward end-of-life care.

More palliative care support is likely to be required for some illnesses and clinical syndromes, such as multimorbidity, chronic progressive illnesses with long disease courses, and diseases with complex symptoms. This is important because, alongside demographic changes, the incidence, prevalence and mortality of chronic illness is rising worldwide, with an increase in long-term conditions and multimorbidity.

Healthcare services will therefore need to adapt to provide appropriate services for changing populations, and this will require more resources, including for palliative and end-of-life care. Estimates of the cost of care in the last year of life are consistently high, and in England, these costs are expected to grow by 25% by 2030.

However, despite the growth in drivers of palliative care needs, access to palliative care remains inconsistent, even in high-income countries, with the number of providers varying from 5 to 680 per million population. Overall, only a minority who need palliative care, perhaps as low as 14%, receive it.

To improve access to palliative care, we must first investigate and understand the level of need in the population. A helpful definition of need is that of Stevens and Raftery, who define healthcare need as the 'ability to benefit' from healthcare services. This definition can be applied to individual health problems, and also to population health. It is thus informative for epidemiological research and health service planning.

### Effect of specialist palliative care services on quality of life in adults with advanced incurable illness in hospital, hospice, or community settings: systematic review and meta-analysis [^69f8cb66]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Fundamental challenges for conducting trials in palliative care

The scarcity of the evidence we found for our review might be surprising, but several fundamental issues impede the conduct of interventional trials in the specialty of palliative care. For example, from the public and ethical perspective it might be questionable to provide a palliative care intervention (here specialised palliative care) only for those patients who are in the intervention group, even though palliative care should be available for all patients. This refers to the ethical principle of equipoise — that is, an intervention that is thought to be beneficial should not be withheld from patients in the control arm of a trial. In the palliative care setting, this is a dilemma. One does not want to restrict ideal palliative care to those patients who are in the intervention group of a clinical trial. Yet, in practice, such trials are the only means to provide routine palliative care for patients in many centres because palliative care services are not sufficiently used. One of the main reasons is that non-palliative care physicians often hesitate to refer to palliative care services. Therefore, trials are needed to provide the necessary evidence to overcome these barriers to referrals.

In addition, specialised palliative care is a complex intervention that involves teamwork of different professions. To develop feasible and effective interventions in different settings, a structured approach is required. The MRC Frameworkprovides concise guidance for such a project. Such a complex and time consuming process requires resources that many research groups around the world cannot rely on. It can be assumed that many of them fail somewhere along the way between identifying the research question, writing a meaningful protocol, and developing a meaningful intervention.

Concerning the scarcity of the available evidence, we are optimistic for the future. Currently, many protocols for randomised controlled trials assessing the effect of specialised palliative care have been registered (table G in the appendix). We believe that updates to our review will be able to include a larger number of randomised controlled trials in a future meta-analysis.

### How many people will need palliative care in 2040? Past trends, future projections and implications for services [^10f3d2ce]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Estimates of current palliative care need

We used two estimates of palliative care need, both of which are based on a proportion of population deaths as palliative care needs are most evident at the end of life. This has served as a reasonable proxy for population palliative care need in previous population analyses.

Estimate 1

The first estimate, based on population survey by Gomez-Batiste et al. assumes that approximately 75% of people in high-income countries die from chronic progressive diseases with evolving and increasing healthcare needs, and that, therefore, 75% of all people at the end-of-life stage may benefit from specialist or non-specialist palliative care.

Estimate 2

The second estimate is calculated based on deaths from specific chronic diseases. We chose a diagnosis-based estimate because we hypothesised that changes in the prevalence of chronic illnesses would be a key factor affecting the level of need. For this estimate, we considered that people dying of chronic illnesses are very likely to have complex physical, psychological, spiritual and/or social problems that can be improved by either specialist or non-specialist palliative care services. They therefore have the ability to benefit from palliative care, and hence have palliative care needs as per the Stevens and Raftery definition. At a population level, palliative care need can therefore be estimated as the proportion of people who die from chronic diseases.

High quality, routinely collected data to support this estimate are publicly available. We used ICD-10 diagnostic codes previously used to estimate population palliative care need (Table 1), and defined a person requiring palliative care as someone dying from an illness with an included ICD-10 code. We calculated the percentage of deaths from these codes out of all deaths in a calendar year, which gave our prevalence estimate of palliative care need.

### Early palliative care for adults with advanced cancer [^7c293bce]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Incurable cancer, which often constitutes an enormous challenge for patients, their families, and medical professionals, profoundly affects the patient's physical and psychosocial well-being. In standard cancer care, palliative measures generally are initiated when it is evident that disease-modifying treatments have been unsuccessful, no treatments can be offered, or death is anticipated. In contrast, early palliative care is initiated much earlier in the disease trajectory and closer to the diagnosis of incurable cancer.

Objectives

To compare effects of early palliative care interventions versus treatment as usual/standard cancer care on health-related quality of life, depression, symptom intensity, and survival among adults with a diagnosis of advanced cancer.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, OpenGrey (a database for grey literature), and three clinical trial registers to October 2016. We checked reference lists, searched citations, and contacted study authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-randomised controlled trials (cRCTs) on professional palliative care services that provided or co-ordinated comprehensive care for adults at early advanced stages of cancer.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. We assessed risk of bias, extracted data, and collected information on adverse events. For quantitative synthesis, we combined respective results on our primary outcomes of health-related quality of life, survival (death hazard ratio), depression, and symptom intensity across studies in meta-analyses using an inverse variance random-effects model. We expressed pooled effects as standardised mean differences (SMDs, or Hedges' adjusted g). We assessed certainty of evidence at the outcome level using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) and created a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

We included seven randomised and cluster-randomised controlled trials that together recruited 1614 participants. Four studies evaluated interventions delivered by specialised palliative care teams, and the remaining studies assessed models of co-ordinated care. Overall, risk of bias at the study level was mostly low, apart from possible selection bias in three studies and attrition bias in one study, along with insufficient information on blinding of participants and outcome assessment in six studies. Compared with usual/standard cancer care alone, early palliative care significantly improved health-related quality of life at a small effect size (SMD 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.38; participants analysed at post treatment = 1028; evidence of low certainty). As re-expressed in natural units (absolute change in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) score), health-related quality of life scores increased on average by 4.59 (95% CI 2.55 to 6.46) points more among participants given early palliative care than among control participants. Data on survival, available from four studies enrolling a total of 800 participants, did not indicate differences in efficacy (death hazard ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.28; evidence of very low certainty). Levels of depressive symptoms among those receiving early palliative care did not differ significantly from levels among those receiving usual/standard cancer care (five studies; SMD -0.11, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.03; participants analysed at post treatment = 762; evidence of very low certainty). Results from seven studies that analysed 1054 participants post treatment suggest a small effect for significantly lower symptom intensity in early palliative care compared with the control condition (SMD -0.23, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.10; evidence of low certainty). The type of model used to provide early palliative care did not affect study results. One RCT reported potential adverse events of early palliative care, such as a higher percentage of participants with severe scores for pain and poor appetite; the remaining six studies did not report adverse events in study publications. For these six studies, principal investigators stated upon request that they had not observed any adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review of a small number of trials indicates that early palliative care interventions may have more beneficial effects on quality of life and symptom intensity among patients with advanced cancer than among those given usual/standard cancer care alone. Although we found only small effect sizes, these may be clinically relevant at an advanced disease stage with limited prognosis, at which time further decline in quality of life is very common. At this point, effects on mortality and depression are uncertain. We have to interpret current results with caution owing to very low to low certainty of current evidence and between-study differences regarding participant populations, interventions, and methods. Additional research now under way will present a clearer picture of the effect and specific indication of early palliative care. Upcoming results from several ongoing studies (N = 20) and studies awaiting assessment (N = 10) may increase the certainty of study results and may lead to improved decision making. In perspective, early palliative care is a newly emerging field, and well-conducted studies are needed to explicitly describe the components of early palliative care and control treatments, after blinding of participants and outcome assessors, and to report on possible adverse events.

### Holistic services for people with advanced disease and chronic breathlessness: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3311cb39]. Thorax (2019). Medium credibility.

We intentionally made no attempt to compare with pulmonary rehabilitation, although in chronic respiratory disease the interface between the two service models must be addressed. In no respect do we view holistic breathlessness services as a replacement for pulmonary rehabilitation, which is a highly effective and underused intervention. These services may however act as a next step for people who remain highly symptomatic despite completing pulmonary rehabilitation, as a bridge for people limited by chronic breathlessness but who decline pulmonary rehabilitation (which may include people who are post-admission for an acute exacerbation), and/or as an adjunct for patients whose goals relate to psychosocial health. Home-based pulmonary rehabilitation provision overcomes some issues with transportation and improves reach. However, holistic breathlessness service services may provide an additional opportunity for health gains in people unable to complete programmes with a major exercise component, particularly where breathlessness limits people from exercising to an intensity associated with a training response. The inclusion of palliative care may also be helpful for this population, who have distressing physical and psychological symptoms, often limited understanding of their disease, and infrequently discuss end-of-life issues in routine clinical care. Although international guidelines advocate for early integration of palliative care in chronic disease, the unpredictable course of many respiratory conditions, including COPD, and the difficulty of predicting survival are barriers to timely palliative care referral and receipt. A symptom-triggered approach should reach more people likely to benefit than current approaches based on prognostication. For services already well-aligned with palliative care, adoption of the core therapeutic components for breathlessness management into existing practice may suffice.

### Palliative care in hospitals [^7d29944a]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Palliative care is medical care focused on the relief of suffering and support for the best possible quality of life for patients facing serious, life-threatening illness and their families. It aims to identify and address the physical, psychological, and practical burdens of illness. Palliative care may be delivered simultaneously with all appropriate curative and life-prolonging interventions. In practice, palliative care practitioners provide assessment and treatment of pain and other symptom distress; employ communication skills with patients, families, and colleagues; support complex medical decision making and goal setting based on identifying and respecting patient wishes and goals; and promote medically informed care coordination, continuity, and practical support for patients, family caregivers, and professional colleagues across healthcare settings and through the trajectory of an illness. The field of hospital palliative care has grown rapidly in recent years in response to patient need and clinician interest in effective approaches to managing chronic life-threatening illness. The growth in the number and needs of seriously and chronically ill patients who are not clearly terminally ill has led to the development of palliative care services outside the hospice benefit provided by Medicare (and other insurers). This article reviews the clinical, educational, demographic, and financial imperatives driving this growth, describes the clinical components of palliative care and the range of service models available, defines the relation of hospital-based palliative care to hospice, summarizes the literature on palliative care outcomes, and presents practical resources for clinicians seeking knowledge and skills in the field.

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^94fe7ebb]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Palliative care — scope, principles, and delivery are described as focusing on expert assessment and management of pain and other symptoms, assessment and support of caregiver needs, and coordination of care, and attending to the physical, functional, psychological, practical, and spiritual consequences of a serious illness. It is a person- and family-centered approach to care providing people living with serious illness relief from the symptoms and stress of an illness, and through early integration into the care plan for the seriously ill, palliative care improves quality of life for the patient and the family. Palliative care is appropriate at any stage in a serious illness; provided over time to patients based on their needs and not their prognosis; offered in all care settings and by various organizations; focused on what is most important to the patient, family, and caregiver(s); and interdisciplinary to attend to the holistic care needs of the patient and identified family and caregivers. Palliative care principles and practices can be delivered by any clinician caring for the seriously ill, and in any setting, and "All clinicians are encouraged to acquire core skills and knowledge regarding palliative care and refer to palliative care specialists as needed".

### Palliative care early in the care continuum among patients with serious respiratory illness: an official ATS / AAHPM / HPNA / SWHPN policy statement [^fed3acff]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Serious respiratory illness — symptom assessment and management: Individualized, evidence-based symptom assessments should occur routinely to assess change and identify new symptoms, including chronic dyspnea or breathlessness, episodes of dyspnea crisis, cough, pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances/insomnia, psychological and spiritual distress or suffering, and weight loss/anorexia. Central to symptom management in several serious respiratory illnesses is pulmonary rehabilitation; for people with COPD and ILD, it is an effective intervention for breathlessness, fatigue, and emotional symptoms, and nonpharmacologic treatment options may complement disease-directed pharmacologic therapies. Low-dose opioids are the mainstay of refractory breathlessness treatment in patients with advanced cancer; however, they are often underused in those with serious respiratory illness, and a recent trial found that low-dose oral sustained-release morphine improved health status in patients with chronic COPD without causing hypercapnia or other serious adverse effects. Additional advanced palliative therapies may be considered in select patients if the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Clinicians should encourage self-care maintenance among patients with serious respiratory illness as it is an essential treatment adjunct that can improve QOL, reduce respiratory-related hospital admissions, and decrease dyspnea; according to the middle-range theory of self-care in chronic illness, interventions may focus on self-care maintenance, monitoring, and management. Self-management of breathlessness among patients with serious respiratory illness should be a focus, and components include recognition and treatment of exacerbations, physical activity and exercise behaviors, and education and tools to self-manage symptoms such as breathlessness.

### Advancing palliative care in patients with CKD: from ideas to practice [^fc3d89d3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

A palliative approach to care focuses on what matters most to patients with life-limiting illness, including chronic kidney disease (CKD). Despite recent publication of related clinical practice guidelines in nephrology, there is limited information about how to practically implement these recommendations. In this Perspective, we describe our experience integrating a palliative approach within routine care of patients with CKD glomerular filtration rate categories 4 and 5 (G4-G5) across a provincial kidney care network during the past 15 years. The effort was led by a multidisciplinary group, tasked with building capacity and developing tools and resources for practical integration within a provincial network structure. We used an evidence-based framework that includes recommendations for 4 pillars of palliative care to guide our work: (1) patient identification, (2) advance care planning, (3) symptom assessment and management, and (4) caring of the dying patient and bereavement. Activities within each pillar have been iteratively implemented across all kidney care programs using existing committees and organizational structures. Key quality indicators were used to guide strategic planning and improvement. We supported culture change through the use of multiple strategies simultaneously. Altogether, we established and integrated palliative care activities into routine CKD G4-G5 care across the continuum from nondialysis to dialysis populations.

### Effect of specialist palliative care services on quality of life in adults with advanced incurable illness in hospital, hospice, or community settings: systematic review and meta-analysis [^ad134112]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

"Specialist palliative care for all" versus "as needed"

Our findings might be surprising and even disappointing for many advocates of palliative care because the reported effect sizes are smaller than many have expected. Yet, we strongly believe that the most important reason for the small effect size on quality of life and the inconclusive findings for the secondary outcomes could be the care approach used in the trials. All trials provided a "specialist palliative care for all" approach and neglected the potential role of general palliative care. As a result, all patients at certain stage of a certain disease were referred to specialist palliative care. For example, in the study of Temel and colleagues all patients with non-small cell lung cancer stage IIIb and IV were referred to the intervention, even if they did not have major symptoms (such as pain, anxiety, dyspnoea, etc) or other distressing conditions such as spiritual or social problems. Meanwhile, many from the specialty of palliative care question the feasibility, practicability, and efficiency of this approach. Quill and Abernethy reported that it is not feasible to refer all patients at the palliative stage of their disease to specialist teams. Such teams cannot be made available for so many patients because of resource allocation issues. The authors also point to the obligation of every physician to hold general skills in palliative care. Physicians must be capable and willing to deal with basic needs for palliative care but also refer those patients with complex needs to specialist palliative care.

We strongly support such an approach ("general palliative care for all plus specialist palliative care as needed"). This model recognises the importance of general palliative care (and interventions that will strengthen palliative care) as well as the necessity to provide specialist care to patients for whom general palliative care is not enough. Yet, we must emphasise a missing link. In our view, this link is routine structured screening for needs of all patients for palliative care as reported by the patients themselves. Such routine screening (for example, for symptom burden) is known to increase quality of life in these patients and reduce emergency admissionsand could be a practical trigger to identify those who need specialist palliative care. It is beyond the scope of this review to recommend a certain tool, but it is obvious that such a questionnaire (paper and pencil or electronic) must at the minimum contain the main symptoms (such as pain, anxiety, dyspnoea) reported by patients themselves.

### Evaluating palliative care case conferences in primary care for patients with advanced non-malignant chronic conditions: a cluster-randomised controlled trial (KOPAL) [^885ec28c]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Patients with advanced non-malignant chronic conditions might benefit from an interprofessional care approach, particularly from collaboration between general practitioners and specialist palliative home care teams, due to their complex medical conditions.
The advantage of the interprofessional KOPAL approach did not show significant results regarding the reduction of hospital admissions.
Identifying the palliative care needs of patients with advanced non-malignant chronic illnesses remains a challenge for healthcare providers.

### Holistic services for people with advanced disease and chronic breathlessness: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ae343553]. Thorax (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Breathlessness is a common and distressing symptom of chronic disease, affecting almost all people with chronic respiratory disease, the majority with heart disease or cancer, and significant proportions of those with renal disease, neurological conditions or HIV/AIDS. With our ageing population and increasing multimorbidity, the number of people affected by breathlessness worldwide will rise. Breathlessness increases as disease progressesand often becomes chronic (ie, it persists despite optimal treatment of the underlying disease). The symptom can result in fear, sleep disturbance, social isolation and disability for patients and carers. Breathlessness also occurs alongside other troublesome symptoms such as cough, fatigue and anxiety, and serves as a marker of overall symptom burden and deterioration.

There are limited pharmacological treatments for breathlessness: moderate evidence supports use of low-dose opioids, and there is little to support use of benzodiazepines. As these approaches do not address the psychosocial problems that underlie and perpetuate the symptom, non-pharmacological treatments take priority. In many people, breathlessness is successfully managed via rehabilitation services that incorporate exercise training, education and behaviour change interventions. Pulmonary rehabilitation, for example, improves functional status and quality of life, and is a cornerstone of best standard breathlessness care. However, issues with referral, uptake and completion limit reach, particularly to people with the most advanced disease with high levels of disability.

Holistic services are emerging, designed specifically for those with advanced disease and chronic breathlessness. These typically draw on palliative care, but with integrated working from multiple specialties and professional groups. Treatments are selected based on the physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs of individual patients, and their families or carers. Individual studies suggest a positive impact on health outcomes. For example, an integrated palliative and respiratory care service improved breathlessness mastery, and suggested a potential survival advantage. Recent international guidelines subsequently advocate for early integration of palliative care in people experiencing chronic disease, and refractory and/or distressing breathlessness may serve as an appropriate referral indicator, especially in non-cancer conditions where prognostication causes delays. However, the evidence base to guide practice and policy is poorly understood.

We therefore aimed to synthesise available evidence around holistic breathlessness services for people with advanced disease. Our objectives were to describe structures and therapeutic components; determine clinical and cost-effectiveness; and understand patients' and carers' experiences of these services.

Background

Providing optimal care to patients facing life-threatening and progressing illnesses requires a focus on patients' and their family caregivers' physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritual needs. It is not solely a task of experts in palliative care. The number of people affected by chronic and progressive illness is escalating, fueled by population ageing and improved life expectancy. While specialist palliative care services, such as hospices and home care teams, provide an extra layer of support for those with the most complex needs, patients and their families with progressive and life threatening illness come into contact with health and social care workers in all settings – primary, secondary, and tertiary. Providing holistic care for seriously ill patients and their families is now a central component of health care. This can, however, be daunting for many doctors, nurses and other staff, especially with limited formal (undergraduate and postgraduate) training.

An important starting point in effective clinical management is the assessment and identification of problems. Unfortunately, practitioners often miss many of patients' needs and symptoms, especially when these are non-physical. This problem is compounded because patients have multiple symptoms and concerns. Asking patients to report their concerns using Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) has been proposed as a way to overcome this. When repeated over time, such assessments can become measurable outcomes, revealing how patients' health status changed following the care provided.

Although practitioners express positive attitudes towards measuring PROMs, routine measurement of concerns is hampered by a lack of training and guidance on how to use and respond to PROMs in clinical care. Published guidance on using PROMs is fragmented; it lacks specified steps and recommendations to follow when implementing PROMs or does not focus on advance disease. Even more pressing, there is a lack of guidance on how to respond to specific PROM scores. There is often an unfamiliarity with the score interpretation, while PROM scores are potentially not fed back to the right person, or reported as often as needed. Clinical significance of health-related quality of life scores are not always reported in studies. Unsurprisingly, therefore, clinical decision-making is not often based on outcome scores and measuring PROMS seems to have a stronger impact on process-aspects of care, i.e. detection of symptoms, than on outcome-aspects of care, i.e. patients' health status (e.g.). Ideally, PROMs should routinely be used and assist in detecting problems, planning treatment, and monitoring how well concerns are alleviated.

### The role of specialist palliative care in individuals "living beyond cancer": a narrative review of the literature [^017e58f1]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Supportive care has been used by some as a substitute for palliative care, with a major driver for this change being the widely held opinion that palliative care is synonymous with end-of-life care. However, although palliative care is an integral component of supportive care (as previously defined), supportive care is much more than palliative care, and requires input from a range of specialist teams and services. Importantly, most SPCTs often have limited knowledge / experience of managing the active toxicities of anticancer treatments, and especially the newer immunotherapies and targeted treatments. Furthermore, most SPCTs have even more limited knowledge / experience of managing the chronic toxicities of anticancer treatments, which has major implications for their involvement in the care of individuals living beyond cancer (see below).

Significantly, according to the NCI definition, all patients with a history of cancer are cancer survivors, including those with advanced / progressive disease, and even those in the final (terminal) stage of their illness. Thus, SPCTs already manage significant number of "cancer survivors", although as previously indicated there is usually a clear demarcation between those subgroups that are routinely reviewed by these services, and those subgroups that are rarely (if ever) reviewed by these services (Table 2). Currently, SPCTs are seldom involved in the management of individuals living beyond cancer.

Table 2
Subgroups of "cancer survivors" and typical engagement with specialist palliative care teams

Core activities of specialist palliative care teams

SPCTs are extremely heterogenous in terms of their membership, services provided, and populations served. Nevertheless, most SPCTs provide the core functions outlined in Box 1, although this range of services is usually restricted to patients with advanced cancer. As discussed, some SPCTs also provide early palliative care, some provide supportive care, and a smaller number also provide services for individuals living beyond cancer (generally symptom control).

### Palliative care interventions in advanced dementia [^7c19e52a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Dementia is a chronic, progressive and ultimately fatal neurodegenerative disease. Advanced dementia is characterised by profound cognitive impairment, inability to communicate verbally and complete functional dependence. Usual care of people with advanced dementia is not underpinned universally by a palliative approach. Palliative care has focused traditionally on care of people with cancer, but for more than a decade, there have been calls worldwide to extend palliative care services to include all people with life-limiting illnesses in need of specialist care, including people with dementia. This review is an updated version of a review first published in 2016.

Objectives

To assess the effect of palliative care interventions in advanced dementia.

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register on 7 October 2020. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of several major healthcare databases, trial registries and grey literature sources. We ran additional searches across MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), four other databases and two trial registries on 7 October 2020 to ensure that the searches were as comprehensive and as up-to-date as possible.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomised (RCTs) and non-randomised controlled trials (nRCTs), controlled before-and-after studies and interrupted time series studies evaluating the impact of palliative care interventions for adults with advanced dementia of any type. Participants could be people with advanced dementia, their family members, clinicians or paid care staff. We included clinical interventions and non-clinical interventions. Comparators were usual care or another palliative care intervention. We did not exclude studies based on outcomes measured.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors (SW, EM, PC) independently assessed all potential studies identified in the search against the review inclusion criteria. Two authors independently extracted data from eligible studies. Where appropriate, we estimated pooled treatment effects in a fixed-effect meta-analysis. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome using GRADE.

Main Results

Nine studies (2122 participants) met the review inclusion criteria. Two studies were individually-randomised RCTs, six were cluster-randomised RCTs and one was a controlled before-and-after study. We conducted two separate comparisons: organisation and delivery of care interventions versus usual care (six studies, 1162 participants) and advance care planning interventions versus usual care (three studies, 960 participants). Two studies were carried out in acute hospitals and seven in nursing homes or long-term care facilities. For both comparisons, we found the included studies to be sufficiently similar to conduct meta-analyses. Changes to the organisation and delivery of care for people with advanced dementia may increase comfort in dying (MD 1.49, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.64; 5 studies, 335 participants; very low certainty evidence). However, the evidence is very uncertain and unlikely to be clinically significant. These changes may also increase the likelihood of having a palliative care plan in place (RR 5.84, 95% CI 1.37 to 25.02; 1 study, 99 participants; I² = 0%; very low certainty evidence), but again the evidence is very uncertain. Such interventions probably have little effect on the use of non-palliative interventions (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.72; 2 studies, 292 participants; I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence). They may also have little or no effect on documentation of advance directives (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.25; 2 studies, 112 participants; I² = 52%; very low certainty evidence), or whether discussions take place about advance care planning (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.18; 1 study, 193 participants; I² = 0%; very low certainty evidence) and goals of care (RR 2.36, 95% CI 1.00 to 5.54; 1 study, 13 participants; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). No included studies assessed adverse effects. Advance care planning interventions for people with advanced dementia probably increase the documentation of advance directives (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.41; 2 studies, 384; moderate certainty evidence) and the number of discussions about goals of care (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.59; 2 studies, 384 participants; moderate certainty evidence). They may also slightly increase concordance with goals of care (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.79; 1 study, 63 participants; low certainty evidence). On the other hand, they may have little or no effect on perceived symptom management (MD -1.80, 95% CI -6.49 to 2.89; 1 study, 67 participants; very low certainty evidence) or whether advance care planning discussions occur (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.24; 1 study, 67 participants; low certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence on palliative care interventions in advanced dementia is limited in quantity and certainty. When compared to usual care, changes to the organisation and delivery of care for people with advanced dementia may lead to improvements in comfort in dying, but the evidence for this was of very low certainty. Advance care planning interventions, compared to usual care, probably increase the documentation of advance directives and the occurrence of discussions about goals of care, and may also increase concordance with goals of care. We did not detect other effects. The uncertainty in the evidence across all outcomes in both comparisons is mainly driven by imprecision of effect estimates and risk of bias in the included studies.

### Palliative care and management of troublesome symptoms for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^54ac07b9]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

People with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have distressing physical and psychological symptoms, often have limited understanding of their disease, and infrequently discuss end-of-life issues in routine clinical care. These are strong indicators for expert multidisciplinary palliative care, which incorporates assessment and management of symptoms and concerns, patient and caregiver education, and sensitive communication to elicit preferences for care towards the end of life. The unpredictable course of COPD and the difficulty of predicting survival are barriers to timely referral and receipt of palliative care. Early integration of palliative care with respiratory, primary care, and rehabilitation services, with referral on the basis of the complexity of symptoms and concerns, rather than prognosis, can improve patient and caregiver outcomes. Models of integrated working in COPD could include: services triggered by troublesome symptoms such as refractory breathlessness; short-term palliative care; and, in settings with limited access to palliative care, consultation only in specific circumstances or for the most complex patients.

### Evaluation design of the patient-centred pathways of early palliative care, supportive ecosystems and appraisal standard (inAdvance): a randomised controlled trial [^9bcfd417]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Palliative care aims to contribute to pain relief, improvement with regard to symptoms and enhancement of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with chronic conditions. Most of the palliative care protocols, programmes and units are predominantly focused on patients with cancer and their specific needs. Patients with non-cancer chronic conditions may also have significantly impaired HRQoL and poor survival, but do not yet receive appropriate and holistic care. The traditional focus of palliative care has been at the end-of-life stages instead of the relatively early phases of serious chronic conditions. The 'Patient-centred pathways of early palliative care, supportive ecosystems and appraisal standard' (InAdvance) project implements and evaluates early palliative care in the daily clinical routine addressing patients with complex chronic conditions in the evolution towards advanced stages. The objective of the current study is to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this novel model of palliative care in the relatively early phases in patients with chronic conditions.

Methods

In this study, a single blind randomised controlled trial design will be employed. A total of 320 participants (80 in each study site and 4 sites in total) will be randomised on a 1:1 basis to the Palliative Care Needs Assessment (PCNA) arm or the Care-as-Usual arm. This study includes a formative evaluation approach as well as a cost-effectiveness analysis with a within-trial horizon. Study outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 6weeks, 6months, 12months and 18months after the implementation of the interventions. Study outcomes include HRQoL, intensity of symptoms, functional status, emotional distress, caregiving burden, perceived quality of care, adherence to treatment, feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of the intervention, intervention costs, other healthcare costs and informal care costs.

Discussion

The InAdvance project will evaluate the effect of the implementation of the PCNA intervention on the target population in terms of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in four European settings. The evidence of the project will provide step-wise guidance to contribute an increased evidence base for policy recommendations and clinical guidelines, in an effort to augment the supportive ecosystem for palliative care.

### Exploring the care needs of patients with advanced COPD: an overview of the literature [^314fa8d4]. Respiratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent condition worldwide and is associated with significant mortality. This paper gives an overview of the relevant literature regarding care needs in advanced COPD from the perspective of the patient or carer, and aims to explore the appropriateness of a palliative care approach in this group. Publications revealed that patients with COPD have a high symptom burden that impacts on quality of life and social functioning. Information provision in COPD is often lacking and the implications of diagnosis and prognosis are not routinely discussed. The impact on families and carers is considerable, many patients have significant care requirements which can affect family relationships. Although patients with COPD have regular contact with health services, access to specialist services and palliative care is poor. This paper highlights the need for increased provision for palliative care in COPD, alongside dedicated education and training for health professionals, and continued research to identify the most appropriate ways of delivering this care.

### Evaluation design of the patient-centred pathways of early palliative care, supportive ecosystems and appraisal standard (inAdvance): a randomised controlled trial [^bf9e774e]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Population ageing is a long-term trend in Europe which began several decades ago. In 2020, more than one fifth (20.6%) of the European Union (EU) population was aged 65 and over. Moreover, the share of those aged 80 years or above is projected to more than double between 2016 and 2080 in the EU, from 5.4 to 12.7%.

With the predicted demographic shift, the prevalence of multi-morbidity, defined as the co-occurrence of two or more long-term conditions, will rise. The prevalence of multi-morbidity among older persons (> 60 years) ranges from 55 to 98% worldwide. For example, a study in Scotland reported that 65% of people aged 65–84 years and 82% of people aged 85 years and over are affected by chronic conditions and multi-morbidity. The impact of chronic conditions and multi-morbidity may include impaired physical function, dependence, poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL), high care costs and decreased survival. Palliative care is considered to be an appropriate way for pain relief, improvement of symptoms experience and well-being and enhancement of HRQoL of patients with chronic conditions. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), palliative care aims to improve the HRQoL of patients and their families who are facing the problems associated with life-threatening illnesses. Palliative care prevents and relieves suffering by means of early identification, appropriate assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, whether physical, psychological, social or spiritual.

However, despite the growth in needs of palliative care services, it is estimated that only about 14% of people in need of palliative care are currently receiving it worldwide. Most of the palliative care protocols, programmes and units are more focused on patients with cancer and their specific requirements and needs. Patients with non-cancer chronic conditions may also have significantly impaired HRQoL and poor survival, but relatively often do not receive holistic and appropriate care according to their needs when compared to oncological patients. Furthermore, the core focus of palliative care providing relief from pain, physical symptoms, and psychosocial distress is at the end-of-life stages. As affirmed by the WHO, patients with chronic conditions may also benefit from palliative care actions in the early phases of their condition in conjunction with the specific life-prolonging treatments.

### Palliative care in advanced lung disease: the challenge of integrating palliation into everyday care [^7daa1287]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

The tendency toward "either/or" thinking (either cure or comfort) in traditional biomedical care paradigms does little to optimize care in advancing chronic illness. Calls for improved palliation in chronic lung disease mandate a review of related care gaps and current clinical practices. Although specialist palliative services have their advocates, adding yet another element to an already fragmented, often complex, care paradigm can be a challenge. Instead, we propose a more holistic, patient-centered approach based on elements fundamental to palliative and best care practices generally and integrated as needed across the entire illness trajectory. To support this approach, we review the concept of primary palliative care competencies, identify vulnerability specific to those living with advanced COPD (an exemplar of chronic lung disease), and describe the need for care plans shaped by patient-centered communication, timely palliative responsiveness, and effective advance care planning. A costly systemic issue in the management of chronic lung disease is patients' increasing dependency on episodic ED care to deal with preventable episodic crises and refractory dyspnea. We address this issue as part of a proposed model of care that provides proactive, collaborative case management and the appropriate and carefully monitored use of opioids. We encourage and support a renewed primary care resolve to integrate palliative approaches to care in advanced lung disease that, in concert with judicious referral to appropriate specialist palliative care services, is fundamental to what should be a more sustainable systematic improvement in palliative care delivery.

Domain 2: Physical aspects of care — Practice Example D2-E (community-based home health and hospice agency) outlines a palliative care program that utilizes advanced practice providers who collaborate with the primary care provider and/or treating specialists and are supported by commercial insurance and Medicare Part B reimbursement. All home health patients are screened for palliative needs by the home health nurse — most people who screen positive have cancer or chronic progressive illnesses with recurrent hospitalizations — and social workers and chaplains from the hospice program collaborate actively with nurses in home health to develop a coordinated plan of care. The advanced practice registered nurse or physician assistant engage with these patients simultaneously with home health, particularly when prescribing authority is needed, to facilitate continued support for high-risk patients once home health care goals are reached. Patient/family and provider satisfaction with the program is high, the hospice sees an increase in appropriate and timely admissions with program growth, and when eligible patients are admitted to hospice care they experience greater continuity with team members, identified as a key value-add to the program.

### Palliative care and the management of common distressing symptoms in advanced cancer: pain, breathlessness, nausea and vomiting, and fatigue [^7a76c100]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

For older patients with advanced cancer, Van Lancker et aldeveloped and validated the Assessment Symptoms Palliative Elderly, a 36-item instrument to assess symptom frequency and intensity. Although longer than ESAS-r and POS, the tool places a greater emphasis on assessing function, social symptoms, and psychological issues, all of which are prominent areas of concern for older patients with cancer.

Use of technology is likely to be an important and key component to implementing PROMs into routine clinical practice. Examples where integration has been successful include home asthma telemonitoring systemsand Web-based support platforms for patients with insulin-dependent diabetes. In an oncology setting, Velikova et alfound that regular repeated assessment of health-related quality of life of patients with cancer (using touch-screen computers in outpatient clinics) improved patients' emotional well-being and resulted in more frequent discussions of chronic nonspecific symptoms. Similarly, in a randomized trial of 766 patients with metastatic cancer, Basch et al, found that those receiving care incorporating routine patient-reported electronic monitoring of symptoms had greater improvements in health-related quality of life (34% v 18%), fewer emergency department visits or admissions to hospital (34% v 41% and 45% v 49%, respectively), and longer quality-adjusted survival (mean, 8.7 months v 8.0 months) compared with those receiving usual care. In a study of patients with lung cancer, Denis et al - investigated the E-MOSAIC intervention, which used real-time electronic monitoring of PROMs, with measures completed weekly by participants on a palm-based device (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:). They found that weekly reporting of symptoms resulted in improved survival compared with those receiving usual care (median survival, 22.4 months v 16.7 months). Compared with the control group, those in the intervention group also had greater improvements in symptoms, communication, and coping, but not overall quality of life.

### Palliative care and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: where the lines meet [^5507af39]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and is expected to increase as the population ages. Patients have a high symptom burden, low healthcare quality of life, and unmet needs at the end of life. This review highlights specific palliative care needs of patients with advanced COPD and opportunities to integrate palliative care into standard practice.

Recent Findings

There are many barriers to providing integrated palliative care in COPD, including difficulty with prognostication, communication barriers surrounding advance care planning, and lack of access to specialty palliative care. Because of the unique disease trajectory, emphases on early and primary palliative care are being studied in this patient population.

Summary

Palliative care is appropriate for patients with COPD and should be integrated with disease-specific therapies. The line between life prolonging and palliative care undoubtedly overlaps and maximizing quality of life throughout the continuum of care should be prioritized for patients with this progressive illness.

### The catalonia WHO demonstration project of palliative care: results at 25 Years (1990–2015) [^bb0c2b70]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2016). Low credibility.

In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) Demonstration Project on Palliative Care in Catalonia (Spain) celebrated its 25th anniversary. The present report describes the achievements and progress made through this project. Numerous innovations have been made with regard to the palliative care (PC) model, organization, and policy. As the concept of PC has expanded to include individuals with advanced chronic conditions, new needs in diverse domains have been identified. The WHO resolution on "Strengthening of palliative care as a component of comprehensive care throughout the life course", together with other related WHO initiatives, support the development of a person-centered integrated care PC model with universal coverage. The Catalan Department of Health, together with key institutions, developed a new program in the year 2011 to promote comprehensive and integrated PC approach strategies for individuals with advanced chronic conditions. The program included epidemiologic research to describe the population with progressive and life-limiting illnesses. One key outcome was the development of a specific tool (NECPAL CCOMS-ICO(©)) to identify individuals in the community in need of PC. Other innovations to emerge from this project to improve PC provision include the development of the essential needs approach and integrated models across care settings. Several educational and research programs have been undertaken to complement the process. These results illustrate how a PC program can respond and adapt to emerging needs and demands. The success of the PC approach described here supports more widespread adoption by other key care programs, particularly chronic care programs.

### Comparison of palliative care delivery in the last year of life between adults with terminal noncancer illness or cancer [^51ccf86c]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How is palliative care being delivered to patients with noncancer illness (ie, chronic organ failure and dementia), and is it being delivered differently than for patients with cancer?

Findings

In this cohort study, among 145 709 adults who died of cancer or terminal noncancer illness and received palliative care in their last year of life, palliative care was more likely to be initiated earlier, initiated in the hospital setting, and delivered across multiple care settings in patients with cancer than in those with organ failure or dementia. Patients with cancer were more likely to receive care using a consultative or specialist model instead of a generalist model and received palliative care more often from general practitioners and physicians with subspecialty training compared with patients with chronic organ failure or dementia.

Meaning

Differences in the delivery of palliative care across distinct types of serious illness have important implications for the organization and scaled implementation of palliative care programs, including enhancement of practitioner education and training and improvements in equitable access to care across all settings.

### Palliative care in liver disease: what does good look like? [^2318ccb7]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

The mortality rate from chronic liver disease in the UK is rising rapidly, and patients with advanced disease have a symptom burden comparable to or higher than that experienced in other life-limiting illnesses. While evidence is limited, there is growing recognition that care of patients with advanced disease needs to improve. Many factors limit widespread provision of good palliative care to these patients, including the unpredictable trajectory of chronic liver disease, the misconception that palliative care and end-of-life care are synonymous, lack of confidence in prescribing and lack of time and resources. Healthcare professionals managing these patients need to develop the skills to ensure effective delivery of core palliative care, with referral to specialist palliative care services reserved for those with complex needs. Core palliative care is best delivered by the hepatology team in parallel with active disease management. This includes ensuring that discussions about disease trajectory and advance care planning occur alongside active management of disease complications. Liver disease is strongly associated with significant social, psychological and financial hardships for patients and their carers; strategies that involve the wider multidisciplinary team at an early stage in the disease trajectory help ensure proactive management of such issues. This review summarises the evidence supporting palliative care for patients with advanced chronic liver disease, presents examples of current best practice and provides pragmatic suggestions for how palliative and disease-modifying care can be run in parallel, such that patients do not miss opportunities for interventions that improve their quality of life.

### The role of telemedicine in enhancing palliative care for older adults: opportunities and challenges [^f49f1f39]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The rapid global aging of the population has led to a substantial increase in the burden of chronic diseases among older adults. In the United States, more than 80% of individuals aged 55 years or older live with at least one chronic condition, and approximately 68% live with two or more, which significantly affects their health, economic well-being, and overall quality of life. In addition to multimorbidity, many older individuals experience complex clinical presentations that include functional dependency, frailty, and cognitive decline.

Geriatric medicine has emerged as a clinical specialty specifically designed to address the complex health needs of the aging population. This discipline adopts a comprehensive, person-centered approach, aiming to optimize the health, functionality, and overall well-being of older adults by considering the dynamic interplay among medical, cognitive, psychological, and social factors.

Palliative care plays a complementary and equally vital role in this context. Defined as a holistic and interdisciplinary model of care, it seeks to enhance the quality of life of patients and their families who are facing life-limiting illnesses, primarily through the prevention and alleviation of suffering. Although historically centered on patients with cancer, palliative care is increasingly acknowledged as essential for older adults living with advanced, non-malignant chronic diseases. These individuals often experience symptom burdens comparable to those of cancer patients but are typically referred to palliative services at later stages of illness, often presenting with more pronounced functional decline.

Despite growing recognition of palliative care within oncology, significant gaps persist in its application to non-oncologic populations, particularly older adults. Challenges include delayed identification of palliative needs, poor integration with chronic disease management, and unclear goals of care.

Domain 2: Physical Aspects of Care — Guideline 2.3 Treatment — Interdisciplinary care plans to address physical symptoms, maximize functional status, and enhance quality of life are developed in the context of the patient's goals of care, disease, prognosis, functional limitations, culture, and care setting. An essential component of palliative care is ongoing management of physical symptoms, anticipating changes in health status, and monitoring of potential risk factors associated with the disease and side effects due to treatment regimens. The IDT encourages and facilitates active involvement of patients and caregivers in developing the plan of care and managing physical symptoms, and patients and families are encouraged and given frequent opportunities to ask questions, seek support, and communicate changes in status including worsening symptoms and treatment-associated side effects. Treatment of distressing symptoms and side effects are evidence-based and include the spectrum of pharmacological, interventional, behavioral, and complementary therapies or interventions, and the need for and effectiveness of a bowel regimen is regularly assessed whenever opioids are prescribed.

### The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of hospital-based specialist palliative care for adults with advanced illness and their caregivers [^7616549f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Serious illness is often characterised by physical/psychological problems, family support needs, and high healthcare resource use. Hospital-based specialist palliative care (HSPC) has developed to assist in better meeting the needs of patients and their families and potentially reducing hospital care expenditure. There is a need for clarity on the effectiveness and optimal models of HSPC, given that most people still die in hospital and also to allocate scarce resources judiciously.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of HSPC compared to usual care for adults with advanced illness (hereafter patients) and their unpaid caregivers/families.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, CDSR, DARE and HTA database via the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL; PsycINFO; CareSearch; National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) and two trial registers to August 2019, together with checking of reference lists and relevant systematic reviews, citation searching and contact with experts to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the impact of HSPC on outcomes for patients or their unpaid caregivers/families, or both. HSPC was defined as specialist palliative care delivered by a palliative care team that is based in a hospital providing holistic care, co-ordination by a multidisciplinary team, and collaboration between HSPC providers and generalists. HSPC was provided to patients while they were admitted as inpatients to acute care hospitals, outpatients or patients receiving care from hospital outreach teams at home. The comparator was usual care, defined as inpatient or outpatient hospital care without specialist palliative care input at the point of entry into the study, community care or hospice care provided outside of the hospital setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We assessed risk of bias and extracted data. To account for use of different scales across studies, we calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous data. We used an inverse variance random-effects model. For binary data, we calculated odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table. Our primary outcomes were patient health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and symptom burden (a collection of two or more symptoms). Key secondary outcomes were pain, depression, satisfaction with care, achieving preferred place of death, mortality/survival, unpaid caregiver burden, and cost-effectiveness. Qualitative data was analysed where available.

Main Results

We identified 42 RCTs involving 7779 participants (6678 patients and 1101 caregivers/family members). Twenty-one studies were with cancer populations, 14 were with non-cancer populations (of which six were with heart failure patients), and seven with mixed cancer and non-cancer populations (mixed diagnoses). HSPC was offered in different ways and included the following models: ward-based, inpatient consult, outpatient, hospital-at-home or hospital outreach, and service provision across multiple settings which included hospital. For our main analyses, we pooled data from studies reporting adjusted endpoint values. Forty studies had a high risk of bias in at least one domain. Compared with usual care, HSPC improved patient HRQoL with a small effect size of 0.26 SMD over usual care (95% CI 0.15 to 0.37; I² = 3%, 10 studies, 1344 participants, low-quality evidence, higher scores indicate better patient HRQoL). HSPC also improved other person-centred outcomes. It reduced patient symptom burden with a small effect size of -0.26 SMD over usual care (95% CI -0.41 to -0.12; I² = 0%, 6 studies, 761 participants, very low-quality evidence, lower scores indicate lower symptom burden). HSPC improved patient satisfaction with care with a small effect size of 0.36 SMD over usual care (95% CI 0.41 to 0.57; I² = 0%, 2 studies, 337 participants, low-quality evidence, higher scores indicate better patient satisfaction with care). Using home death as a proxy measure for achieving patient's preferred place of death, patients were more likely to die at home with HSPC compared to usual care (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.16; I² = 0%, 7 studies, 861 participants, low-quality evidence). Data on pain (4 studies, 525 participants) showed no evidence of a difference between HSPC and usual care (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.01; I² = 0%, very low-quality evidence). Eight studies (N = 1252 participants) reported on adverse events and very low-quality evidence did not demonstrate an effect of HSPC on serious harms. Two studies (170 participants) presented data on caregiver burden and both found no evidence of effect of HSPC (very low-quality evidence). We included 13 economic studies (2103 participants). Overall, the evidence on cost-effectiveness of HSPC compared to usual care was inconsistent among the four full economic studies. Other studies that used only partial economic analysis and those that presented more limited resource use and cost information also had inconsistent results (very low-quality evidence). Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence assessed using GRADE was very low to low, downgraded due to a high risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision.

Authors' Conclusions

Very low- to low-quality evidence suggests that when compared to usual care, HSPC may offer small benefits for several person-centred outcomes including patient HRQoL, symptom burden and patient satisfaction with care, while also increasing the chances of patients dying in their preferred place (measured by home death). While we found no evidence that HSPC causes serious harms, the evidence was insufficient to draw strong conclusions. Although these are only small effect sizes, they may be clinically relevant at an advanced stage of disease with limited prognosis, and are person-centred outcomes important to many patients and families. More well conducted studies are needed to study populations with non-malignant diseases and mixed diagnoses, ward-based models of HSPC, 24 hours access (out-of-hours care) as part of HSPC, pain, achieving patient preferred place of care, patient satisfaction with care, caregiver outcomes (satisfaction with care, burden, depression, anxiety, grief, quality of life), and cost-effectiveness of HSPC. In addition, research is needed to provide validated person-centred outcomes to be used across studies and populations.

### AGA clinical practice update on palliative care management in cirrhosis: expert review [^8c29e3be]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Palliative care management in cirrhosis — best practice advice statements 1–5 emphasize care delivery, communication, and symptom and caregiver assessment. Care with palliative care principles should be provided to any patient with advanced serious chronic illness or life-limiting illness such as cirrhosis, irrespective of transplant candidacy; this care should be based on needs assessment instead of prognosis alone, delivered concurrently with curative or life-prolonging treatments, and tailored to stage of disease. Care inclusive of palliative care principles may be delivered by healthcare providers from any specialty within any healthcare setting. Providers caring for persons with cirrhosis should evaluate the severity of symptoms within physical, psychological, social, and spiritual domains related to their liver disease, its treatment, and prognosis. Across the spectrum of cirrhosis, excellence in communication is integral to high-quality advance care planning, goals of care conversations, and the cultivation of prognostic awareness with patients and caregivers. Routine care for patients with cirrhosis, and particularly those with decompensated disease, should include assessment of caregiver support and screening for caregiver needs.

### The selection and use of outcome measures in palliative and end-of-life care research: the MORECare international consensus workshop [^f809c398]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Research on palliative and EOL care is beset by well-reported challenges rooted in involving individuals with advanced illness in research and their families, the multiple domains of palliative care provided across health and social care, and the intention to improve quality of life in the face of deterioration. These challenges have hampered the use and selection of outcome measures in trials and nonrandomized studies on palliative and EOL care services. We critically discuss three main areas to further this field of research: priority measurement properties, incorporating proxy data, and identifying time points.

### Advance care planning for fatal chronic illness: avoiding commonplace errors and unwarranted suffering [^5bc64ba0]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with eventually fatal illnesses often receive routine treatments in response to health problems rather than treatments arising from planning that incorporates the patient's situation and preferences. This paper considers the case of an elderly man with advanced lung disease who had mechanical ventilation and aggressive intensive care, in part because his nursing home clinicians did not complete an advance care plan and his do-not-resuscitate order did not accompany him to the hospital. The errors that led to his hospitalization and his unwanted treatment there demonstrate how the ordinary lack of advance care planning is deleterious for patients who are nearing the end of life. We discuss serious, recurring, and generally unnoticed errors in planning for care near the end of life and possible steps toward improvement. Repairing these shortcomings will require quality improvement and system redesign efforts, methods familiar from patient safety initiatives. Reliable improvement will also require making it unacceptable for clinicians to fail to plan ahead for care during fatal chronic illness.

This article consider some clinical and population level approaches to advanced care of chronic conditions and end of life care. One approach aims to follow patient values and preferences about acceptable end of life (EOL) as elicited by questionnaires. The grounds for emphasising patients' preferences and the adequacy of the questionnaires are examined. Other approaches involve additional aims such as meeting patient and family members needs, providing information, cost effectiveness and satisfying professionals' preferences for a certain type of EOL experience. Issues raised by adding these (and other) aims are examined.

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^1661ed17]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

National Consensus Project for Quality Palliative Care — palliative care is described as an interdisciplinary care delivery system that anticipates, prevents, and manages physical, psychological, social, and spiritual suffering to optimize quality of life; it can be delivered in any care setting and, with early integration into the care plan of seriously ill people, improves quality of life for both patients and families. The Institute of Medicine distinguishes two levels: specialty palliative care delivered by palliative care specialists, and primary (generalist) palliative care delivered by clinicians who are not palliative care specialists. Additional on-page definitions emphasize patient- and family-centered care and broad settings of delivery: the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services highlights optimizing quality of life by anticipating, preventing, and treating suffering while addressing physical, intellectual, emotional, social, and spiritual needs and facilitating autonomy, information access, and choice; the Center to Advance Palliative Care and the American Cancer Society describe specialized medical care for people with serious illness that focuses on relief from symptoms and stress with the goal of improving quality of life for both patient and family; and the Dying in America report defines care that provides relief from pain and other symptoms, supports quality of life, may begin early in treatment, can be delivered across home, nursing home, long-term acute care, acute hospital, and outpatient settings, and notes that outcomes are optimized when begun early, delivered alongside curative or disease-modifying treatments, and available in all needed settings.

### Effect of specialist palliative care services on quality of life in adults with advanced incurable illness in hospital, hospice, or community settings: systematic review and meta-analysis [^97c98aae]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Objective To assess the effect of specialist palliative care on quality of life and additional outcomes relevant to patients in those with advanced illness.

Design Systematic review with meta-analysis.

Data sources Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, and trial registers searched up to July 2016.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Randomised controlled trials with adult inpatients or outpatients treated in hospital, hospice, or community settings with any advanced illness. Minimum requirements for specialist palliative care included the multiprofessional team approach. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data, assessed the risk of bias (Cochrane risk of bias tool), and evaluated the quality of evidence (GRADE tool).

Data synthesis Primary outcome was quality of life with Hedges' g as standardised mean difference (SMD) and random effects model in meta-analysis. In addition, the pooled SMDs of the analyses of quality of life were re-expressed on the global health/QoL scale (item 29 and 30, respectively) of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 (0–100, high values = good quality of life, minimal clinically important difference 8.1).

Results Of 3967 publications, 12 were included (10 randomised controlled trials with 2454 patients randomised, of whom 72% (n = 1766) had cancer). In no trial was integration of specialist palliative care triggered according to patients' needs as identified by screening. Overall, there was a small effect in favour of specialist palliative care (SMD 0.16, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.31; QLQ-C30 global health/QoL 4.1, 0.3 to 8.2; n = 1218, six trials). Sensitivity analysis showed an SMD of 0.57 (−0.02 to 1.15; global health/QoL 14.6, −0.5 to 29.4; n = 1385, seven trials). The effect was marginally larger for patients with cancer (0.20, 0.01 to 0.38; global health/QoL 5.1, 0.3 to 9.7; n = 828, five trials) and especially for those who received specialist palliative care early (0.33, 0.05 to 0.61, global health/QoL 8.5, 1.3 to 15.6; n = 388, two trials). The results for pain and other secondary outcomes were inconclusive. Some methodological problems (such as lack of blinding) reduced the strength of the evidence.

Conclusions Specialist palliative care was associated with a small effect on QoL and might have most pronounced effects for patients with cancer who received such care early. It could be most effective if it is provided early and if it identifies though screening those patients with unmet needs.

### Recognising the importance of chronic lung disease: a consensus statement from the global alliance for chronic diseases (lung diseases group) [^16c802ab]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Palliative care in chronic lung diseases

As is similar for the under-utilisation of pulmonary rehabilitation, there is low access to and implementation of palliative care for chronic lung diseases, despite its effectiveness. Patients who are dying from COPD experience a progressive decline in health, increasing symptoms and reduced autonomy. However, the majority of patients with advanced COPD are not offered palliative care. National and international guidelines, over the past 20 years, have tried to emphasise its value and adoption into practice. Despite this, even in high income countries, among the general population, there is minimal evidence of palliative care being offered to patients with COPD, compared to those with lung cancer, despite the symptoms being potentially just as distressing.

Palliative care for lung diseases in low resource settings is likely to be non-existent or minimal. It is profoundly affected by low access to health services and social and cultural beliefs around sharing a terminal diagnosis with the patient. Palliative care services demand a high degree of networks between multiple disciplines and organisations, and unified standards of ethical care may be missing in LMIC. The infrastructure investment within LMIC may need intensive investment for this to occur, but none-the-less this area needs to be highlighted for future research.

Regarding medical management for palliative care in patients with cancer, more specifically with respect to initiation of palliative care (components), ASCO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider including the following essential components in the palliative care:

- establishing rapport and building relationship with patients and family caregivers

- managing symptoms (such as pain, dyspnea, fatigue, sleep disturbance, mood, nausea, and constipation), distress, and functional status

- exploring understanding and providing education about illness and prognosis

- clarifying treatment goals

- assessing and supporting coping and spiritual needs

- assisting with medical decision-making

- coordinating with other care providers

- providing referrals to other care providers as indicated.

### Measuring outcomes in randomized prospective trials in palliative care [^44b20f00]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2007). Low credibility.

Palliative care aims to improve the quality of life of patients and their families and reduce suffering from life-threatening illness. In assessing palliative care efficacy, researchers must consider a broad range of potential outcomes, including those experienced by the patient's family/caregivers, clinicians, and the health care system. The purpose of this article is to summarize the discussions and recommendations of an Outcomes Working Group convened to advance the palliative care research agenda, particularly in the context of randomized controlled trials. These recommendations address the conceptualization of palliative care outcomes, sources of outcomes data, application of outcome measures in clinical trials, and the methodological challenges to outcome measurement in palliative care populations. As other fields have developed and refined methodological approaches that address their particular research needs, palliative care researchers must do the same to answer important clinical questions in rigorous and credible ways.

Appendix I: Glossary — key definitions in palliative care include the following. Serious illness is defined as a "health condition that carries a high risk of mortality and either negatively impacts a person's daily function or quality of life or excessively strains their caregiver". Shared decision-making is described as "an interpersonal, interdependent process in which the health care provider and the patient relate to and influence each other as they collaborate in making decisions about the patient's health care", and "Three essential elements must be present for shared decision making to occur. First, both the health care provider and the patient must recognize and acknowledge that a decision is, in fact, required. Second, they must both know and understand the best available evidence concerning the risks and benefits of each option. Third, decisions must take into account both the provider's guidance and the patient's values and preferences". Social determinants of health are defined as "the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age", and are "mostly responsible for health inequities - the unfair and avoidable differences in health status seen within and between countries". Specialist palliative care is "the active, total care of patients with serious illness and their families", and "Care is provided by an interdisciplinary team whose members have undergone recognized specialist palliative care training". Spirituality "is the aspect of humanity that refers to the way individuals seek and express meaning and purpose and the way they experience their connectedness to the moment, to self, to others, to nature, and to the significant or sacred". Spiritual assessment is "a more extensive process of active listening to a patient's story conducted by a board-certified chaplain that summarizes the needs and resources that emerge in that process", with "a spiritual care plan with expected outcomes that is then communicated to the rest of the treatment team", and "should be done only by a board-certified chaplain or an equivalently prepared spiritual care provider". Spiritual distress is defined as "a state of suffering related to the impaired ability to experience meaning in life through connectedness with self, others, world or a Superior Being", including attributes such as "suffering, impaired spirituality, contrary to spiritual well- being, and related to meaning in life".

### Involvement of supportive care professionals in patient care in the last month of life [^47c3aa5b]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

At the end of life, patients with cancer or other life-threatening diseases may develop a variety of symptoms and problems, either physical, psychological or spiritual, which can be distressing and detrimental to their quality of life. In patients with incurable cancer, symptoms like fatigue, pain, lack of energy, weakness and appetite loss occur in more than 50% of the patients. Patients with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic heart failure reported multiple symptoms that are often undertreated, and inappropriate symptom treatment has been reported for patients with dementia.

Palliative and supportive care aim to relieve suffering and improve the quality of life for patients with advanced illnesses and their families. It is based on an interdisciplinary approach that can be offered simultaneously with disease-oriented treatment and involves attention to the emotional, spiritual and practical needs and goals of patients and of the people who are close to them. Although there is discussion about the terminology, there is considerable overlap between palliative and supportive care. The phrase 'palliative care' is in principle used for patients with a limited life expectancy due to an incurable disease, whereas the phrase 'supportive care' can be used for all patients with chronic diseases. Both focus on symptom management, psychosocial care, communication, complex decision-making and transition of goals of care. There is growing evidence that palliative care improves the quality of the last phase of life for patients and their relatives.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^7b6f83b6]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

End-of-life and hospice care in advanced COPD — trajectory, mortality and communication: In many patients, the disease trajectory in COPD is marked by a gradual decline in health status and increasing symptoms, punctuated by acute exacerbations that are associated with an increased risk of dying. Although mortality rates following hospitalization for an acute exacerbation of COPD are declining, reported rates still vary from 23% to 80%. Progressive respiratory failure, cardiovascular diseases, malignancies and other diseases are the primary cause of death in people with COPD hospitalized for an exacerbation. Palliative care is a broad term that includes approaches to symptom control as well as management of terminal patients close to death. Palliative care, end-of-life care, and hospice care are important components of the care of patients with advanced COPD. End-of-life care should also include discussions with patients and their families about their views on resuscitation, advance directives and place of death preferences. At an individual level, prediction of 6-month survival in people with COPD is unreliable and therefore early discussion of these issues is important together with phased introduction of supportive care. Hospitalization may be a trigger to initiate discussion of advance care planning. Good advance care planning can reduce anxiety for patients and their families by talking about death and dying and offering emotional support. It can also ensure that care is consistent with their wishes and avoids unnecessary, unwanted and costly invasive approaches. For patients with very advanced or terminal illness, hospice services may provide additional benefit.

### Duration of palliative care before death in international routine practice: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^189b5863]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this systematic review, 169 studies were included, involving 11,996,479 patients. 43% of studies were of good quality and studies variably summarised duration of palliative care with inconsistent measures of spread. Internationally, half of all patients accessing palliative care services are referred less than 19 days before death, although we found very large diversity in the median duration of palliative care in days prior to death across the countries in this review, from 6 days in Australia to 69 days in Canada. The median number of days of palliative care prior to death for all US studies was 19 days, and for all non-US studies, it was 29 days. Cancer patients have a longer duration of palliative care as compared with those with non-malignant disease. We found palliative care duration is comparable for patients referred to specialist inpatient units and community settings, but significantly longer than for patients in a general hospital ward. At a country level, human development index level and the extent of palliative care development had an unexpected negative effect on the duration of palliative care.

This large systematic review and meta-analysis of international data found the duration of palliative care before death for patients with life-limiting illness is much shorter (i.e. a median of 19 days) than is supported by research evidence and widely advocated in health care policy. Davis et al.'s systematic review of randomised trials of early integration of outpatient and home palliative care concluded that care must be provided for at least 3–4 months before death to reach maximal benefit. Although we appreciate duration and content of palliative care should be guided by individual patient needs without a one-size-fits-all approach, we are concerned that this reflects a gap between the current practice of palliative care in the terminal phase of life and the timely initiation of palliative care, which impacts on the benefit of palliative care for patients and health care services. This work extends previous efforts by the team to understand the duration of hospice-based specialist palliative care in the UK. This review augments the focus to include data across multiple care settings, including hospital, home and the community, alongside novel comparisons of the duration of palliative care across countries internationally.

### Association of receipt of palliative care interventions with health care use, quality of life, and symptom burden among adults with chronic noncancer illness: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f622f646]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The evidence for palliative care exists predominantly for patients with cancer. The effect of palliative care on important end-of-life outcomes in patients with noncancer illness is unclear.

Objective

To measure the association between palliative care and acute health care use, quality of life (QOL), and symptom burden in adults with chronic noncancer illnesses.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and PubMed from inception to April 18, 2020.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials of palliative care interventions in adults with chronic noncancer illness. Studies involving at least 50% of patients with cancer were excluded.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers independently screened, selected, and extracted data from studies. Narrative synthesis was conducted for all trials. All outcomes were analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Acute health care use (hospitalizations and emergency department use), disease-generic and disease-specific quality of life (QOL), and symptoms, with estimates of QOL translated to units of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Palliative Care scale (range, 0 [worst] to 184 [best]; minimal clinically important difference, 9 points) and symptoms translated to units of the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale global distress score (range, 0 [best] to 90 [worst]; minimal clinically important difference, 5.7 points).

Results

Twenty-eight trials provided data on 13 664 patients (mean age, 74 years; 46% were women). Ten trials were of heart failure (n = 4068 patients), 11 of mixed disease (n = 8119), 4 of dementia (n = 1036), and 3 of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 441). Palliative care, compared with usual care, was statistically significantly associated with less emergency department use (9 trials [n = 2712]; 20% vs 24%; odds ratio, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.68–1.00]; I2 = 3%), less hospitalization (14 trials [n = 3706]; 38% vs 42%; odds ratio, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.65–0.99]; I2 = 41%), and modestly lower symptom burden (11 trials [n = 2598]; pooled standardized mean difference (SMD), -0.12; [95% CI, -0.20 to -0.03]; I2 = 0%; Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale score mean difference, -1.6 [95% CI, -2.6 to -0.4]). Palliative care was not significantly associated with disease-generic QOL (6 trials [n = 1334]; SMD, 0.18 [95% CI, -0.24 to 0.61]; I2 = 87%; Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Palliative Care score mean difference, 4.7 [95% CI, -6.3 to 15.9]) or disease-specific measures of QOL (11 trials [n = 2204]; SMD, 0.07 [95% CI, -0.09 to 0.23]; I2 = 68%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of patients with primarily noncancer illness, palliative care, compared with usual care, was statistically significantly associated with less acute health care use and modestly lower symptom burden, but there was no significant difference in quality of life. Analyses for some outcomes were based predominantly on studies of patients with heart failure, which may limit generalizability to other chronic illnesses.

### Comparison of palliative care delivery in the last year of life between adults with terminal noncancer illness or cancer [^599fd5f6]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Palliative care improves quality of life, reduces symptom burden and unwanted health care use, and helps patients die in their preferred location. Palliative care is the active holistic care of people and their families experiencing suffering because of serious illness, especially near the end of life. It focuses on the prevention, early identification, assessment, and management of physical issues, including pain and other distressing symptoms, psychological distress, spiritual distress, and social needs. However, studies, contrasting palliative care for patients with cancer and those with terminal noncancer illness report disparities in access and differences in the magnitude of its associated benefits.

A population-based studyof 235 159 adults who died in Ontario, Canada, found that patients dying of cancer were more likely to receive palliative care than patients dying of noncancer illness, which included chronic organ failure and dementia. Relative to their death, patients with cancer were more likely to receive palliative care earlier than patients with noncancer illness. Prior population-based research, demonstrated associated benefits of certain components of palliative care among 74 986 patients dying with heart failure (HF). Patients who received palliative care in the home from specialist palliative care practitioners had increased odds of a home death, a place where most patients prefer to die.

The focus of practitioners, decision makers, and health services researchers is shifting from an examination of the efficacy of palliative care across distinct types of serious illness to an examination of the successful design of palliative care programs to scale and implement them. Although prior researchhas evaluated differences in certain components of palliative care delivery for specific conditions (eg, HF), there is limited evidence investigating how the type of serious illness a patient has is associated with gaps in the delivery of multiple key components of palliative care. The current study is novel because it describes how multiple key elements of palliative care are being delivered across distinct types of serious illness at a population level with an aim to identify these gaps. The objective of this study was to describe the delivery of palliative care among adults in their last year of life who died of terminal noncancer illness (ie, chronic organ failure and dementia) compared with those who died of cancer.

### Executive summary of the KDIGO controversies conference on supportive care in chronic kidney disease: developing a roadmap to improving quality care [^021b5f19]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a high burden of physical and psychosocial symptoms, poor outcomes, and high costs of care. Current paradigms of care for this highly vulnerable population are variable, prognostic and assessment tools are limited, and quality of care, particularly regarding conservative and palliative care, is suboptimal. The KDIGO Controversies Conference on Supportive Care in CKD reviewed the current state of knowledge in order to define a roadmap to guide clinical and research activities focused on improving the outcomes of people living with advanced CKD, including those on dialysis. An international group of multidisciplinary experts in CKD, palliative care, methodology, economics, and education identified the key issues related to palliative care in this population. The conference led to a working plan to address outstanding issues in this arena, and this executive summary serves as an output to guide future work, including the development of globally applicable guidelines.

### The changing role of palliative care in the ICU [^9565d4e1]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Palliative care is an interprofessional specialty as well as an approach to care by all clinicians caring for patients with serious and complex illness. Unlike hospice, palliative care is based not on prognosis but on need and is an essential component of comprehensive care for critically ill patients from the time of ICU admission. In this clinically focused article, we review evidence of opportunities to improve palliative care for critically ill adults, summarize strategies for ICU palliative care improvement, and identify resources to support implementation.

Data Sources

We searched the MEDLINE database from inception through January 2014. We also searched the Reference Library of The Improving Palliative Care in the ICU Project website sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and the Center to Advance Palliative Care, which is updated monthly. We hand-searched reference lists and author files.

Study Selection

Selected studies included all English-language articles concerning adult patients using the search terms 'intensive care' or 'critical care' with 'palliative care', 'supportive care', 'end-of-life care', or 'ethics'.
Data Extraction

After examination of peer-reviewed original scientific articles, consensus statements, guidelines, and reviews resulting from our literature search, we made final selections based on author consensus.

Data Synthesis

Existing evidence is organized to address: 1) opportunities to alleviate physical and emotional symptoms, improve communication, and provide support for patients and families; 2) models and specific interventions for improving ICU palliative care; 3) available resources for ICU palliative care improvement; and 4) ongoing challenges and targets for future research. Key domains of ICU palliative care have been defined and operationalized as measures of quality. There is increasing recognition that effective integration of palliative care during acute and chronic critical illness may help patients and families face challenges after discharge from intensive care.

Conclusions

Palliative care is increasingly accepted as an essential component of comprehensive care for critically ill patients, regardless of diagnosis or prognosis. A variety of strategies to improve ICU palliative care appear to be effective, and resources including technical assistance and tools are available to support improvement efforts. As the longer-term impact of intensive care on those surviving acute critical illness is increasingly documented, palliative care can help prepare and support patients and families for challenges after ICU discharge. Further research is needed to inform efforts to integrate palliative care with intensive care more effectively and efficiently in and after the ICU and to document improvement using valid and responsive outcome measures.

### The selection and use of outcome measures in palliative and end-of-life care research: the MORECare international consensus workshop [^bc24da3d]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

To enable the wide application and interpretation of outcome measures in palliative and EOL care, the measurement properties need to be validated for this population, capture multidimensional components, and be broadly applicable across health systems, populations, disease trajectories (including post-death for bereaved carers), languages, and cultures. The best measures have essential properties of simplicity of use and good interpretability, the ability to measure clinically important change, and reporting by a patient or proxy informant. To further the field requires clinical imperatives to more closely inform recommendations on outcome measurement.

### Patient-centered care: key elements applicable to chronic liver disease [^8c209c1a]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a progressive illness with high symptom burden and functional and cognitive impairment, often with comorbid mental and substance use disorders. These factors lead to significant deterioration in quality of life, with immense burden on patients, caregivers, and healthcare. The current healthcare system in the United States does not adequately meet the needs of patients with CLD or control costs given the episodic, reactive, and fee-for-service structure. There is also a need for clinical and financial accountability for CLD care. In this context, we describe the key elements required to shift the CLD care paradigm to a patient-centered and value-based system built upon the Porter model of value-based health care. The key elements include (1) organization into integrated practice units, (2) measuring and incorporating meaningful patient-reported outcomes, (3) enabling technology to allow innovation, (4) bundled care payments, (5) integrating palliative care within routine care, and (6) formalizing centers of excellence. These elements have been shown to improve outcomes, reduce costs, and improve overall patient experience for other chronic illnesses and should have similar benefits for CLD. Payers need to partner with providers and systems to build upon these elements and help align reimbursements with patients' values and outcomes. The national organizations such as the American Association for Study of Liver Diseases need to guide key stakeholders in standardizing these elements to optimize patient-centered care for CLD.

ASCO palliative care guideline update — methods and evidence synthesis — recommendations were based on a systematic review of PubMed (January 2015–January 2023) and Cochrane Library (January 2023) focusing on phase III randomized clinical trials (RCTs), systematic reviews with meta-analyses, and clinical experience; eligibility included adult patients with cancer and adult caregivers, interventions such as specialist palliative care services and/or generalist care, psychological services, community, caregiver, and dyadic interventions, comparators of usual care or generalist oncology care, outcomes including quality of life, patient satisfaction, symptoms, psychological outcomes including distress, survival, and caregiver burden, and a sample size of ≥ 50; articles were excluded if meeting abstracts not subsequently published, editorials, commentaries, letters, news articles, case reports, narrative reviews, or were published in a non-English language; evidence quality used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and elements of the GRADE quality assessment and recommendations development process, with some outcomes downgraded because concealment of allocation and blinding are difficult in palliative care RCTs; public comment occurred from November 22, 2023 through December 4, 2023, capturing "Agree as written", "Agree with suggested modifications", and "Disagree. See Comments", with 15 written comments received and 77%–100% of the 23 respondents either agreeing or agreeing with slight modifications, and 0%–23% disagreeing.

### Palliative clinical trials in advanced chronic liver disease: challenges and opportunities [^df4a3b7a]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with advanced chronic liver disease have a complex symptom burden and many are not candidates for curative therapy. Despite this, provision of palliative interventions remains woefully inadequate, with an insufficient evidence base being a contributory factor. Designing and conducting palliative interventional trials in advanced chronic liver disease remains challenging for a multitude of reasons. In this manuscript we review past and ongoing palliative interventional trials. We identify barriers and facilitators and offer guidance on addressing these challenges. We hope that this will reduce the inequity in palliative care provision in advanced chronic liver disease.

### Holistic services for people with advanced disease and chronic breathlessness: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8bfb1ab4]. Thorax (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, holistic services for chronic breathlessness in people with advanced disease overall demonstrate positive effects on patient distress due to breathlessness and psychological health. Services are heterogonous in their content and delivery, but are highly valued by patients and families, who appreciate tailored education around breathlessness, provision of simple, portable self-management interventions and expert staff providing person-centred, dignified care. Chronic or distressing breathlessness can serve as an appropriate referral indicator for timely referral and receipt of palliative care, especially in non-cancer conditions where prognostication causes delays. Further work should test and understand the most effective service configurations and how these can be integrated into existing healthcare systems.

### Integrated model for patient-centered advanced liver disease care [^7dd4bdb4]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Advanced liver disease (AdvLD) is a high-risk common condition with a progressive, highly morbid, and often fatal course. Despite effective treatments, there are substantial shortfalls in access to and use of evidence-based supportive and palliative care for AdvLD. Although patient-centered, chronic illness models that integrate early supportive and palliative care with curative treatments hold promise, there are several knowledge gaps that hinder development of an integrated model for AdvLD. We review these evidence gaps. We also describe a conceptual framework for a patient-centered approach that explicates key elements needed to improve integrated care. An integrated model of AdvLD would allow clinicians, patients, and caregivers to work collaboratively to identify treatments and other healthcare that best align with patients' priorities.

### The surprise question and clinician-predicted prognosis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^da6a7937]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

Our meta-analysis helps define the potential role of the Surprise Question as a prognostic tool in acute and chronic illness. We found that the overall accuracy of Surprise Question was modest, and that it performs best in populations where death is common, when posed over a shorter follow-up period, and to more experienced respondents. Despite its limitations, it may be the case that when considering supportive care, prognostication is less important, as those patients identified by the Surprise Question who do not subsequently die may still benefit from an early integration of a palliative approach into their care. Future studies should address whether integrating the Surprise Question into routine clinical care improves access to palliative care services, facilitates advance care planning and is acceptable to the healthcare team.

### End-of-life care: managing common symptoms | AAFP… [^71827a92]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

In its report "Dying in America, " the Institute of Medicine stresses that "all clinicians across disciplines and specialties who care for people with advanced serious illness should be competent in basic palliative care, including communication skills, interprofessional collaboration, and symptom management". 1 As clinicians assist patients and families through the course of disease, eventually, the care will focus on symptom management in the last weeks and days of life. Outside of the hospital, these care plans are directed by primary care physicians and subspecialists who have been managing patients' primary illness, often without the aid of a palliative medicine–trained physician. Therefore, it is imperative that clinicians understand how to help these patients achieve symptom relief. This review focuses on the outpatient management of common symptoms in persons at the end of life, whether in the home, assisted living facility, or nursing home environment.

General Principles Clinicians should follow certain guiding principles when prescribing medications for symptom management at the end of life. Medications should be used to treat the primary etiology of a symptom. For example, if a patient is anxious because of shortness of breath, treatment should focus on the dyspnea to alleviate the primary symptom and then the resulting anxiety. Opiates are the medication of choice for the management of breathlessness in end-of-life care. 3–5 When administered at appropriate doses, opiates do not reduce or compromise respiratory status and do not hasten dying. 13, 14 Opiates help to reduce the sense of air hunger in patients with dyspnea. The use of opiates for palliative therapy in advanced pulmonary disease is supported by clinical guidelines from the American Thoracic Society.
6. In patients with severe, refractory agitation, palliative sedation may be considered.

Palliative sedation is defined as the intentional lowering of awareness toward, and including, unconsciousness for patients with severe and refractory symptoms. It should be considered only when symptoms do not respond to alternative therapies and should always be performed in consultation with a palliative medicine or hospice-trained clinician. Constipation Effective management of constipation in end-of-life care is critical, because constipation can lead to pain, vomiting, restlessness, and delirium. Low oral intake of food and fluids and adverse effects of opiates are common etiologies. Preventive regimens generally include a stimulant laxative with a stool softener. Dosing regimens for these medications are listed in.

### Association between palliative care and patient and caregiver outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2bf032b8]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The use of palliative care programs and the number of trials assessing their effectiveness have increased.

Objective

To determine the association of palliative care with quality of life (QOL), symptom burden, survival, and other outcomes for people with life-limiting illness and for their caregivers.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL to July 2016.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials of palliative care interventions in adults with life-limiting illness.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers independently extracted data. Narrative synthesis was conducted for all trials. Quality of life, symptom burden, and survival were analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis, with estimates of QOL translated to units of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-palliative care scale (FACIT-Pal) instrument (range, 0–184 [worst-best]; minimal clinically important difference [MCID], 9 points); and symptom burden translated to the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) (range, 0–90 [best-worst]; MCID, 5.7 points).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Quality of life, symptom burden, survival, mood, advance care planning, site of death, health care satisfaction, resource utilization, and health care expenditures.

Results

Forty-three RCTs provided data on 12 731 patients (mean age, 67 years) and 2479 caregivers. Thirty-five trials used usual care as the control, and 14 took place in the ambulatory setting. In the meta-analysis, palliative care was associated with statistically and clinically significant improvements in patient QOL at the 1- to 3-month follow-up (standardized mean difference, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.83; FACIT-Pal mean difference, 11.36] and symptom burden at the 1- to 3-month follow-up (standardized mean difference, -0.66; 95% CI, -1.25 to -0.07; ESAS mean difference, -10.30). When analyses were limited to trials at low risk of bias (n = 5), the association between palliative care and QOL was attenuated but remained statistically significant (standardized mean difference, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.34; FACIT-Pal mean difference, 4.94), whereas the association with symptom burden was not statistically significant (standardized mean difference, -0.21; 95% CI, -0.42 to 0.00; ESAS mean difference, -3.28). There was no association between palliative care and survival (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.17). Palliative care was associated consistently with improvements in advance care planning, patient and caregiver satisfaction, and lower health care utilization. Evidence of associations with other outcomes was mixed.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this meta-analysis, palliative care interventions were associated with improvements in patient QOL and symptom burden. Findings for caregiver outcomes were inconsistent. However, many associations were no longer significant when limited to trials at low risk of bias, and there was no significant association between palliative care and survival.

### Palliative care of patients with haematological malignancies: strategies to overcome difficulties via integrated care [^894909c4]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2021). High credibility.

Palliative care, hospice care, and end of life care have been the focus of increased attention over the past two decades; palliative care has shifted from being introduced only at the end of life to becoming an integrated part of routine care for patients. Currently, the timing and extent of the integration of palliative care into standard medical care practice depends on the underlying disease. Patients with haematological malignancies receive less palliative care initiated at a later disease stage compared with patients with other types of cancer. All patients in need of palliative care, hospice care, and end of life care should be given the chance to benefit from these types of care. Patients, their relatives, health-care professionals, and the health-care system can all benefit from the closer integration of palliative, hospice, and end of life care, even in combination with disease orientated treatment. Important factors to consider when introducing palliative care for patients with haematological malignancies are the different treatment strategies for each disease, the heterogeneous dynamics of the different haematological malignancies, the broad variance of therapeutic effects, and patients' dependence on the health-care system for the administration of transfusions and antimicrobial treatment, which is different from patients with solid tumours. Key areas that physicians should pay particular attention to are strategies for communication with patients to aid their understanding of their illness and prognosis and concepts to address special needs of patients with haematological malignancies (eg, transfusion requirements and symptom control). Because haematological malignancies mainly affect patients in advanced age, this Series paper integrates a special focus on age-associated topics.

### Validation of END-of-life scorING-system to identify the dying patient: a prospective analysis [^c86ad659]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The advanced technological treatments available in the intensive care unit (ICU) aim at managing acute illness and at the same time supporting multiorgan failure. Considering an average mortality rate of 20% among critical care patients, only 80% of ICU patients really benefit from these highly expensive treatments; furthermore, a not irrelevant percentage of ICU survivors will die in any case before hospital discharge. Given the likelihood of morbidity or mortality, palliative and end-of-life care should be routinely considered in the ICU. As such, the World Health Organization has described palliative care as "an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness". The physician should be thus aware of the patient and family needs to improve the management of physical, psychological and spiritual symptoms. Additionally, being aware of the value of palliative care services to help meet the families' and patients' needs and align therapy to the prognosis of the patient balanced with their preferences and values.

Beyond those clearly at the final stages of irreversible diseases (i.e. end-of-life), all patients admitted in the ICU require an early integration between a comprehensive palliative approach and intensive care treatment. The probability of dying of each critical care patient should be evaluated early on at the ICU admission and continuously reassessed during the entire ICU length of stay; the amount of palliative care treatments should thus be integrated accordingly.

Although excellent scoring systems are available in the ICU for prognostic and clinical monitoring purposes (e.g. Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation, APACHE, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, SOFA), an accurate identification of end-of-life patients in the ICU is still cumbersome. As example, the usefulness of several scores (e.g. the APACHE score) is mainly validated at the ICU admission, when the patients' responsiveness to intensive care treatments is not clear yet. Other scoring systems (e.g. the SOFA score) are well validated to monitor the organ dysfunctions over time in the ICU; nevertheless, the requirement of biochemical data for the scoring calculation may limit their routine use/daily application. Finally, the requirement for, and to what degree, palliative care should be integrated with intensive care for all ICU patients is often not objectively defined and instead determined by individual physician's perspective.

Domain 3: Palliative and end-of-life care in the ICU

In ICU patients with advanced medical illnesses and deteriorating health in spite of optimal intensive care treatment, does early integration of palliative care reduce symptom distress, improve quality of life, and enhance alignment of care with patient goals?

Outcomes

Patient satisfaction.
Completion of advance care planning.
Transition to do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate.
Number of transfers to hospice care.
Patient anxiety, depression, and PTSD experience at three months.
Transition from LSTs to comfort care.
ICU length of stay.

Background

Given the high mortality among critically ill patients, palliative care must be available in ICUs. ICU HCPs as the main providers of palliative care with palliative-care consultants being called in for complex cases is the most common model. For cancer patients, early enrollment in a palliative-care program, before hospital admission, was associated with better patient and family satisfaction, fewer hospital admissions, better quality of life, and achievement of the preferred place of death. Recent studies have sought to determine whether similar benefits are obtained in ICU patients and their families.

Summary of the evidence

Three single-center low- to very-low-level evidence RCTs from the United States (US) assessed a palliative-care consultation within 3 days after ICU admission of high-risk patients (e.g. with advanced age, lifespan-limiting chronic conditions, or moderate/severe acute conditions). The ICU stay was shorter and patient satisfaction better in one trial, while the other demonstrated more transfers to hospice care and fewer ventilator days and tracheostomies, with no difference in ICU stay length. The results of seven observational studies of early palliative-care consultations or early family meetings to discuss patient goals support the findings from the RCTs.

Discussion

Most studies of early palliative-care integration for ICU patients focused on consultation with palliative-care specialists or on family meetings with ICU staff to discuss goals of care. Other components of palliative care such as symptom management and spirituality were not investigated. Only three RCTs are available and both had a single-center design that may limit general applicability. The seven observational studies also had a single-center design, and five were retrospective.

### Integrating palliative care into routine head and neck cancer care… [^a37520ba]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The concept of palliative care has evolved over the past few decades, transitioning from a focus on end-of-life planning to providing comprehensive psychosocial support and symptom management for those with serious chronic illnesses such as cancer. 1 As the evidence base supporting palliative care for people with cancer grows, there are ever-increasing calls for. its earlier integration alongside so-called standard oncologic treatment as a way to improve quality and quantity of life. 2 There is also an important extension of palliative care to caregivers of people living with cancer, as these "second patients" have levels of unmet needs and distress that match and at times exceed those of the person with cancer. 3 The potential for palliative care is particularly significant for patients with advanced head and neck cancer, as they continue to face a stubbornly poor prognosis and high symptom burden.

These debilitating symptoms, which are often exacerbated in end-of-life situations, include common cancer toxicities, such as pain and fatigue, but also unique toxicities of HNC relating to airway obstruction, dysphagia, malodorous wounds near the face, aesthetic disfigurement, and risk of major bleeding. 2, 4.

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^7e422436]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Serious illness — definition and care needs are outlined, noting that individuals who are seriously ill need care that is seamless across settings, can rapidly respond to needs and changes in health status, and is aligned with patient-family preferences and goals. In this document, serious illness is defined as "a health condition that carries a high risk of mortality and either negatively impacts a person's daily function or quality of life or excessively strains their caregiver". The text emphasizes that providing "crisis-care" to individuals with a serious illness whose ongoing care needs are poorly managed has resulted in increased health care spending that does not necessarily improve quality of life, and that patients with serious illness and their family caregivers are seldom able to have their care needs reliably met, leading to symptom exacerbation crises and emergency department visits and/or repeated hospitalizations. It also highlights unmet care needs across all ages and areas of the country that burden families and the US health care system.

### Complex advance care planning interventions for chronic serious illness: how do they work: a scoping review [^3b11a5a2]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Study design

To address the aims of this study, a scoping review design was considered most appropriate. A scoping review is a process of mapping and describing the existing literature, which can be undertaken when the area of study in question is complexand/or heterogeneous in methods or in discipline. This scoping review was conducted according to the methodological framework set forth by Arksey and O'Malleyand the additional recommendations by Levac et al. The framework recommends the following steps: (1) identifying the research question; (2) identifying relevant studies; (3) study selection; (4) charting the data; and (5) collating, summarising and reporting the results. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist (PRISMA-ScR)was followed for writing the present review report.

Search strategy

We conducted an online search of the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Key terms, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), Emtree headings and CINAHL headings were used in their applicable databases. The search was first conducted in March 2020 using a search strategy informed by terms and keywords used in existing systematic reviews of ACP. This strategy underwent piloting to ensure the search was sensitive enough to capture key articles, yet specific enough to avoid capturing large numbers of irrelevant articles (see online supplemental figure 1 for an example search strategy). The search was last repeated on 18 November 2020 to identify additional articles that may have been published since the initial search. We included studies that were published in the English language from 1 January 2010 to the date of the last search. Filters were applied for publication type (journal articles, articles in press) where possible.

### Duration of palliative care before death in international routine practice: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^19736869]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Early provision of palliative care, at least 3–4 months before death, can improve patient quality of life and reduce burdensome treatments and financial costs. However, there is wide variation in the duration of palliative care received before death reported across the research literature. This study aims to determine the duration of time from initiation of palliative care to death for adults receiving palliative care across the international literature.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis that was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018094718). Six databases were searched for articles published between Jan 1, 2013, and Dec 31, 2018: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Global Health, Web of Science and The Cochrane Library, as well undertaking citation list searches. Following PRISMA guidelines, articles were screened using inclusion (any study design reporting duration from initiation to death in adults palliative care services) and exclusion (paediatric/non-English language studies, trials influencing the timing of palliative care) criteria. Quality appraisal was completed using Hawker's criteria and the main outcome was the duration of palliative care (median/mean days from initiation to death).

Results

One hundred sixty-nine studies from 23 countries were included, involving 11,996,479 patients. Prior to death, the median duration from initiation of palliative care to death was 18.9 days (IQR 0.1), weighted by the number of participants. Significant differences between duration were found by disease type (15 days for cancer vs 6 days for non-cancer conditions), service type (19 days for specialist palliative care unit, 20 days for community/home care, and 6 days for general hospital ward) and development index of countries (18.91 days for very high development vs 34 days for all other levels of development). Forty-three per cent of studies were rated as 'good' quality. Limitations include a preponderance of data from high-income countries, with unclear implications for low- and middle-income countries.

Conclusions

Duration of palliative care is much shorter than the 3–4 months of input by a multidisciplinary team necessary in order for the full benefits of palliative care to be realised. Furthermore, the findings highlight inequity in access across patient, service and country characteristics. We welcome more consistent terminology and methodology in the assessment of duration of palliative care from all countries, alongside increased reporting from less-developed settings, to inform benchmarking, service evaluation and quality improvement.

### Home palliative care works: but how? A meta-ethnography of the experiences of patients and family caregivers [^82bc34a3]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Objective

To understand patients and family caregivers' experiences with home palliative care services, in order to identify, explore and integrate the key components of care that shape the experiences of service users.

Methods

We performed a meta-ethnography of qualitative evidence following PRISMA recommendations for reporting systematic reviews. The studies were retrieved in 5 electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, BNI, CINAHL) using 3 terms and its equivalents ('Palliative', 'Home care', 'Qualitative research') combined with 'AND', complemented with other search strategies. We included original qualitative studies exploring experiences of adult patients and/or their family caregivers (≥ 18 years) facing life-limiting diseases with palliative care needs, being cared for at home by specialist or intermediate home palliative care services.

Results

28 papers reporting 19 studies were included, with 814 participants. Of these, 765 were family caregivers and 90% were affected by advanced cancer. According to participants' accounts, there are 2 overarching components of home palliative care: presence (24/7 availability and home visits) and competence (effective symptom control and skilful communication), contributing to meet the core need for security. Feeling secure is central to the benefits experienced with each component, allowing patients and family caregivers to focus on the dual process of living life and preparing death at home.

Conclusions

Home palliative care teams improve patients and caregivers experience of security when facing life-limiting illnesses at home, by providing competent care and being present. These teams should therefore be widely available and empowered with the resources to be present and provide competent care.

### Evaluating palliative care case conferences in primary care for patients with advanced non-malignant chronic conditions: a cluster-randomised controlled trial (KOPAL) [^4dd3d82e]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the palliative care needs of patients with advanced chronic non-malignant diseases, with their needs being comparable to those of cancer patients. The World Health Organization has identified dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) among the chronic conditions requiring palliative care, and there is evidence that palliative care improves outcomes in advanced stages of these conditions. While care for these patients is often provided by general practitioners (GPs) alone, the complexity of their conditions, their high level of symptom burden, and the unpredictability of disease progression suggest the need for an interprofessional approach to care. In the last 6 months of life, patients with CHF or COPD often experience frequent hospitalisations, overuse of curative treatments, and increased admissions to intensive care. Similarly, patients with dementia are 3.1× more likely to be hospitalised in the last month of life. Patients with advanced chronic non-malignant diseases could therefore particularly benefit from the timely involvement of a specialist palliative home care (SPHC) team in order to manage symptoms and prevent potentially aggressive interventions, including hospitalisation, intensive care and procedures, such as percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement.

Despite increasing efforts to improve access, patients with advanced chronic non-malignant diseases constitute < 10% of SPHC recipients. The lack of interprofessional collaboration and uncertainty of illness trajectories are among the main barriers to the inclusion of these patients in SPHC. While various interventions to promote interprofessional collaboration for cancer patients with palliative care needs have been investigated, approaches to address the palliative care needs of patients with advanced chronic non-malignant disease living at home remain scarce. In response to these challenges, a pilot study conducted in Australia investigated the impact of case conferences between palliative care specialists and GPs for patients with non-malignant diseases. Although based on a limited sample, the authors observed a substantial reduction in hospitalisations and emergency department visits among participants. In light of these findings, our study aimed to implement case conferences between SPHC teams and GPs for patients with advanced chronic non-malignant diseases in the German healthcare system in order to achieve a shared care plan. By fostering interprofessional collaboration, we sought to reduce hospital admissions and enhance the overall quality of life of these patients.

### Palliative care interventions in chronic respiratory diseases: a systematic review [^64ce71e9]. Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic respiratory diseases represent a significant burden of disease globally, with high morbidity and mortality. Individuals living with these conditions, as well as their families, face considerable physical, emotional and social challenges. Palliative care might be a valuable approach to address their complex needs, but evidence to prove this is still scarce.

Objectives

This systematic review aimed to study the effectiveness of palliative care interventions in health-related outcomes (quality of life, symptom control, symptom burden, psychological well-being, advance care planning, use of health services, and survival) in chronic respiratory patients.

Methods

Pubmed, Cochrane and Web of Science were searched for trials published in the last 10 years, comparing palliative care interventions to usual care, in patients with chronic respiratory diseases. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed.

Results

Eight studies were included, seven randomized controlled trials and one cluster-controlled trial; the former with moderate risk of bias and the latter with high risk of bias. Findings revealed that palliative interventions improve breathlessness control and advance care planning. There were no significant differences for the other outcomes.

Conclusions

Palliative care appears to have a beneficial effect on breathlessness, one of the most distressing symptoms in patients suffering from chronic respiratory diseases and allows for advanced care planning. Additional research, with more robust trials, is needed to draw further conclusions about other health-related outcomes.

### Randomised clinical trial of an early palliative care intervention (SUPPORT) for patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and their caregivers: protocol and key design considerations [^34b6ae0e]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

SUPPORT is a randomised controlled trial to test the efficacy of SUPPORT intervention compared with routine care in patients with IPF and their caregivers. The trial will evaluate whether the SUPPORT intervention decreases stress (primary outcome) for patients and caregivers, improves symptom burden, QOL, preparedness and advance care planning for patients and caregivers, QODD for caregivers if the patient dies during the course of the study as well as assess the impact of primary PC on healthcare resource use near the EOL.

PC, often the province of cancer care, is significantly underdeveloped in IPF, a disease which has a prognosis that is worse than many common cancers. The proposed study will provide objective evidence of a supportive care intervention delivered by clinicians early after diagnosis and the benefits when PCis introduced early (following diagnosis). It will shift clinical and research paradigms to use primary PC to meet needs and then targeted referral to specialty PC when needed. Our long-term goal is to generalise the applicability of this intervention to other patient populations with non-malignant life-limiting illness such as heart failure and other advanced lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the third leading cause of death in the USA.

While PC has been a mainstay of cancer treatment, the integration of PC into non-malignant life-threatening disease is not routine; the literature continues to report that family members of decedents who received care at home with hospice services were more likely to report a favourable dying experience. The plan to integrate early PC into the care of patients with IPF and their caregivers is innovative and will substantially close the gap between patients with IPF and quality EOL care.

- **Recommendation 1**: The spectrum of palliative care in serious respiratory illness begins with primary palliative care delivered by pulmonary and critical care clinicians that is integrated concomitantly with usual disease-modifying therapies and should be complemented by interprofessional secondary or specialist palliative care expertise when necessary.
- **Recommendation 2**: Comprehensive, individualized assessment of symptoms and needs should occur at every routine clinical encounter.
- **Recommendation 3**: Advance care planning should be an iterative and longitudinal process of communication that starts at the diagnosis of a serious respiratory illness and evolves with changes in patient health status, goals, and preferences.
- **Recommendation 4**: Informal caregivers should be identified and incorporated as a part of the primary unit of care with patients; effective engagement is necessary to support both patients and informal caregivers throughout the illness journey, including respite and bereavement.
- **Recommendation 5**: Comprehensive primary palliative care training of pulmonary–critical care clinicians is essential and can help mitigate disparities in access; this should begin early in professional training and includes elements such as palliative care terminology and communication, advance care planning, active listening, cultural awareness and sensitivity, and symptom assessment and management.
- Recommendation 6: Emergency response planning and preparedness should include provisions for the delivery of palliative care in the context of a catastrophic event and/or resource limitation. The palliative care response must include both the existing and new vulnerable populations who will be most impacted by a catastrophic disaster and should consider eight critical elements of crisis palliative care provision: stuff, staff, space, systems, sedation, separation, communication, and equity.
- **Recommendation 7**: Pulmonary–critical care and palliative care professional societies should create a Pulmonary Palliative Care Research Consortium to support collaborative research opportunities with associated funding mechanisms to advance pulmonary palliative care science.
