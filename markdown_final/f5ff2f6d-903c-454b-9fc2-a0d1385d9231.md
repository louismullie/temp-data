## Question

magnesium sulfate breathlessness

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether magnesium sulfate helps with breathlessness in acute asthma and COPD exacerbations, and how to apply the evidence clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity definitions that drive benefit. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic rationale for magnesium's bronchodilatory effect. Next, I will review adult asthma evidence for intravenous versus nebulized routes, followed by pediatric asthma data. After that, I should examine COPD evidence. Finally, I will synthesize guideline positions, safety considerations, and a practical decision framework for when to use magnesium and when to avoid it.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and severity anchors, because magnesium's utility is tightly linked to how severe the exacerbation is and whether first-line therapy has failed. Severe asthma features include talking in words, respiratory rate above 30, pulse above 120, oxygen saturation less than 90 percent on room air, and peak expiratory flow or FEV1 less than 50 percent predicted, and guidelines advise reassessing after about an hour of initial therapy to decide on escalation, including consideration of intravenous magnesium in nonresponders [^117E8Amf] [^113PWQWx].

> I need to check the pharmacologic rationale next. Magnesium acts as a calcium channel blocker at smooth muscle, reducing bronchial smooth muscle contractility, and may also attenuate mast cell mediator release and cholinergic transmission, which together plausibly relieve breathlessness in severe bronchospasm. Mechanistic and clinical studies support bronchodilation in acute asthma, though the magnitude varies with severity and route of administration [^114JWusN] [^113M3Spn].

> Now, let me review adult asthma evidence for intravenous magnesium sulfate. High-quality syntheses show that a single 2 g IV infusion over 15–30 minutes reduces hospital admissions by roughly 25 percent and improves lung function in adults whose exacerbations are severe and refractory to initial bronchodilators and corticosteroids, with the clearest signal in those with very low FEV1 at presentation, while routine use across all-comers is not supported [^116hNHji] [^111AiAMp]. Wait, let me verify the largest head-to-head trial; the 3Mg trial found no significant reduction in admission or breathlessness overall, but did show a modest improvement in dyspnea with IV versus nebulized magnesium, reinforcing that any benefit is modest and context-dependent rather than universal [^116g3Zus].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about nebulized magnesium in adults. Systematic reviews and the 3Mg trial indicate that nebulized magnesium, whether added to beta-agonists or given alone, does not consistently improve breathlessness or reduce admissions in adults, and any signal is weak and heterogeneous. Thus, nebulized magnesium should not be used routinely in adult acute asthma [^116MrWx7] [^116g3Zus]. I should double-check older positive trials; yes, a small Lancet study suggested improved FEV1 with isotonic nebulized magnesium as an adjunct to salbutamol in severe asthma, but this has not been replicated reliably in larger, contemporary trials, so I should weigh that as low-certainty, hypothesis-generating evidence rather than practice-changing data [^116LjEVv].

> Next, I should review pediatric asthma. Let me verify the direction of effect. Multiple meta-analyses show that IV magnesium reduces hospital admissions in children with moderate to severe exacerbations, with a number needed to treat around 4–7, and improves pulmonary function, supporting its selective use when initial therapy fails. However, nebulized magnesium does not reduce hospitalization or severity scores despite small improvements in peak flow, so routine nebulized use is not supported by current evidence even though some guidelines mention it as a consideration in severe cases [^114nqCHR] [^115WvJoB] [^1149UHwk] [^114Su83D]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought nebulized magnesium might reduce admissions based on older narrative summaries, but the most recent pediatric meta-analyses do not show a clinical outcome benefit, so I should correct that assumption and align with the stronger negative evidence base [^1149UHwk].

> I will now examine COPD, where the question is whether magnesium helps the breathlessness of an acute exacerbation. Cochrane and subsequent reviews suggest that IV magnesium may reduce hospital admissions and improve dyspnea scores in adults with acute COPD exacerbations, though the certainty is low and studies are small; nebulized magnesium has not shown consistent benefit on lung function or admissions, so it should not be used routinely [^114bVvbg] [^113CskaK]. Let me reconsider the magnitude; pooled estimates suggest roughly a 30–40 percent relative reduction in admission with IV magnesium, but given heterogeneity and small samples, shared decision-making and careful selection of sicker, nonresponding patients is prudent [^notfound].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with consensus. GINA advises against routine IV or nebulized magnesium in asthma exacerbations but supports considering IV magnesium for severe exacerbations not responding to initial therapy, with particular attention to very low FEV1 or persistent hypoxemia; AAFP similarly recommends considering IV magnesium to reduce hospitalizations in severe adult asthma not responding to initial treatment, while emphasizing that nebulized magnesium is not routinely recommended [^111AiAMp] [^111AQcah] [^113edMMm]. I should confirm pediatric nuances; GINA allows consideration of nebulized isotonic magnesium in children with severe exacerbations within the first hour, but this is based on limited evidence and should be framed as optional and context-specific rather than standard [^114Su83D].

> I need to ensure safety is addressed. Magnesium is generally well tolerated in single-dose use, but flushing, hypotension, bradycardia, and neurologic depression can occur, and toxicity risk rises with renal impairment. In patients with myasthenia gravis, magnesium can precipitate neuromuscular weakness and respiratory failure, so it is relatively contraindicated or requires extreme caution with readiness to treat hypermagnesemia using calcium gluconate and supportive measures if needed [^113eJgBx] [^113MUhRW] [^115VKgZP] [^1129d6To]. Hold on, I should verify monitoring advice. During infusion, checking blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and deep tendon reflexes is reasonable, and slowing or stopping the infusion if respiratory rate drops or hypotension develops is advised in protocols adapted from obstetric safety practices, even though these derive from different indications [^113bULBr].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. For adults with acute asthma, if the patient has severe features and remains in significant distress or has FEV1 less than about 50 percent predicted after an hour of optimal inhaled bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids, a single 2 g IV magnesium infusion over 15–30 minutes is reasonable and may reduce admission and modestly improve breathlessness. If the exacerbation is mild to moderate or the patient is improving, magnesium is unlikely to help and should be avoided [^116hNHji] [^111AiAMp]. For children with moderate to severe asthma not responding to initial therapy, IV magnesium can be considered given consistent signals for reduced admission, whereas nebulized magnesium should not be used routinely despite small physiologic gains, given lack of clinical outcome benefit [^114nqCHR] [^1149UHwk]. For COPD, in patients with severe dyspnea and limited response to standard bronchodilators and steroids, a cautious trial of IV magnesium may be reasonable, acknowledging low-certainty evidence and the need to monitor vitals and neuromuscular status during infusion [^114bVvbg].

> Bottom line, I should confirm the core message. Magnesium sulfate is not a remedy for routine breathlessness in asthma or COPD; it offers modest, context-specific benefits for severe, refractory exacerbations in which bronchospasm predominates, with IV administration showing clearer signals than nebulized, and with the most consistent benefit in children for IV therapy and no convincing clinical benefit for nebulized therapy in either adults or children; use it selectively after first-line therapy fails, monitor closely, and avoid in patients at risk of magnesium-related neuromuscular depression [^116hNHji] [^114nqCHR] [^116MrWx7] [^111AiAMp].

---

Magnesium sulfate provides modest bronchodilation and may reduce breathlessness in **severe asthma exacerbations** that are refractory to initial therapy [^111AiAMp], with the strongest evidence for intravenous use [^116hNHji]. It is **not recommended for routine use** in mild-to-moderate asthma or COPD exacerbations due to limited and inconsistent benefit [^114bVvbg] [^116MrWx7]. Nebulized magnesium sulfate is generally well tolerated but offers no clear advantage over intravenous administration; use should be reserved for severe cases with close monitoring for hypotension and respiratory depression [^116MrWx7] [^116g3Zus] [^115vVm3u].

## Pharmacological mechanisms relevant to breathlessness

Magnesium sulfate may reduce breathlessness via **bronchodilation** — calcium channel blockade in airway smooth muscle reduces bronchoconstriction [^1128J2GY] — and via **anti-inflammatory effects**, including inhibition of inflammatory mediators that may lessen airway edema and hyperresponsiveness [^1128J2GY].

## Clinical evidence in asthma exacerbations

Key findings comparing routes in acute asthma:

| **Aspect** | **Intravenous magnesium sulfate** | **Nebulized magnesium sulfate** |
|-|-|-|
| Adults | IV magnesium sulfate (2 g over 20 min) reduced hospital admissions by ~25% and improved lung function in severe exacerbations not responding to initial therapy [^116hNHji] [^111AiAMp] | Evidence is mixed; some studies show modest improvements in lung function, but no consistent reduction in hospital admissions or breathlessness [^116MrWx7] [^116g3Zus] |
| Children | IV magnesium reduced hospital admissions by ~68% and improved pulmonary function in moderate-to-severe exacerbations [^114nqCHR] [^115WvJoB] | Meta-analyses show no significant reduction in asthma severity or hospitalizations, though small improvements in peak flow may occur [^1149UHwk] [^1158Ev1L] |
| Guidelines | GINA recommends IV magnesium for severe exacerbations not responding to initial treatment; not for routine use [^111AiAMp] [^113PWQWx] | GINA suggests nebulized isotonic magnesium may be considered in children ≥ 2 years with severe exacerbations, but evidence is limited [^114Su83D] [^116mWAML] |

---

## Clinical evidence in COPD exacerbations

Evidence for magnesium sulfate in COPD is limited and inconsistent; **some studies suggest potential benefits**, but overall certainty is low [^114bVvbg] [^111HgcMr]. A Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to support routine use in COPD exacerbations, citing small, heterogeneous studies [^114bVvbg].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Magnesium sulfate is generally well tolerated; common effects include flushing, warmth, and mild hypotension. Serious adverse effects (e.g. respiratory depression, cardiac arrhythmias) are rare but require monitoring, especially in patients with renal impairment or neuromuscular disorders [^113eJgBx] [^113MUhRW].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines recommend magnesium sulfate as an adjunct in **severe asthma exacerbations** that do not respond to initial bronchodilators and corticosteroids, and **not for routine use** in mild-to-moderate asthma or COPD exacerbations [^111AiAMp] [^113PWQWx] [^113edMMm] [^113CskaK].

---

## Practical clinical implications

- **Patient selection**: Use magnesium sulfate primarily for severe asthma exacerbations refractory to initial therapy.
- **Route of administration**: Intravenous magnesium sulfate has stronger evidence than nebulized formulations.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor for hypotension, respiratory depression, and other adverse effects, especially in patients with renal impairment or neuromuscular disorders [^113eJgBx] [^113MUhRW].
- **Adjunctive therapy**: Magnesium sulfate should be used alongside standard therapies, including bronchodilators and corticosteroids [^113PWQWx].

---

Magnesium sulfate can modestly reduce breathlessness in **severe asthma exacerbations** refractory to initial therapy, particularly when given intravenously [^116hNHji]. It is **not recommended for routine use** in mild-to-moderate asthma or COPD exacerbations due to limited and inconsistent evidence [^111AQcah] [^113CskaK].

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113hqCJX]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Recent GINA updates (2023) suggest against routine use of intravenous MgSO 4, but at the same time, advocate considering it in patients with severe asthma who do not respond to first-line treatment. Though robust data do not support this recommendation, one may argue that there are some potential beneficial effects on pulmonary functions and clinical outcomes, like hospitalisation, without any significant increase in adverse event rates. Hence, it may be justified until better therapies are available. However, the same guideline from GINA suggests considering nebulised MgSO 4 as an adjuvant to salbutamol and ipratropium in children aged > 2 years with severe exacerbation. The evidence does not support this recommendation well. The index systematic review did not observe any significant effect on critical clinical outcomes. The lack of efficacy was consistently seen across almost all studies included in the review, adding to the robustness of the results. Similar observations were reported in previous systematic reviews on nebulised MgSO 4 in children. There was significant improvement (though of lesser magnitude) in PEFR with nebulised MgSO 4, as observed with intravenous MgSO 4 as well, but there was no significant change in FEV₁. However, unlike intravenous MgSO 4, it does not translate to improved clinical outcomes. These findings suggest that the 2023 GINA recommendations might not be in coherence with the updated review and need a revisit on this aspect.

Background

Asthma exacerbations can be frequent and range in severity from relatively mild to status asthmaticus. The use of magnesium sulfate (MgSO(4)) is one of numerous treatment options available during acute exacerbations. While the efficacy of intravenous MgSO(4) has been demonstrated, little is known of the role of inhaled MgSO(4).

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of inhaled MgSO(4) administered in acute asthma on pulmonary functions and admission rates.

Specific Aims

To quantify the effects of inhaled MgSO(4) i) in addition to inhaled β(2)-agonist, ii) in comparison to inhaled β(2)-agonist alone or iii) in addition to combination treatment with inhaled β(2) -agonist and ipratropium bromide.

Search Methods

Randomised controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Group register of trials in September 2012. These trials were supplemented with trials found in the reference list of published studies, studies found using extensive electronic search techniques, as well as a review of the grey literature and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

Randomised (or pseudo-randomised) controlled trials including adults or children with acute asthma were eligible for inclusion in the review. Studies were included if patients were treated with nebulised MgSO(4) alone or in combination with β(2)-agonist and/or ipratropium bromide and were compared with β(2)-agonist alone or inactive control.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial selection, data extraction and risk of bias were assessed independently by two review authors. Efforts were made to collect missing data from authors. Results are presented as standardised mean differences (SMD) for pulmonary function and risk ratios (RR) for hospital admission; both are displayed with their 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Sixteen trials (21 references) of unclear and high risk of bias were eligible and included 896 patients who were randomised (838 patients completed). Seven of the 16 included studies involved adults exclusively, three included adults and paediatric patients, four studies enrolled paediatric patients and in the remaining two studies the age of participants was not stated. The design, definitions, intervention and outcomes were different in all 16 studies; this heterogeneity made direct comparisons difficult (see additional tables 1–3). The overall risk of bias among the included studies was variable and this is reflected in the 'Summary of findings' table with most outcomes being judged as only moderate or less. Inhaled magnesium sulfate in addition to inhaled β(2)-agonistThere was no statistically significant improvement in pulmonary function when inhaled MgSO(4) and β(2)-agonist was compared with β(2)-agonist alone (SMD 0.23; 95% CI -0.27 to 0.74; three studies, n = 188); however, there was considerable between study heterogeneity. There was no clear advantage in terms of hospital admissions (RR 0.76 95% CI 0.49, 1.16; four studies, n = 249), and there were no serious adverse events reported. Inhaled magnesium sulfate versus inhaled β(2)-agonistThe results of pulmonary function in three studies that compared inhaled MgSO(4) versus β(2)-agonist were too heterogeneous to combine; however, two of the studies found poorer lung function on MgSO(4). There was no significant difference in terms of hospital admissions in a single small study when MgSO(4) was compared to β(2)-agonist (RR 0.53 95% CI 0.05, 5.31; one study, n = 33), and there were no serious adverse events reported. Inhaled magnesium sulfate in addition to inhaled β(2)-agonist and ipratropiumA further comparison has been included in the 2012 update of this review of MgSO(4) given in addition to inhaled ipratropium and β(2)-agonist therapy (as recommended by the GINA guidelines). However, there is not yet enough data for this outcome to come to any definite conclusions, but both small studies in adults with severe asthma exacerbation found improvements in pulmonary function with additional inhaled MgSO(4).

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no good evidence that inhaled MgSO(4) can be used as a substitute for inhaled β(2)-agonists. When used in addition to inhaled β(2)-agonists (with or without inhaled ipratropium), there is currently no overall clear evidence of improved pulmonary function or reduced hospital admissions. However, individual study results from three trials suggest possible improved pulmonary function in those with severe asthma exacerbations (FEV1 less than 50% predicted). Heterogeneity among trials included in this review precludes a more definitive conclusion. Further studies should focus on inhaled MgSO(4) in addition to the current guideline treatment for acute asthma (inhaled β(2) -agonist and ipratropium bromide). As the evidence suggests that the most effective role of nebulised MgSO(4) may be in those with severe acute features and this is where future research should be focused. A set of core outcomes needs to be agreed upon both in adult and paediatric studies to allow improved study comparison in future.

Comparison 6: ready to use solution versus reference drug requiring dilution: prevention of preterm birth

This comparison included one trial of 46 women (see Table 3). The trial compared a pre-mixed 'ready-to-use' solution of magnesium sulphate, with a reference drug, a commercially available infusion solution concentrate requiring dilution. All women were given a 4 g IV loading dose followed by 1–2 g/hour IV maintenance.

Life-threatening adverse effects of treatment

There were no maternal deaths, or 'serious' adverse events in either group (Analysis 6.1 and 6.2). There were no data on other primary outcomes.

Interventions to limit adverse effects

There were insufficient data for reliable conclusions about the differential effects on 'withdrawing from the study due to adverse effects' (Analysis 6.3) and one or two injection site changes (Analysis 6.5).

Adverse effects associated with treatment

There were insufficient data for reliable conclusions about the differential effects on any of the adverse effects reported in the trial (adverse events of severe intensity, poor general tolerability, respiratory depression, warmth, nausea and/or vomiting, tiredness, headache, dry mouth, dizziness, sweating, skin redness, burning at injection site, palpitations, constipation, dyspnoea, heart pain, agitation) (Analyses 6.4 and 6.6 to 6.21).

Other outcomes

The trial did not assess other outcomes of interest.

Evidence from non-randomised comparative studies with concurrent controls

Fourteen non-randomised comparative studies with concurrent controls were included (3,615 women): four non-randomised clinical trials (969 women), four prospective before and after studies (78 women), five retrospective cohort studies (2,502 women) and one retrospective case-control study (66 women). Additionally, one historical control study was included (76 women). The detailed characteristics of the studies are presented in Additional file 4, with the risk of bias assessment presented in Figures 5 and 6. For the four non-randomised trials, sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding were not considered adequate (Figure 5). In regards to other comparative studies, for the majority of studies, selection, according to principles of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, was considered adequate (7/11), whilst comparability was largely unclear or not considered adequate, and outcome or exposure assessment was largely unclear (Figure 6).

Magnesium sulfate — children with acute severe asthma: The role of magnesium sulfate is not established for children 5 years and younger; for children ≥ 2 years old with acute severe asthma, nebulized isotonic magnesium sulfate may be considered as an adjuvant to standard treatment within the first hour, particularly when oxygen saturation is < 92% and symptoms last < 6 hours; intravenous magnesium sulfate in a single dose of 40–50 mg/kg (maximum 2 g) by slow infusion (20–60 minutes) has also been used.

### Intravenous and nebulized magnesium sulfate for treating acute asthma in adults and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114trugE]. Respiratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the effects of intravenous and nebulized magnesium sulfate on treating adults and children with acute asthma.

Methods

Electronic literature search and the manual search of key respiratory journals were performed up to October 18, 2011. Randomized controlled trials were included if patients had been treated with intravenous or nebulized magnesium sulfate in combination with β2-agonists and were compared with the use of β2-agonists. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and the relative risks (RRs) were calculated for pulmonary functions and hospital admission respectively.

Results

25 trials (16 intravenous, 9 nebulized) involving 1754 patients were included. In adults intravenous treatment was associated with a significant effect upon respiratory function (SMD, 0.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.05 to 0.55; p = 0.02) but weak evidence of effect upon hospital admission (RR 0.86,95% CI 0.73 to 1.01; p = 0.06) in adults, and in children with significant effects upon both respiratory function (SMD, 1.94; 95% CI, 0.80 to 3.08; p = 0.0008) and hospital admission (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.91; p = 0.008). Nebulized treatment was associated with significant effects upon respiratory function (SMD, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.41; p = 0.009) and hospital admission (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.92; p = 0.02) in adults.

Conclusion

The use of intravenous magnesium sulfate, in addition to β2-agonists and systemic steroids, in the treatment of acute asthma appears to produce benefits with respect to improve pulmonary function and reduce the number of hospital admissions for children, and only improve pulmonary function for adults. However, the use of nebulized magnesium sulfate just appears to produce benefits for adults.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111rGLLt]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Statistical analysis

We used the Review Manager (RevMan) computer program V.5.4 (Cochrane Collaboration, 2020) for data synthesis and meta-analysis. We calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% CIs for continuous variables and relative risk (with 95% CI) for dichotomous variables. As explained above, studies using different scales to measure the same outcome were combined using the generic inverse variance approach.

We used a random-effects model to account for slight variability in the disease severity and dose of the intervention. Heterogeneity in studies was explored by inspection of forest plots as well as using the χ² test on Cochran's Q statistics and I² statistics. We did a sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of studies with high-risk bias on outcomes. We planned a subgroup analysis based on asthma severity. Wherever data permitted, we planned meta-regression to quantify the impact of various covariates (disease severity, age and cumulative dose) on the primary outcome. Publication bias was assessed by examining funnel plot asymmetry. We followed updated Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) recommendations to evaluate the certainty of the evidence and used GRADEPro software to generate the summary of the findings table. Two reviewers (JK and JPG) independently assessed the certainty of the evidence. In case of disagreement, a third researcher (JM) was involved.

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate for acute asthma… [^117NW3PJ]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Is intravenous magnesium sulfate effective for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations. Evidence-Based Answer Patients presenting to the emergency department with an acute asthma exacerbation that has not responded to first-line therapy can be treated effectively with intravenous magnesium sulfate. In children, magnesium sulfate reduced hospital admissions by 68%. In adults, magnesium sulfate reduced admissions by 25%. Evidence Summary A 2016 Cochrane review of three RCTs found that treatment with intravenous magnesium sulfate reduced the odds of hospital admissions by 68% in patients 18 months to 18 years of age who presented to the emergency department with acute asthma exacerbations. A 2014 Cochrane review of 14 RCTs found a 25% reduction in hospital admissions in adults who were treated in the emergency department with intravenous magnesium sulfate for asthma exacerbation. 2 The number needed to treat to prevent one admission was 7. Most of the studies were double-blinded trials comparing intravenous magnesium sulfate vs. placebo after first-line therapy was ineffective. The authors reported statistically significant but clinically minimal improvements in the secondary outcomes of forced expiratory volume in one second and peak expiratory flow. Guidelines from the Global Initiative for Asthma recommend treating patients with acute asthma exacerbation with repeated doses of short-acting bronchodilators, early oral corticosteroids, and controlled-flow oxygen if available.

3 In those with severe exacerbations, ipratropium should be added and nebulized short-acting bronchodilators should be considered. In acute care facilities, intravenous magnesium sulfate may be considered if the patient does not respond to intensive initial treatment. Copyright © Family Physicians Inquiries Network.

### Comparison of nebulized magnesium sulfate plus albuterol to nebulized albuterol plus saline in children with acute exacerbations of mild to moderate asthma [^114QXZUK]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

A prospective, randomized, double blinded study was conducted to determine whether a combination of nebulized magnesium sulfate and albuterol as a single dose adds any benefit in management of children with mild to moderate asthma when compared to nebulized albuterol with saline. The difference in FEV1 was significant at 10 and 20 min after a single dose of the combined treatment with magnesium and albuterol when compared with the albuterol and saline group (1.41 L ± 0.53 vs. 1.13 L ± 0.34, respectively, p = 0.03). The addition of magnesium to albuterol seems to provide short-term benefits in children with acute exacerbations of mild to moderate asthma.

### Use of nebulised magnesium sulphate as an adjuvant in the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD in adults: a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^113XoWAA]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Intravenous magnesium has been shown to cause bronchodilation in acute severe asthma and in small trials in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). There is also some evidence of benefit from nebulised magnesium in acute severe asthma. Our hypothesis was that adjuvant magnesium treatment administered via repeated nebulisation was effective in the management of AECOPD.

Methods

In this randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial, we approached 161 patients with AECOPD presenting to the emergency departments at two New Zealand hospitals with a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) < 50% predicted 20 min after initial administration of salbutamol 2.5 mg and ipratropium 500 µg via nebulisation. Patients received 2.5 mg salbutamol mixed with either 2.5 mL isotonic magnesium sulphate (151 mg per dose) or 2.5 mL isotonic saline (placebo) on three occasions at 30 min intervals via nebuliser. The primary outcome measure was FEV1 at 90 min.

Results

116 patients were randomised, 52 of whom were randomly allocated to the magnesium adjuvant group. At 90 min the mean (SD) FEV1 in the magnesium group (N = 47) was 0.78 (0.33) l compared with 0.81 (0.30) l in the saline group (N = 61) (difference -0.026 l (95% CI -0.15 to 0.095, p = 0.67). No patients required non-invasive ventilation. There were 43/48 admissions to hospital in the magnesium group and 56/61 in the saline group (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.10, p = 0.69).

Conclusions

Nebulised magnesium as an adjuvant to salbutamol treatment in the setting of AECOPD has no effect on FEV1. Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12608000167369.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11421Vfe]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Secondary outcomes

Children who received MgSO 4 have significantly better PEFR (presented as % predicted) than the control group (2 RCTs, 145 participants; MD: 19.3; 95% CI: 8.9 to 29.8; I² = 0%) (figure 4A). However, there was no significant difference in FEV 1 (MD: 8.1; 95% CI: −3 to +19). We also compared the effect of MgSO 4 and placebo on physiological parameters (heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation). Infants who received MgSO 4 have slightly lower respiratory rates than the control group (MD: 0.9; 95% CI: −1.4 to −0.4); however, having any clinical significance was unlikely. There was no significant difference in heart rate and oxygen saturation (figure 4B). There was no significant difference in the need for hospitalisation, ICU admission or hospital stay (table 1 and online supplemental figures 1–3). There are some concerns that MgSO 4 can lead to respiratory depression, hypotension and bradycardia; therefore, we compared adverse events between the two groups as a safety outcome. We did not observe any increased adverse event rates with MgSO 4 (online supplemental figure 4 and table 1).

### Medication regimens for managing acute asthma [^113nFGzY]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbation is defined as a progressive increase in symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, or wheezing sufficient to require a change in therapy. After ruling out diagnoses that mimic an asthma exacerbation, therapy should be initiated. Short-acting β 2 agonists and short-acting muscarinic antagonists are effective as bronchodilators for asthma in the acute setting. Systemic corticosteroids to reduce airway inflammation continue to be the mainstay therapy for asthma exacerbations, and, unless there is a contraindication, the oral route is favored. Based on the current evidence, nebulized magnesium should not be routinely used in acute asthma. The evidence favors the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate in selected cases, particularly in severe exacerbations. Methylxanthines have a minimum role as therapy for asthma exacerbations but may be considered in refractory cases of status asthmaticus with careful monitoring of toxicity. Current guidelines recommend the use of helium-oxygen mixtures in patients who do not respond to standard therapies or those with severe disease.

### The role of magnesium sulfate in acute asthma: does route of administration make a difference? [^116ifTNd]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The role of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) in the treatment of acute asthma is not clear. Four recent systematic reviews suggest a limited role of intravenous (i.v.) and inhaled nebulized treatment. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current literature, focus on two recent large multicenter randomized controlled trials, and discuss future research directions.

Recent Findings

The Magnesium Nebulized Trial In Children (MAGNETIC) trial has shown little benefit to routine use of nebulized MgSO4 in children with acute asthma, but there may be a benefit in those with severe exacerbations and a shorter duration of symptoms. The 3Mg trial has shown no role for nebulized MgSO4 in adults and, at best a limited role for i.v. MgSO4 in only the most severe exacerbations. This is the only study with direct comparison of nebulized and i.v. MgSO4.

Summary

MgSO4 has a role in severe exacerbations of acute asthma and there is no evidence of benefit outside this clinical situation. Both nebulized and i.v. treatments are well tolerated and inexpensive. In adults, the most effective route of administration is i.v. There are no direct comparison studies in children. Further research should focus on more severe exacerbations.

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate for treating adults with acute asthma in the emergency department [^116hNHji]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterised by airways inflammation, constriction of airway smooth muscle and structural alteration of the airways that is at least partially reversible. Exacerbations of asthma can be life threatening and place a significant burden on healthcare services. Various guidelines have been published to inform management personnel in the acute setting; several include the use of a single bolus of intravenous magnesium sulfate (IV MgSO4) in cases that do not respond to first-line treatment. However, the effectiveness of this approach remains unclear, particularly in less severe cases.

Objectives

To assess the safety and efficacy of IV MgSO4 in adults treated for acute asthma in the emergency department.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Review Group Specialised Register (CAGR) up to 2 May 2014. We also searched www. ClinicalTrials.gov and reference lists of other reviews, and we contacted trial authors to ask for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults treated in the emergency department (ED) for exacerbations of asthma if they compared any dose of IV MgSO4 with placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

All review authors screened titles and abstracts for inclusion, and at least two review authors independently extracted study characteristics, risk of bias and numerical data. Disagreements were resolved by consensus, and we contacted trial investigators to obtain missing information. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios using study participants as the unit of analysis, and we analysed continuous data as mean differences or standardised mean differences using fixed-effect models. We rated all outcomes using GRADE and presented results in Summary of findings table 1. We carried out subgroup analyses on the primary outcome for baseline severity of exacerbations and whether or not ipratropium bromide was given as a co-medication. Unpublished data and studies at high risk of bias for blinding were removed from the main analysis in sensitivity analyses.

Main Results

Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria, randomly assigning 2313 people with acute asthma to the comparisons of interest in this review. Most studies were double-blinded trials comparing a single infusion of 1.2 g or 2 g IV MgSO4 over 15 to 30 minutes versus a matching placebo. Eleven were conducted at a single centre, and three were multi-centre trials. Participants in almost all of the studies had already been given at least oxygen, nebulised short-acting beta2-agonists and IV corticosteroids in the ED; in some studies, investigators also administered ipratropium bromide. Ten studies included only adults, and four included both adults and children; these were included because the mean age of participants was over 18 years. Intravenous MgSO4 reduced hospital admissions compared with placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.92; I² = 28%, P value 0.18; n = 972; high-quality evidence). In absolute terms, this odds ratio translates into a reduction of seven hospital admissions for every 100 adults treated with IV MgSO4 (95% CI two to 13 fewer). The test for subgroup differences revealed no statistical heterogeneity between the three severity subgroups (I² = 0%, P value 0.73) or between the four studies that administered nebulised ipratropium bromide as a co-medication and those that did not (I² = 0%, P value 0.82). Sensitivity analyses in which unpublished data and studies at high risk for blinding were removed from the primary analysis did not change conclusions. Within the secondary outcomes, high- and moderate-quality evidence across three spirometric indices suggests some improvement in lung function with IV MgSO4. No difference was found between IV MgSO4and placebo for most of the non-spirometric secondary outcomes, all of which were rated as low or moderate quality (intensive care admissions, ED treatment duration, length of hospital stay, readmission, respiration rate, systolic blood pressure). Adverse events were inconsistently reported and were not meta-analysed. The most commonly cited adverse events in the IV MgSO4 groups were flushing, fatigue, nausea and headache and hypotension (low blood pressure).

Authors' Conclusions

This review provides evidence that a single infusion of 1.2 g or 2 g IV MgSO4 over 15 to 30 minutes reduces hospital admissions and improves lung function in adults with acute asthma who have not responded sufficiently to oxygen, nebulised short-acting beta2-agonists and IV corticosteroids. Differences in the ways the trials were conducted made it difficult for the review authors to assess whether severity of the exacerbation or additional co-medications altered the treatment effect of IV MgSO4. Limited evidence was found for other measures of benefit and safety. Studies conducted in these populations should clearly define baseline severity parameters and systematically record adverse events. Studies recruiting participants with exacerbations of varying severity should consider subgrouping results on the basis of accepted severity classifications.

### Aerosolized magnesium sulfate for acute asthma: a systematic review [^116NhTEE]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The use of MgSO(4) is one of numerous treatment options available during exacerbations of asthma. While the efficacy of therapy with IV MgSO(4) has been demonstrated, little is known about inhaled MgSO(4).

Objectives

A systematic review of the literature was performed to examine the effect of inhaled MgSO(4) in the treatment of patients with asthma exacerbations in the emergency department.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials were eligible for inclusion and were identified from the Cochrane Airways Group "Asthma and Wheez" register, which consists of a combined search of the EMBASE, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and CINAHL databases and the manual searching of 20 key respiratory journals. Reference lists of published studies were searched, and a review of the gray literature was also performed. Studies were included if patients had been treated with nebulized MgSO(4) alone or in combination with beta(2)-agonists and were compared to the use of beta(2)-agonists alone or with an inactive control substance. Trial selection, data extraction, and methodological quality were assessed by two independent reviewers. The results from fixed-effects models are presented as standardized mean differences (SMDs) for pulmonary functions and the relative risks (RRs) for hospital admission. Both are displayed with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

Six trials involving 296 patients were included. There was a non-significant increase in pulmonary function between patients whose treatments included nebulized MgSO(4) and those whose treatments did not (SMD, 0.22; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.47 five studies); there was also a trend toward reduced hospitalizations in patients whose treatments included nebulized MgSO(4) (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.41 to 1.09; four studies). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that lung function improvement was similar in adult patients and in those patients who received nebulized MgSO(4) in addition to a beta(2)-agonist.

Conclusions

The use of nebulized MgSO(4), particularly in addition to a beta(2)-agonist, in the treatment of an acute asthma exacerbation appears to produce benefits with respect to improved pulmonary function and may reduce the number of hospital admissions.

### Optimizing the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate for acute asthma treatment in children [^111yAzKU]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is the most common pediatric chronic disease and currently affects 7.1 million children in the United States. Many children experience acute asthma exacerbations. Many children also require hospitalization despite treatment in an emergency department with current standard therapy (corticosteroids, albuterol, and ipratropium). These hospitalizations may be avoided if effective adjunctive therapies can be developed to adequately treat severe exacerbations.

Methods

Publications were searched in the PubMed database using the following keywords: magnesium AND asthma AND children AND randomized controlled trial. A total of 30 publications were returned. References of relevant articles were also screened. We included publications of controlled randomized trials where intravenous magnesium sulfate was studied in children (age < 18 years) with acute asthma (n = 7). We excluded studies in adults or trials with other formulations of magnesium (e.g., nebulized).

Results

Previous studies have demonstrated that intravenous magnesium sulfate (IV MgSO 4) significantly improves respiratory function and reduces hospitalization rate in children with moderate to severe asthma exacerbations. Current dosing regimens involve a short infusion of 25–75mg/kg over 20min (maximum 2–2.5g/dose), though no studies have directly compared dosages for relative efficacy. Several studies suggest utilizing a peak plasma concentration of magnesium higher than 4mg/dL as a surrogate of efficacy. This review summarizes the literature regarding the use of IV MgSO 4 for the treatment of pediatric acute asthma.

Conclusions

We suggest that optimized dosing regimens could be developed using a linked pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling and simulation approach. We propose the factors that should be considered in future clinical trial design in order to better understand the use of IV MgSO 4 in pediatric acute asthma.

### Nebulized magnesium for moderate and severe pediatric asthma: a randomized trial [^112UkHea]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Intravenous magnesium sulfate, a rescue therapy added to bronchodilator and systemic steroid therapy for moderate and severe asthma, is uncommonly administered. We hypothesized that nebulized magnesium would confer benefit without undue risk.

Design and Methods

Patients aged 2 to 14 y with moderate and severe asthma (PRAM severity score ≥ 4) admitted to infirmary/observation unit care were randomized double-blind on admission to receive 800 mg nebulized magnesium or normal saline placebo after all received intensive therapy with combined nebulized albuterol-ipratropium and intravenous methylprednisolone. Time to medical readiness for discharge was the primary outcome; sample size was chosen to detect a 15% absolute improvement. Improvement over time in PRAM severity score and other secondary outcomes were compared for the overall group and severe asthma subset.

Results

One hundred and ninety-one magnesium sulfates and 174 placebo patients met criteria for analysis. The groups were similar with mean baseline PRAM scores > 7. Blinded active therapy significantly increased blood magnesium level 2 hr post-treatment completion compared to placebo, 0.85 vs 0.82 mmol/L, P = 0.001. There were no important adverse effects. Accelerated failure time analysis showed a non-significantly shortened time to medical readiness for discharge of 14% favoring the magnesium sulfate group, OR = 1.14, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.40, P = 0.20. Mean times until readiness for discharge were 14.7 hr [SD 9.7] versus 15.6 hr [SD 11.3] for the investigational and placebo groups, respectively, P = 0.41.

Conclusions

Adding nebulized magnesium to combined nebulized bronchodilator and systemic steroid therapy failed to significantly shorten time to discharge of pediatric patients with moderate or severe asthma.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1158Ev1L]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Objectives

To review the efficacy of nebulised magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4) in acute asthma in children.

Methods

The authors searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published until 15 December 2023. RCTs were included if they compared the efficacy and safety of nebulised MgSO 4 as a second-line agent in children presenting with acute asthma exacerbation. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed, and the Risk of Bias V.2 tool was used to assess the biases among them.

Results

10 RCTs enrolling 2301 children with acute asthma were included. All trials were placebo controlled and administered nebulised MgSO 4 /placebo and salbutamol (± ipratropium bromide). There was no significant difference in Composite Asthma Severity Score between the two groups (6 RCTs, 1953 participants; standardised mean difference: -0.09; 95%CI: -0.2 to +0.02, I² = 21%). Children in the MgSO 4 group have significantly better peak expiratory flow rate (% predicted) than the control group (2 RCTs, 145 participants; mean difference: 19.3; 95%CI: 8.9 to 29.8; I² = 0%). There was no difference in the need for hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission or duration of hospital stay. Adverse events were minor, infrequent (7.3%) and similar among the two groups.

Conclusions

There is low-certainty evidence that nebulised MgSO 4 as an add-on second-line therapy for acute asthma in children does not reduce asthma severity or a need for hospitalisation. However, it was associated with slightly better lung functions. The current evidence does not support the routine use of nebulised MgSO 4 in paediatric acute asthma management.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111AQcah]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

### The role of magnesium sulfate in the acute and chronic management of asthma [^114JWusN]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute asthma is common and severe exacerbations may result in hospitalization, need for endotracheal intubation and, rarely, death. Standard emergency care includes systemic corticosteroids and bronchodilators, but additional treatments may be required in severe cases. We summarize the substantial evidence regarding the role of MgSO4 in acute asthma and comments on the potential benefit in chronic asthma.

Recent Findings

Inhaled and intravenous MgSO4 agents are used in the treatment of acute asthma, but only the intravenous formulation is effective. In severe asthma exacerbations, a single bolus dose of intravenous MgSO4 reduces admissions and improves pulmonary functions. Inhaled MgSO4 is more effective than placebo as a bronchodilator, but performs no better than salbutamol and there is no apparent synergy when the two are combined. Whereas intravenous MgSO4 treatments appear to be effective, long-term 'replacement' therapy with magnesium does not appear to affect chronic asthma.

Summary

Evidence suggests that intravenous MgSO4 is beneficial in acute asthma, while the evidence for inhaled MgSO4 is less convincing. Moreover, the role of replacement therapy with oral magnesium remains to be clarified. The use of intravenous MgSO4 remains uncommon, with emergency physicians appropriately restricting its use to patients with severe exacerbations.

### Evidence-based treatments for acute asthma [^111e9ijX]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Asthma is an important health care problem; over 12 million people in the United States suffer from asthma, the majority of whom are young patients. Presentations of acute asthma to emergency departments are common. In the United States, acute asthma presentations account for close to 2 million emergency department visits annually, and these patients often exhibit acute and chronic markers of severe asthma; so controlling asthma is important from many perspectives. We review the evidence for various acute asthma therapies, using the highest levels of evidence, employing systematic reviews (especially those from the Cochrane Collaboration) and evidence from randomized controlled trials to guide therapy decisions. beta agonists and systemic corticosteroids are the cornerstones of initial treatment. Delivery of beta agonists via nebulizer or metered-dose inhaler with spacer device appear to be similarly efficacious. However, recent evidence from studies involving children and adults indicate that addition of ipratropium bromide to early beta agonist treatments may reduce airway obstruction and reduce hospital admissions, especially for more severe asthma. Evidence from systematic reviews indicates that intravenous magnesium sulfate may provide similar benefits in severe asthma. Antibiotics, intravenous beta agonists, and intravenous aminophylline have been shown to add little and may increase adverse effects. Treatment for discharged patients should include systemic corticosteroids for 5–7 days, for all but the mildest asthma. Addition of inhaled corticosteroids should be considered for most patients, since evidence suggests that inhaled corticosteroids may reduce relapses and improve quality of life. Alternative treatments such as long-acting beta agonists and leukotriene antagonists remain unproven in this setting. Linking a discharge plan to close follow-up and asthma education (especially an action plan) needs to be encouraged. Acute asthma is a common problem and treatment has improved dramatically over the past 10 years. Employing the evidence-based practice outlined above should reduce the burden of acute asthma on patients and the health care system.

### The effect of nebulized magnesium sulfate in the treatment of moderate to severe asthma attacks: a randomized clinical trial [^111AGDV6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Thirty percent of people with asthma do not respond to standard treatment, and complementary therapies are needed. The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of inhaled magnesium sulfate on the treatment response in emergency department (ED) patients with moderate to severe attacks of asthma.

Methods

This study is a randomized controlled trial, enrolling patients with moderate to severe asthma in the ED. Subjects allocated to the study group were treated with the standard, plus 3 mL of 260 mmol/L solution of magnesium sulfate every 20 to 60 minutes. The control group was treated with nebulized saline as a placebo in addition to standard protocol. The study results included admission rate and changes in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) (primary outcomes) as well as dyspnea severity score, respiratory rate and peripheral oxygen saturation.

Results

A total of 50 patients were enrolled (25 allocated to the study group and 25 to the control group). The study group as compared to the control group had significantly more improvement in the intensity of dyspnea, PEFR and Spo2 20, 40 and 60 minutes after intervention. In the control group, 11 patients (44%) required admission as compared to 18 (72%) in the control group (P = 0.02).

Conclusion

Adding nebulized magnesium sulfate to standard therapy in patients with moderate to severe asthma attacks leads to greater and faster improvement in PEFR, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and respiratory rate. It also reduces hospitalization rates in this patient population.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116mWAML]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 12–4 — Initial emergency department management of asthma exacerbations in children 5 years and younger outlines immediate therapies and dosing. Supplemental oxygen is delivered by face nasal prongs or mask to maintain oxygen saturation at 94–98%. Short-acting beta agonist (SABA) dosing is 2–6 puffs of salbutamol by spacer, or 2.5 mg by nebulizer, every 20 minutes for the first hour, then severity is reassessed; if symptoms persist or recur, give an additional 2–3 puffs per hour and admit to hospital if > 10 puffs are required in 3–4 hours. Systemic corticosteroids include an initial oral prednisolone dose of 1–2 mg/kg up to a maximum 20 mg for children < 2 years old or 30 mg for children 2–5 years, or intravenous methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg 6-hourly on day 1. Additional options in the first hour are to consider adding ipratropium bromide (1–2 puffs by pMDI and spacer; if poor response to initial SABA, nebulized ipratropium bromide 250 mcg every 20 minutes for 1 hour only) and to consider nebulized isotonic magnesium sulfate (150 mg) as 3 doses in the first hour for children aged ≥ 2 years with severe exacerbation. If inhalation is not possible, an intravenous bolus of terbutaline 2 mcg/kg may be given over 5 minutes, followed by continuous infusion of 5 mcg/kg/hour.

### Asthma in adults [^114WFcbt]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 10% of adults have suffered an attack of asthma, and up to 5% of these have severe disease that responds poorly to treatment. Patients with severe disease have an increased risk of death, but patients with mild to moderate disease are also at risk of exacerbations. Most guidelines about the management of asthma follow stepwise protocols. This review does not endorse or follow any particular protocol, but presents the evidence about specific interventions.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for chronic, and for acute asthma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to October 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 121 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: for acute asthma: beta(2) agonists (plus Ipratropium bromide, nebulisers, pressured metered-dose inhalers, short-acting continuous nebulised, short-acting intermittent nebulised, short-acting intravenous), corticosteroids (inhaled), corticosteroids (single oral, combined inhaled, short courses), education about acute asthma, generalist care, helium-oxygen mixture, magnesium sulphate (intravenous, adding isotonic nebulised magnesium to inhaled beta(2) agonists), mechanical ventilation, oxygen supplementation (controlled 28% oxygen, controlled 100% oxygen), specialist care. For chronic asthma: beta(2) agonists (adding long-acting inhaled when poorly controlled by inhaled corticosteroids, or short-acting inhaled as needed for symptom relief), inhaled corticosteroids (low dose, increasing dose), leukotriene antagonists (with or without inhaled corticosteroids), theophylline (when poorly controlled by inhaled corticosteroids).

### Maternal adverse effects of different antenatal magnesium sulphate regimens for improving maternal and infant outcomes: a systematic review [^114CLfwY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Inclusion criteria

Studies

We included intervention (randomised, cluster-randomised, quasi-randomised and non-randomised comparative studies) and observational studies (cohort, case-control, cross-sectional, case series and case reports). We included studies available as abstracts only, along with full-text publications. Personal blogs and discussion forum threads from pregnancy-related internet sites were included, along with incident reports from patient safety organisations.

Participants, interventions and comparisons

We included women given antenatal magnesium sulphate: for pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (including when it was continued/initiated in the immediate postpartum period); for tocolysis to women in preterm labour or who had had at least one episode of threatened preterm labour; for neuroprotection of the fetus, to women considered at risk of preterm birth (less than 37 weeks' gestation), or at term, regardless of the regimen for administration (including iatrogenic overdoses). We excluded studies where women were given oral magnesium sulphate, and where magnesium sulphate was given as an adjuvant during anaesthesia, or where magnesium sulphate was given in combination with another agent for tocolysis. We included instances where magnesium sulphate was compared to no placebo, placebo or to a different magnesium sulphate regimen, and/or, where the study's exposure was magnesium sulphate. We excluded studies where magnesium sulphate was compared to an alternative therapy.

Outcomes

We included studies that reported data on maternal adverse effects associated with magnesium sulphate. Primary outcomes were life-threatening adverse effects of treatment (death, cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest). Secondary outcomes included other maternal-reported or clinical maternal adverse effects attributed to treatment (e.g. warmth and flushing, arm discomfort), outcomes associated with interventions to reduce potential/actual adverse effects (e.g. use of calcium gluconate, discontinuation of treatment), and other outcomes of interest (including caesarean section, pulmonary oedema, and postpartum haemorrhage). We used the definitions as used by the study authors.

Study selection

After screening all titles and abstracts, we obtained the full-text article for any study which appeared to meet the inclusion criteria based on the title and/or abstract, along with any reviews that may have provided relevant references. All full-text articles and abstracts were assessed for inclusion. Each stage was carried out by one reviewer (ESB) with the second reviewer (PFM) assessing a random sample (10% of the total). We resolved any discrepancies through discussion, or if required, we consulted the third reviewer (CAC).

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate for bronchial hyperreactivity: a randomized, controlled, double-blind study [^113M3Spn]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Magnesium has been shown to be helpful in the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma. Conflicting data exist concerning the effect of magnesium on bronchial hyperreactivity.

Methods

We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the effect of intravenous magnesium sulfate on bronchial reactivity to metacholine in 30 subjects with bronchial hyperreactivity. Two days after baseline metacholine provocation, 20 subjects received 0.3 mmol/kg/h of intravenous magnesium sulfate and 10 subjects received normal saline solution. Metacholine provocation was repeated 30 minutes after the initiation of the magnesium or placebo infusion.

Results

The difference of the postinterventional minus the baseline provocative dose of metacholine required to decrease the forced expiratory volume in 1 second by 20% (PC20) was significantly higher in the magnesium group compared with the placebo group (0.48 ± 0.46 mg/mL versus 0.05 ± 0.73 mg/mL, P = 0.028). In the magnesium group, the PC(20) significantly increased (from 0.83 ± 0.54 mg/mL to 1.31 ± 0.66 mg/mL, P = 0.0001), whereas there was no change in the placebo group (0.86 ± 0.52 mg/mL to 0.91 ± 0.54 mg/mL, P = 0.83).

Conclusions

In the magnesium group, 30% of the subjects reached a normal PC(20) compared with 10% in the placebo group. We conclude that intravenous magnesium sulfate significantly improved bronchial hyperreactivity and may serve as an adjunct to standard treatment.

### Magnesium sulfate for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114bVvbg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic and progressive disease, often punctuated by recurrent flare-ups or exacerbations. Magnesium sulfate, having a bronchodilatory effect, may have a potential role as an adjunct treatment in COPD exacerbations. However, comprehensive evidence of its effects is required to facilitate clinical decision-making.

Objectives

To assess the effects of magnesium sulfate for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal, EU Clinical Trials Register and Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials. We also searched the proceedings of major respiratory conferences and reference lists of included studies up to 2 August 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included single- or double-blind parallel-group randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing magnesium sulfate in adults with COPD exacerbations. We excluded cross-over trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The primary outcomes were: hospital admissions (from the emergency room); need for non-invasive ventilation (NIV), assisted ventilation or admission to intensive-care unit (ICU); and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were: length of hospital stay, mortality, adverse events, dyspnoea score, lung function and blood gas measurements. We assessed confidence in the evidence using GRADE methodology. For missing data, we contacted the study investigators.

Main Results

We identified 11 RCTs (10 double-blind and 1 single-blind) with a total 762 participants. The mean age of participants ranged from 62 to 76 years. Trials were single- or two-centre trials conducted in Iran, New Zealand, Nepal, Turkey, the UK, Tunisia and the USA between 2004 and 2018. We judged studies to be at low or unclear risk of bias for most of the domains. Three studies were at high risk for blinding and other biases. Intravenous magnesium sulfate versus placebo Seven studies (24 to 77 participants) were included. Fewer people may require hospital admission with magnesium infusion compared to placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.45, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.88; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 7; 3 studies, 170 participants; low-certainty evidence). Intravenous magnesium may result in little to no difference in the requirement for non-invasive ventilation (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.75; very low-certainty evidence). There were no reported cases of endotracheal intubation (2 studies, 107 participants) or serious adverse events (1 study, 77 participants) in either group. Included studies did not report intensive care unit (ICU) admission or deaths. Magnesium infusion may reduce the length of hospital stay by a mean difference (MD) of 2.7 days (95% CI 4.73 days to 0.66 days; 2 studies, 54 participants; low-certainty evidence) and improve dyspnoea score by a standardised mean difference of -1.40 (95% CI -1.83 to -0.96; 2 studies, 101 participants; low-certainty evidence). We were uncertain about the effect of magnesium infusion on improving lung function or oxygen saturation. For all adverse events, the Peto OR was 0.14 (95% CI 0.02 to 1.00; 102 participants); however, the event rate was too low to reach a robust conclusion. Nebulised magnesium sulfate versus placebo Three studies (20 to 172 participants) were included. Magnesium inhalation may have little to no impact on hospital admission (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.82; very low-certainty evidence) or need for ventilatory support (NIV or mechanical ventilation) (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.20; very low-certainty evidence). It may result in fewer ICU admissions compared to placebo (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.00; very low-certainty evidence) and improvement in dyspnoea (MD -14.37, 95% CI -26.00 to -2.74; 1 study, 20 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were no serious adverse events reported in either group. There was one reported death in the placebo arm in one trial, but the number of participants was too small for a conclusion. There was limited evidence about the effect of magnesium inhalation on length of hospital stay, lung function outcomes or oxygen saturation. Included studies did not report adverse events. Magnesium sulfate versus ipratropium bromide A single study with 124 participants assessed nebulised magnesium sulfate plus intravenous magnesium infusion versus nebulised ipratropium plus intravenous normal saline. There was little to no difference between these groups in terms of hospital admission (OR 1.62, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.37), endotracheal intubation (OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.71) and length of hospital stay (MD 1.10 days, 95% CI -0.22 to 2.42), all with very low-certainty evidence. There were no data available for non-invasive ventilation, ICU admission and serious adverse events. Adverse events were not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous magnesium sulfate may be associated with fewer hospital admissions, reduced length of hospital stay and improved dyspnoea scores compared to placebo. There is no evidence of a difference between magnesium infusion and placebo for NIV, lung function, oxygen saturation or adverse events. We found no evidence for ICU admission, endotracheal intubation, serious adverse events or mortality. For nebulised magnesium sulfate, we are unable to draw conclusions about its effects in COPD exacerbations for most of the outcomes. Studies reported possibly lower ICU admissions and a lesser degree of dyspnoea with magnesium inhalation compared to placebo; however, larger studies are required to yield a more precise estimate for these outcomes. Similarly, we could not identify any robust evidence for magnesium sulfate compared to ipratropium bromide. Future well-designed multicentre trials with larger samples are required, including subgroups according to severity of exacerbations and COPD phenotypes.

### Asthma in adults (acute): magnesium sulfate treatment [^112rkSc5]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 10% of adults have suffered an attack of asthma, and up to 5% of these have severe disease that responds poorly to treatment. Patients with severe disease have an increased risk of death, but patients with mild to moderate disease are also at risk of exacerbations. Most guidelines about the management of asthma follow stepwise protocols. This overview does not endorse or follow any particular protocol, but presents the evidence about a specific intervention, magnesium sulfate.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of magnesium sulfate for acute asthma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to November 2014 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 50 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 24 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 10 studies and the further review of 14 full publications. Of the 14 full articles evaluated, one systematic review was updated and one systematic review was added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for five PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic overview, we categorised the efficacy for two comparisons based on information about the effectiveness and safety of magnesium sulfate (iv) versus placebo and magnesium sulfate (nebulised) plus short-acting beta2 agonists (inhaled) versus short-acting beta2 agonists (inhaled) alone.

### Magnesium should be given to all children presenting to hospital with acute severe asthma [^116SpXFQ]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Asthma is one of the most prevalent chronic condition affecting children worldwide and acute exacerbations requiring emergency medical management are common. In addition to corticosteroids, a number of drugs may be used in the management of acute severe asthma aiming to reverse bronchoconstriction. Magnesium sulphate - either inhaled or intravenous - may be added to conventional therapy of children with acute severe asthma. Despite its safety profile and effectiveness, the use of magnesium sulphate has been inconsistent due to lack of consensus. The authors believe that the accumulating evidence of a favorable 'cost benefit' profile justifies the use of magnesium for all children presenting with acute severe asthma.

### A randomized trial comparing metered dose inhalers and breath actuated nebulizers [^113VE73p]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Despite little evidence for its effectiveness, the breath-actuated nebulizer (BAN) is the default albuterol delivery method in our pediatric emergency department.

Objective

We compared the clinical efficacy of BAN and the metered-dose inhaler (MDI) in treating subjects patients 2 to 17 years of age who presented with mild to moderate asthma exacerbations.

Methods

This is a randomized, nonblinded, noninferiority study conducted at a single pediatric tertiary care emergency department. Subjects presenting with a Pediatric Asthma Score ranging from 5 to 11 received albuterol by BAN or MDI via standard weight-based and symptom severity dosing protocols. Aerosolized ipratropium (via BAN) and intravenous magnesium sulfate were given when clinically indicated. The primary outcome was patient disposition. The noninferiority margin for the primary outcome was an admission rate difference ≤ 10%. Analyses were adjusted for confounders that were significant at p ≤ 0.10.

Results

We enrolled 890 subjects between October 2014 and April 2015. BAN and MDI groups were comparable for age, gender, and race but not for pretreatment symptom severity; 51% in the MDI group had a Pediatric Asthma Score of moderate severity (8–11) vs. 63% in the BAN group (p < 0.003). Unadjusted admission rates were 11.9% for MDI and 12.8% for BAN, for an unadjusted risk difference of -0.9% (95% confidence interval -5% to 3%). After adjusting for baseline confounder severity, the risk difference was 2% (95% confidence interval -4% to 7%), which met the criteria for noninferiority.

Conclusions

Albuterol therapy by MDI is noninferior to BAN for the treatment of mild to moderate asthma exacerbations in children 2 to 17 years of age.

### The role of oral magnesium supplements for the management of stable bronchial asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111cn2Tu]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, GINA guidelines defined adults as those 6 years old and above. This dichotomy is not used in many of the available studies. Clearer details regarding trial methodology, particularly about sequence generation and allocation concealment would help future systematic reviewers appraise the literature more properly. Additionally, clear stratification by oral magnesium dose and duration of therapy can help produce more precise and useful estimates. Finally, none of the RCTs provided their research protocol.

The use of magnesium supplements as an adjuvant to standard asthma treatment in mild to moderate asthmatic patients is not supported by high quality evidence. Apart from one point at week 8 where the FEV1 had significantly improved, no other benefits from oral magnesium supplements were seen. Until future higher quality evidence emerges, oral magnesium cannot be recommended for mild to moderate asthma.

### Asthma in adults [^111xj3A3]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 10% of adults have suffered an attack of asthma, and up to 5% of these have severe disease that responds poorly to treatment. Patients with severe disease have an increased risk of death, but patients with mild-to-moderate disease are also at risk of exacerbations. Most guidelines about the management of asthma follow stepwise protocols. This review does not endorse or follow any particular protocol, but presents the evidence about specific interventions.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for chronic asthma? What are the effects of treatments for acute asthma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 99 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions. For acute asthma: beta(2) agonists (plus ipratropium bromide, pressured metered-dose inhalers, short-acting continuous nebulised, short-acting intermittent nebulised, and short-acting intravenous); corticosteroids (inhaled); corticosteroids (single oral, combined inhaled, and short courses); education about acute asthma; generalist care; helium-oxygen mixture (heliox); magnesium sulphate (intravenous and adding isotonic nebulised magnesium to inhaled beta(2) agonists); mechanical ventilation; oxygen supplementation (controlled 28% oxygen and controlled 100% oxygen); and specialist care. For chronic asthma: beta(2) agonists (adding long-acting inhaled beta(2) agonists when asthma is poorly controlled by inhaled corticosteroids, or short-acting inhaled beta(2) agonists as needed for symptom relief); inhaled corticosteroids (low dose and increasing dose); leukotriene antagonists (with or without inhaled corticosteroids); and theophylline (when poorly controlled by inhaled corticosteroids).

### Intravenous magnesium sulphate provides no additive benefit to standard management in acute asthma [^112BHEKB]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of acute asthma is based on rapid reversal of bronchospasm and airway inflammation. Magnesium sulphate (MgSO(4)) is known to have a bronchodilator effect on smooth muscle but studies have shown conflicting results on its efficacy in acute asthma, although its use is recommended in national and international guidelines.

Aims

To determine if intravenous MgSO(4), when used as an adjunct to standard therapy, improves the outcome in acute asthma.

Methods

A double blind, randomised placebo controlled trial comparing 1.2g MgSO(4) with standard therapy in adult patients with acute asthma. Patients had a PEF ≤ 75% predicted and all were treated with oxygen, nebulised salbutamol and ipratropium, and IV hydrocortisone. They then received 1.2g IV MgSO(4) or placebo. Outcome measures were % predicted PEF at 60 min and hospital admission rates.

Results

One hundred and twenty nine patients were studied. Placebo and active treatment groups were well matched at baseline. MgSO(4) had no benefit with regards hospital admission rates or % predicted PEF at 60 min (p = 0.48) for the whole group, or for subgroups of life-threatening (p = 0.85), severe (p = 0.63) and moderate (p = 0.67) acute asthma.

Conclusion

This study did not show additional benefit from 1.2g IV MgSO(4) when given as an adjunct to standard therapy for acute asthma.

### Magnesium sulfate infusion to prevent hospitalization for… [^113CskaK]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Details for This Review Study Population: Adults 35 years and older in seven countries presenting to an emergency department with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Efficacy End Points: Hospital admissions from the ED and the need for noninvasive ventilation, assisted ventilation, or intensive care unit admission. Harm End Points: Adverse events or serious adverse events Narrative: COPD is a chronic, progressive disease often complicated by exacerbations that commonly lead to hospital admissions, decreased quality of life, and increased morbidity and mortality. Novel strategies have been suggested to decrease the rate of hospitalizations for acute COPD exacerbations. Some evidence suggests that hypomagnesemia increases airway hyperreactivity, impairs pulmonary function, and increases the risk of COPD exacerbations.

1, 2 A 2008 study showed that hypomagnesemia is an independent predictor of readmission to the hospital for acute COPD exacerbations. 3 Magnesium sulfate infusions are used as adjuvant therapy for asthma exacerbations because of their bronchodilatory effect. 4 Similarly, magnesium sulfate may have potential as adjuvant therapy for COPD exacerbations. 5 The primary outcomes were hospital admissions and the need for noninvasive ventilation, assisted ventilation, or intensive care unit admission. Seven of the studies examined magnesium sulfate infusions, three studies assessed nebulized magnesium sulfate inhalation, and one study examined both. Comparisons included placebo alone, placebo plus standard care, placebo plus alternative nebulized solution, and nebulized ipratropium plus intravenous saline. None of the studies quantified COPD severity, making it difficult to know if comparison groups were similar.

Despite previous data showing a correlation between low magnesium levels and hospital readmission, none of the three studies evaluating hospital admissions from the ED reported magnesium levels on initial presentation to the ED; therefore, it is difficult to determine if patients who benefited from magnesium sulfate infusion were truly hypomagnesemic at the time of initial presentation. Conclusion: A color recommendation of yellow was assigned for the use of magnesium sulfate infusion to prevent hospital admission from the ED for acute COPD exacerbation. However, more extensive studies are needed, as well as additional data on adverse events and serious adverse events. Safety data, inclusion criteria, and dosing guidance are required before magnesium sulfate infusions are a routine addition to the standard of care for patients with acute COPD exacerbations.

### Nebulized magnesium sulfate in the management of acute exacerbations of asthma [^1147YjUW]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of nebulized magnesium sulfate in the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed (all to October 2005) were searched using the key words magnesium, magnesium sulfate, magnesium compounds, nebulise, nebulize, vaporise, vaporize, nebulizers and vaporizers, aerosols, asthma, exacerbation, bronchial spasm, and bronchospasm.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Prospective, randomized, controlled trials that evaluated efficacy and safety endpoints of nebulized magnesium sulfate in the management of acute exacerbations of asthma were included. All studies were evaluated independently by both authors. Efficacy outcomes included pulmonary function, clinical disease severity (as defined by each study), and rate of hospitalization. Safety outcomes were as described by each trial.

Data Synthesis

Six prospective trials met the study criteria. Nebulized magnesium alone failed to demonstrate any benefit compared with beta(2)-agonists alone at improving pulmonary function. In trials in which nebulized magnesium was used as a vehicle for albuterol, there appear to be additional benefits to albuterol therapy in terms of improvements in pulmonary function in a population with mild-to-moderate asthma. The heterogeneous patient populations, study designs, magnesium doses, and the delivery methods preclude the extrapolation of these results to current clinical practice.

Conclusions

The studies included in this review fail to clarify the role of nebulized magnesium sulfate; therefore, this therapy cannot be recommended at this time. Future studies evaluating the role of nebulized magnesium as an adjunct therapy to beta(2)-agonist, anticholinergic, and corticosteroid therapy are necessary to determine whether a clinically relevant benefit of this intervention exists.

### Magnesium sulphate for women at risk of preterm birth for neuroprotection of the fetus [^115ZfyxP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Considering secondary outcomes assessed using GRADE for infants/children, magnesium sulphate probably reduced severe intraventricular haemorrhage (grade 3 or 4) (5 RCTs, 5885 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and may have resulted in little to no difference in chronic lung disease/bronchopulmonary dysplasia (5 RCTs, 6689 infants) (low‐certainty evidence). For women, magnesium sulphate probably resulted in little or no difference in caesarean section (5 RCTs, 5861 women) and postpartum haemorrhage (2 RCTs, 2495 women) (both moderate‐certainty evidence). No data were reported for breastfeeding at discharge and women's views of treatment.

For the majority of other secondary outcomes not assessed using GRADE for infants/children, no evidence of differences was observed. However, we did observe a number of possible benefits in the magnesium sulphate versus placebo group: fewer infants required intubation for resuscitation (2 RCTs, 3093 infants); and up to two years' corrected age, fewer children had moderate or severe cerebral palsy (6 RCTs, 6108 children); died or had any neurodevelopmental disability (3 RCTs, 3194 children); had substantial gross motor dysfunction (2 RCTs, 1648 children); and died or had substantial gross motor dysfunction (6 RCTs, 5097 children). No harms for infants/children were observed with magnesium sulphate versus placebo, except for possibly more children up to two years' corrected age with behavioural scores (assessed by the Child Behaviour Checklist) within the clinical problem range overall, and on the following scales: anxiety, withdrawal, sleeping problems, other (all in 1 RCT, up to 795 children). For women, in large part, no evidence of differences in outcomes, including no benefits, was observed. However, we did observe some possible harms in the magnesium sulphate versus placebo group: more women experienced any side effects of treatment (4 RCTs, 5300 women) and the following side effects: hypotension (3 RCTs, 3059 women), tachycardia (1 RCT, 1062 women), warmth over body/flushing (4 RCTs, 5300 women), arm discomfort with infusion (3 RCTs, 4736 women), mouth dryness (2 RCTs, 2495 women), nausea or vomiting (4 RCTs, 5300 women), sleepiness (RCT, 1062 women), sweating (3 RCTs, 4736 women), dizziness (2 RCTs, 2495 women), and blurred vision (2 RCTs, 2495 women).

### IV magnesium sulfate for bronchiolitis: a randomized trial [^112VYV56]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The goal of this study was to determine if IV magnesium, useful for severe pediatric asthma, reduces time to medical readiness for discharge in patients with bronchiolitis when added to supportive care.

Methods

We compared a single dose of 100 mg/kg of IV magnesium sulfate vs placebo for acute bronchiolitis. Patients received bronchodilator therapy, nebulized hypertonic saline, and 5 days of dexamethasone if there was eczema and/or a family history of asthma. Time to medical readiness for discharge was the primary efficacy outcome. Bronchiolitis severity scores and need for infirmary or hospital admission and for clinic revisits within 2 weeks were secondary outcomes. Cardiorespiratory instability onset was the safety outcome.

Results

A total of 162 previously healthy infants diagnosed with bronchiolitis aged 22 days to 17.6 months (median, 3.7 months) were enrolled. Approximately one-half of patients had eczema and/or a family history of asthma; 86.4% had positive findings on nasopharyngeal virus swabs. Geometric mean time until medical readiness for discharge was 24.1 h (95% CI, 20.0–29.1) for the 78 magnesium-treated patients and 25.3 h (95% CI, 20.3–31.5) for the 82 patients receiving placebo (ratio, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.52–1.80]; p = 0.91). Mean bronchiolitis severity scores over time were similar for the two groups. The frequency of clinic visits in the subsequent 2 weeks (33.8% and 27.2%, respectively) was also similar. Fifteen magnesium recipients (19.5%) vs five placebo recipients (6.2%) were readmitted to the infirmary or hospital within 2 weeks (P = 0.016). No acute cardiorespiratory side effects were reported.

Conclusions

IV magnesium did not provide benefit for patients with acute bronchiolitis and may be harmful.

### The use of magnesium sulfate in acute asthma: rapid uptake of evidence in north American emergency departments [^112AoGGj]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Systematic reviews of approximately 13 randomized trials support treatment with intravenous magnesium sulfate (MgSO(4)) in patients with severe acute asthma; however, little is known about its actual clinical use.

Objective

We sought to examine the use of intravenous MgSO(4) in the emergency department (ED) and physician attitudes toward its use.

Methods

Data for MgSO(4) use were obtained from observational cohort studies of ED patients with acute asthma. Investigators were asked about MgSO(4) through a brief Internet-based survey. The main outcomes were the percentage of sites reporting MgSO(4) use and patient factors that potentially modified the use of this agent.

Results

Among 9745 ED patients with acute asthma, 240 (2.5%) received MgSO(4). Increasing age, previous intubation, higher initial respiratory rate, lower initial PEF, higher number of beta-agonists in the ED, and use of systemic corticosteroids were associated with MgSO(4) use (P < .01). Overall, 103 (87%) of 119 potential sites completed the survey. Most (92%) respondents stated their EDs had MgSO(4) available, and 64% had recently used it. More respondents listed severity (96%) and failure to respond to initial beta-agonists (87%) as factors prompting their use of MgSO(4). Other factors, such as age, sex, and duration of exacerbation, less commonly influenced MgSO(4) use.

Conclusion

Most ED physicians accept the efficacy of MgSO(4) in acute asthma. Despite this belief and the ready availability of MgSO(4), its ED use remains uncommon (2.5% of cases). In both practice and theory, emergency physicians appear to appropriately restrict its use to patients with severe acute asthma.

### Magnesium sulphate for treating acute bronchiolitis in children up to two years of age [^112czcCh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute bronchiolitis is a significant burden on children, their families and healthcare facilities. It mostly affects children younger than two years of age. Treatment involves adequate hydration, humidified oxygen supplementation, and nebulisation of medications, such as salbutamol, epinephrine, and hypertonic saline. The effectiveness of magnesium sulphate for acute bronchiolitis is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effects of magnesium sulphate in acute bronchiolitis in children up to two years of age.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, and two trials registries to 30 April 2020. We contacted trial authors to identify additional studies. We searched conference proceedings and reference lists of retrieved articles. Unpublished and published studies were eligible for inclusion.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, comparing magnesium sulphate, alone or with another treatment, with placebo or another treatment, in children up to two years old with acute bronchiolitis. Primary outcomes were time to recovery, mortality, and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were duration of hospital stay, clinical severity score at 0 to 24 hours and 25 to 48 hours after treatment, pulmonary function test, hospital readmission within 30 days, duration of mechanical ventilation, and duration of intensive care unit stay.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE methods to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included four RCTs (564 children). One study received funding from a hospital and one from a university; two studies did not report funding sources. Comparator interventions differed among all four trials. Studies were conducted in Qatar, Turkey, Iran, and India. We assessed two studies to be at an overall low risk of bias, and two to be at unclear risk of bias, overall. The certainty of the evidence for all outcomes and comparisons was very low except for one: hospital re-admission rate within 30 days of discharge for magnesium sulphate versus placebo. None of the studies measured time to recovery, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of intensive care unit stay, or pulmonary function. There were no events of mortality or adverse effects for magnesium sulphate compared with placebo (1 RCT, 160 children). The effects of magnesium sulphate on clinical severity are uncertain (at 0 to 24 hours: mean difference (MD) on the Wang score 0.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.28 to 0.54; and at 25 to 48 hours: MD on the Wang score -0.42, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.00). Magnesium sulphate may increase hospital re-admission rate within 30 days of discharge (risk ratio (RR) 3.16, 95% CI 1.20 to 8.27; 158 children; low-certainty evidence). None of our primary outcomes were measured for magnesium sulphate compared with hypertonic saline (1 RCT, 220 children). Effects were uncertain on the duration of hospital stay in days (MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.28), and on clinical severity on the Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument (RDAI) score at 25 to 48 hours (MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.59). There were no events of mortality or adverse effects for magnesium sulphate, with or without salbutamol, compared with salbutamol (1 RCT, 57 children). Effects on the duration of hospital stay were uncertain (magnesium sulphate: 24 hours (95% CI 25.8 to 47.4), magnesium sulphate + salbutamol: 20 hours (95% CI 15.3 to 39.0), and salbutamol: 24 hours (95% CI 23.4 to 76.9)). None of our primary outcomes were measured for magnesium sulphate + epinephrine compared with no treatment or normal saline + epinephrine (1 RCT,120 children). Effects were uncertain for the duration of hospital stay in hours (MD -0.40, 95% CI -3.94 to 3.14), and for RDAI scores (0 to 24 hours: MD -0.20, 95% CI -1.06 to 0.66; and 25 to 48 hours: MD -0.90, 95% CI -1.75 to -0.05).

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to establish the efficacy and safety of magnesium sulphate for treating children up to two years of age with acute bronchiolitis. No evidence was available for time to recovery, duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit stay, or pulmonary function. There was no information about adverse events for some comparisons. Well-designed RCTs to assess the effects of magnesium sulphate for children with acute bronchiolitis are needed. Important outcomes, such as time to recovery and adverse events should be measured.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1149UHwk]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Objectives

To review the efficacy of nebulised magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4) in acute asthma in children.

Methods

The authors searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published until 15 December 2023. RCTs were included if they compared the efficacy and safety of nebulised MgSO 4 as a second-line agent in children presenting with acute asthma exacerbation. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed, and the Risk of Bias V.2 tool was used to assess the biases among them.

Results

10 RCTs enrolling 2301 children with acute asthma were included. All trials were placebo controlled and administered nebulised MgSO 4 /placebo and salbutamol (± ipratropium bromide). There was no significant difference in Composite Asthma Severity Score between the two groups (6 RCTs, 1953 participants; standardised mean difference: −0.09; 95% CI: −0.2 to +0.02, I² = 21%). Children in the MgSO 4 group have significantly better peak expiratory flow rate (% predicted) than the control group (2 RCTs, 145 participants; mean difference: 19.3; 95% CI: 8.9 to 29.8; I² = 0%). There was no difference in the need for hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission or duration of hospital stay. Adverse events were minor, infrequent (7.3%) and similar among the two groups.

Conclusions

There is low-certainty evidence that nebulised MgSO 4 as an add-on second-line therapy for acute asthma in children does not reduce asthma severity or a need for hospitalisation. However, it was associated with slightly better lung functions. The current evidence does not support the routine use of nebulised MgSO 4 in paediatric acute asthma management.

### Comparison of nebulised magnesium sulphate and salbutamol combined with salbutamol alone in the treatment of acute bronchial asthma: a randomised study [^111wVs69]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that combined administration of multiple doses of nebulised salbutamol and magnesium sulphate provides additional benefit compared with salbutamol alone in adult patients with acute asthma.

Design

Randomised, double blind, prospective study.

Methods

A total of 100 patients presenting to an emergency department with an acute attack of bronchial asthma were randomised to two groups: nebulisation with a combination of salbutamol and magnesium sulphate (group A) and nebulisation with salbutamol only (group B). Both groups received nebulisation thrice at intervals of 20 minutes. Salbutamol and magnesium sulphate were administered in doses of 0.5 mg and 500 mg, respectively, and the solutions were made isotonic to plasma osmolality. Pulse rate, blood pressure, and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were measured at baseline and at 15, 60, 75, and 120 minutes. Serum magnesium levels and blood gases were measured at 0 and 120 minutes in both groups.

Results

All patients had either acute severe or life threatening asthma. The baseline characteristics were comparable in the two groups. Both groups showed significant rise in PEFR at all time intervals, however, there was no significant difference between the groups in rise in PEFR at any time point. Serum magnesium levels remained within normal limits, and there was no difference in requirement of additional medication during the study or hospital admission rates in both groups. No significant side effects were noted.

Conclusion

This study suggests that there is no therapeutic benefit of adding magnesium sulphate to salbutamol nebulisation in the treatment of patients with acute severe or life threatening asthma.

### Association between intravenous magnesium therapy in the emergency department and subsequent hospitalization among pediatric patients with refractory acute asthma: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^116uchGV]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design and Population

We conducted a post hoc secondary analysis of a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT of children aged 2 to 17 years treated at 7 Pediatric Emergency Research Canada EDs for acute asthma from September 26, 2011, to November 19, 2019 (the trial protocol for the RCT is given in Supplement 1). This secondary analysis was performed from September to November 2020. The research ethics boards of the Hospital for Sick Children and of all participating sites approved the RCT and all data obtained during the study. Waiver of informed consent was not obtained for this secondary analysis because the parent trial included collection of all data used in this secondary analysis, and the consent form specified intravenous magnesium as a possible required treatment during trial participation. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Children enrolled in the RCT who continued to experience moderate to severe respiratory distress, defined by a PRAM score of 5 points or higher(Table 1)after 1 hour of standardized initial treatment with systemic corticosteroids and 3 treatments with inhaled albuterol and ipratropium bromide, were randomly assigned to receive three 20-minute treatments of nebulized albuterol (5 mg) plus either nebulized magnesium sulfate (600 mg) or 5.5% saline placebo via a pretested, high-efficiency Aeroneb Go nebulizer (Philips). After completion of this therapy (60 minutes after randomization), the ED physicians prescribed additional treatments such as IV magnesium sulfate as needed and decided whether to hospitalize patients according to their clinical judgement.

Table 1.
Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure Score a

Abbreviation: NA, not applicable.

The RCT included children with a physician's diagnosis of asthma or a previous wheeze treated with inhaled bronchodilators or systemic corticosteroids. Children with comorbidities such as chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, neurologic disease, or other systemic diseases were excluded, as were those experiencing their first episode of asthmalike symptoms who may have had other diagnoses. Children needing immediate airway stabilization and those who received IV magnesium therapy before trial enrollment were also excluded.

Exposure

This secondary analysis used data from patients enrolled in the RCT who were administered IV magnesium after receipt of nebulized magnesium or placebo before disposition from the ED based on the clinical judgment of the treating ED physician. Magnesium was given by a continuous 30-minute IV infusion using magnesium doses of 40 to 75 mg/kg (maximum 2 g) in accordance with the local standard of care.

### Intravenous and nebulized magnesium sulfate for treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116tXSJG]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous (IV) and nebulized magnesium sulfate in acute asthma in children.

Methods

The PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases were searched. Randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized controlled trials of IV and nebulized magnesium sulfate in pediatric acute asthma were included. The outcomes subject to meta-analysis were pulmonary function, hospitalization, and further treatment. If statistical heterogeneity was significant, random-effects models were used for meta-analysis, otherwise, fixed-effects models were applied.

Results

Ten randomized and quasi-randomized trials (6 IV, 4 nebulized) were identified. Intravenous magnesium sulfate treatment is associated with significant effects on respiratory function (standardized mean difference, 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80–3.08; P = 0.0008) and hospital admission (risk ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.31–0.95; P = 0.03). But nebulized magnesium sulfate treatment shows no significant effect on respiratory function (standardized mean difference, 0.19; 95% CI, -0.01–0.40; P = 0.07) or hospital admission (risk ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.86–1.44; P = 0.42).

Conclusions

The meta-analysis revealed that IV magnesium sulfate is an effective treatment in children, with the pulmonary function significantly improved and hospitalization and further treatment decreased. But nebulized magnesium sulfate treatment showed no significant effect on respiratory function or hospital admission and further treatment.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113PWQWx]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Management of asthma exacerbations in a primary care or acute care facility calls to assess severity from dyspnea, respiratory rate, pulse rate, oxygen saturation and lung function while starting SABA and oxygen therapy, with infection control procedures followed. Arrange immediate transfer to an acute care facility for signs of severe exacerbation, or to intensive care if the patient is drowsy, confused, or has a silent chest; during transfer, give inhaled SABA and ipratropium bromide, controlled oxygen and systemic corticosteroids. Start treatment with repeated administration of SABA (in most patients, by pressurized metered-dose inhaler [pMDI] and spacer), early oral corticosteroids, and controlled flow oxygen if available; review response of symptoms, oxygen saturation and lung function after 1 hour, and give ipratropium bromide only for severe exacerbations. Consider intravenous magnesium sulfate for patients with severe exacerbations not responding to initial treatment. Do not routinely request a chest X-ray, and do not routinely prescribe antibiotics for asthma exacerbations. Decide about hospitalization based on clinical status, lung function, response to treatment, recent and past exacerbations, and ability to manage at home.

### The role of oral magnesium supplements for the management of stable bronchial asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1128J2GY]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects ~300 million people worldwide, reaching up to 18% of the population in certain countries.

Symptoms of asthma include coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, and other respiratory complaints. Most of the time these symptoms are mild and can be controlled with inhalers and avoidance of known allergens, but other times they can lead to exacerbations that can be life threatening. An estimated annual 300,000 deaths worldwide are attributed to asthma.

The mainstay of management is a beta-agonist and corticosteroids inhaler. However, new investigations into the pathogenesis of the disease are emerging. For example, many reports have observed that low blood levels and low dietary intake of magnesium are factors that possibly contribute to the development of asthma. – In addition, low levels of magnesium have been detected in asthmatics compared with non-asthmatics, especially those that have presented to the emergency department with exacerbations. –

Magnesium deficiency has a role in many diseases in addition to asthma, including migraines, depression, and epilepsy.– Although the exact role magnesium has in asthma is not completely understood, it is known that it functions as an anti-inflammatory agent in addition to its role in inhibiting the effect of calcium to contract smooth muscle.–

Previous trials showed that magnesium use through intravenous or inhaled routes does have a role in managing asthma in acute exacerbations. – However, studies published on the benefits of oral supplements have reported unclear conclusions.– Major problems with these trials regarding randomization, placebo use, intervention duration, outcome measurements, and baseline level of serum magnesium may explain the conflicting results.

The role of intravenous and inhaled magnesium in the management of acute asthma has been extensively studied and the guidelines are well established. IV or inhaled routes can be used as a last resort for severe, persistent asthma that fails to respond to conventional treatment. Nevertheless, oral magnesium is not included in these guidelines.

Our aim in this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of all published reports on the effect of oral magnesium for the management of chronic asthma.

The following adverse reactions have been identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

The most common adverse reactions are flushing, sweating, hypotension, depressed reflexes, flaccid paralysis, hypothermia, circulatory collapse, cardiac and central nervous system (CNS) depression proceeding to respiratory paralysis and hypocalcemia. Bradycardia, pulmonary edema, decreased respiratory rate, lethargy, sedation, somnolence, visual disturbances, and hypermagnesemia are also reported (6)

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate inducing acute respiratory failure in a patient with myasthenia gravis [^1129d6To]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A woman in her 90s with a background of myasthenia gravis and atrial fibrillation presented to hospital following a fall. While in the emergency department it was noted that she was in atrial fibrillation with a fast-ventricular response and as part of her management was given intravenous magnesium. Following this she developed acute respiratory failure and required intubation and ventilation. The patient recovered quickly and was extubated in the intensive care unit the next day. On subsequent days, the patient received two further doses of intravenous magnesium before the link was identified. On both of these occasions she again developed respiratory failure which were managed with non-invasive ventilation. This case highlights the importance of all members of the team being aware of the drugs that can induce a myasthenic crisis. It also stimulates further research into the development of a guide of how to safely treat symptomatic hypomagnesaemia in patients with myasthenia gravis.

### A meta-analysis on intravenous magnesium sulphate for treating acute asthma [^115WvJoB]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2005). Low credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the effectiveness of intravenous magnesium sulphate in the treatment of acute asthmatic attacks in children by meta-analysis.

Methods

A systematic and comprehensive search of the literature was performed to identify controlled clinical trials of magnesium sulphate in paediatric acute asthma which evaluated outcomes of hospitalisation or short term pulmonary function tests or symptom scores. Unpublished data were searched by personal contacts with authors and specialists. Two reviewers independently assessed trial qualities and synthesised data. Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated by the Cochrane Q test. Outcome data were pooled by random or fixed effect models depending on presence or absence of heterogeneity.

Results

Five randomised placebo controlled trials involving a total of 182 patients were identified. They compared intravenous magnesium sulphate to placebo in treating paediatric patients with moderate to severe asthmatic attacks in the emergency department, with co-therapies of inhaled beta2 agonists and systemic steroids. The studies were of high quality with results judged to be valid. Four studies showed that magnesium sulphate was effective, while one study found it ineffective. There was no significant heterogeneity in the primary outcome of hospitalisation. In the fixed effect model, magnesium sulphate is effective in preventing hospitalisation (OR 0.290, 95% CI 0.143 to 0.589). The number needed to treat is 4 (95% CI 3 to 8). Secondary outcomes of short term pulmonary function tests and clinical symptom scores also showed significant improvement.

Conclusion

Intravenous magnesium sulphate probably provides additional benefit in moderate to severe acute asthma in children treated with bronchodilators and steroids.

### Survey of physicians' attitudes toward the use of magnesium sulfate for acute asthma exacerbations in Turkey [^111g4UUQ]. The Journal of Asthma (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is considered to be a well-tolerated, inexpensive, and effective medication for severe asthma exacerbations. We surveyed physicians who treat patients with asthma to evaluate the current knowledge and usage of MgSO4.

Methods

A self-administered questionnaire was e-mailed to members of the Turkish National Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and was distributed to participants of its annual congress.

Results

Of the 456 respondents (mean age: 36.53 ± 9.11 years), 42.3% reported to use MgSO4 in asthma exacerbations in their practice, and 48.7% agreed that MgSO4 was included in asthma guidelines. The best known indication was that it was useful only in patients refractory to bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids (67.7%). The two most common reasons to use MgSO4 were to shorten hospital stay (94.7%), and prevent admission to intensive care unit (80.3%). The respondents mostly used MgSO4 in the treatment of severe or life-threatening exacerbations. Thirty-nine percent believed that MgSO4 had no effect on discharge period, and 29% of them marked minor side effects. The most common reason for not using MgSO4 was inexperience (36.5%). Having an academic affiliation (OR = 3.20, p < 0.001), the number of asthmatic outpatients seen per month (OR = 1.82, p = 0.007), and more recent graduation from medical school (≤ 1991) (OR = 0.23, p < 0.001) were associated with the use of MgSO4 in the multivariate analysis.

Conclusion

Even though the effect of MgSO4 in acute severe asthma is well known, only half of the physicians dealing with asthma patients have used it in their practice. Education and encouragement in this regard are necessary.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^112c8V5R]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Start OCS early after presentation. For adults, give prednisolone 40–50 mg/d (or equivalent) for 5–7 days. For children, give prednisolone 1–2 mg/kg (maximum, 40 mg) for 3–5 days. Tapering is not needed if administered for < 2 weeks.

Review response of symptoms, vital signs, oxygen saturation and lung function after 1 hour (or earlier if worsening). Give ipratropium bromide only for severe exacerbations. Consider intravenous magnesium sulfate for patients with severe exacerbations not responding to initial treatment.

Do not routinely request chest radiography or routinely prescribe antibiotics for asthma exacerbations.

The decision on whether to hospitalize should be based on the patient's clinical status, lung function, response to treatment, recent and past history of exacerbations, social support, and ability to manage at home.

Rationale

Currently, inhaled albuterol is the usual bronchodilator in acute asthma management. Similar efficacy and safety of formoterol in the ED have been reported. In one study, high-dose budesonide–formoterol had similar efficacy and safety to SABA in ED patients.

Discharge Management

Before the patient goes home, arrange ongoing treatment. This should include starting ICS-containing controller treatment, preferably ICS–formoterol as MART (Table 1; Table E2 andin the online supplement) to reduce the risk of another exacerbation, or stepping up the dose of existing maintenance treatment for 2–4 weeks. Advise patients to use reliever medication as needed, not regularly. Patients prescribed ICS–formoterol as their reliever should return to this after an ED presentation.

### Intravenous or nebulised magnesium sulphate versus standard therapy for severe acute asthma (3Mg trial): a double-blind, randomised controlled trial [^116g3Zus]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous studies suggested intravenous or nebulised magnesium sulphate (MgSO(4)) might improve respiratory function in patients with acute asthma. We aimed to determine whether intravenous or nebulised MgSO(4) improve symptoms of breathlessness and reduce the need for hospital admission in adults with severe acute asthma.

Methods

In our double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled adults (aged ≥ 16 years) with severe acute asthma at emergency departments of 34 hospitals in the UK. We excluded patients with life-threatening features or contraindication to study drugs. We used a central randomisation system to allocate participants to intravenous MgSO(4) (2 g in 20 min) or nebulised MgSO(4) (three 500 mg doses in 1 h) alongside standard therapy including salbutamol, or placebo control plus standard therapy alone. We assessed two primary outcome measures in all eligible participants who started treatment, according to assigned treatment group: the proportion of patients admitted to hospital within 7 days and breathlessness measured on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) in the 2 h after initiation of treatment. We adjusted for multiple testing using Simes's method. The trial stopped before recruitment was completed because funding expired. This study is registered, number ISRCTN04417063.

Findings

Between July 30, 2008, and June 30, 2012, we recruited 1109 (92%) of 1200 patients proposed by the power calculation. 261 (79%) of 332 patients allocated nebulised MgSO(4) were admitted to hospital before 7 days, as were 285 (72%) of 394 patients allocated intravenous MgSO(4) and 281 (78%) of 358 controls. Breathlessness was assessed in 296 (89%) patients allocated nebulised MgSO(4), 357 (91%) patients allocated intravenous MgSO(4), and 323 (90%) controls. Rates of hospital admission did not differ between patients treated with either form of MgSO(4) compared with controls or between those treated with nebulised MgSO(4) and intravenous MgSO(4). Change in VAS breathlessness did not differ between active treatments and control, but change in VAS was greater for patients in the intravenous MgSO(4) group than it was in the nebulised MgSO(4) group (5·1 mm, 0·8 to 9·4; p = 0·019). Intravenous or nebulised MgSO(4) did not significantly decrease rates of hospital admission and breathlessness compared with placebo: intravenous MgSO(4) was associated with an odds ratio of 0·73 (95% CI 0·51 to 1·04; p = 0·083) for hospital admission and a change in VAS breathlessness of 2·6 mm (-1·6 to 6·8; p = 0·231) compared with placebo; nebulised MgSO(4) was associated with an odds ratio of 0·96 (0·65 to 1·40; p = 0·819) for hospital admission and a change in VAS breathlessness of -2·6 mm (-7·0 to 1·8; p = 0·253) compared with placebo.

Interpretation

Our findings suggest nebulised MgSO(4) has no role in the management of severe acute asthma in adults and at best suggest only a limited role for intravenous MgSO(4) in this setting.

### Intravenous and nebulised magnesium sulphate for acute asthma: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116RrXgj]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To estimate the effect of intravenous and nebulised magnesium sulphate upon hospital admissions and pulmonary function in adults and children with acute asthma.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised and quasi-randomised trials of intravenous or nebulised magnesium sulphate in acute asthma. Trials were identified by searches of the electronic literature, relevant journal websites and conference proceedings, and contact with authors and experts. Data were pooled using random effects meta-analysis of the relative risk (RR) of hospital admission and the standardised mean difference (SMD) in pulmonary function.

Results

24 studies (15 intravenous, 9 nebulised) incorporating 1669 patients were included. Intravenous treatment was associated in adults with weak evidence of an effect upon respiratory function (SMD 0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.01 to 0.51; p = 0.05), but no significant effect upon hospital admission (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.08; p = 0.22), and in children with a significant effect upon respiratory function (SMD 1.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 3.08; p < 0.001) and hospital admission (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.90; p = 0.005). Nebulised treatment was associated in adults with weak evidence of an effect upon respiratory function (SMD 0.17, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.36; p = 0.09), and hospital admission (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.02; p = 0.06), and in children with no significant effect upon respiratory function (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -1.49 to 0.98; p = 0.69) or hospital admission (RR 2.0, 95% CI 0.19 to 20.93; p = 0.56).

Conclusion

Intravenous magnesium sulphate appears to be an effective treatment in children. Further trials are needed of intravenous and nebulised magnesium sulphate in adults and nebulised magnesium sulphate in children.

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate for treating children with acute asthma in the emergency department [^114nqCHR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Acute asthma in children can be life-threatening and must be treated promptly in the emergency setting. Intravenous magnesium sulfate is recommended by various guidelines for cases of acute asthma that have not responded to first-line treatment with bronchodilators and steroids. The treatment has recently been shown to reduce the need for hospital admission for adults compared with placebo, but it is unclear whether it is equally effective for children.

Objectives

To assess the safety and efficacy of intravenous magnesium sulfate (IV MgSO4) in children treated for acute asthma in the emergency department (ED).

Search Methods

We identified studies by searching the Cochrane Airways Review Group Specialised Register up to 23 February 2016. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and reference lists of other reviews, and we contacted study authors to ask for additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of children treated in the ED for exacerbations of asthma if they compared any dose of IV MgSO4 with placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened the results of the search and independently extracted data from studies meeting the inclusion criteria. We resolved disagreements through discussion and contacted study authors in cases of missing data and other uncertainties relating to the studies. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios and continuous data as mean differences, both using fixed-effect models. We assessed each study for risk of bias and rated the quality of evidence for each outcome with GRADE and presented the results in a 'Summary of findings' table. There was insufficient evidence to conduct the planned subgroup analyses.

Main Results

Five studies (182 children) met the inclusion criteria, and four contributed data to at least one meta-analysis. The included studies were overall at low risk of bias, but our confidence in the evidence was generally low, mainly due to the small sample sizes. Treatment with IV MgSO4 reduced the odds of admission to hospital by 68% (odds ratio (OR) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.74; children = 115; studies = 3; I² = 63%). This result was based on data from just three studies including 115 children. Meta-analysis for the secondary outcomes was extremely limited by paucity of data. We performed meta-analysis for the outcome 'return to the emergency department within 48 hours', which showed a very imprecise effect estimate that was not statistically significant (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.02 to 10.30; children = 85; studies = 2; I(2) = 0%). Side effects and adverse events were not consistently reported and meta-analysis was not possible, however few side effects or adverse events were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

IV MgSO4 may reduce the need for hospital admission in children presenting to the ED with moderate to severe exacerbations of asthma, but the evidence is extremely limited by the number and size of studies. Few side effects of the treatment were reported, but the data were extremely limited.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117WCiRQ]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Protocol registration and reporting

The protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022373692, available at). The review was done as per the methodology described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and is being reported as per the updated Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.

Research question

Does inhaled/nebulised MgSO 4 as an adjunct to SABA, compared with standard therapy, help reduce asthma severity score in children presenting with acute asthma exacerbation?

Information sources and eligibility criteria

We searched Medline (via PubMed), Embase, Web of Science and CENTRAL for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published from inception until 15 December 2023. The search was further updated on 15 February 2024. We did not use any language restrictions or filters during the database search. The electronic search was supplemented by a manual search of the bibliography of relevant reports to identify additional citations. We also searched various registries (until 15 December 2023), namely ClinicalTrials.gov, Clinical Trial Registry of India, Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry and the European Union Clinical Trials Register. We included studies if they meet all the following criteria: (1) population: children aged 1–18 years with acute asthma, (2) intervention: inhaled/nebulised MgSO 4, (3) control: either placebo with standard therapy or standard therapy alone, (4) study design: parallel-group RCTs. Studies will be excluded if they meet any of the following criteria: (1) population: adults, (2) intervention: oral or intravenous MgSO 4, (3) study design: non-RCT/crossover RCT, and studies published in non-English language or as abstract only.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the asthma severity. There are multiple scores for assessing asthma severity, namely the Pulmonary Index Score, Pediatric Asthma Severity Score, Childhood Asthma Scoreand the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure. All these scores are on an ordinal scale where increasing scores mean increasing disease severity. We combined studies reporting similar scores. If different scores were reported across studies, then we combined them using standardised mean difference (SMD) calculated by the following formula:

Secondary outcomes included pulmonary function tests (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)), need for hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of hospital stay, effect on physiological parameters (heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation) and adverse events, including mortality before discharge.

### Intravenous magnesium for acute asthma? [^115Sq83k]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Each year in the UK, around 1,500 people die from asthma. Standard treatment has been based on bronchodilators (e.g. beta 2-stimulants) and anti-inflammatory drugs (corticosteroids). The recently revised British Guideline on the Management of Asthma suggests also using a single dose of i.v. magnesium sulphate in patients with acute severe asthma, an unlicensed indication. Here we discuss the rationale for giving i.v. magnesium and whether it offers any advantage for patients with acute severe asthma.

### IV magnesium sulfate in the treatment of acute severe asthma: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^113cmR7G]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Studies of IV magnesium sulfate as a treatment for acute asthma have had mixed results, with some data suggesting a benefit for acute severe asthma, but not for mild-to-moderate asthma. In a multicenter cohort, this study tests the hypothesis that administration of magnesium sulfate improves pulmonary function in patients with acute severe asthma.

Design

Placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial.

Setting

Emergency departments (EDs) of eight hospitals.

Patients

Patients aged 18 to 60 years presenting with acute asthma and FEV1 ≤ 30% predicted on arrival to the ED.

Intervention

All patients received nebulized albuterol at regular intervals and IV methylprednisolone. Two grams of IV magnesium sulfate or placebo were administered 30 min after ED arrival. The primary efficacy end point was FEV1 at 240 min, and the data analysis was intent to treat.

Results

Two hundred forty-eight patients were included, and the mean FEV1 on ED arrival was 22.9% predicted. At 240 min, patients receiving magnesium had a mean FEV1 of 48.2% predicted, compared to 43.5% predicted in the placebo-treated group (mean difference, 4.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29 to 9.3%; p = 0.045). A regression model confirmed the effect of magnesium compared to placebo was greater in patients with a lower initial FEV1 (p < 0.05). If the initial FEV1 was < 25% predicted, the final FEV1 was 45.3% predicted in the magnesium-treated group and 35.6% predicted in the placebo-treated group (mean difference, 9.7%; 95% CI, 4.0 to 15.3%; p = 0.001). If the initial FEV was ≥ 25% predicted, magnesium administration was not beneficial; the final FEV1 was 51.1% predicted in the magnesium-treated group and 53.9% predicted in the placebo-treated group (mean difference, - 2.9%, 95% CI, - 9.4 to 3.7; p = not significant). Overall, the use of magnesium sulfate did not improve hospital admission rates.

Conclusion

Administration of 2 g of IV magnesium sulfate improves pulmonary function when used as an adjunct to standard therapy in patients with very severe, acute asthma.

### Inhaled magnesium sulfate in the treatment of acute asthma [^1122Ntz7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma exacerbations can be frequent and range in severity from relatively mild to status asthmaticus. The use of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is one of numerous treatment options available during acute exacerbations. While the efficacy of intravenous MgSO4 has been demonstrated, little is known about inhaled MgSO4.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy of inhaled MgSO4 in the treatment asthma exacerbations.

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Airways Group "Asthma and Wheez" register. These trials were supplemented with trials found in the reference list of published studies, studies found using extensive electronic search techniques, as well as a review of the gray literature and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

Randomised (or pseudo-randomised) controlled trials were eligible for inclusion. Studies were included if patients were treated with nebulised MgSO4 alone or in combination with beta2-agonist and where compared to beta2-agonist alone or inactive control.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial selection, data extraction and methodological quality were assessed by two independent reviewers. Efforts were made to collect missing data from authors. Results from fixed effects models are presented as standardized mean differences (SMD) for pulmonary functions and relative risks (RR) for hospital admission; both are displayed with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

Main Results

Six trials involving 296 patients were included. Four studies compared nebulised MgSO4 with beta2-agonist to beta2-agonist and two studies compared MgSO4 to beta2-agonist alone. Three studies enrolled only adults and 2 enrolled exclusively pediatric patients; three of the studies enrolled severe asthmatics. Overall, there was a significant difference in pulmonary function between patients whose treatments included nebulised MgSO4 in addition to beta2-agonist (SMD: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.1 to 0.63; 4 studies); however, hospitalizations were similar between the groups (RR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.40 to 1.04; 3 studies). Subgroup analyses did not demonstrate significant differences in lung function improvement between adults and children, or between severe and mild to moderate asthmatics. Conclusions regarding treatment with nebulised MgSO4 alone are difficult to draw due to lack of studies in this area.

Authors' Conclusions

Nebulised inhaled magnesium sulfate in addition to beta2-agonist in the treatment of an acute asthma exacerbation, appears to have benefits with respect to improved pulmonary function and there is a trend towards benefit in hospital admission. Heterogeneity between trials included in this review precludes a more definitive conclusion.

Women's experiences – from personal blogs and discussion forum threads

(See Additional file 8 for blog and discussion forum thread sources).

Before treatment

Women considered information regarding others' experiences with magnesium sulphate important, with a particular desire for knowledge regarding adverse effects and their severity; a number of women expressed an explicit wish for "the truth, no matter how bad or scary". Women expressed expectations of treatment benefits, relating to the different indications for use, and also concern and a sense of fear regarding the possible adverse effects of treatment; one woman exclaimed "What?! NO! ANYTHING BUT MAG!"

During treatment

Whilst variations in experiences existed, women described a variety of adverse effects, the predominant being a sensation of heat: "MY GOD, THE HEAT! I felt so hot and it came from within". Other commonly described adverse effects were similar to those frequently reported adverse effects in randomised trials – muscle weakness, lethargy, blurred vision, nausea or vomiting, headaches, confusion, arm discomfort, thirst, feeling sweaty and dizzy. Less common adverse effects women attributed to magnesium sulphate treatment included a failed induction of labour and consequent need for a caesarean section, the delayed onset of lactation, and the development of pulmonary oedema. A number of women described their request or the need for treatment cessation due to adverse effects, with two women highlighting their experience of being "accidentally overdosed". Many women portrayed their experience as terrifying, revealing a sense of anguish.

After treatment

Women expressed relief following treatment cessation, and great concerns regarding the possibility of treatment in future pregnancies: "I pray I never have to do it again". A number of women felt information regarding the possible adverse effects of treatment was miscommunicated and misleading. Although many women recalled adverse effects of severe intensity, they were generally very thankful, and there was agreement among commenting women that the potential perceived benefits of treatment outweighed discomforts experienced, with magnesium sulphate being described as "a necessary evil".

Clinical Question Is magnesium sulfate an effective addition to usual care for adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations. Evidence-Based Answer Adding intravenous magnesium to standard care for adults with COPD exacerbations may decrease hospital admissions and the length of hospitalization. Seven people with COPD exacerbations would need to be treated with intravenous magnesium to prevent one admission. Patients treated with intravenous magnesium who require hospitalization have a decreased length of stay. There is insufficient evidence about the frequency and severity of adverse events.

1. The primary outcomes were hospital admission, the need for noninvasive ventilation or assisted ventilation, intensive care unit admission, and serious adverse events.

Secondary outcomes included the length of hospital stay, mortality, other adverse events, lung function, blood gas measurements, and dyspnea score, as measured by the dyspnea severity score and the Borg dyspnea scale. Lower scores on the dyspnea severity and Borg scales indicate less severe dyspnea. Although it is unclear what a minimal clinically significant difference on the dyspnea severity scale would be, a minimal clinically significant difference on the Borg scale is only a one-unit difference. Patients receiving intravenous magnesium sulfate had a slightly lower dyspnea score. There was no significant difference in the need for noninvasive ventilation; no serious adverse events were reported in either group.

Patients who received nebulized magnesium sulfate plus standard treatment experienced no improvement in hospitalization or intensive care unit admission rates, compared with standard treatment alone, and there was no difference in the use of noninvasive ventilation, length of hospital stay, or dyspnea score. Serious adverse events were not assessed in those studies. Patients who received nebulized plus intravenous magnesium sulfate compared with nebulized ipratropium bromide, both in addition to standard treatment, experienced no difference in length of hospital stay or rates of hospitalization, endotracheal intubation, or serious adverse events. International guidelines recognize the effectiveness of intravenous magnesium sulfate as a second- or third-line agent for treating severe asthma exacerbations.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111AiAMp]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Magnesium — intravenous magnesium sulfate is not recommended for routine use in asthma exacerbations; however, when given as a single 2 g infusion over 20 minutes, it reduces hospital admissions in some patients, including adults with FEV1 < 25–30% predicted at presentation and children whose FEV1 fails to reach 60% predicted after 1 hour of care, and in adults and children who fail to respond to initial treatment and have persistent hypoxemia; trials excluding more severe asthma showed no benefit from adding intravenous or nebulized magnesium compared with placebo in routine care for adults and adolescents.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115fLgp7]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, affecting nearly 22 million children worldwide. Acute exacerbation is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in children with asthma and accounts for almost 13 000 deaths and 5 million disability-adjusted life years, along with a huge healthcare cost. The first-line therapy for acute exacerbation of childhood asthma is well established and comprises systemic corticosteroids and inhaled short-acting β 2 -agonists (SABAs) along with controlled oxygen. However, many children do not respond to these agents and hence necessitate additional therapy (second line). The role of intravenous and nebulised magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4) has been explored as second-line therapy for acute exacerbation; however, the controversy on its route and timing still exists.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2021 update suggests using intravenous MgSO 4 (not nebulised) for patients with severe exacerbation not responding to initial treatment; however, the 2023 update suggests nebulised isotonic MgSO 4 as a second-line therapy for children aged 2 years and above. In a recent systematic review, intravenous MgSO 4 as a second-line therapy was associated with reduced hospitalisation and improved lung functions. Previous systematic reviews on nebulised MgSO 4 showed variable and contradictory results, adding further uncertainty. Recently, the role of nebulised MgSO 4 as second-line therapy in asthma exacerbation has been further explored in many more trials, necessitating an update on this aspect.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to update the evidence on the efficacy and safety of inhaled/nebulised MgSO 4 as second-line therapy in children and adolescents (up to 18 years) with acute asthma exacerbation.

### Asthma in adults (acute) [^115ydVhU]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 10% of adults have suffered an attack of asthma, and up to 5% of these have severe disease that responds poorly to treatment. Patients with severe disease have an increased risk of death, but patients with mild to moderate disease are also at risk of exacerbations. Most guidelines about the management of asthma follow stepwise protocols. This review does not endorse or follow any particular protocol, but presents the evidence about specific interventions.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute asthma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 100 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: beta(2) agonists (plus ipratropium bromide, pressured metered-dose inhalers, short-acting continuous nebulised, short-acting intermittent nebulised, short-acting iv, and inhaled formoterol); corticosteroids (inhaled); corticosteroids (single oral, combined inhaled, and short courses); education about acute asthma; generalist care; helium-oxygen mixture (heliox); magnesium sulphate (iv and adding isotonic nebulised magnesium to inhaled beta(2) agonists); mechanical ventilation; oxygen supplementation (controlled 28% oxygen and controlled 100% oxygen); and specialist care.

5 MgSO4 ADVERSE EFFECTS

Magnesium sulfate produces flushing, sweating, and a sensation of warmth due to its peripheral vasodilator effects when infused intravenously. Other reported maternal side effects related to dosage and speed of infusion include nausea, vomiting, headache, palpitations and, rarely, pulmonary edema. Overdose can result in cardiac and neurological adverse events. There is no evidence of any unintended adverse outcomes in the neonate. MgSO4 was initially considered as a tocolytic; however, there is no evidence that delivery is delayed when used.

Recommendation: Where MgSO4 is administered, monitor women for clinical signs of magnesium toxicity at least every 4 h by recording pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and deep tendon (for example, patellar) reflexes.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116LtwpW]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

Treatment with nebulised MgSO 4 as an adjunct to SABA (± ipratropium) compared with standard therapy does not lead to better control of asthma exacerbation or reduce the need for hospitalisation among the children presenting with acute asthma exacerbation. It significantly improves pulmonary functions (PEFR) and is not associated with increased adverse events. However, our confidence in the evidence is low, and substantial uncertainty remains. There is a need for large RCTs on this aspect to improve the certainty of the evidence.

### Role of nebulised magnesium sulfate in treating acute asthma in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Dds8g]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Strengths and limitations

This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed using standard Cochrane methodology and is reported as per appropriate guidelines. All studies used a placebo and were double-blind, adding to their robustness. Most studies enrolled children with similar disease severity (moderate to severe exacerbation) from similar settings (emergency room), reducing the clinical heterogeneity and making the results more robust and widely applicable. However, there are certain limitations. Most of the studies had small sample sizes, hence, had wide CIs, reducing the level of certainty. The asthma severity scores used in different studies varied greatly. Though we used an appropriate approach to summarise them, it still affects our certainty in results. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of data for subgroup analyses based on disease severity or age group. Though adverse events were rare, they were not reported consistently.

Due to these limitations, the certainty of the evidence for most outcomes was low or very low. This certainty can be improved by adding larger, adequately powered, placebo-controlled multicentric RCTs. Until larger trials are available, the current evidence does not support the routine use of nebulised MgSO 4 as an add-on therapy in children presenting with acute exacerbation of asthma not responding to inhaled SABAs and systemic steroids.

### Maternal adverse effects of different antenatal magnesium sulphate regimens for improving maternal and infant outcomes: a systematic review [^112ZUeU9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Antenatal magnesium sulphate, widely used in obstetrics to improve maternal and infant outcomes, may be associated with adverse effects for the mother sufficient for treatment cessation. This systematic review aimed to quantify maternal adverse effects attributed to treatment, assess how adverse effects vary according to different regimens, and explore women's experiences with this treatment.

Methods

Bibliographic databases were searched from their inceptions to July 2012 for studies of any design that reported on maternal adverse effects associated with antenatal magnesium sulphate given to improve maternal or infant outcomes. Primary outcomes were life-threatening adverse effects of treatment (death, cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest). For randomised controlled trials, data were meta-analysed, and risk ratios (RR) pooled using fixed-effects or random-effects models. For non-randomised studies, data were tabulated by design, and presented as RR, odds ratios or percentages, and summarised narratively.

Results

A total of 143 publications were included (21 randomised trials, 15 non-randomised comparative studies, 32 case series and 75 reports of individual cases), of mixed methodological quality. Compared with placebo or no treatment, magnesium sulphate was not associated with an increased risk of maternal death, cardiac arrest or respiratory arrest. Magnesium sulphate significantly increased the risk of 'any adverse effects' overall (RR 4.62, 95% CI 2.42–8.83; 4 trials, 13,322 women), and treatment cessation due to adverse effects (RR 2.77; 95% CI 2.32–3.30; 5 trials, 13,666 women). Few subgroup differences were observed (between indications for use and treatment regimens). In one trial, a lower dose regimen (2 g/3 hours) compared with a higher dose regimen (5 g/4 hours) significantly reduced treatment cessation (RR 0.05; 95% CI 0.01–0.39, 126 women). Adverse effect estimates from studies of other designs largely supported data from randomised trials. Case reports supported an association between iatrogenic overdose of magnesium sulphate and life-threatening consequences.

Conclusions

Appropriate administration of antenatal magnesium sulphate was not shown to be associated with serious maternal adverse effects, though an increase in 'minor' adverse effects and treatment cessation was shown. Larger trials are needed to determine optimal regimens, achieving maximal effectiveness with minimal adverse effects, for each antenatal indication for use. Vigilance in the use of magnesium sulphate is essential for women's safety.

### Magnesium sulphate in the treatment of acute asthma: evaluation of current practice in adult emergency departments [^112xS2BT]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

A recent meta-analysis showed that intravenous and nebulised magnesium sulphate have similar levels of evidence to support their use in the treatment of acute asthma in adults. This consisted of weak evidence of effect on respiratory function and hospital admissions, with wide confidence intervals ranging from no effect to significant positive effects. Current BTS/SIGN guidelines suggest an equivocal role for intravenous magnesium sulphate and no role for nebulised magnesium sulphate. A study was performed to assess what emergency physicians currently do in their management of acute asthma.

Method

A postal survey was undertaken of all adult emergency departments within the UK. A structured questionnaire was sent to all clinical leads in emergency medicine about their current usage of both intravenous and nebulised magnesium sulphate in the treatment of acute asthma.

Results

180 of the 251 emergency departments in the UK responded (72%). Magnesium sulphate was used in 93%, mostly because it was expected to relieve breathlessness (70%) or reduce HDU/ITU admissions (51%). It was predominantly given to those patients with acute severe asthma (84%) and life-threatening exacerbations (87%), with most stating they would give the drug if there was no response to repeated nebulisers (68%). In comparison, nebulised magnesium sulphate was only used in two emergency departments (1%). The main reason for not administering the drug via a nebuliser was insufficient evidence (51%).

Conclusions

Intravenous magnesium sulphate is widely used for acute asthma, usually for patients with severe or life-threatening asthma who have not responded to initial treatment. Nebulised magnesium sulphate, by contrast, is hardly used at all. The use of intravenous magnesium sulphate is more extensive than current guidelines or available evidence would appear to support.

Respiratory distress — notes/educational pearls: The combination of ipratropium with albuterol may decrease the need for hospital admission in certain patients. Magnesium sulfate may cause hypotension that will usually respond to a fluid bolus. Patient with acute heart failure and hypotension have high mortality. When assessing for cause of respiratory distress, CHF tends to be associated with lower levels of EtCO2 compared to COPD, and EtCO2 values that are extremely low and high are markers of poor outcomes and need for intubation or ICU admission.

### Inhaled magnesium sulfate in the treatment of acute asthma [^116MrWx7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma exacerbations can be frequent and range in severity from mild to life-threatening. The use of magnesium sulfate (MgSO₄) is one of numerous treatment options available during acute exacerbations. While the efficacy of intravenous MgSO₄ has been demonstrated, the role of inhaled MgSO₄ is less clear.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of inhaled MgSO₄ administered in acute asthma.

Specific Aims

to quantify the effects of inhaled MgSO₄ I) in addition to combination treatment with inhaled β₂-agonist and ipratropium bromide; ii) in addition to inhaled β₂-agonist; and iii) in comparison to inhaled β₂-agonist.

Search Methods

We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the Cochrane Airways Group register of trials and online trials registries in September 2017. We supplemented these with searches of the reference lists of published studies and by contact with trialists.

Selection Criteria

RCTs including adults or children with acute asthma were eligible for inclusion in the review. We included studies if patients were treated with nebulised MgSO₄ alone or in combination with β₂-agonist or ipratropium bromide or both, and were compared with the same co-intervention alone or inactive control.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial selection, data extraction and risk of bias. We made efforts to collect missing data from authors. We present results, with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for pulmonary function, clinical severity scores and vital signs; and risk ratios (RRs) for hospital admission. We used risk differences (RDs) to analyse adverse events because events were rare.

Main Results

Twenty-five trials (43 references) of varying methodological quality were eligible; they included 2907 randomised patients (2777 patients completed). Nine of the 25 included studies involved adults; four included adult and paediatric patients; eight studies enrolled paediatric patients; and in the remaining four studies the age of participants was not stated. The design, definitions, intervention and outcomes were different in all 25 studies; this heterogeneity made direct comparisons difficult. The quality of the evidence presented ranged from high to very low, with most outcomes graded as low or very low. This was largely due to concerns about the methodological quality of the included studies and imprecision in the pooled effect estimates. Inhaled magnesium sulfate in addition to inhaled β₂-agonist and ipratropiumWe included seven studies in this comparison. Although some individual studies reported improvement in lung function indices favouring the intervention group, results were inconsistent overall and the largest study reporting this outcome found no between-group difference at 60 minutes (MD -0.3% predicted peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), 95% CI -2.71% to 2.11%). Admissions to hospital at initial presentation may be reduced by the addition of inhaled magnesium sulfate (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.00; participants = 1308; studies = 4; I² = 52%) but no difference was detected for re-admissions or escalation of care to ITU/HDU. Serious adverse events during admission were rare. There was no difference between groups for all adverse events during admission (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.05; participants = 1197; studies = 2). Inhaled magnesium sulfate in addition to inhaled β₂-agonistWe included 13 studies in this comparison. Although some individual studies reported improvement in lung function indices favouring the intervention group, none of the pooled results showed a conclusive benefit as measured by FEV1 or PEFR. Pooled results for hospital admission showed a point estimate that favoured the combination of MgSO₄ and β₂-agonist, but the confidence interval includes the possibility of admissions increasing in the intervention group (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.15; participants = 375; studies = 6; I² = 0%). There were no serious adverse events reported by any of the included studies and no between-group difference for all adverse events (RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.03; participants = 694; studies = 5). Inhaled magnesium sulfate versus inhaled β₂-agonistWe included four studies in this comparison. The evidence for the efficacy of β₂-agonists in acute asthma is well-established and therefore this could be considered a historical comparison. Two studies reported a benefit of β₂-agonist over MgSO₄ alone for PEFR and two studies reported no difference; we did not pool these results. Admissions to hospital were only reported by one small study and events were rare, leading to an uncertain result. No serious adverse events were reported in any of the studies in this comparison; one small study reported mild to moderate adverse events but the result is imprecise.

Authors' Conclusions

Treatment with nebulised MgSO₄ may result in modest additional benefits for lung function and hospital admission when added to inhaled β₂-agonists and ipratropium bromide, but our confidence in the evidence is low and there remains substantial uncertainty. The recent large, well-designed trials have generally not demonstrated clinically important benefits. Nebulised MgSO₄ does not appear to be associated with an increase in serious adverse events. Individual studies suggest that those with more severe attacks and attacks of shorter duration may experience a greater benefit but further research into subgroups is warranted. Despite including 24 trials in this review update we were unable to pool data for all outcomes of interest and this has limited the strength of the conclusions reached. A core outcomes set for studies in acute asthma is needed. This is particularly important in paediatric studies where measuring lung function at the time of an exacerbation may not be possible. Placebo-controlled trials in patients not responding to standard maximal treatment, including inhaled β₂-agonists and ipratropium bromide and systemic steroids, may help establish if nebulised MgSO₄ has a role in acute asthma. However, the accumulating evidence suggests that a substantial benefit may be unlikely.

The following adverse reactions have been identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

The most common adverse reactions are flushing, sweating, hypotension, depressed reflexes, flaccid paralysis, hypothermia, circulatory collapse, cardiac and central nervous system (CNS) depression proceeding to respiratory paralysis and hypocalcemia. Bradycardia, pulmonary edema, decreased respiratory rate, lethargy, sedation, somnolence, visual disturbances, and hypermagnesemia are also reported (6)

### Use of isotonic nebulised magnesium sulphate as an adjuvant to salbutamol in treatment of severe asthma in adults: randomised placebo-controlled trial [^116LjEVv]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Intravenous magnesium can cause bronchodilation in treatment of severe asthma, however its effect by the nebulised route is uncertain. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of isotonic magnesium sulphate as an adjuvant to nebulised salbutamol in severe attacks of asthma.

Methods

We enrolled 52 patients with severe exacerbations of asthma presenting to the emergency departments at two hospitals in New Zealand. A severe exacerbation was defined as a forced expiratory volume at 1 s (FEV₁) of less than 50% predicted 30 min after initial administration of 2.5 mg salbutamol via nebulisation. In this randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial patients received 2.5 mg nebulised salbutamol mixed with either 2.5 mL isotonic magnesium sulphate or isotonic saline on three occasions at 30 min intervals. The primary outcome measure was FEV(1) at 90 min. Analysis was per protocol.

Findings

At 90 min the mean FEV1 in the magnesium group was 1.96 L (95% CI 1.68–2.24) and in the saline group 1.55 L (1.24–1.87). The difference in the mean FEV(1) between the magnesium and saline groups was 0.37 L (0.13–0.61, p = 0.003).

Interpretation

Use of isotonic magnesium as an adjuvant to nebulised salbutamol results in an enhanced bronchodilator response in treatment of severe asthma.

### An integrative review of the side effects related to the use of magnesium sulfate for pre-eclampsia and eclampsia management [^1156Fsh1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia is one of the most common causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality in low and middle income countries. Magnesium sulfate is the drug of choice for prevention of seizures as part of comprehensive management of the disease. Despite the compelling evidence for the effectiveness of magnesium sulfate, concern has been expressed about its safety and potential for toxicity, particularly among providers in low- and middle-income countries. The purpose of this review was to determine whether the literature published in these global settings supports the concerns about the safety of use of magnesium sulfate.

Methods

An integrative review of the literature was conducted to document the known incidences of severe adverse reactions to magnesium sulphate, and specific outcomes of interest related to its use. All types of prospective clinical studies were included if magnesium sulfate was used to manage pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the study was conducted in a low- or middle-income country, and the study included the recording of the incidence of any adverse side effect resulting from magnesium sulfate use.

Results

A total of 24 studies that compared a magnesium sulfate regimen against other drug regimens and examined side effects among 34 subject groups were included. The overall rate of absent patellar reflex among all 9556 aggregated women was 1.6%, with a range of 0–57%. The overall rate of respiratory depression in 25 subject groups in which this outcome was reported was 1.3%, with a range of 0–8.2%. Delay in repeat administration of magnesium sulfate occurred in 3.6% of cases, with a range of 0–65%. Calcium gluconate was administered at an overall rate of less than 0.2%. There was only one maternal death that was attributed by the study authors to the use of magnesium sulfate among the 9556 women in the 24 studies.

Conclusion

Concerns about safety and toxicity from the use of magnesium sulfate should be mitigated by findings from this integrative review, which indicates a low incidence of the most severe side effects, documented in studies that used a wide variety of standard and modified drug regimens. Adverse effects of concern to providers occur infrequently, and when they occurred, a delay of repeat administration was generally sufficient to mitigate the effect. Early screening and diagnosis of the disease, appropriate treatment with proven drugs, and reasonable vigilance for women under treatment should be adopted as global policy and practice.

### Magnesium sulphate at 30 to 34 weeks' gestational age: neuroprotection trial (MAGENTA) – study protocol [^114jAmUe]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

For the child

Key health outcomes assessed at two years' corrected age:

- Individual components of the primary outcome including severity of cerebral palsy (defined as death; cerebral palsy).

- Death or any neurosensory disability (death defined as stillbirth, death of live born infant before hospital discharge or death after hospital discharge; and any neurosensory disabilities that includes the neurosensory impairments of cerebral palsy, [GMFCS level 1 to 5], blindness [corrected visual acuity worse than 6/60 in the better eye], deafness [hearing loss requiring amplification or worse], and any developmental delay defined as standardised score more than 1 SD below the mean (< −1SD).

- Death or major neurosensory disability. Major neurosensory disability includes severe and moderate disability (defined as any of: legal blindness, sensorineural deafness requiring hearing aids; moderate or severe cerebral palsy [GMFCS level 2 to 5] or developmental delay/intellectual impairment [standardised score more than two SD below the mean].

- General health of the child (including use of health services since primary hospitalisation), childhood respiratory morbidity, blood pressure (Z scores and proportions in hypertensive ranges), behaviour as assessed by the Child Behaviour Checklist and body size.

For the mother

- Maternal serious adverse cardiovascular and/or respiratory outcome of the infusion (defined as maternal death, cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest).

- Maternal side effects of the infusion (including nausea; vomiting; flushing, infusion arm discomfort; mouth dryness; sweating; dizziness; blurred vision; respiratory rate decreased > four breaths per minute below baseline or < 12 breaths per minute; blood pressure decreased > 15 mmHg below baseline level; whether the infusion is discontinued because of side effects).

- Incidence of postpartum haemorrhage, estimated blood loss at birth 500 mL or more; and major postpartum haemorrhage, estimated blood loss 1500 mL or more; mode of birth.

### Magnesium sulphate at 30 to 34 weeks' gestational age: neuroprotection trial (MAGENTA) – study protocol [^113bULBr]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Both study groups

The woman's pulse, blood pressure and respiratory rate are assessed and recorded before the infusion is commenced, fifteen minutes after the infusion has started and at the end of the infusion. Any other monitoring as per the individual obstetric unit protocols for intravenous administration of magnesium sulphate is followed. Magnesium toxicity is unlikely with the regimen recommended in this protocol and serum magnesium concentrations do not need to be routinely measured. There is a potential theoretical interaction between magnesium sulphate and nifedipine of hypotension and neuromuscular blockade effects, although this is seldom reported in clinical practice.

The trial treatment infusion should be stopped if the respiratory rate decreases more than four breaths per minute below baseline, or is less than 12 breaths per minute; or diastolic blood pressure decreases more than 15 mmHg below baseline level. The infusion may be continued when the respiratory rate or the blood pressure return to the baseline levels. Should hypotension or respiratory depression occur, prompt medical review is recommended. If there is clinical concern over respiratory depression calcium gluconate (1 g [10 mL of 10% solution] can be given slowly via the intravenous route over 10 minutes). Resuscitation and ventilatory support should be immediately available, if needed, during administration of the study medication. At the end of the trial treatment infusion, the section on maternal side effects should be completed on the Treatment form.

Care during labour and the postnatal stay will be managed by the obstetric team caring for the woman. Care of the neonate is the responsibility of the attending neonatologist.

Follow up after birth until the time of primary discharge for both groups

The pregnancy and labour data will be extracted from case notes by the masked research assistant at the collaborating hospitals. The postnatal and neonatal data will be collected similarly after discharge of the mother and baby from hospital.

Longer term follow up

Women enrolled in the trial will give consent for follow-up of their children from birth until two years' corrected age at the time of the initial, prenatal recruitment. Mothers of all babies discharged home alive will be contacted by a member of the study team from the coordinating centre at The University of Adelaide by mail soon after hospital discharge and then again when their baby is six, 12 and 18 months corrected age. Mothers will be provided with a reply paid envelope and asked to confirm their current contact details by mail. At each of these times, a member of the study team at the coordinating centre will contact the parents by telephone if a response has not been received in the mail.

### Management of asthma and COPD exacerbations in adults in the ICU [^114Cxgat]. CHEST Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Other Medications

IV magnesium sulfate has been shown to reduce hospitalizations among patients with life-threatening asthma exacerbations and COPD exacerbations in the ED, and it should be considered in patients not responding to initial therapies (Table 2).– The use of ketamine, a dissociative analgesic with bronchodilator effects, has been suggested in patients who are not intubated at low, subdissociative doses; however, quality data showing a clinical benefit are lacking. Some interest exists in using biologic agents in asthma exacerbations, given their relatively quick onset over days, although data have been limited to case reports and 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrating that benralizumab administered in the ED reduced the rate of recurrent exacerbations in the subsequent 12 weeks. Methylxanthines (eg, theophylline and aminophylline) and terbutaline, an IV β 2 -agonist, are not recommended for asthma or COPD exacerbations among adults because of their lack of efficacy compared with inhaled β 2 -agonists, and methylxanthines are associated with increased side effects and adverse events such as tachyarrhythmias.

Inhaled Gases

The use of volatile anesthetics for life-threatening asthma exacerbations has been described in case reports, although prospective data are insufficient to support their use outside of refractory cases of bronchospasm until further research is carried out. – No role currently exists for volatile anesthetics in severe COPD exacerbations because studies show mixed effects on respiratory mechanics compared with IV sedation. Helium-oxygen (heliox) mixtures, used to promote laminar flow and to reduce airway resistance, may improve respiratory mechanics during severe asthma exacerbations, although data are limited on meaningful clinical outcomes in this population. – Among COPD exacerbations requiring NIV or IMV, heliox improves the work of breathing and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi). Two RCTs of COPD exacerbations requiring NIV found that heliox did not prevent NIV failure; however, trends toward lower intubation rates and greater time to NIV failure were noted in the heliox group. – Heliox could be considered on a case-by-case basis as an adjunct therapy for patients with severe asthma and COPD exacerbations refractory to other treatments.

5.3	Risk of Elevated Blood Glucose

Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known prediabetes or diabetes mellitus given the risk of elevated blood glucose.

5.4	Co-administration with Unapproved Tocolytics

Do not use Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection with unapproved tocolytics (e.g., beta adrenergic agents such as terbutaline, or with calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine). Serious adverse events including pulmonary edema and hypotension have occurred [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.5	Aluminum Toxicity

Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection contains aluminum that may be toxic (Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection contains less than 25 mcg/L of aluminum). Aluminum may reach toxic concentrations with prolonged parenteral administration in patients with renal impairment.

Patients with renal impairment who receive parenteral concentrations of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day, accumulate aluminum at concentrations associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.

5.6	Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis

Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection is contraindicated in patients with known myasthenia gravis.

Use of magnesium sulfate in patients with underlying myasthenia gravis can precipitate a myasthenic crisis. Myasthenic crisis is a life-threatening condition characterized by neuromuscular respiratory failure. Symptoms of myasthenic crisis may include difficulty swallowing, ptosis, facial droop, weakness and/or difficulty breathing that may require intubation.

If myasthenic crisis is suspected, discontinue use of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection immediately. Secure the patient's airway. Consider intensive care unit admission and elective intubation, if respiratory failure is anticipated. Once the airway is secure, confirm the diagnosis. Therapies include plasmapheresis and plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and immunomodulating therapy in addition to high-dose glucocorticoids.

Magnesium sulfate is associated with several minor side effects such as a feeling of warmth, flushing, nausea and vomiting, muscle weakness, somnolence, dizziness, and irritation at the injection site. More serious side effects are rare but include the loss of the patellar reflex (typically occurring at a serum concentration of 8–10 mEq/L) and respiratory depression (> 13 mEq/L).

Routine monitoring of a woman undergoing magnesium sulfate therapy includes simple assessment of neurologic status (level of alertness and patellar reflexes), respiratory rate and urinary output. Typical management of the more serious side effects includes heightened monitoring, delay in administration of next dose or suspension of magnesium sulfate therapy. Oliguria is an element of the disease process [reduced clearance by the kidneys], and not an adverse effect of magnesium sulfate use. Because magnesium is cleared by the kidneys, oliguria of less than 30 cc per hour is used as a determinant for withholding a scheduled dose, in order to prevent toxic levels. If serious toxicity is suspected, and immediate counteraction of magnesium is desired, calcium gluconate can be administered to counteract the effect of magnesium levels that are well above the therapeutic range.

Despite the compelling evidence for the effectiveness of magnesium sulfate concern has been expressed about the safety of its administration and use, particularly in clinical environments where the capacity for patient monitoring is limited. These concerns can constrain initiation of treatment for all women with indicated need, or may impede sustaining therapy over the recommended timeline established for the particular regimen, once treatment has been initiated.

The purpose of this review was to determine whether the published literature from low- and middle-income countries supports the concerns about the safety of use of magnesium sulfate. The review identifies the frequency of severe adverse reactions when the drug is used according to a recommended protocol, and the frequency of the need for intervention as a result of those reactions.

### Use of intravenous magnesium sulfate in addition to standard first-line treatment with inhaled / nebulised short-acting beta 2 agonist and systemic steroids in the management of acute asthma exacerbations in children: a systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials [^111CW24J]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of intravenous magnesium sulfate in asthma exacerbation is unclear.

Aims

To determine the efficacy and safety of intravenous magnesium sulfate in managing asthma exacerbation in children.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Web of Science up to May 2024. We included randomised controlled trials and followed the international guidelines for conducting systematic reviews. Outcomes included morbidity, escalation of care, length of hospital stay, lung functions, adverse events, and mortality.

Results

Nine studies (total participants = 473) were included. Hospitalisation rate and the need for non-invasive ventilation were less among the intravenous magnesium sulfate group (mean difference (MD) = 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.90, I² 7%, n = 115) and (risk ratio (RR) = 0.17, 95%CI 0.15 to 0.54, p = 0.003, n = 143), respectively. Asthma severity scores (MD = -0.18, 95%CI -1.35 to 0.98, I 2 2%, n = 115), length of hospital stay (MD = -78.86, 95%CI -200.37 to 42.66, I² 99%, n = 284) and the need for invasive ventilation (RR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.17, I 2 0%, n = 237) were similar. There was no difference in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) admission rate (p = 0.43 n = 61). Peak expiratory flow improved in the intravenous magnesium group (p < 0.001, n = 20). No serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusion

We found low-certainty evidence that intravenous magnesium sulfate results in a lower hospitalisation rate and less need for non-invasive ventilation. Asthma scores, PICU admission, invasive ventilation and length of hospital stay were similar. While the evidence base is weak, the favourable safety profile suggests that intravenous magnesium sulfate can be considered a treatment for asthma exacerbations.

P208 Intravenous magnesium sulfate in the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD: a randomized controlled trial

E Pishbin, E Vafadar Moradi

Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran

Introduction: Intravenous (IV) magnesium has an established role in the treatment of acute asthma attack. It is attractive as a bronchodilator because it is relatively cheap and has minimal side effects. There are few studies evaluating the effect of magnesium on acute exacerbation of COPD and the results of them are contradictory.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of IV magnesium sulfate in the treatment of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute exacerbation of COPD.

Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, adult patients presented to the ED with acute exacerbation of COPD were randomly allocated in 2 groups. Patients in the study group received the standard treatment, plus 2 gram of IV magnesium sulfate and patients in the control group received the standard treatment, plus placebo. The outcomes included admission rate, intubation rate, changes in PEFR, SpO2 and dyspnea severity score. PEFR, SpO2 and dyspnea severity score were documented before the treatment and 20 minutes after administration of MgSO4 or placebo.

Results: 34 patients were included in the study (17 patients in each group), 16 patients were men and 18 patients were women. The study group had significantly more improvement in the dyspnea severity score (P = 0.001) and SpO2 (P = 0.004) as compared to the control group. But the difference in the changes in PEFR, intubation rate and admission rate were not clinically significant between 2 groups. (P > 0.05)

Conclusions: Adding magnesium sulfate to the standard treatment in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD leads to more improvement in dyspnea severity score and SpO2 although it does not reduce admission rate and intubation rate.

Small sample size and the dependency of PEFR on patient's effort are limitations of the present study. Furthermore we did not exclude the patients with the Cor pulmonale which may had an effect on the low response rate to MgSO4.

### Nasal high-flow oxygen versus conventional oxygen therapy for acute severe asthma patients: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^1113QEnr]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Protocol and Interventions

After arrival in the ED, all patients were assessed consecutively for eligibility by an ED physician. If acute severe asthma was suspected, the physician gave standard treatment as per recommendation, 1 which included up to three doses of nebulized beta‐agonist and anticholinergics every 20 minutes. Oxygen therapy was given via nebulization during a 60‐minute run‐in period. Systemic corticosteroid and magnesium sulfate were given and investigations such as laboratory analysis and chest radiographs were ordered at the discretion of the treating physician. This physician then notified a project investigator, who confirmed and reassessed eligibility at 60 minutes after initial management. This run‐in period was designed to exclude patients whose severity of acute attack was too mild or too severe, who might not have completed the study protocol. If eligibility was confirmed, the project investigator enrolled the patient, obtained informed consent, randomized the interventions, and completed data collection. A computer‐generated, mixed‐block (block size of 2 and 4) randomization for sequence assignment (1:1 ratio) was performed using sealed opaque envelopes.

Enrolled patients were randomized to receive either COT or NHF for 120 minutes. COT was given by a standard oxygen nasal cannula or nonrebreather mask. NHF was delivered by a high‐flow blower‐humidifier AIRVO 2 via Optiflow medium‐sized high‐flow nasal cannula (Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Auckland, New Zealand). The initial NHF rate was 35 L/min and could be adjusted from 30 to 60 L/min according to the participant's level of comfort. FiO 2 was adjusted in both groups to achieve a steady state SpO 2 of 95% to 99% or 90% to 92% if the patients' baseline SpO 2 at room was less than 92%.

During the trial, all participants received standard treatments and interventions, including continued doses of bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroid, and magnesium sulfate if not given prior to reassessment, antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and other treatments as deemed appropriate by the treating physician. After the trial, standard of care for acute severe asthma and other treatments were delivered at the discretion of the treating physicians.

### Asthma and other recurrent wheezing disorders in children (acute) [^1139FBje]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2012). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute childhood asthma is a common clinical emergency presenting across a range of ages and with a range of severities.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute asthma in children? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 35 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: beta2 agonists (high-dose nebulised, metered-dose inhaler plus spacer device versus nebuliser, intravenous), corticosteroids (systemic, high-dose inhaled), ipratropium bromide (single- or multiple-dose inhaled), magnesium sulphate, oxygen, and theophylline or aminophylline.

6	ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following adverse reactions have been identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

The most common adverse reactions are flushing, sweating, hypotension, depressed reflexes, flaccid paralysis, hypothermia, circulatory collapse, cardiac and central nervous system (CNS) depression proceeding to respiratory paralysis and hypocalcemia. Bradycardia, pulmonary edema, decreased respiratory rate, lethargy, sedation, somnolence, visual disturbances, and hypermagnesemia are also reported (6)

### Magnesium sulfate in dextrose [^113MUhRW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10	OVERDOSAGE

Manifestations of magnesium toxicity include a drop in blood pressure, difficulty breathing, and disappearance of the patellar reflex. As serum magnesium rises above 4 mEq per liter, the deep tendon reflexes decrease. As the serum magnesium level approaches 10 mEq per liter, the tendon reflexes disappear and respiratory paralysis may occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Other signs and symptoms of magnesium overdosage include flushing, sweating, hypotension, weakness, hypothermia, circulatory collapse, cardiac and central nervous system depression proceeding to respiratory paralysis, cardiac arrest, and prolongation of PR and QRS intervals. Patients with renal impairment and underlying neuromuscular diseases such as myasthenia gravis may experience magnesium intoxication at lower magnesium concentrations (Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection is contraindicated in patients with myasthenia gravis).

If patient is experiencing magnesium toxicity, immediately discontinue Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection. Artificial respiration may be required. Administer an injectable calcium salt to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Hypermagnesemia in the newborn (after administration of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection to the mother) may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as intravenous calcium.

### A randomized clinical trial of nebulized magnesium sulfate in addition to albuterol in the treatment of acute mild-to-moderate asthma exacerbations in adults [^114KMX8M]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We sought to compare the efficacy and safety of nebulized magnesium sulfate (MgSO(4)) plus albuterol with that of albuterol alone in adult patients with mild-to-moderate acute asthma exacerbations.

Methods

Patients were randomized to receive nebulized MgSO(4) (384 mg in 6 mL of sterile water) or an equal volume of placebo (normal saline solution) in a double-blind fashion after each dose of nebulized albuterol administered (2.5 mg/3 mL) every 20 minutes for the first hour of the study. Spirometry was performed at baseline and every 20 minutes for 2 hours. Monitoring for safety included vital signs, pulse oximetry, and serum magnesium levels. Improvement in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second was chosen as a primary efficacy end point.

Results

Among 74 patients enrolled, 37 were randomized to each of 2 study groups. There were no statistically or clinically significant differences between the 2 study groups in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second at any point during the trial or overall. There were no significant differences in vital signs, pulse oximetry, or serum magnesium levels at any point during the study.

Conclusion

The combination of nebulized MgSO(4) and albuterol provides no benefit in addition to that provided by therapy with albuterol in adult patients with mild-to-moderate asthma exacerbations. The efficacy of nebulized MgSO(4) in patients with severe asthma exacerbations remains unknown.

### An integrative review of systematic reviews related to the management of breathlessness in respiratory illnesses [^111tzUB5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Asthma (pharmacological treatments)

In all, 69 systematic reviews were identified. Eighteen were excluded because they referred only to children, did not specify symptoms as outcomes, or were reviews of studies of vaccines or comparisons between devices. Of the 51 reviews included, 50 were accessed via the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Seven included data on breathlessness while all others assessed breathlessness as part of a single score of 'asthma symptoms'. Again, there was heterogeneity between systematic reviews in the specific outcomes measured within these symptom scores.

Treatments included: anti-leukotrienes; beta-agonists (inhaled/non-inhaled); allergen immunotherapy; anti-IgE; antibiotics; anti-cholinergics; azathioprine; beclomethasone; budesonide; caffeine; beta-blockers; chloroquine; corticosteroids (inhaled/non-inhaled); cyclosporine; fluticasone; anti-gastro-oesophageal reflux treatment; gold; inhaled/non-inhaled magnesium sulphate; macrolides; methotrexate; oxatomide; and tailored interventions based on sputum eosinophils.

Many reviews report some level of benefit from or equivalence between treatments under review. Clearly steroids (both oral and intramuscular) improve lung function, while long-acting beta agonists (LABA) with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) demonstrate improved outcomes in lung function and symptoms compared to LABA and antileukotrienes, short-acting beta agonists (SABA) or theophylline. Treatments from large scale reviews that report positive effects most strongly include: allergen immunotherapy (57 trials), beclomethasone (60 trials), budesonide (43 trials), fluticasone (75 trials), ICS compared with sodium cromoglycate (25 trials), LABA (67 trials), and LABA vs. SABA (31 trials).

Small reviews of caffeine (6 trials), inhaled magnesium sulphate (6 trials), intravenous magnesium sulphate (7 trials), and tailored interventions based on sputum eosinophils, particularly those with severe asthma and frequent exacerbations (3 trials) also suggested therapeutic benefits. Caffeine (taken orally) has demonstrated a modest, though short-term (up to 4 hours), effect as a bronchodilator.

### Pharmacologic therapies in patients with exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^111HgcMr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by frequent exacerbations.

Purpose

To evaluate the comparative effectiveness and adverse events (AEs) of pharmacologic interventions for adults with exacerbation of COPD.

Data Sources

English-language searches of several bibliographic sources from database inception to 2 January 2019.

Study Selection

68 randomized controlled trials that enrolled adults with exacerbation of COPD treated in out- or inpatient settings other than intensive care and compared pharmacologic therapies with placebo, "usual care", or other pharmacologic interventions.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently extracted data and rated study quality and strength of evidence (SOE).

Data Synthesis

Compared with placebo or management without antibiotics, antibiotics given for 3 to 14 days were associated with increased exacerbation resolution at the end of the intervention (odds ratio [OR], 2.03 [95% CI, 1.47 to 2.80]; moderate SOE) and less treatment failure at the end of the intervention (OR, 0.54 [CI, 0.34 to 0.86]; moderate SOE), independent of severity of exacerbations in out- and inpatients. Compared with placebo in out- and inpatients, systemic corticosteroids given for 9 to 56 days were associated with less treatment failure at the end of the intervention (OR, 0.01 [CI, 0.00 to 0.13]; low SOE) but also with a higher number of total and endocrine-related AEs. Compared with placebo or usual care in inpatients, other pharmacologic interventions (aminophyllines, magnesium sulfate, anti-inflammatory agents, inhaled corticosteroids, and short-acting bronchodilators) had insufficient evidence, showing either no or inconclusive effects (with the exception of the mucolytic erdosteine) or improvement only in lung function.

Limitation

Scant evidence for many interventions; several studies had unclear or high risk of bias and inadequate reporting of AEs.

Conclusion

Antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids reduce treatment failure in adults with mild to severe exacerbation of COPD.

### Management of acute asthma exacerbations [^113juTH7]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbations can be classified as mild, moderate, severe, or life threatening. Criteria for exacerbation severity are based on symptoms and physical examination parameters, as well as lung function and oxygen saturation. In patients with a peak expiratory flow of 50 to 79 percent of their personal best, up to two treatments of two to six inhalations of short-acting beta2 agonists 20 minutes apart followed by a reassessment of peak expiratory flow and symptoms may be safely employed at home. Administration using a hand-held metered-dose inhaler with a spacer device is at least equivalent to nebulized beta2 agonist therapy in children and adults. In the ambulatory and emergency department settings, the goals of treatment are correction of severe hypoxemia, rapid reversal of airflow obstruction, and reduction of the risk of relapse. Multiple doses of inhaled anticholinergic medication combined with beta2 agonists improve lung function and decrease hospitalization in school-age children with severe asthma exacerbations. Intravenous magnesium sulfate has been shown to significantly increase lung function and decrease the necessity of hospitalization in children. The administration of systemic corticosteroids within one hour of emergency department presentation decreases the need for hospitalization, with the most pronounced effect in patients with severe exacerbations. Airway inflammation can persist for days to weeks after an acute attack; therefore, more intensive treatment should be continued after discharge until symptoms and peak expiratory flow return to baseline.
