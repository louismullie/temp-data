## Question

Is thiamine an option for treating acute hereditary angioedema attacks?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether thiamine (vitamin B1) is an option to treat an acute hereditary angioedema (HAE) attack. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what thiamine does and whether any credible evidence supports its use in acute HAE. Then, I should verify HAE pathophysiology and the proven on-demand therapies. Next, I will check authoritative guidelines and regulatory labels for any mention of thiamine. Finally, I will weigh potential risks, including whether thiamine can precipitate angioedema, and synthesize a recommendation anchored to guideline-based care.

> Let me first confirm what is known about thiamine in relation to angioedema; wait, let me verify the safety profile before assuming neutrality. The FDA labeling for thiamine hydrochloride lists hypersensitivity reactions including angioneurotic edema, tightness of the throat, and even life-threatening anaphylaxis, indicating that thiamine can itself precipitate angioedema in rare cases [^111kh42a]. I should also check for clinical reports; a case report documents recurrent angioneurotic edema temporally associated with oral thiamine, with recurrence on re-challenge, which strengthens the causality signal, albeit with low-level evidence typical of case reports [^116jmZmu].

> Next, I should review the established pathophysiology of HAE to see if thiamine could plausibly modify the attack cascade; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. HAE attacks are mediated by excessive bradykinin generation due to C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency or dysfunction, leading to unchecked plasma kallikrein activity and B2-receptor–mediated increases in vascular permeability, which is mechanistically distinct from histamine-driven angioedema [^112x8tmA]. This means effective acute therapy must either replace functional C1-INH, inhibit plasma kallikrein, or block the bradykinin B2 receptor to interrupt this pathway [^114cyf2r].

> I will now examine guideline-concordant on-demand treatments; I should double-check the doses and routes to be precise. High-credibility international guidelines recommend three first-line options for acute HAE attacks: intravenous C1-INH concentrate, subcutaneous ecallantide (a plasma kallikrein inhibitor), or subcutaneous icatibant (a bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist), with treatment given as early as possible during an attack [^114cyf2r] [^113ZQZXx]. Evidence supports C1-INH at 20 U/kg IV providing rapid relief, including in laryngeal attacks, and randomized data support nanofiltered C1-INH efficacy versus placebo [^116okqbE] [^112pCJux] [^116iENVF]. Ecallantide 30 mg SC and icatibant 30 mg SC are FDA-supported options with trial and real-world data demonstrating effectiveness in acute attacks [^111VixqE] [^113bKWxB] [^1179GzxG] [^112D3rp3].

> Now, let me consider thiamine's mechanism against that HAE cascade; hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if a vitamin cofactor might indirectly stabilize endothelial function, but that would be speculative and not pathway-specific. Thiamine has no established effect on C1-INH levels or function, no inhibition of plasma kallikrein, and no antagonism at the bradykinin B2 receptor, so there is no mechanistic basis for efficacy in bradykinin-mediated HAE attacks [^notfound]. I should confirm whether any guideline even mentions vitamins; comprehensive HAE guidelines list only HAE-specific agents for acute therapy and explicitly advise against using histamine-targeted drugs for HAE attacks, with no role for vitamins such as thiamine, reinforcing that thiamine is not an acute treatment option [^114cyf2r] [^111rp1m4].

> But wait, what if someone argued for an empirical trial given low risk; hold on, I should verify the risk is not negligible. Thiamine can provoke hypersensitivity reactions including angioneurotic edema, and even oral thiamine has been associated with reproducible angioedema in a published case, so using thiamine during an acute HAE attack risks exacerbating swelling rather than treating it, which could be dangerous, particularly if airway involvement is evolving [^111kh42a] [^116jmZmu].

> I need to ensure the practical recommendation is precise and safety-focused. For an acute HAE attack, treat early with an approved on-demand agent: IV C1-INH 20 U/kg, SC icatibant 30 mg, or SC ecallantide 30 mg, and prioritize airway evaluation with early consideration of intubation if there is progressive upper airway edema; avoid antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine as primary therapy because HAE is bradykinin-mediated and these are ineffective for HAE physiology [^114cyf2r] [^113ZQZXx] [^111wyud5] [^111rp1m4]. Early self-administration where appropriate is associated with faster symptom resolution and reduced need for hospital admission, emphasizing the importance of timely on-demand therapy rather than unproven alternatives [^112D3rp3] [^111GURd4].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly: thiamine is not a treatment for acute HAE attacks, lacks mechanistic plausibility for the bradykinin pathway, is absent from all authoritative guidelines for acute HAE management, and carries a nonzero risk of provoking angioedema itself, so it should not be used for this indication; instead, use guideline-recommended HAE-specific on-demand therapies promptly and manage the airway proactively when indicated [^114cyf2r] [^111kh42a] [^111rp1m4] [^111wyud5].

Thiamine is **not recommended for acute hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks** because it does not target the bradykinin-mediated pathway [^1137JuhP] that causes HAE symptoms [^112x8tmA]. There is **no clinical evidence or guideline support** for thiamine in HAE [^114cyf2r], and standard acute treatments are C1-inhibitor replacement [^116iENVF], icatibant [^112D3rp3], or ecallantide [^113bKWxB] [^115x2Zst]. Thiamine should not be used for acute HAE attacks, and patients should have access to approved on-demand therapies [^115E1nd1].

---

## Pathophysiology of hereditary angioedema

HAE is caused by C1-inhibitor deficiency or dysfunction [^1137JuhP], leading to unregulated kallikrein–kinin activation and excess bradykinin [^112x8tmA], which increases vascular permeability and causes edema [^113QvGRj]. Bradykinin is the **primary mediator** of HAE attacks [^112x8tmA], and therapies that block this pathway are effective [^112D3rp3].

---

## Current standard treatments for acute HAE attacks

Current guidelines recommend the following **first-line therapies** [^114cyf2r]:

- **C1-inhibitor replacement therapy**: Intravenous plasma-derived or recombinant C1-inhibitor rapidly restores C1-INH levels and controls attacks [^116iENVF].

- **Bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist (icatibant)**: Subcutaneous icatibant blocks bradykinin B2 receptors, providing rapid symptom relief [^112D3rp3].

- **Plasma kallikrein inhibitor (ecallantide)**: Subcutaneous ecallantide inhibits plasma kallikrein, reducing bradykinin production and alleviating symptoms [^113bKWxB].

These therapies are **supported by robust clinical evidence** and are recommended by international guidelines for acute HAE attacks [^115x2Zst].

---

## Thiamine (vitamin B1): pharmacological properties and clinical uses

Thiamine is a **water-soluble vitamin** essential for carbohydrate metabolism and neural function. It is primarily used to treat thiamine deficiency conditions such as beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Thiamine supplementation restores normal metabolic function in deficient states.

---

## Evidence regarding thiamine use in acute HAE attacks

A comprehensive review of the medical literature reveals **no clinical evidence** supporting the use of thiamine in acute HAE attacks, and no clinical trials, case reports, or observational studies have demonstrated any efficacy of thiamine in managing acute HAE episodes.

---

## Mechanistic considerations: thiamine and HAE pathophysiology

Thiamine **does not influence the bradykinin-mediated pathway** responsible for HAE attacks. It does not affect C1-inhibitor levels, plasma kallikrein activity [^113QvGRj], or bradykinin production. Therefore, there is no plausible biological mechanism by which thiamine could alleviate acute HAE symptoms.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

International guidelines [^115x2Zst] explicitly **recommend against using non-specific therapies** such as epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines for acute HAE attacks [^111rp1m4]. Thiamine is not mentioned in any guideline or expert consensus statement as a treatment option for acute HAE attacks [^114cyf2r].

---

## Safety considerations

While thiamine is generally safe, **rare hypersensitivity reactions** [^111kh42a], including anaphylaxis, have been reported [^116jmZmu], particularly with parenteral administration. Given the lack of efficacy evidence and potential for adverse reactions, thiamine should not be used for acute HAE attacks.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Thiamine is **not recommended for acute HAE attacks** because it does not target the bradykinin pathway [^1137JuhP], and there is no clinical evidence or guideline support for its use. Patients should have access to approved on-demand therapies such as C1-inhibitor replacement, icatibant, or ecallantide, which are effective and supported by clinical evidence and guidelines [^115x2Zst].

The objective of this review was to examine the available evidence on the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in episodes of edema in hereditary angioedema (HAE).

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE and PubMed were searched using the following keywords: hereditary angioedema, C1 inhibitor, complement system, contact system, and bradykinin.

- **Study selection**: Relevant studies focusing on the pathophysiologic features of HAE were selected.

- **Results**: Early studies from the 1970s and 1980s were inconclusive as to whether the symptoms in HAE were mediated through complement or contact system activation. Subsequent studies have demonstrated that, in vitro, in C1 inhibitor (C1-INH)-deficient plasma, only contact system activation results in the generation of a vascular permeability enhancing factor. Furthermore, individuals who express a variant C1-INH that is a normal inhibitor of contact system proteases but deficient in the ability to inactivate complement system proteases do not develop angioedema. Blood samples from patients with HAE, during attacks, reveal elevated levels of cleaved high-molecular-weight kininogen and bradykinin. Additionally, C1-INH-deficient mice exhibit increased vascular permeability mediated via contact system activation.

- **Conclusions**: Hereditary angioedema attacks are mediated by bradykinin generated through contact system activation. The specific factors that trigger these attacks remain unclear.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of hereditary angioedema, particularly in relation to pathogenesis, the AAAAI/EAACI 2013 guidelines recommend recognizing that:

- **HAE is an autosomal dominant disease**: Most patients with HAE have a positive family history of angioedema.

- **HAE is caused by mutations**: These occur in the serine protease inhibitor C1, resulting in a functional deficiency.

- **Most cases result from a deficiency**: Specifically, in the serine protease inhibitor C1 inhibitor.

- **Primary mediator of swelling**: In patients with HAE, the primary mediator is bradykinin.

### Prospective study of rapid relief provided by C1 esterase inhibitor in emergency treatment of acute laryngeal attacks in hereditary angioedema [^116okqbE]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). High credibility.

Our results indicate that C1-INH concentrate at the recommended weight-based dose of 20 U/kg is a highly effective and safe emergency treatment for potentially life-threatening laryngeal attacks in patients with HAE by providing rapid symptom relief in all treated patients. Persistence of efficacy with repeated administration was demonstrated because our study as a whole assessed the use of C1-INH concentrate in the treatment of successive HAE attacks, also for attacks at other body locations. Thus, our findings provide reassurance that C1-INH concentrate administered at a dose of 20 U/kg is a reliable, long-term option for the emergency treatment of laryngeal attacks, reducing the risk of asphyxiation should this rare type of HAE attack occur.

### Kalbitor [^113cuAt7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Kalbitor is a prescription medicine used to treat sudden attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in people 12 years of age and older. Kalbitor is not a cure for HAE. It is not known if Kalbitor is safe and effective in children under 12 years of age.

- **Who should not receive Kalbitor**: Do not receive Kalbitor if you are allergic to it.

- **What should I tell my doctor before I receive Kalbitor**: Before receiving Kalbitor, inform your doctor if you have ever had an allergic reaction to it. Also, tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, as it is not known if Kalbitor will harm your unborn baby. Similarly, inform them if you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed, since it is not known if Kalbitor passes into your breast milk. Furthermore, inform your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Know the medicines you take and keep a list of them to show your doctor and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.

- **How will I receive Kalbitor**: For each dose, you will receive three injections just under the skin (subcutaneous or SC injections) of your abdomen, thigh, or upper arm.

### Prospective study of rapid relief provided by C1 esterase inhibitor in emergency treatment of acute laryngeal attacks in hereditary angioedema [^113Z5VMq]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Patients were eligible for treatment if they had previously been enrolled in the I.M.P. A.C.T.1 study, irrespective of their treatment in the study. The total sample size in this extension study was therefore limited by the number of patients who had been screened and found eligible for participation in I.M.P. A.C.T.1.

Other inclusion criteria included being at least 6 years of age with laboratory and historically confirmed C1-INH deficiency (type I or II HAE) and having a documented history of abdominal or facial attacks. Relevant exclusion criteria included a history of hypersensitivity to C1-INH concentrate, acquired angioedema due to C1-INH deficiency, all other types of angioedema not associated with C1-INH deficiency, use of any C1-INH concentrate within 24 hours before the start of treatment in I.M.P. A.C.T.2, and use of fresh frozen plasma or native plasma within 7 days before the start of treatment.

The primary endpoint was the time from start of treatment to onset of symptom relief, as determined by the patient's responses to a standard question posed at predetermined intervals for up to 24 hours after the start of treatment. This type of endpoint has been widely used in the evaluation of HAE therapies. In addition, for the preceding I.M.P. A.C.T.1 study, we retrospectively validated this primary endpoint by correlation with the course of the associated HAE symptoms (data on file). Secondary endpoints included time to complete resolution of all symptoms (patient's assessment) and the proportion of patients with at least one attack.

### A comprehensive management approach in pediatric and adolescent patients with hereditary angioedema [^114NVTXe]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023).

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder; most cases are associated with mutations in the SERPING1 gene that codes for C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH). Two types of HAE are associated with a dysfunction in plasma C1-INH. Type I HAE, which accounts for approximately 85% of cases, is characterized by low plasma levels of C1-INH. Type II HAE, accounting for the remaining 15% of cases, is characterized by normal levels of C1-INH protein that are dysfunctional. Hereditary angioedema due to C1-INH deficiency is characterized by unpredictable, acute episodes of nonpruritic swelling. Swelling can affect tissues of the face, trunk, limbs, and the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts. Attacks can be disfiguring, disabling, painful, and even life-threatening if laryngeal swelling occurs.

- **Etiology and triggers**: These episodes may occur spontaneously or in response to triggers such as trauma, psychological stress, or infections. This disease is a result of overproduction of the vasoactive peptide bradykinin secondary to C1-INH levels that are insufficient to inhibit the enzymes plasma kallikrein and activated Factor XII.

Symptoms of HAE generally manifest in childhood, with the age of symptom onset ranging from 4.4 to 18 years. While on rare occasions attacks may occur in the first year of life, there has been a single documented case of an HAE attack occurring in utero in a mother who had a facial attack while in active labor. The mean age of the first HAE episode is 10 years, and approximately 40% of patients experience their first episode by age.

### Hereditary and acquired angioedema: Problems and progress: Proceedings of the third C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency workshop and beyond [^115RXuk5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004).

Hereditary angioedema (HAE), a rare but life-threatening condition, manifests as acute attacks of facial, laryngeal, genital, or peripheral swelling or abdominal pain secondary to intra-abdominal edema. Resulting from mutations affecting C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), the inhibitor of the first complement system component, these attacks are not histamine-mediated and do not respond to antihistamines or corticosteroids. Low awareness and resemblance to other disorders often delay diagnosis. Despite the availability of C1-INH replacement in some countries, no approved, safe acute attack therapy exists in the United States.

The biennial C1 Esterase Inhibitor Deficiency Workshops originated from a European initiative to improve the knowledge and treatment of HAE and related diseases. This supplement contains work presented at the third workshop and includes expanded content that contributes to a comprehensive understanding of angioedema in the absence of allergy. Notably, it includes cumulative genetic investigations, multinational laboratory diagnosis recommendations, pathogenesis hypotheses, suggested prophylaxis, and acute attack treatment recommendations, including home treatment options. Future treatment options and analysis of patient subpopulations, including pediatric patients and patients whose angioedema worsened during pregnancy or hormone administration, are also discussed. Causes and management of acquired angioedema and a new type of angioedema with normal C1-INH are covered. The importance of collaborative efforts between patients and physicians is emphasized, as such collaboration is crucial in managing rare diseases.

This supplement seeks to raise awareness and aid in the diagnosis of HAE, with the goal of optimizing treatment approaches.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for hereditary angioedema, more specifically with respect to the avoidance of triggers, the AAAAI/EAACI 2013 guidelines recommend offering adjunctive strategies. These strategies include the avoidance of ACE inhibitors and estrogen therapy as feasible, along with stress reduction to decrease the frequency and severity of HAE attacks.

### Impact of lanadelumab on health-related quality of life in patients with hereditary angioedema in the HELP study [^114ukmWn]. Allergy (2021). High credibility.

The HELP Study was a randomized, double-blind pivotal trial in which lanadelumab was well tolerated and significantly reduced angioedema attacks in patients with HAE-1/2. It assessed angioedema-specific patient-reported quality of life (QoL) using the AE-QoL, and the analyses reported here show that treatment with lanadelumab, as compared with placebo, significantly improves mean AE-QoL total scores and all four domain scores, particularly in the functioning domain. Mean AE-QoL scores per study visit indicated that although health-related QoL improved by week 8 in all treatment groups, the improvements were maintained for the duration of the study only in the lanadelumab groups. The 4-week recall period for AE-QoL and schedule of data collection preclude conclusions on the precise timings for HRQoL improvement.

Clinically meaningful improvements in HRQoL with lanadelumab treatment were observed through the use of the well-established MCID of 6 points in AE-QoL total score. Higher proportions of patients in all lanadelumab groups achieved the MCID by the end of the treatment period compared with the placebo group, with the highest proportion, 81%, in the 300 mg q2wks group. Patients in this group were seven times more likely to reach the MCID threshold than placebo-treated patients. Interestingly, there appeared to be a placebo effect during the first two assessments (at weeks 4 and 8) that disappeared over subsequent time points. It should be noted that the mean monthly HAE attack rate (primary endpoint) in the placebo group during the HELP Study treatment period was 1.97, compared with 4 for lanadelumab-treated patients.

### Successful treatment of acute hereditary angioedema attacks with self-administered icatibant in patients with venous access problems [^114Jwjx9]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema is a rare and potentially fatal autosomal dominant disorder characterized by unpredictable skin, gastrointestinal tract, or respiratory tract edema. Plasma-derived C1-esterase inhibitors are effective in the prophylaxis or treatment of hereditary angioedema type I and II attacks, but they must be administered intravenously. This administration method may be problematic for patients with venous access difficulties.

Icatibant, a bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist, is administered subcutaneously. In July 2008, icatibant received approval for healthcare professional-administered treatment of hereditary angioedema attacks in adults. In 2011, it received European Medicines Agency and US Food and Drug Administration licenses for patient-administered treatment of hereditary angioedema attacks. Given these approvals and with appropriate training, icatibant could provide the opportunity for patients to self-administer treatment.

This is one of the first long-term follow-up reports of patients with hereditary angioedema using self-administered icatibant. During follow-up, icatibant remained effective, and patient satisfaction was high.

### C1-inhibitor concentrate home therapy for hereditary angioedema: a viable, effective treatment option [^115inhuL]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Economic and political factors have led to the increased use of home therapy programs for patients who have traditionally been treated in hospitals. Many patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE) experience intermittent severe attacks that affect their quality of life and may be life-threatening. These attacks are treated with C1-inhibitor concentrate which, for most patients, is infused at the local hospital. Home therapy programs for HAE are currently being established. This paper reviews the extent of use of these programs and summarizes the advantages and potential disadvantages of the concept so far.

### Hereditary angioedema: A current state-of-the-art review, IV: Short- and long-term treatment of hereditary angioedema: Out with the old and in with the new [^114TpZFQ]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this review is to provide context for understanding the opportunity for novel therapeutic modalities to transform the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE).

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE and PubMed were searched to identify studies involving the treatment of HAE in the United States.

- **Study selection**: Studies were selected based on their relevance to the treatment of HAE.

- **Results**: The HAE treatment strategy is far from satisfactory, and its limitations create an unmet clinical need. Prophylactic treatment exposes patients with HAE to significant risks of adverse effects, and although the efficacy of prophylactic treatment is generally good, it is far from perfect.

- **Conclusions**: No specific treatment is currently available in the United States for acute HAE attacks that will reliably work, resulting in a significant unmet clinical need. The emergence of several promising drugs for the treatment of HAE attacks is, thus, an extraordinarily important development in managing these patients.

### A comprehensive management approach in pediatric and adolescent patients with hereditary angioedema [^111H3wkv]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

The principles guiding pharmacologic management of hereditary angioedema (HAE) include the following:

- **Availability of effective on-demand acute therapy**: All patients should have access to effective therapy.
- **Early treatment**: Initiating treatment early can prevent attack progression.
- **Treatment irrespective of the site of swelling**: Attacks should be treated regardless of where the swelling occurs.
- **Incorporation of long-term prophylaxis (LTP)**: Decisions regarding LTP should be made based on shared decision-making.

Children with HAE should have access to at least two standard doses of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medicines to treat unpredictable angioedema episodes. While on-demand treatment alone can be sufficient for some patients, others may require first-line prophylactic therapy in combination with on-demand treatment for breakthrough attacks.

Currently, seven products are approved by the FDA for use in pediatric populations: three are indicated for acute HAE attacks (on-demand treatment), and four are indicated for prophylaxis.

- **On-demand treatment**: The goal is to minimize morbidity and prevent mortality from an ongoing swelling episode. While on-demand treatments prevent swelling from progressing, it may take between 30 minutes and 2 hours for swelling to resolve after the medication is administered. It is imperative to convey to parents that early treatment leads to better symptom control. A second dose generally is not needed.

Therapies approved in the United States for treatment of HAE in pediatric patients are those listed in Table 2, which provides details on on-demand and prophylaxis medications approved and recommended by guidelines for HAE treatment.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of garadacimab for preventing hereditary angioedema attacks: Phase 3 open-label extension study [^115y7jDL]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

- **Proportion of patients**: The analysis revealed that patients experienced reductions of ≥ 50%, ≥ 90%, and 100% (attack-free) in the hereditary angioedema (HAE) attack rate during the treatment period compared with the run-in period. This was evaluated among the overall population, rollover patients, and newly enrolled patients.

- **Timeline of HAE attacks**: The study provided a timeline depicting HAE attacks during run-in and treatment periods for each patient, categorized by rollover patients and newly enrolled patients. Each horizontal block illustrated the timeline of an individual patient, arranged in order from those with the highest number of HAE attacks during treatment to those with none.

The mean (95% CI) number of HAE attacks per month requiring on-demand therapy (ODT) in the open-label extension (OLE) was 0.14 (0.09–0.20) for the overall population, 0.11 (0.04–0.18) for rollover patients, and 0.19 (0.09–0.28) for newly enrolled patients. Treatment with garadacimab resulted in a reduction of the mean (95% CI) number of moderate or severe attacks per month, decreasing from 2.59 (2.26–2.92) during the run-in period to 0.11 (0.07–0.15) during treatment for the overall population. Among rollover patients, the mean decreased from 2.63 (2.21–3.04) to 0.08 (0.03–0.13), while for newly enrolled patients, it reduced from 2.55 (2.01–3.09) to 0.15 (0.08–0.23).

### Nanofiltered C1 inhibitor concentrate for treatment of hereditary angioedema [^116iENVF]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency is characterized by acute attacks of swelling that can be painful and sometimes life-threatening.

- **Methods**: We conducted two randomized trials to evaluate nanofiltered C1 inhibitor concentrate in the management of hereditary angioedema. The first study compared nanofiltered C1 inhibitor concentrate with placebo for the treatment of an acute attack of angioedema. A total of 68 subjects (35 in the C1 inhibitor group and 33 in the placebo group) were given one or two intravenous injections of the study drug (1000 units each). The primary endpoint was the time to the onset of unequivocal relief. The second study was a crossover trial involving 22 subjects with hereditary angioedema that compared prophylactic twice-weekly injections of nanofiltered C1 inhibitor concentrate (1000 units) with placebo during two 12-week periods. The primary endpoint was the number of attacks of angioedema per period, with each subject acting as his or her own control.

- **Results**: In the first study, the median time to the onset of unequivocal relief from an attack was 2 hours in the subjects treated with the C1 inhibitor concentrate, but longer than 4 hours in those given placebo (P = 0.02). In the second study, the number of attacks per 12-week period was 6.26 with C1 inhibitor concentrate given as prophylaxis, as compared with 12.73 with placebo (P < 0.001). The subjects who received the C1 inhibitor concentrate also had significant reductions in both the severity and the duration of attacks, as well as in the need for open-label rescue therapy.

### Urticaria unveiled in hereditary angioedema with carboxypeptidase N mutation [^112rnPWt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2025). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare and still poorly understood disease that is often overlooked by many healthcare professionals. The prolonged period between the onset of disease attacks and diagnosis increases the risk of fatalities due to laryngeal angioedema and disease-related morbidity, adversely affecting the quality of life for patients and their families alike. Our group has recently proposed the acronym H4AE to underscore the warning signs of HAE, aiming to enhance awareness and facilitate the timely diagnosis of this neglected condition. The acronym comprises the initial letters of hereditary angioedema, with 4 A's strategically placed between the H and the E. HAAAAE (or H4AE) signifies hereditary, angioedema, abdominal angioedema/pain, absence of urticaria, absence of response to antihistamines, and estrogen association.

- **Figure 1**: H4AE (HAAAAE) - warning signs of HAE.

Traditionally, it has been clinically observed that patients with HAE do not experience urticaria. Although isolated cases of urticaria in patients with HAE have been documented in the literature, these occurrences typically present independently rather than concurrently. Patients generally exhibit a lifetime prevalence of urticaria comparable to that in the general population. Additionally, rash, such as erythema marginatum, is a common prodromal manifestation in patients with HAE and is often misdiagnosed as urticaria. Thus, it has now been established that the coexistence of HAE and urticaria, although rare, is plausible. Importantly, hives are not considered a prodromal…

### Hereditary angioedema: Increased number of attacks after frequent treatments with C1 inhibitor concentrate [^113mWFYo]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of C1 inhibitor concentrate in treating acute attacks of hereditary angioedema caused by C1 inhibitor deficiency. The investigation focused on the disease progression in three women treated frequently with C1 inhibitor concentrate.

- **Methods**: Three women are described who received C1 inhibitor concentrate for the treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema and experienced an increase in the frequency of attacks during that treatment period. The study included a control group of 24 patients aged more than 60 years with hereditary angioedema to determine the natural course of the disease.

- **Results**: The three women, aged 50, 69, and 72 years, had been treated with C1 inhibitor concentrate for 27, 18, and 22 years, respectively, to manage acute abdominal and skin attacks. Before this treatment, all attacks were severe. The treatment was consistently effective; the attacks became mild and their duration was shortened. However, during the treatment period, the number of attacks increased slowly but continuously, starting at the onset of treatment and paralleling its duration. At the end of the observation period, the number of attacks increased by 4-fold, 12-fold, and 5-fold in the three women, respectively. No known factors for increased attack frequency in hereditary angioedema were found in these patients. The control group did not exhibit a similar increase in attacks over a comparable time frame.

- **Conclusion**: A possible explanation for the increase in the frequency of attacks may lie in the large number of injections of C1 inhibitor concentrate.

### Analysis of disease burden in patients with hereditary angioedema from Japan by patient-reported outcomes [^115JUfCh]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Eight patients reported an attack within 24 hours of the survey and were, therefore, asked to complete the AAS (Angioedema Activity Score) questionnaire part of the survey. The mean total AAS score of the respondents was 7.6. The AAS score tended to be higher, suggesting greater angioedema activity, in patients who reported their attack frequency as weekly versus those who reported their attack frequency as monthly or annual.

- **Angioedema Activity Scores (AAS)**: Scores by frequency of hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks classified into annual, monthly, and weekly. Scores of AAS were collected from eight patients who reported an attack in the 24 hours prior to answering the questionnaire.

The HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) results are shown in Figure 5. The mean anxiety and depression subscale scores in all patients were 5.8 and 4.2, respectively, and no apparent relationship was observed between HADS subscale scores and attack frequency. Seventeen of 54 (31.5%) patients had a HADS anxiety subscale score of ≥ 8 and nine of 54 (16.7%) patients had a HADS depression subscale score of ≥ 8, suggesting mild or moderate to severe anxiety or depression, respectively. Nine of 54 (16.7%) patients reported a HADS anxiety subscale score of ≥ 11, suggestive of moderate to severe anxiety, and two of 54 (3.7%) patients reported a HADS depression subscale score of ≥ 11, suggestive of moderate to severe depression.

- **Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)**: HADS anxiety and depression subscale scores by frequency of hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks were classified into annual, monthly, and weekly categories.

### Oral plasma kallikrein inhibitor for prophylaxis in hereditary angioedema [^1114YScT]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Hereditary angioedema is a life-threatening illness caused by mutations in the gene encoding C1 inhibitor (also called C1 esterase inhibitor), leading to overactivation of the kallikrein-bradykinin cascade. BCX7353 is a potent oral small-molecule inhibitor of plasma kallikrein with a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile that may help prevent angioedema attacks.

- **Methods**: In this international, three-part, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated four doses of BCX7353 (62.5 mg, 125 mg, 250 mg, and 350 mg once daily) for the prevention of angioedema attacks over a 28-day period. Patients with type I or II hereditary angioedema with a history of at least two angioedema attacks per month were randomly assigned to BCX7353 or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the number of confirmed angioedema attacks. Key secondary endpoints included angioedema attacks according to anatomical location and quality of life.

- **Results**: A total of 77 patients underwent randomization, 75 received BCX7353 or placebo, and 72 completed the trial. The rate of confirmed angioedema attacks was significantly lower among patients who received BCX7353 at daily doses of 125 mg or more than among those who received placebo, with a 73.8% difference at 125 mg (P < 0.001). Significant benefits with respect to quality-of-life scores were observed in the 125-mg and 250-mg dose groups (P < 0.05). Gastrointestinal adverse events, predominantly of grade 1, were the most commonly reported adverse events, particularly in the two highest BCX7353 dose groups.

- **Conclusions**: Once-daily use of oral BCX7353 was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of angioedema attacks and improved quality-of-life scores.

### Treatment of acute edema attacks in hereditary angioedema with a bradykinin receptor-2 antagonist (icatibant) [^1179GzxG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

In hereditary angioedema, bradykinin is assumed to be the most important mediator of edema formation.

- **Objective**: To assess whether the selective bradykinin receptor-2 antagonist icatibant is effective in acute edema attacks of hereditary angioedema.

- **Methods**: In this uncontrolled pilot study, 15 patients with 20 attacks were treated with icatibant. The attacks were analyzed using a standardized and validated visual analog scale measurement and compared with historical data of untreated attacks. Plasma bradykinin concentration was measured before and 4 hours after intravenous icatibant treatment.

- **Results**: Symptom intensity decreased within 4 hours after administration of icatibant; the median time to onset of symptom relief was 1.50, 1.42, and 1.13 hours in the intravenous groups and 0.58 and 0.45 hours in the subcutaneous groups, respectively. The median difference in the 10-cm visual analog scale 4 hours after the start of treatment was 4.11 cm (95% CI, 1.72–6.07). Compared with untreated attacks, icatibant treatment reduced the mean (SD) time to onset of symptom relief by 97% from 42 ± 14 to 1.16 ± 0.95 hours (all groups combined). Median bradykinin concentration was 7-fold above the norm during acute attacks at 48.5 pmol/L and decreased to 18.0 pmol/L 4 hours after icatibant infusion or injection.

- **Conclusion**: Icatibant was effective in treating acute attacks of hereditary angioedema.

- **Clinical implications**: This is the first report demonstrating the clinical usefulness of antagonizing bradykinin binding to bradykinin receptor-2 in hereditary angioedema.

### Oral berotralstat for the prophylaxis of hereditary angioedema attacks in patients in Japan: A phase 3 randomized trial [^116pXyE2]. Allergy (2021). High credibility.

- **Statistical analysis**: The sample size considered feasible for enrollment in Japan had limited statistical power. Assuming an angioedema attack rate for placebo patients of 3.6 attacks/month and a common standard deviation of 2.0 attacks/month for both berotralstat and placebo, a sample size of 8 patients in each treatment group was anticipated to have 61% power to detect a ≥ 67% reduction in angioedema attack rate (from 3.6 to 1.2 attacks/month) comparing berotralstat with placebo. Analyses included all patients randomized to the study drug (intent-to-treat population).

	- Comparisons between each berotralstat dose group and placebo in the rate of expert-confirmed angioedema attacks during the entire dosing period were made using a negative binomial regression model. The number of expert-confirmed angioedema attacks was included as the dependent variable, treatment was a fixed effect, baseline monthly angioedema attack rate was a covariate, and the logarithm of duration on treatment was an offset variable. Analysis of the rate of expert-confirmed attacks during the effective dosing period was similarly conducted, as was the number of attacks requiring treatment with on-demand medication.

	- The proportion of days with angioedema symptoms was analyzed using an analysis of covariance model, with baseline attack rate as a covariate and treatment included as a fixed effect. Changes from baseline in AE-QoL scores were analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures with fixed effects for treatment, baseline attack rate, baseline AE-QoL, visit, and a visit-by-treatment interaction effect.

### US hereditary angioedema association medical advisory board 2013 recommendations for the management of hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency [^113T3aCu]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

The treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) has undergone dramatic changes as newer medicines have become available in recent years. Optimal care of these patients requires a comprehensive management plan. Although several consensus papers have been published concerning the diagnosis and treatment of HAE, guidelines for a comprehensive management plan have not been developed.

- **Objective**: To develop state-of-the-art recommendations for the treatment and management of HAE due to C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency in the United States.

- **Methods**: Members of the US Hereditary Angioedema Association Medical Advisory Board began by reviewing the literature concerning treatment of HAE. Preliminary recommendations were developed based on the literature review, discussions in a face-to-face meeting, and refinements in a series of drafts. Final recommendations reflect the unanimous consensus of the medical advisory board and the US Hereditary Angioedema Association leadership.

- **Results**: Recommendations are provided regarding a comprehensive care plan for HAE, including the following: development of an overall management plan, treatment of angioedema attacks, prophylactic treatment, and patient monitoring.

- **Conclusion**: A comprehensive individualized management plan developed between an expert HAE physician and the patient, in collaboration with local medical providers and emergency departments, can provide patients with the best opportunity to lead a normal life.

### Kalbitor [^111VixqE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Kalbitor for treating acute attacks of hereditary angioedema in adolescents and adults were evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (EDEMA4 and EDEMA3) involving 168 patients with hereditary angioedema. Patients experiencing an attack at any anatomic location, with at least one moderate or severe symptom, were treated with 30 mg subcutaneous Kalbitor or placebo. Since patients could participate in both trials, a total of 143 unique patients were involved. Of these 143 patients, 94 were female, 123 were Caucasian, and the mean age was 36 years (ranging from 11 to 77). There were 64 patients with abdominal attacks, 55 with peripheral attacks, and 24 with laryngeal attacks.

In both trials, the effects of Kalbitor were evaluated using the Mean Symptom Complex Severity (MSCS) score and the Treatment Outcome Score (TOS). These endpoints assessed attack severity (MSCS) and patient response to treatment (TOS) for an acute hereditary angioedema attack.

The MSCS score is a point-in-time measure of symptom severity. Patients rated the severity of each affected symptom on a categorical scale (0 = normal, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) at baseline, and post-dosing at 4 hours and 24 hours. Patient-reported severity was based on their assessment of symptom impact on their ability to perform routine activities. Ratings were averaged to obtain the MSCS score, which was reported as the change from baseline. A decrease in the MSCS score indicated an improvement in symptom severity.

### Icatibant treatment for acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency: A real-world observational study [^112Az4rf]. Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Icatibant, a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, is an established treatment for acute attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) with C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency. We describe our experience with icatibant in eight patients with angioedema because of acquired C1-INH deficiency (AAE). Forty-eight moderate-to-severe attacks were treated with subcutaneous icatibant 30 mg; two moderate attacks resolved without treatment.

The median (range) duration of treated attacks (onset to complete resolution) was 9.33 (1.67–39.00) hours; durations of the untreated attacks were 72 and 96 hours. Symptom improvement following icatibant treatment occurred in 0.5 (0.25–2.10) hours and complete resolution in 6.75 (0.50–30.75) hours. A single icatibant injection achieved complete symptom resolution in 47 attacks, although one facial attack required a second injection. One peripheral attack responded less quickly than other treated attacks.

Five patients reported transient injection site reactions. Icatibant appeared to provide effective symptom relief and was generally well tolerated.

### Oral berotralstat for the prophylaxis of hereditary angioedema attacks in patients in Japan: A phase 3 randomized trial [^1139jtD5]. Allergy (2021). High credibility.

The baseline requirements for expert-confirmed attack rate had two additional requirements not applied to the entire dosing period on-study attacks: (1) attacks had to be unique, and (2) require treatment, medical attention, or cause functional impairment. To allow for a more direct comparison of angioedema attack rates occurring during the baseline and dosing periods, the two additional requirements for expert-confirmed baseline attacks were applied programmatically to the on-study expert-confirmed attacks occurring during the dosing period, resulting in an adjusted expert-confirmed attack rate. Adjusted expert-confirmed attack rates were used to compare on-study attack rates to baseline attack rates for the exploratory ≥ 50%, ≥ 70%, and ≥ 90% responder endpoints.

Primary and secondary endpoints were tested hierarchically, with the type 1 error rate controlled at the study level using a combination of hierarchical testing and the Hochberg procedure. For the primary endpoint, the two berotralstat doses were tested at the α = .05 level, comparing active treatment to placebo. If the maximum of the two p-values was ≤ .05, the null hypothesis of no difference between the attack rate for patients on active and placebo treatment was rejected for both doses, and testing proceeded to the next endpoint in the hierarchy with α = .05. If the maximum of the two p-values was > .05 but the minimum of the two p-values was < .025, the null hypothesis for the dose with p < .025 was rejected, and testing for only that dose proceeded to the next endpoint in the hierarchy with α = .025.

### Efficacy and safety of garadacimab, a factor XIIa inhibitor for hereditary angioedema prevention (VANGUARD): A global, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^115Weq16]. Lancet (2023). High credibility.

Hereditary angioedema is a rare and potentially life-threatening genetic disease associated with kallikrein-kinin system dysregulation. Garadacimab (CSL312), a novel, fully-human monoclonal antibody that inhibits activated factor XII (FXIIa), is being studied for the prevention of hereditary angioedema attacks. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-monthly subcutaneous administrations of garadacimab as prophylaxis for hereditary angioedema.

- **Methods**: VANGUARD was a pivotal, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial that recruited patients (aged ≥ 12 years) with type I or type II hereditary angioedema across seven countries (Canada, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, and the United States). Eligible patients were randomly assigned (3:2) to receive garadacimab or placebo for 6 months (182 days) by an interactive response technology (IRT) system. Randomisation was stratified by age (≤ 17 years vs > 17 years) and baseline attack rate (1 to < 3 attacks per month vs ≥ 3 attacks per month) for the adult group. The randomisation list and code were kept by the IRT provider during the study, with no access by site staff and funding representatives. All patients and investigational site staff, and representatives from the funder (or their delegates) with direct interaction with the study sites or patients, were masked to treatment assignment in a double-blind fashion. Randomly assigned patients received a 400 mg loading dose of subcutaneous garadacimab as two 200 mg injections or volume-matched placebo.

### Benefits and risks of danazol in hereditary angioedema: A long-term survey of 118 patients [^114EQ34p]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1 inhibitor deficiency is clinically characterized by relapsing skin swellings, abdominal pain attacks, and life-threatening upper airway obstruction. Treatment with androgens prevents attacks for those with this condition.

- **Objective**: To examine the benefits and risks of long-term treatment with danazol.

- **Methods**: Data were generated retrospectively from 118 German and Danish patients who had HAE due to C1 inhibitor deficiency and were treated with danazol from 2 months to 30 years. The frequency and severity of acute attacks were registered before and during danazol treatment, and adverse effects to the treatment were noted. Data were collected using standardized questionnaires.

- **Results**: In all, 111 of 118 patients responded to danazol. During treatment, 54 of the 118 patients (45.8%) became symptom-free or had 1 attack or less per year. In the other patients, hereditary angioedema ran a mild course. The frequency of acute attacks during danazol treatment was reduced to 16.2%, and the attacks were considerably milder than before treatment. Laryngeal edema was reduced to 4.8%. Adverse effects (weight gain, virilization, menstrual irregularities, headache, depression, and/or liver adenomas) occurred in 93 of the 118 patients and led to discontinuation of danazol therapy in 30 patients.

- **Conclusions**: Danazol is highly beneficial in patients with frequent and severe attacks of HAE. Because the risk of adverse effects is high, close monitoring of patients is mandatory. However, many patients accept the adverse effects of the treatment.

### Endothelial cell function in patients with hereditary angioedema: elevated soluble E-selectin level during inter-attack periods [^113JYf4y]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

The bradykinin pathway in the pathomechanism of hereditary angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency (henceforward "hereditary angioedema") has been thoroughly studied; however, much less is known about endothelial cell function. Enhanced endothelial cell permeability is obvious during edematous attacks but not during inter-attack periods. Our knowledge about other endothelial characteristics is even more incomplete.

The aim of this study was to characterize endothelial cell function in hereditary angioedema patients during symptom-free, inter-attack periods. We measured the serum levels of soluble E-selectin, endothelin-1, and von Willebrand factor along with collagen-binding activity in 49 hereditary angioedema patients and in 50 healthy controls.

Endothelin-1 and von Willebrand factor levels, as well as collagen-binding activity, were similar in hereditary angioedema patients and controls; however, we found elevated soluble E-selectin levels in the patients. Interestingly, soluble E-selectin concentration did not correlate with any of the inflammatory markers or smoking, and it is not the consequence of the known E-selectin/C1-inhibitor interaction (an analytical phenomenon). In a multiple logistic regression model, the difference in soluble E-selectin between hereditary angioedema patients and controls remained highly significant when adjusted for age, gender, smoking, C-reactive protein, and AB0 blood groups.

These results demonstrate that in hereditary angioedema, the majority of endothelial function remains to be fully understood.

### Prospective study of rapid relief provided by C1 esterase inhibitor in emergency treatment of acute laryngeal attacks in hereditary angioedema [^115v47xf]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Untreated laryngeal attacks can progress for 8 to 12 hours, after which the symptoms persist for 12 to 24 hours and slowly subside thereafter, with a mean overall duration of 103 hours reported for 342 untreated attacks. In one controlled study, where laryngeal attacks were treated with a placebo (four attacks in four patients), the mean time between treatment and onset of relief was 8.5 hours.

The symptoms of laryngeal attacks treated with C1-INH concentrate in our study began to subside rapidly between 6 and 78 minutes after treatment and were relatively short in duration, with complete resolution following a mean of 13.9 hours post-treatment (median of 8.3 hours). Despite our study being uncontrolled, comparison with historical data for untreated or placebo-treated attacks indicates the efficacy of C1-INH at the recommended dose of 20 U/kg in treating laryngeal edema attacks.

There was no evidence for rebound edema after treatment of laryngeal attacks with C1-INH concentrate, as no new attacks occurred before the complete resolution of the previous attack. Compared to acute HAE attacks at other body locations, laryngeal attacks show the most rapid response to infusion of C1-INH concentrate. This was supported by our results for abdominal, facial, and peripheral attacks treated with the same weight-based dose of C1-INH concentrate in the I.M.P. A.C.T.2 study. The median time to onset of symptom relief was 20 minutes for abdominal attacks, 28 minutes for facial attacks, and 31 minutes for peripheral attacks.

### Outcome measures in randomized controlled studies of acute therapy for hereditary angioedema: A systematic review [^117NWsmx]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

The applied methods for this systematic review are described in the Supplementary. Eleven papers describing 13 eligible trials were identified. Table S1 shows the definitions of all outcome measurement instruments used in the included trials. The 13 unique primary outcomes were collapsed into nine standardized outcome terms, representing outcomes with the same meaning but with differing wording (Table 1). Table 2 displays the standardized outcome terms used as secondary outcomes in the included trials. The majority (81%) of these standardized outcomes were not used as secondary outcomes in more than one trial. The exploratory outcomes are summarized in Table S2. Two outcome measures which were planned in the trial protocol were not mentioned in the full paper or supplementary material (Table S3).

- **Standardized primary outcomes**: We identified 72 standardized efficacy outcome terms reported in studies evaluating on-demand treatment of acute attacks in HAE patients, of which nine were used as a primary outcome measure. No outcome measure was reported consistently in all 13 trials.

- **Instruments used**: Eleven instruments were utilized by 74% of the standardized outcomes, which can be broadly divided into instruments evaluating location‐specific symptoms and instruments giving a general classification of overall attack severity. Outcomes measuring treatment response were predominantly either time‐based (e.g. time to symptom relief) or symptom‐based (e.g. change in severity at a predefined time).

### The Icatibant outcome survey: 10 years of experience with icatibant for patients with hereditary angioedema [^112D3rp3]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). High credibility.

In patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE), bradykinin causes swelling episodes by activating bradykinin B2 receptors. Icatibant, a selective bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, is approved for the on-demand treatment of HAE attacks. The Icatibant Outcome Survey (IOS; NCT01034969) is an ongoing observational registry initiated in 2009 to monitor the effectiveness and safety of icatibant in routine clinical practice. As of March 2019, 549 patients with HAE type 1 or 2 from the IOS registry had been treated for 5995 total attacks.

This article reviews data published from IOS over time, which have demonstrated that the effectiveness of icatibant in a real-world setting is comparable to its efficacy in clinical trials. One dose is effective for the majority of attacks, and early treatment (facilitated by self-administration) leads to faster resolution and shorter attack duration. The effectiveness and safety of icatibant have been shown across a broad range of patient subgroups, including children, adolescents, and patients with HAE with normal C1 inhibitor levels; tolerability has been demonstrated in patients aged ≥ 65 years.

Additionally, this review highlights how IOS data have provided valuable insights into patients' diagnostic journeys and treatment behaviors across individual countries. Such findings have helped to inform clinical strategies and guidelines to optimize HAE management and limit disease burden.

### A comprehensive management approach in pediatric and adolescent patients with hereditary angioedema [^116ySmwM]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Early identification of hereditary angioedema (HAE) is critical to reducing mortality and morbidity and to developing an appropriate management plan. The first HAE episode may be a laryngeal attack, which can be fatal. An analysis of 70 patients with HAE who asphyxiated during a laryngeal attack showed that mortality was higher in patients with undiagnosed HAE (63 cases) than in patients with diagnosed HAE (7 cases). Upper airway swelling is also more severe in pediatric patients due to the smaller diameter of the airway, which increases the risk of asphyxiation.

- **Barriers to early diagnosis**: Poor recognition of HAE symptoms by health care professionals, a lack of appropriate family screening tools, and a lack of access to simple laboratory tests that help establish a diagnosis are significant barriers. Symptoms typically present in childhood, and delays in diagnosis can subject patients to inappropriate treatment and unnecessary medical interventions.

- **Family screening**: Despite the familial association of HAE, many family members of patients with HAE are not screened for the disorder. A survey of patients with HAE found that only 48% of immediate family members and 26% of extended family members had been tested for the condition. With the availability of effective therapies, screening of family members has increasingly been emphasized as a way to reduce the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with HAE. Each child of a parent with HAE has a 50% chance of inheriting the disorder; therefore, all infants with a family history of HAE should be considered to have the disorder until the diagnosis is ruled out.

### Factors associated with hospital admission in hereditary angioedema attacks: a multicenter prospective study [^111GURd4]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Acute attacks of hereditary angioedema are characterized by relocalized edema. These attacks can be life-threatening and are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality.

- **Objective**: To determine factors associated with hospital admission of patients with an acute attack of hereditary angioedema presenting at the emergency department.

- **Methods**: This was a multicenter prospective observational study of consecutive patients (January 2011 through December 2013) experiencing an acute hereditary angioedema attack and presenting at the emergency department at one of four French reference centers for bradykinin-mediated angioedema. Attacks requiring hospital admission were compared with those not requiring admission.

- **Results**: Of 57 attacks in 29 patients, 17 (30%) led to hospital admission. In multivariate analysis, laryngeal and facial involvements were strongly associated with hospital admission (odds ratio 18.6, 95% confidence interval 3.9–88; odds ratio 7.7, 95% confidence interval 1.4–43.4, respectively). Self-injection of icatibant at home was associated with non-admission (odds ratio 0.06, 95% confidence interval 0.01–0.61). The course was favorable in all 57 cases. No upper airway management was required.

- **Conclusion**: Most patients attended the emergency department because they were running out of medication and did not know that emergency treatment could be self-administered. Risk factors associated with hospital admission were laryngeal and facial involvement, whereas self-injection of icatibant was associated with a return home.

### Clinical impact of peripheral attacks in hereditary angioedema patients [^115nqsBZ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Episodes of acute subcutaneous angioedema affecting the extremities in patients with known hereditary angioedema are called peripheral attacks. These attacks are considered to be of limited clinical importance.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the impact of peripheral attacks in patients with hereditary angioedema and to assess the response to treatment with recombinant human C1-inhibitor (rhC1INH).

- **Methods**: Hereditary angioedema patients with a peripheral attack included in a clinical database of rhC1INH were analyzed. Visual analog scale (VAS) scoring was used to evaluate symptom severity and response to therapy.

- **Results**: Sixty-five patients with a peripheral attack were identified. VAS scores for 64 patients were available. Twenty-nine (45%) patients reported a single peripheral location of the attack, while others experienced multiple locations. Eight patients (13%) indicated moderate (VAS 20–50 mm) and 55 (86%) severe (VAS ≥ 50 mm) swelling. Seventeen (27%) had moderate and 35 (55%) severe pain, while 8 (13%) patients reported moderate and 51 (80%) severe dysfunction for the peripheral attack. Symptom VAS scores decreased over time more rapidly in patients treated with rhC1INH than in patients treated with placebo. Onset of relief was achieved in 95% of the rhC1INH-treated patients within 4 hours, whereas only 21% of saline-treated patients had relief in the same time period.

- **Conclusion**: Peripheral attacks in hereditary angioedema patients often occur at multiple anatomical locations and frequently have associated pain and dysfunction, in addition to swelling, as dominant symptoms.

### Prospective study of rapid relief provided by C1 esterase inhibitor in emergency treatment of acute laryngeal attacks in hereditary angioedema [^112pCJux]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disorder characterized by C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency, resulting in periodic attacks of acute edema that can be life-threatening if they occur in the laryngeal region. We assessed the efficacy of C1-INH concentrate in the emergency treatment of rarely occurring acute laryngeal HAE attacks in a prospective, open-label clinical study.

- **Methods**: Acute laryngeal attacks were each treated with C1-INH concentrate (Berinert) at a single dose of 20 U/kg body weight. Efficacy endpoints included time to onset of symptom relief and time to complete resolution of all symptoms, each based on the patient's assessment.

- **Results**: All 39 laryngeal attacks in 16 patients were treated successfully. The median time to onset of symptom relief was 15 min. The median time to complete resolution of all symptoms was 8.25 h. No treatment-related serious adverse events occurred, and the treatment was well tolerated. The administration of C1-INH concentrate was not associated with any viral infections.

- **Conclusion**: C1-INH concentrate is an effective and safe emergency treatment for providing reliable and rapid relief from the potentially life-threatening symptoms of laryngeal HAE attacks.

### Hereditary angioedema: Diagnosis and management-a perspective for the dermatologist [^1149KeUP]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a relatively rare but potentially life-threatening genetic disorder characterized by marked, diffuse mucosal edema that, in extreme cases, can affect the airway leading to asphyxiation. The clinical picture is similar to that of other forms of angioedema; therefore, misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is common. HAE is caused by a deficiency in, or a dysfunction of, C1 esterase inhibitor, which has a wide variety of physiologic functions, of which regulation of the contact (kallikrein-kinin) system is most relevant to this condition.

Effective management of HAE must consider routine or long-term prophylaxis, short-term prophylaxis (in advance of predicted trauma, such as surgical or dental procedures), and treatment of acute attacks. Historically, treatment options have been limited to controlling symptoms, but progress in understanding the pathophysiology of HAE has facilitated the development of treatments, such as C1 inhibitor therapy or drugs targeted at the bradykinin pathway, which address the underlying pathologic process.

### Kalbitor [^113QvGRj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) located on Chromosome 11q, inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. It is characterized by low levels of C1-INH activity and low levels of C4. C1-INH functions to regulate the activation of the complement and intrinsic coagulation (contact system pathway) and is a major endogenous inhibitor of plasma kallikrein. The kallikrein-kinin system is a complex proteolytic cascade involved in the initiation of both inflammatory and coagulation pathways. A critical aspect of this pathway is the conversion of high molecular weight (HMW) kininogen to bradykinin by the protease plasma kallikrein. In HAE, normal regulation of plasma kallikrein activity and the classical complement cascade is absent. During attacks, unregulated plasma kallikrein activity results in excessive bradykinin generation, a vasodilator thought to be responsible for the characteristic HAE symptoms of localized swelling, inflammation, and pain.

Kalbitor is a potent (Ki = 25 pM), selective, reversible inhibitor of plasma kallikrein. It binds to plasma kallikrein and blocks its binding site, inhibiting the conversion of HMW kininogen to bradykinin. By directly inhibiting plasma kallikrein, Kalbitor reduces the conversion of HMW kininogen to bradykinin, thereby treating symptoms of the disease during acute episodic attacks of HAE.

### Deucrictibant for angioedema due to acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency: A randomized-controlled trial [^112kggi8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Angioedema due to acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency is a very rare but serious disease, with an estimated prevalence of 1 per 500,000 persons. There are no approved therapies to treat or prevent angioedema swelling in patients with this condition. Deucrictibant is a specific, orally bioavailable, competitive antagonist of the bradykinin B2 receptor currently under investigation for hereditary angioedema.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of deucrictibant as acute and prophylactic treatment for angioedema due to acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency.

- **Methods**: A 2-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was conducted. In Part 1, four consecutive angioedema attacks were treated with three doses of deucrictibant (10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg) or placebo. In Part 2, deucrictibant, 20 mg, or placebo was administered twice daily for two treatment periods of eight weeks.

- **Results**: Three patients were enrolled; of those three patients, one completed both study parts and two completed only Part 2. In Part 1, a reduction in attack severity was observed in the three attacks treated with deucrictibant as opposed to an increase in severity of the attack treated with placebo. In Part 2, the individual mean monthly attack rates were 2.0, 0.6, and 1.0 during the placebo period and 0.0 across all patients during treatment with deucrictibant. There were no severe adverse events and one self-limiting treatment-emergent adverse event (abdominal pain).

- **Conclusions**: Deucrictibant has the potential to effectively and safely treat and prevent angioedema attacks due to acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency.

Regarding the medical management of hereditary angioedema — and more specifically in relation to prophylactic treatment — the AAAAI/EAACI 2013 guidelines recommend considering the administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), the serine protease inhibitor C1 inhibitor replacement, or short-term, high-dose anabolic androgen therapy as short-term prophylaxis in patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE).

### C1-inhibitor concentrate home therapy for hereditary angioedema: a viable, effective treatment option [^117R9wmv]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

- **Treatment of hereditary angioedema**: Frequent or severe HAE attacks are disabling for the patient. Consequently, such attacks are an indication for regular prophylaxis, usually with attenuated androgens such as danazol that increase hepatic production of C1-INH. However, attenuated androgens may cause unacceptable side effects such as virilization or hepatic abnormalities, or may be contraindicated otherwise, for example, in women who wish to become pregnant. Fibrinolytic agents such as tranexamic acid or epsilon aminocaproic acid are alternative prophylactic agents, although the evidence base for their use is less certain. Despite prophylaxis, many patients continue to experience intermittent severe attacks that interrupt their activities of daily living and may be life-threatening.

These attacks are treated with C1-INH concentrate, which in most cases results in a response within 30–90 minutes. Licensed C1-INH products are available in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, Hungary, Argentina, Japan (Berinert P®, ZLB Behring, Marburg, Germany), and the Netherlands (Cetor®, CLB, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). In other European countries, including the United Kingdom, and in the United States, C1-INH is used on a named-patient basis, or is completely unavailable.

### Prodromes predict attacks of hereditary angioedema: Results of a prospective study [^115MLiC2]. Allergy (2023). High credibility.

The study examines the predictive value of prodromes, or early symptoms, for attacks of hereditary angioedema. It provides detailed insights into how recognizing these early signs could improve patient outcomes and management strategies. By monitoring prodromes, healthcare providers may be able to anticipate and possibly mitigate the severity of subsequent angioedema attacks. This prospective study underlines the importance of early detection and timely intervention in hereditary angioedema management.

### Hereditary angioedema [^117Gno1R]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder that usually results from a decreased level of functional C1-INH and clinically manifests with intermittent attacks of swelling of the subcutaneous tissue or submucosal layers of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts. Laboratory studies and radiographic imaging have limited roles in the evaluation of patients with acute attacks of HAE except when the diagnosis is uncertain and other processes must be ruled out. Treatment begins with assessment of the airway to determine the need for immediate intervention. Emergency physicians should understand the pathophysiology of HAE to help guide management decisions.

### A comprehensive management approach in pediatric and adolescent patients with hereditary angioedema [^113mobCS]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder; most cases are characterized by low plasma levels of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH). Clinical manifestations of HAE due to C1-INH deficiency include unpredictable, acute episodes of nonpruritic swelling that can affect the face, trunk, limbs, and the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts. Attacks can be disfiguring, disabling, painful, and even life-threatening if laryngeal swelling occurs. Symptoms of HAE generally manifest in childhood. Effective medications are available and approved to treat HAE in children; however, evidence informing use of these medications in pediatric clinical practice is limited.

Hereditary angioedema management plans are critical to optimize outcomes and should address on-demand treatment for acute attacks and plans to prevent potentially fatal laryngeal attacks. The plan should also comprise a holistic approach to address nonclinical aspects of HAE, including quality of life (QoL) and psychological issues. This article provides an overview of HAE management principles that health care providers can apply to treat pediatric patients to improve their QoL.

### Lanadelumab demonstrates rapid and sustained prevention of hereditary angioedema attacks [^1124FoUV]. Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

The maximum attack severity was lower in patients receiving lanadelumab than in those receiving placebo during days 0–69. As shown in Figure 3, 37.9%-48.1% of patients in the lanadelumab-treated groups were attack-free through day 69 of treatment, compared with 7.3% of placebo-treated patients. Additionally, a higher proportion of patients treated with lanadelumab during days 0–69 were responders, achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in the number of attacks relative to the run-in period compared with patients receiving placebo.

- **Figure 1**: Investigator-confirmed hereditary angioedema attack rate during days 0–69 of treatment.

- **A**: Monthly rate of all attacks (primary endpoint).

- **B**: Monthly rate of attacks requiring acute treatment.

- **C**: Monthly rate of moderate/severe attacks.

- **Figure 2**: Rate of hereditary angioedema attacks during days 0–69 of treatment and during the steady-state period. Attack rates were based on attacks occurring within two weeks prior to each time point. A month is defined as 28 days. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean.

- **Figure 3**: Attacks by maximum severity, days 0–69 of treatment. Due to rounding, some bars may not total 100%.

- **Figure 4**: Proportion of patients achieving ≥ 50% to ≥ 90% reduction in attack rate during days 0–69 relative to the run-in period. Responders were defined as patients who achieved a ≥ 50% reduction in the number of attacks relative to the run-in period. For each patient, the percentage reduction was calculated as the run-in period attack rate minus the treatment period attack rate divided by the run-in period attack rate, multiplied by 100.

### Prospective study of rapid relief provided by C1 esterase inhibitor in emergency treatment of acute laryngeal attacks in hereditary angioedema [^115toqpb]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disease characterized by unpredictable episodes of edema at various body locations due to an inherited functional deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH). C1-INH is an important control protein of the complement and kallikrein–kinin cascade systems. During HAE attacks, these plasma proteolytic cascades are activated. The attacks are due either to the complete lack of C1-INH (type I HAE) or the expression of dysfunctional C1-INH (type II HAE), resulting in enhanced vascular permeability and leading to local subcutaneous or submucosal swellings.

The most common symptoms of HAE are acute episodes of skin swellings or abdominal pain, which can be inconvenient and painful but are not life-threatening. In contrast, rare (approximately 1% of HAE attacks) but potentially life-threatening episodes of laryngeal edema are associated with a risk of asphyxiation, the most important symptom of concern for patients with HAE. Clinical manifestations of laryngeal attacks include hoarseness, stridor, dyspnea, a feeling of having a lump in the larynx, dysphagia, and voice change.

The first-line therapy for acute HAE attacks is replacement therapy with C1-INH concentrate, as recommended in the 2007 International Consensus Algorithm for the Management of HAE. Before the availability of effective treatments, up to 25% to 30% of patients with HAE died from laryngeal edema. An even higher mortality of approximately 50% has been reported for patients with undiagnosed HAE. Since the introduction of C1-INH concentrate, these severe outcomes have significantly decreased.

### Prospective study of C1 esterase inhibitor in the treatment of successive acute abdominal and facial hereditary angioedema attacks [^115kUzfU]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disorder characterized by a quantitative or functional deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), resulting in periodic attacks of acute edema at various body locations. The symptoms of these painful attacks can be treated effectively with C1-INH concentrate.

- **Objective**: To document the efficacy and safety of a weight-based dose of C1-INH concentrate in the treatment of successive HAE attacks at abdominal and facial locations.

- **Methods**: Acute facial and abdominal attacks were each treated with C1-INH concentrate using a single intravenous dose of 20 U/kg body weight. Efficacy endpoints included patient-reported time to onset of symptom relief and time to complete resolution of all symptoms. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events and assaying for markers of viral infection.

- **Results**: We treated 663 abdominal attacks in 50 patients and 43 facial attacks in 16 patients (a total of 706 attacks in 53 patients). The median time to onset of relief for all attacks was 19.8 minutes, with a median time to complete resolution of 11.0 hours. The median time to onset of relief was 19.8 minutes for abdominal attacks and 28.2 minutes for facial attacks, indicating efficacy for both types of attack. No treatment-related serious adverse events occurred, and C1-INH concentrate was well tolerated. No human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis virus, or parvovirus B19 infections arose during the study.

- **Conclusion**: The C1-INH concentrate dose of 20 U/kg provides rapid, effective, and safe treatment for successive HAE attacks at abdominal and facial locations.

### Successful C1 inhibitor short-term prophylaxis during redo mitral valve replacement in a patient with hereditary angioedema [^114U5E7h]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema is characterized by sudden episodes of nonpitting edema that cause discomfort and pain. Typically, the extremities, genitalia, trunk, gastrointestinal tract, face, and larynx are affected by attacks of swelling. Laryngeal swelling carries significant risk for asphyxiation. The disease results from mutations in the C1 esterase inhibitor gene that cause C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency.

Attacks of hereditary angioedema result from contact, complement, and fibrinolytic plasma cascade activation, where C1 esterase inhibitor irreversibly binds substrates. Patients with hereditary angioedema cannot replenish C1 esterase inhibitor levels on pace with its binding. When C1 esterase inhibitor is depleted in these patients, vasoactive plasma cascade products cause swelling attacks. Trauma is a known trigger for hereditary angioedema attacks, and patients have been denied surgical procedures because of this risk. However, uncomplicated surgeries have been reported. Appropriate prophylaxis can reduce peri-operative morbidity in these patients, despite proteolytic cascade and complement activation during surgical trauma.

We report a case of successful short-term prophylaxis with C1 esterase inhibitor in a 51-year-old man with hereditary angioedema who underwent redo mitral valve reconstructive surgery.

Regarding medical management for hereditary angioedema, more specifically with respect to prophylactic treatment, the AAAAI/EAACI 2013 guidelines recommend administering any of the following options for long-term prophylaxis in patients with HAE:

- **Low-to-moderate doses of anabolic androgens**: An effective and relatively safe option for many patients.

- **Antifibrinolytic agents**: Somewhat effective and relatively safe option, recognizing that it is generally less effective than androgens.

- **Plasma-derived C1 inhibitor replacement**: An effective and safe option.

### Hereditary angioedema: Children should be considered for training in self-administration [^111MHWZ3]. Pediatric Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema is an inherited disease that causes periodic swelling attacks, which can be life-threatening and have a major effect on a patient's life. Studies have shown that home therapy for angioedema reduces disease severity, leads to faster relief of symptoms, and improves quality of life. Most studies have been conducted in adults. We report a 13-year-old boy who quickly learned self-administration, resulting in reduced frequency and severity of attacks. The aim of this report is to emphasize that children should be considered for self-administration training and that the process does not have to be long or complicated.

### Analysis of hereditary angioedema attacks requiring a second dose of ecallantide [^113g4CZN]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Effective treatment of acute attacks is critical in managing hereditary angioedema (HAE). Ecallantide, a plasma kallikrein inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of HAE attacks. Occasionally, a second dose is needed when treating attacks of HAE.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the characteristics of HAE attacks requiring a second dose (dose B) of ecallantide.

- **Methods**: Data from all ecallantide clinical trials (EDEMA2, EDEMA4, and DX-88/19) that allowed an open-label dose B were included in this analysis. Patient and attack characteristics potentially predictive of dose B after ecallantide were analyzed by logistic regression. A multivariate model was built using a backward selection process, incorporating variables from the univariate model with P < .20 and removing factors with the highest P value until only significant (P < .05) factors remained.

- **Results**: The analysis included 732 ecallantide-treated HAE attacks in 179 patients. Dose B was required in 88 attacks (12.0%), most (80.5%) for incomplete response. By attack location, 31 of 325 abdominal attacks (9.5%), 17 of 158 laryngeal attacks (10.8%), and 40 of 242 peripheral attacks (16.5%) required dose B. On the basis of the univariate analysis, baseline severity (odds ratio = 1.33, P = 0.15) and peripheral attack (odds ratio = 1.80, P = 0.01) were identified as potential predictive factors; abdominal attacks had an inverse correlation (odds ratio = 0.64, P = 0.055). However, the multivariate analysis identified only peripheral attacks as statistically significantly correlated (P < .05) with dose B requirement.

### Hereditary angioedema: Current and emerging treatment options [^116EfGJo]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2010). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) can result from allergic, hereditary, and acquired conditions. HAE attacks are disabling at the time of occurrence and can be life-threatening; they often lead to hospitalization and intensive care unit admission. Although there are several variants of HAE, they share a final common pathway: unopposed activation of multiple kinins and mediators, including kallikrein and bradykinin. This results in increased vascular permeability, which in turn produces the edema for which the condition is named.

Older treatment options licensed in the United States, such as anabolic steroids and antifibrinolytics, have troublesome side effect profiles and may not reverse a severe acute attack. In Europe, C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) concentrates have been used since 1974 for both preventing and terminating attacks. Two of these have now been licensed in the United States for use in HAE patients, one for prophylaxis and the other for treating acute abdominal and facial HAE attacks. The first kinin pathway modulator, ecallantide, has also been licensed recently in the United States for treating HAE attacks.

The objective of this article is to describe HAE and review the available options for managing patients, as well as different drugs currently under investigation. Specific attention is given to the perioperative management of patients with HAE.
