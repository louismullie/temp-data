## Question

can we take telmisartan 1 hour before dialysis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether telmisartan can be taken 1 hour before hemodialysis and what the clinical implications are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about telmisartan's pharmacokinetics and whether dialysis removes it. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling says about dosing in dialysis patients. Next, I will consider the hemodynamic risks around dialysis sessions and how timing affects hypotension. After that, I should review any direct clinical data in hemodialysis patients. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-focused recommendation and monitoring plan, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetics and dialyzability, because that will anchor the timing question. Telmisartan reaches peak plasma concentration about 0.5 to 1 hour after oral dosing, has a long terminal half-life around 24 hours, and is highly protein bound, which limits removal by dialysis; importantly, the FDA explicitly states telmisartan is not removed by hemodialysis, so dialysis does not clear the drug from circulation [^115UhhVY] [^113vNeXj] [^116obP6V].

> Wait, let me verify the dosing guidance in renal impairment and dialysis before jumping to timing. The FDA labeling indicates no initial dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment, including those on hemodialysis, and it can be administered with or without food, which means pharmacokinetically there is no mandate to avoid pre-dialysis dosing from a drug-removal standpoint [^111rqBkt] [^111hXcqc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety just because the drug isn't dialyzable. I need to check hemodynamic risks. Patients on dialysis can develop orthostatic hypotension, and the label advises close blood pressure monitoring; taking telmisartan 1 hour pre-dialysis means the peak effect coincides with ultrafiltration-related volume shifts, which can potentiate hypotension during or after dialysis, so the risk is clinically meaningful even if the drug itself is not removed by dialysis [^111rqBkt] [^111hXcqc].

> Next, I should review direct clinical data in hemodialysis patients to see if there are signals about tolerability and timing. A small study in hypertensive hemodialysis patients using telmisartan 40 mg once daily showed significant blood pressure reductions and good tolerability without major adverse effects, but it did not specifically test pre-dialysis timing; nonetheless, it supports that telmisartan is effective and generally safe in this population with appropriate monitoring [^114yYdPD].

> I will now examine whether there is any evidence that pre-dialysis dosing worsens outcomes. I don't see trials that mandate a specific pre- versus post-dialysis schedule, but given the peak effect at 0.5–1 hour and the risk of intradialytic hypotension, many clinicians prefer to dose after dialysis or at a time separated from the session; if pre-dialysis dosing is chosen, it should be accompanied by vigilant blood pressure monitoring and awareness of ultrafiltration plans that day [^115UhhVY] [^111rqBkt].

> Let me synthesize a practical answer. Yes, telmisartan can be taken 1 hour before dialysis because it is not removed by hemodialysis and no dose adjustment is required; however, I should emphasize that this timing places the drug's peak effect during a period of volume removal and hemodynamic instability, increasing the risk of symptomatic hypotension. If used pre-dialysis, monitor blood pressure closely before, during, and after dialysis, and consider dosing post-dialysis or at a different time if hypotension occurs or if the patient is prone to intradialytic crashes [^113vNeXj] [^111rqBkt] [^111hXcqc].

> But wait, what if the patient is on combination therapy or has other risk factors for hypotension. I should double-check for concomitant antihypertensives, especially calcium channel blockers or other vasodilators, and ensure we are not layering peak effects; additionally, I need to ensure we are not combining with another RAAS blocker, as dual blockade increases risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and renal dysfunction without added benefit, which would further complicate pre-dialysis hemodynamics [^115WgRC1] [^117BNFUB].

> Final recommendation: Telmisartan may be administered 1 hour before dialysis, but I would generally prefer dosing after dialysis or at a time separated from the session to mitigate hypotension risk. If pre-dialysis dosing is necessary, monitor blood pressure closely and adjust the dialysis prescription or antihypertensive regimen as needed, and remember that telmisartan is not dialyzable, so missed doses cannot be corrected by dialysis [^113vNeXj] [^111rqBkt] [^111hXcqc].

Telmisartan can be taken **1 hour before dialysis** because it is not removed by hemodialysis [^113vNeXj] and no dose adjustment is needed in renal impairment [^111rqBkt]. However, monitor for **hypotension** during dialysis, as patients on dialysis are prone to orthostatic hypotension [^111rqBkt]. If hypotension occurs, consider dosing after dialysis or adjusting the dialysis prescription. No special timing is required for peritoneal dialysis or CRRT [^111tSPoQ] [^113vNeXj].

---

## Pharmacokinetics of telmisartan

- **Absorption**: Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) is reached 0.5–1 hour after oral dosing [^115UhhVY].
- **Elimination**: Terminal half-life is ~24 hours, supporting once-daily dosing [^115UhhVY].
- **Dialyzability**: Telmisartan is not removed by hemodialysis or hemofiltration [^113vNeXj] [^116obP6V].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **FDA labeling**: No dose adjustment is required for renal impairment, including hemodialysis [^111rqBkt] [^111hXcqc].
- **Dialysis patients**: Telmisartan is acceptable in hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and CRRT, with no dose adjustment needed [^115dmFHn] [^111tSPoQ] [^115FuREy].
- **Monitoring**: Close blood pressure monitoring is recommended due to risk of orthostatic hypotension in dialysis patients [^111rqBkt] [^111hXcqc].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

- **Hypotension risk**: Dialysis patients are at increased risk of orthostatic hypotension; monitor blood pressure closely [^111rqBkt] [^111hXcqc].
- **Hyperkalemia**: Monitor potassium, especially in patients with advanced renal impairment or on potassium-sparing drugs [^111bu1WD].
- **Timing**: If hypotension occurs, consider dosing after dialysis or adjusting the dialysis prescription.

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Hemodialysis | Telmisartan can be taken 1 hour before dialysis; monitor for hypotension [^111rqBkt] [^111hXcqc] |
| Peritoneal dialysis | No special timing required; standard dosing applies [^111tSPoQ] |
| CRRT | No special timing required; standard dosing applies [^115FuREy] |

---

Telmisartan can be taken **1 hour before dialysis** without loss of effect, but monitor for hypotension and adjust timing if needed.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Telmisartan

Limited data are available with regard to overdosage of telmisartan in humans. The most likely manifestations of overdosage with telmisartan are hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Telmisartan is not removed by hemofiltration and is not dialyzable.

Hydrochlorothiazide

The most common signs and symptoms observed in patients with a hydrochlorothiazide overdose are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established. The oral LD50of hydrochlorothiazide is greater than 10 g/kg in both mice and rats.

Metabolism and Elimination

Following either intravenous or oral administration of14C-labeled telmisartan, most of the administered dose (> 97%) was eliminated unchanged in feces via biliary excretion; only minute amounts were found in the urine (0.91% and 0.49% of total radioactivity, respectively).

Telmisartan is metabolized by conjugation to form a pharmacologically inactive acyl glucuronide; the glucuronide of the parent compound is the only metabolite that has been identified in human plasma and urine. After a single dose, the glucuronide represents approximately 11% of the measured radioactivity in plasma. The cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are not involved in the metabolism of telmisartan.

Total plasma clearance of telmisartan is > 800 mL/min. Terminal half-life and total clearance appear to be independent of dose.

Specific Populations

 Renal Insufficiency

No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with decreased renal function. Telmisartan is not removed from blood by hemofiltration and is not dialyzable [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

 Hepatic Insufficiency

In patients with hepatic insufficiency, plasma concentrations of telmisartan are increased, and absolute bioavailability approaches 100% [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Hydrochlorothiazide

Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidney. When plasma levels have been followed for at least 24 hours, the plasma half-life has been observed to vary between 5.6 and 14.8 hours. At least 61% of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain barrier and is excreted in breast milk.

Specific Populations

Telmisartan

Renal Insufficiency: Telmisartan is not removed from blood by hemofiltration and is not dialyzable [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Hepatic Insufficiency: In patients with hepatic insufficiency, plasma concentrations of telmisartan are increased, and absolute bioavailability approaches 100% [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Gender: Plasma concentrations of telmisartan are generally 2 to 3 times higher in females than in males. In clinical trials, however, no significant increases in blood pressure response or in the incidence of orthostatic hypotension were found in women. No dosage adjustment is necessary.

Geriatric Patients: The pharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ between the elderly and those younger than 65 years of age.

Data

 Animal Data

No teratogenic effects were observed when telmisartan was administered to pregnant rats at oral doses of up to 50 mg/kg/day and to pregnant rabbits at oral doses up to 45 mg/kg/day. In rabbits, embryolethality associated with maternal toxicity (reduced body weight gain and food consumption) was observed at 45 mg/kg/day [about 12 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 80 mg on a mg/m2basis]. In rats, maternally toxic (reduction in body weight gain and food consumption) telmisartan doses of 15 mg/kg/day (about 1.9 times the MRHD on a mg/m2basis), administered during late gestation and lactation, were observed to produce adverse effects in neonates, including reduced viability, low birth weight, delayed maturation, and decreased weight gain. The no-observed-effect doses for developmental toxicity in rats and rabbits, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively, are about 0.64 and 3.7 times, on a mg/m2basis, the maximum recommended human dose of telmisartan (80 mg/day).

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There is no information regarding the presence of telmisartan in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Telmisartan is present in the milk of lactating rats (see Data). Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infant including hypotension, hyperkalemia and renal impairment, advise a nursing woman not to breastfeed during treatment with MICARDIS.

Data

Telmisartan was present in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations 1.5 to 2 times those found in plasma from 4 to 8 hours after administration.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to MICARDIS

If oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function.

### Effects of telmisartan added to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on mortality and morbidity in hemodialysis patients with chronic heart failure a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^11396w2p]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

the aim of this study was to determine whether telmisartan decreases all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in hemodialysis patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) when added to standard therapies with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

Background

in hemodialysis patients, CHF is responsible for a high mortality rate, but presently very few data are available with regard to this population.

Methods

A 3-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial was performed involving 30 Italian clinics. Hemodialysis patients with CHF (New York Heart Association functional class II to III; LVEF ≤ 40%) were randomized to telmisartan or placebo in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. A total of 332 patients were enrolled (165 telmisartan, 167 placebo). Drug dosage was titrated to a target dose of telmisartan of 80 mg or placebo. Mean follow-up period was 35.5 ± 8.5 months (median: 36 months; range: 2 to 40 months). Primary outcomes were: 1) all-cause mortality; 2) cardiovascular mortality; and 3) CHF hospital stay.

Results

at 3 years, telmisartan significantly reduced all-cause mortality (35.1% vs. 54.4%; p < 0.001), cardiovascular death (30.3% vs. 43.7%; p < 0.001), and hospital admission for CHF (33.9% vs. 55.1%; p < 0.0001). With Cox proportional hazards analysis, telmisartan was an independent determinant of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.32 to 0.82; p < 0.01), cardiovascular mortality (HR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.61; p < 0.0001), and hospital stay for deterioration of heart failure (HR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.51; p < 0.0001). Adverse effects, mainly hypotension, occurred in 16.3% of the telmisartan group versus 10.7% in the placebo group.

Conclusions

addition of telmisartan to standard therapies significantly reduces all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and heart failure hospital stays in hemodialysis patients with CHF and LVEF ≤ 40%.

### Telmisartan and amlodipine [^111KrQVy]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Telmisartan is metabolized by conjugation to form a pharmacologically inactive acylglucuronide; the glucuronide of the parent compound is the only metabolite that has been identified in human plasma and urine. After a single dose, the glucuronide represents approximately 11% of the measured radioactivity in plasma. The cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are not involved in the metabolism of telmisartan.

Total plasma clearance of telmisartan is > 800 mL/min. Terminal half-life and total clearance appear to be independent of dose.

Amlodipine:

Amlodipine is extensively (about 90%) converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic metabolism with 10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine.

Specific Populations

Renal Insufficiency:

Telmisartan

No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with decreased renal function. Telmisartan is not removed from blood by hemofiltration [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.5)].

Amlodipine

The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. Patients with renal failure may therefore receive the usual initial dose.

Hepatic Insufficiency:

Telmisartan

In patients with hepatic insufficiency, plasma concentrations of telmisartan are increased, and absolute bioavailability approaches 100% [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.4) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption:

Following oral administration, peak concentrations (Cmax) of telmisartan are reached in 0.5 to 1 hour after dosing. Food slightly reduces the bioavailability of telmisartan, with a reduction in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of about 6% with the 40 mg tablet and about 20% after a 160 mg dose. The absolute bioavailability of telmisartan is dose dependent. At 40 and 160 mg the bioavailability was 42% and 58%, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of orally administered telmisartan are nonlinear over the dose range 20 to 160 mg, with greater than proportional increases of plasma concentrations (Cmaxand AUC) with increasing doses. Telmisartan shows bi-exponential decay kinetics with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 24 hours. Trough plasma concentrations of telmisartan with once daily dosing are about 10% to 25% of peak plasma concentrations. Telmisartan has an accumulation index in plasma of 1.5 to 2.0 upon repeated once daily dosing.

Distribution

Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (> 99.5%), mainly albumin and α 1 – acid glycoprotein. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range achieved with recommended doses. The volume of distribution for telmisartan is approximately 500 liters indicating additional tissue binding.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There is no information regarding the presence of telmisartan and amlodipine tablets or telmisartan in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published studies report that amlodipine is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of amlodipine on the breastfed infant. There is no available information on the effects of amlodipine on milk production. Telmisartan is present in the milk of lactating rats (see Data). Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infant including hypotension, hyperkalemia and renal impairment, advise a nursing woman not to breastfeed during treatment with telmisartan and amlodipine tablets.

Data:

Telmisartan was present in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations 1.5 to 2 times those found in plasma from 4 to 8 hours after administration.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of telmisartan and amlodipine tablets in pediatric patients have not been established.

Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to telmisartan and amlodipine

If oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function.

### Effect of telmisartan on renal outcomes: a randomized trial [^111C4dvr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) blunt progression of advanced diabetic nephropathy, but their long-term renal effects in other patients are not clear.

Objective

To examine the long-term renal effects of telmisartan versus placebo in adults at high vascular risk.

Design

Randomized trial. Patients were randomly assigned by a central automated system between November 2001 and May 2004 and were followed until March 2008. Participants and investigators were blinded to intervention status.

Setting

Multicenter, multinational study.

Patients

5927 adults with known cardiovascular disease or diabetes with end-organ damage but without macroalbuminuria or heart failure who cannot tolerate angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

Intervention

Telmisartan, 80 mg/d (n = 2954), or matching placebo (n = 2972) plus standard treatment for a mean of 56 months.

Measurements

Composite renal outcome of dialysis or doubling of serum creatinine, changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and changes in albuminuria.

Results

No important difference was found in the composite renal outcome with telmisartan (58 patients [1.96%]) versus placebo (46 patients [1.55%]) (hazard ratio, 1.29 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.89]; P = 0.20). Among the telmisartan and placebo groups, 7 and 10 patients had dialysis and 56 and 36 patients had doubling of serum creatinine, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.59 [CI, 1.04 to 2.41]; P = 0.031). Albuminuria increased less with telmisartan than with placebo (32% [CI, 23% to 41%] vs. 63% [CI, 52% to 76%]; P < 0.001). Decreases in estimated GFR were greater with telmisartan than with placebo (mean change in estimated GFR, -3.2 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) [SD, 18.3] vs. -0.26 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) [SD, 18.0]; P < 0.001).

Limitation

Only 17 participants had dialysis.

Conclusion

In adults with vascular disease but without macroalbuminuria, the effects of telmisartan on major renal outcomes were similar to those of placebo.

Specific Populations

Telmisartan

Renal Insufficiency: Telmisartan is not removed from blood by hemofiltration and is not dialyzable [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

Hepatic Insufficiency: In patients with hepatic insufficiency, plasma concentrations of telmisartan are increased, and absolute bioavailability approaches 100% [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Gender: Plasma concentrations of telmisartan are generally 2 to 3 times higher in females than in males. In clinical trials, however, no significant increases in blood pressure response or in the incidence of orthostatic hypotension were found in women. No dosage adjustment is necessary.

Geriatric Patients: The pharmacokinetics of telmisartan do not differ between the elderly and those younger than 65 years of age.

Drug Interaction Studies

Telmisartan

Ramipril: Co-administration of telmisartan 80 mg once daily and ramipril 10 mg once daily to healthy subjects increases steady-state Cmaxand AUC of ramipril 2.3-and 2.1-fold, respectively, and Cmaxand AUC of ramiprilat 2.4-and 1.5-fold, respectively. In contrast, Cmaxand AUC of telmisartan decrease by 31% and 16%, respectively. When co-administering telmisartan and ramipril, the response may be greater because of the possibly additive pharmacodynamic effects of the combined drugs, and also because of the increased exposure to ramipril and ramiprilat in the presence of telmisartan.

Other Drugs: Co-administration of telmisartan did not result in a clinically significant interaction with acetaminophen, amlodipine, glyburide, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin, or ibuprofen. Telmisartan is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and had no effects in vitro on cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for some inhibition of CYP2C19. Telmisartan is not expected to interact with drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes; it is also not expected to interact with drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for possible inhibition of the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19.

10	OVERDOSAGE

Telmisartan

Limited data are available with regard to overdosage of telmisartan in humans. The most likely manifestations of overdosage with telmisartan are hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Telmisartan is not removed by hemofiltration and is not dialyzable.

Hydrochlorothiazide

The most common signs and symptoms observed in patients with a hydrochlorothiazide overdose are those caused by electrolyte depletion (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hyponatremia) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis. If digitalis has also been administered, hypokalemia may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by hemodialysis has not been established. The oral LD50of hydrochlorothiazide is greater than 10 g/kg in both mice and rats.

### Renal outcomes with telmisartan, ramipril, or both, in people at high vascular risk (the ONTARGET study): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, controlled trial [^116Utg6g]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are known to reduce proteinuria. Their combination might be more effective than either treatment alone, but long-term data for comparative changes in renal function are not available. We investigated the renal effects of ramipril (an ACE inhibitor), telmisartan (an ARB), and their combination in patients aged 55 years or older with established atherosclerotic vascular disease or with diabetes with end-organ damage.

Methods

The trial ran from 2001 to 2007. After a 3-week run-in period, 25 620 participants were randomly assigned to ramipril 10 mg a day (n = 8576), telmisartan 80 mg a day (n = 8542), or to a combination of both drugs (n = 8502; median follow-up was 56 months), and renal function and proteinuria were measured. The primary renal outcome was a composite of dialysis, doubling of serum creatinine, and death. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00153101.

Findings

784 patients permanently discontinued randomised therapy during the trial because of hypotensive symptoms (406 on combination therapy, 149 on ramipril, and 229 on telmisartan). The number of events for the composite primary outcome was similar for telmisartan (n = 1147 [13.4%]) and ramipril (1150 [13.5%]; hazard ratio [HR] 1.00, 95% CI 0.92–1.09), but was increased with combination therapy (1233 [14.5%]; HR 1.09, 1.01–1.18, p = 0.037). The secondary renal outcome, dialysis or doubling of serum creatinine, was similar with telmisartan (189 [2.21%]) and ramipril (174 [2.03%]; HR 1.09, 0.89–1.34) and more frequent with combination therapy (212 [2.49%]: HR 1.24, 1.01–1.51, p = 0.038). Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) declined least with ramipril compared with telmisartan (-2.82 [SD 17.2] mL/min/1.73 m(2)vs -4.12 [17.4], p < 0.0001) or combination therapy (-6.11 [17.9], p < 0.0001). The increase in urinary albumin excretion was less with telmisartan (p = 0.004) or with combination therapy (p = 0.001) than with ramipril.

Interpretation

In people at high vascular risk, telmisartan's effects on major renal outcomes are similar to ramipril. Although combination therapy reduces proteinuria to a greater extent than monotherapy, overall it worsens major renal outcomes.

Trial design

At screening, a physical examination was performed, demographics were collected, and blood was collected for clinical chemistry assessment. After screening, eligible patients using an ACEi or ARB entered a "run in period", lasting a maximum of 4 weeks, in which the use of ACEi or ARB was discontinued to avoid interference with the study drug while the patients' blood pressure was stabilized with a calcium antagonist or metoprolol (i.e. ≤ 10 mmHg change from screening values) if necessary and at the discretion of the investigator.

At the study day and prior to breakfast, venous blood samples were taken for routine clinical laboratory assessment and 24‐hour urine was collected and analyzed for urinary albumin, protein, sodium, potassium, creatinine, and urea excretion.

After a low‐dose computed tomography scan for attenuation correction, 400 MBq [11 C]Telmisartan was intravenously administered as a bolus at t = 0 hours followed by a 1.5 hours baseline dynamic PET scan (Biograph Vision, Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) to measure selective uptake and accumulation of [11 C]Telmisartan. After a 1.5‐hours washout period (at t = 3 hours), an oral dose of 20, 80, or 120 mg telmisartan was administered to the patient (n = 3:3:3). N‐desmethyl telmisartan was commercially bought and labeled by the Hospital Pharmacy at the UMCG. Then, at the approximate time of maximal oral telmisartan plasma concentration (t = 4 hours; 1 hour after telmisartan administration) and after a second low‐dose computed tomography scan for attenuation correction, a second intravenous [11 C]Telmisartan dose of ~ 400 MBq was administered followed by a second 1.5‐hours dynamic PET scan. In this postdrug scan, a part of the receptor binding sites are occupied by telmisartan, hence the reduction in [11 C]Telmisartan uptake compared with the baseline scan can be used to determine the RO of telmisartan.PET images were reconstructed into a series of 26 frames (7 × 10, 2 × 30, 3 × 60, 2 × 120, 2 × 180, 5 × 300, and 5 × 600 seconds) with corrections for detector normalization, deadtime, isotope decay, photon attenuation, random, and scattered coincidences.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There is no information regarding the presence of telmisartan in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Telmisartan is present in the milk of lactating rats (see Data). Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infant including hypotension, hyperkalemia and renal impairment, advise a nursing woman not to breastfeed during treatment with telmisartan.

Data

Telmisartan was present in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations 1.5 to 2 times those found in plasma from 4 to 8 hours after administration.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to telmisartan

If oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of patients receiving telmisartan in hypertension clinical studies, 551 (19%) were 65 to 74 years of age and 130 (4%) were 75 years or older. No overall differences in effectiveness and safety were observed in these patients compared to younger patients and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Of the total number of patients receiving telmisartan in the cardiovascular risk reduction study (ONTARGET), the percentage of patients ≥ 65 to < 75 years of age was 42%; 15% of patients were ≥ 75 years old. No overall differences in effectiveness and safety were observed in these patients compared to younger patients and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In normal volunteers, a dose of telmisartan 80 mg inhibited the pressor response to an intravenous infusion of angiotensin II by about 90% at peak plasma concentrations with approximately 40% inhibition persisting for 24 hours.

Plasma concentration of angiotensin II and plasma renin activity (PRA) increased in a dosedependent manner after single administration of telmisartan to healthy subjects and repeated administration to hypertensive patients. The once-daily administration of up to 80 mg telmisartan to healthy subjects did not influence plasma aldosterone concentrations. In multiple dose studies with hypertensive patients, there were no clinically significant changes in electrolytes (serum potassium or sodium), or in metabolic function (including serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, LDL, glucose, or uric acid).

In 30 hypertensive patients with normal renal function treated for 8 weeks with telmisartan 80 mg or telmisartan 80 mg in combination with hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg, there were no clinically significant changes from baseline in renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, filtration fraction, renovascular resistance, or creatinine clearance.

7.4 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System and Changes in Renal Function

Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) with angiotensin blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and renal impairment. The ONTARGET trial enrolled 25,620 patients ≥ 55 years old with atherosclerotic disease or diabetes with end-organ damage, randomizing them to telmisartan (ARB) only, ramipril (ACE inhibitor) only, or the combination, and followed them for a median of 56 months. Patients who received the combination of ARB and ACE inhibitor did not obtain any additional benefit (no additional reduction of risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization from heart failure) compared to ARB monotherapy or ACE inhibitor monotherapy, but experienced an increased incidence of renal dysfunction (e.g., acute renal failure) compared with monotherapy groups.

In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide and other agents that affect the RAS.

Do not co-administer aliskiren with telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with diabetes. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2).

7.5 Digoxin

When telmisartan was co-administered with digoxin, median increases in digoxin peak plasma concentration (49%) and in trough concentration (20%) were observed. Monitor digoxin levels in patients taking concomitant telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide and digoxin.

7.6 Antidiabetic Drugs (Oral Agents and Insulin)

Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic drugs may be required when co-administered with hydrochlorothiazide.

7.7 Cholestyramine and Colestipol Resins

Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Stagger the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and the resin such that hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours before or 4 to 6 hours after the administration of the resin.

8.2	Lactation

Risk Summary

There is no information regarding the presence of MICARDIS HCT or telmisartan in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Limited published studies report that hydrochlorothiazide is present in human milk. However, there is insufficient information to determine the effects of hydrochlorothiazide on the breastfed infant or the effects of hydrochlorothiazide on milk production. Telmisartan is present in the milk of lactating rats (see Data). Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infant including hypotension, hyperkalemia and renal impairment, advise a nursing woman not to breastfeed during treatment with MICARDIS HCT.

Data

Telmisartan was present in the milk of lactating rats at concentrations 1.5 to 2 times those found in plasma from 4 to 8 hours after administration.

8.4	Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of MICARDIS HCT in pediatric patients have not been established.

Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to MICARDIS HCT:

If oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function.

8.5	Geriatric Use

In the controlled clinical trials (n = 1017), approximately 20% of patients treated with telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide were 65 years of age or older, and 5% were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in effectiveness and safety of telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide were observed in these patients compared to younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function and of concomitant diseases or other drug therapy.

8.6	Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic insufficiency should initiate treatment under close medical supervision using the 40 mg/12.5 mg combination.

Telmisartan

As the majority of telmisartan is eliminated by biliary excretion, patients with biliary obstructive disorders or hepatic insufficiency can be expected to have reduced clearance and higher blood levels.

Hydrochlorothiazide

Minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease.

Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions

Use of drugs that act on the RAS in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: oligohydramnios, reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure, fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension, and death. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus.

In patients taking telmisartan during pregnancy, perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of gestation. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue telmisartan, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury.

Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to telmisartan for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. If oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function [see].

Data

Animal Data

No teratogenic effects were observed when telmisartan was administered to pregnant rats at oral doses of up to 50 mg/kg/day and to pregnant rabbits at oral doses up to 45 mg/kg/day. In rabbits, embryolethality associated with maternal toxicity (reduced body weight gain and food consumption) was observed at 45 mg/kg/day [about 12 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 80 mg on a mg/m2basis]. In rats, maternally toxic (reduction in body weight gain and food consumption) telmisartan doses of 15 mg/kg/day (about 1.9 times the MRHD on a mg/m2basis), administered during late gestation and lactation, were observed to produce adverse effects in neonates, including reduced viability, low birth weight, delayed maturation, and decreased weight gain. The no observed effect doses for developmental toxicity in rats and rabbits, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively, are about 0.64 and 3.7 times, on a mg/m2basis, the maximum recommended human dose of telmisartan (80 mg/day).

Practice Point 1.2 — automated office blood pressure (AOBP) measurement — states that AOBP, either attended or unattended, may be the preferred method of standardized office BP measurement. In the opinion of the Work Group, AOBP may increase adherence to proper preparation because devices can be programmed to include a rest period, can automatically take multiple BP measurements, and provide an average BP measurement, and BP measured with AOBP can be either attended (with a healthcare provider in the room) or unattended (without a provider in the room). Although a recent meta-analysis suggested that unattended AOBP measurements result in lower average BPs than attended measurements, the differences were notably small when restricted to studies that randomized the order in which unattended and attended standardized measurements were made. Several large trials, including Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination With Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET), and SPS3, have used AOBP devices, and the SPRINT protocol did not specify whether AOBP should be performed attended or unattended.

Study Highlights
WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

Angiotensin receptor blockers reduce the risk of kidney failure but a large and unexplained interindividual response variability leads to suboptimal therapy in many patients with diabetic kidney disease.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

Whether there is a relationship among the interindividual differences in plasma exposure, kidney tissue distribution, receptor occupancy (RO), and ultimately urinary‐albumin‐to‐creatinine‐ratio (UACR) response after telmisartan administration.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

UACR response variability is associated with interindividual differences in plasma telmisartan exposure. Furthermore, plasma telmisartan exposure is positively associated with telmisartan kidney distribution, although its relationship with angiotensin‐1 receptor occupancy was less clear.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

Understanding of the pharmacological relationship among telmisartan dose, exposure, kidney distribution, RO, and UACR response in individual patients may lead to improved individual telmisartan dosing regimens.

Approximately 30% of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) ultimately develop diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and this has now become the leading cause of renal replacement therapies, accounting for ~ 50% of cases in developed countries. In addition, DKD results in high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and decreased patients' health‐related quality of life. Among others, current treatment of DKD includes tight blood pressure control with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).

ARBs are the guideline recommended treatment for kidney protection, based on clinical trials demonstrating that these agents reduce the risk of kidney failure. Yet, a substantial proportion of patients remains at high risk for progressive kidney function loss during ARB treatment, which can be, in part, attributed to an interindividual variation in therapeutic response. This individual variation in long‐term efficacy closely correlates with the individual variation in urinary‐albumin‐to‐creatinine‐ratio (UACR), an accepted surrogate for progressive kidney function loss. Indeed, ~ 30% of patients do not achieve a reduction in the UACR during ARB treatment. This provides a clear rationale to pay more attention to studying the individual patient and unravel determinants of response variability and therapy resistance in order to personalize treatment. We hypothesize that the underlying mechanisms of the interindividual response variability can be attributed to variability in plasma‐ and tissue drug disposition and receptor interaction.

### Three-year cardiovascular outcomes of telmisartan in patients with hypertension: an electronic health record-based cohort study [^116G9WBV]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Telmisartan exhibits superior efficacy in controlling 24-h blood pressure (BP) compared with other angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). However, data on its cardiovascular effects in patients with hypertension are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the cardiovascular outcomes in patients taking telmisartan compared to those taking other ARBs.

Methods

This multicenter retrospective study used data from the Korea University Medical Center database, built from electronic health records. A total of 19,247 patients taking two or more antihypertensive medications were identified. Patients prescribed telmisartan (telmisartan users) were compared with those prescribed an ARB other than telmisartan (other ARB users). The primary outcome was major adverse cardiac events (MACE), a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and hospitalizations due to heart failure. The adjusted outcomes were compared using 1:1 propensity score (PS) matching.

Results

Overall, 3,437 (17.9%) patients were telmisartan users. These patients were more likely to be younger and male and less likely to have a history of chronic kidney disease, dialysis, or heart failure. In the PS-matched cohort, BP control was similar in both groups; however, telmisartan users exhibited significantly lower visit-to-visit BP variability. The adjusted 3-year MACE rate was similar between telmisartan users (4.6%) and other ARB users (4.7%, log-rank P = 0.75), with comparable safety profiles.

Conclusions

In real-world practice, telmisartan showed cardiovascular outcomes similar to those of other ARBs in patients with hypertension taking two or more antihypertensive drugs.

### Current status of angiotensin receptor blockers for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases: focus on telmisartan [^113c8xYp]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Poorly controlled hypertension is a major risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, strokes, heart failure and renal failure. Despite these devastating complications, blood pressure control of ≤ 140/90 mmHg, which is above the current standard, is very poor worldwide, accounting for 34% of hypertensive patients in the United States, and 6% in other countries. The reasons for this poor control of blood pressure include lack of aggressive treatment by physicians, especially for the systolic blood pressure, drug selection and patient compliance. The blood pressure follows a circadian rhythm and is the highest between 0600 to 1200 h, when most complications occur. Long-acting drugs that extend their action to cover this vulnerable period are preferable, especially those that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, and are the most effective in controlling blood pressure and preventing or reducing its cardiovascular and renal complications. With respect to the angiotensin receptor blockers, telmisartan has been demonstrated by several studies to be the longest acting among its class of drugs and to effectively prevent the early morning rise of blood pressure.

5.6 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAS)

Telmisartan

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy.

The ONTARGET trial enrolled 25,620 patients ≥ 55 years old with atherosclerotic disease or diabetes with end-organ damage, randomized them to telmisartan only, ramipril only, or the combination, and followed them for a median of 56 months. Patients receiving the combination of telmisartan and ramipril did not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy, but experienced an increased incidence of renal dysfunction (e.g., acute renal failure) compared with groups receiving telmisartan alone or ramipril alone.

In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on telmisartan and amlodipine and other agents that affect the RAS.

Do not co-administer aliskiren with telmisartan and amlodipine in patients with diabetes. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with telmisartan and amlodipine in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min /1.73 m2).

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption:

Following oral administration, peak concentrations (Cmax) of telmisartan are reached in 0.5 to 1 hour after dosing. Food slightly reduces the bioavailability of telmisartan, with a reduction in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of about 6% with the 40 mg tablet and about 20% after a 160 mg dose. The absolute bioavailability of telmisartan is dose dependent. At 40 mg and 160 mg, the bioavailability was 42% and 58%, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of orally administered telmisartan are nonlinear over the dose range 20 mg to 160 mg, with greater than proportional increases of plasma concentrations (Cmaxand AUC) with increasing doses. Telmisartan shows bi-exponential decay kinetics with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 24 hours. Trough plasma concentrations of telmisartan with once daily dosing are about 10% to 25% of peak plasma concentrations. Telmisartan has an accumulation index in plasma of 1.5 to 2.0 upon repeated once daily dosing.

Distribution

Telmisartan is highly bound to plasma proteins (> 99.5%), mainly albumin and α1- acid glycoprotein. Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range achieved with recommended doses. The volume of distribution for telmisartan is approximately 500 liters indicating additional tissue binding.

In patients with renal impairment, there are limited data on the efficacy of telmisartan/HCTZ compared with placebo, telmisartan monotherapy or other ARB-based combinations. The Diabetics Exposed to Telmisartan And enalaprIL (DETAIL ®) study, in which more than 80% of enrolled patients had microalbuminuria, confirmed the efficacy of telmisartan in combination with a diuretic. Switching patients with poorly controlled hypertension and mild-to-moderate chronic kidney disease from high-dose ARBs to telmisartan 40 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg provided additional BP reductions and reduced urinary protein excretion, suggesting the combination is effective in this patient population. Telmisartan/HCTZ has also demonstrated excellent tolerability. A retrospective safety analysis of 50 studies that evaluated telmisartan either as monotherapy or combined with HCTZ confirmed that the addition of HCTZ did not have a negative impact on the excellent tolerability profile of telmisartan, which is comparable with placebo. Similar tolerability profiles have been reported for other ARB/HCTZ combinations.

Data

Animal Data:

No reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted with the combination of telmisartan and amlodipine besylate. However, these studies have been conducted for telmisartan and amlodipine besylate alone.

Telmisartan:

No teratogenic effects were observed when telmisartan was administered to pregnant rats at oral doses of up to 50 mg/kg/day and to pregnant rabbits at oral doses up to 45 mg/kg/day. In rabbits, embryolethality associated with maternal toxicity (reduced body weight gain and food consumption) was observed at 45 mg/kg/day [about 12 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 80 mg on a mg/m2basis]. In rats, maternally toxic (reduction in body weight gain and food consumption) telmisartan doses of 15 mg/kg/day (about 1.9 times the MRHD on a mg/m2basis), administered during late gestation and lactation, were observed to produce adverse effects in neonates, including reduced viability, low birth weight, delayed maturation, and decreased weight gain. The no observed effect doses for developmental toxicity in rats and rabbits, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively, are about 0.64 and 3.7 times, on a mg/m2basis, the maximum recommended human dose of telmisartan (80 mg/day).

Amlodipine:

No evidence of teratogenicity or embryo/fetal toxicity was found when pregnant rats and rabbits were treated orally with amlodipine maleate at doses up to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day (approximately 10 and 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area, respectively) during their respective periods of major organogenesis. However, for rats, litter size was significantly decreased (by about 50%) and the number of intrauterine deaths was significantly increased (about 5-fold). Amlodipine has been shown to prolong both the gestation period and the duration of labor in rats at this dose.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Both clinical trials were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice and the study protocols were approved by the local medical ethics committees. All participants signed written informed consent before any study‐specific procedure commenced.

Individual telmisartan exposure‐response analysis on‐2 data

Exposure and response data of 10 participants were obtained from the telmisartan arm in the pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy of ROTATE‐2 (: NL5459). In short, ROTATE‐2 was a double‐blind, 48‐week, multicenter, crossover study to determine the individual albuminuria lowering response of four different albuminuria lowering drug classes in adult patients with T2D, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 45 mL/minute/1.73 m 2 and elevated albuminuria (> 30 and ≤ 500 mg/g). Individuals with a cardiovascular disease event within 6 months of study enrollment, using glucagon like peptide‐1 receptor agonists, or pregnant women were excluded. Inclusion for the PK substudy was based on willingness to participate. Most important exclusion criterium for the substudy was the use of medication, and a surgical or medical condition that might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of telmisartan.

In the 4‐week PK telmisartan substudy, at the first day of oral 80 mg telmisartan dosing, blood samples were obtained at predose and 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, or 6 and 24 hours and stored at −80°C before shipping to a central laboratory for analysis of plasma telmisartan concentrations using a validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy method (Nuvisan, Neu‐Ulm, Germany; calibration range 0.500–1,000 ng/mL, lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) 0.500 ng/mL, inter‐assay precision 2.9–7.4%, and accuracy 100.4–101.9%). UACR data were available from morning urine voids collected at days −2, −1, and 0 and week 4, and measured at a local laboratory.

### Have we fallen off target with concerns surrounding dual RAAS blockade? [^112qQiyS]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

A misinterpretation of the results from ONTARGET (Ongoing Telmisartan alone and in combination with ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) has sparked both efficacy and safety concerns within the nephrology community regarding the utilization of dual RAAS blockade to achieve more desirable renal outcomes. Two important considerations are requisite prior to interpreting these results, specifically: the context of the cohort studied (non-proteinuric CKD patients at low risk of progression) and the inadequate power of the study to assess renal outcomes. The cardiac and renal protection afforded from dual RAAS blockade in select populations, particularly proteinuric CKD and CHF, is supported by literature. Moreover, the response to dual RAAS blockade involving different combinations of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and direct renin inhibitors, may not be uniform amongst all patient populations. Will we continue to withhold the appropriate medical therapy from certain individuals based on misconstrued data? The proceedings provide a critical analysis of the ONTARGET study and an evidence-based substantiation for the utilization of various forms of dual RAAS blockade in proteinuric kidney disease and beyond.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Telmisartan and Amlodipine Tablets

The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine and telmisartan when combined are similar to the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine and telmisartan when administered separately.

After administering telmisartan and amlodipine tablets 80/10 mg with a high-fat meal, the total area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and Cmaxfor telmisartan decreased by about 24% and 60%, respectively. For amlodipine, AUC and Cmaxwere not altered [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.1)].

Telmisartan

Following oral administration, peak concentrations (Cmax) of telmisartan are reached in 0.5 to 1 hour after dosing. Food slightly reduces the bioavailability of telmisartan, with a reduction in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of about 6% with the 40 mg tablet and about 20% after a 160 mg dose. The absolute bioavailability of telmisartan is dose dependent. At 40 and 160 mg the bioavailability was 42% and 58%, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of orally administered telmisartan are nonlinear over the dose range 20 to 160 mg, with greater than proportional increases of plasma concentrations (Cmaxand AUC) with increasing doses. Telmisartan shows bi-exponential decay kinetics with a terminal elimination half life of approximately 24 hours. Trough plasma concentrations of telmisartan with once daily dosing are about 10% to 25% of peak plasma concentrations. Telmisartan has an accumulation index in plasma of 1.5 to 2.0 upon repeated once daily dosing.

### Multicentre randomized controlled trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor / angiotensin receptor blocker withdrawal in advanced renal disease: the STOP-ACEi trial [^113f7xbE]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

The rigor of some of these studies, which failed to dissociate renoprotective from antihypertensive effects of ACEi/ARBs, is now being questioned. Renoprotection from ACEi/ARB may be lost in more advanced disease where significant ischaemic nephropathy is present. This hypothesis is supported by reports in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with CKD indicating that ACEi/ARBs may accelerate renal progression, in spite of a beneficial anti-proteinuric effect. Combined ACEi/ARB treatment has been shown to worsen renal outcomes in patients at high cardiovascular risk and increases the risk of hyperkalaemia and acute kidney injury. The Telmisartan Randomized Assessment Study in ACE intolerant subjects with cardiovascular disease (TRANSCEND) demonstrated both a greater decline in eGFR and greater incidence of doubling of serum creatinine on Telmisartan (HR 1.59; 95% CI 1.04–2.41).

In a recent observational study, withdrawal of ACEi/ARB therapy in 52 older patients with advanced CKD led to a mean increase in eGFR of 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 over 12 months and an increase or stabilization in eGFR in all but four patients. There was a small increase in BP but no change in risk of cardiovascular events. There was also an association between the increase in BP levels upon discontinuation of ACEi/ARB and improved renal function. The close interaction of the kidney and the heart is critical to survival, and the risk factors for poor cardiovascular outcomes in the general population and in early CKD are associated with better outcomes in advanced CKD. There are no studies assessing the benefits of ACEi/ARB therapy in cardiovascular risk reduction in advanced non-dialysis CKD. Indeed, although lowering BP reduces cardiovascular events, evidence suggests that ACEi/ARBs are not superior to other antihypertensives in this regard. Several randomized controlled studies in dialysis patients have shown increased cardiovascular events with the use of ACEi. Indeed, the rate of decline of renal function remains a strong predictor of mortality.

5.5 Impaired Renal Function

As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, anticipate changes in renal function in susceptible individuals. In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure or renal dysfunction), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar results have been reported with telmisartan [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen were observed. There has been no long-term use of telmisartan in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but anticipate an effect similar to that seen with ACE inhibitors.

5.6 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAS)

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin-receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy.

The ONTARGET trial enrolled 25,620 patients ≥ 55 years old with atherosclerotic disease or diabetes with end-organ damage, randomizing them to telmisartan only, ramipril only, or the combination, and followed them for a median of 56 months. Patients receiving the combination of telmisartan and ramipril did not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy, but experienced an increased incidence of renal dysfunction (e.g., acute renal failure) compared with groups receiving telmisartan alone or ramipril alone.

In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on telmisartan and other agents that affect the RAS.

Do not co-administer aliskiren with telmisartan in patients with diabetes. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with telmisartan in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2).

### Studying telmisartan plasma exposure, kidney distribution, receptor occupancy, and response in patients with type 2 diabetes using [C] telmisartan [^113GGj9A]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

The T max we observed in the PET imaging study was substantially longer than reported in literatureand this is important in the design trial, because we aimed to inject the second [11 C]Telmisartan dose when maximum plasma telmisartan concentrations had been reached, assuming that this correlates to maximum AT‐1 receptor blockage. The time of telmisartan dosing was 80–90 minutes prior to [11 C]Telmisartan injection (i.e. slightly longer than the reported T max of 60 minutes). However, the PK profiles in Figure 2 suggest that still none of the participants had reached maximum plasma telmisartan concentrations at the moment of tracer administration. Assuming that maximum AT‐1 receptor blockage at kidney level follows maximum plasma telmisartan concentration, it can be reasoned that the timing of the second PET scan procedure was not optimal and the RO could have been underestimated in some individuals. It is also noteworthy that the PET models all assume a constant RO during the PET scan (steady‐state condition). Because this was not the case, the time‐dependent RO will influence the data fitting and thus the model parameters. This effect will depend on the dynamics of the telmisartan plasma concentration and thus introduces additional variability into the results.

Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) — usual dose ranges and key precautions are as follows: Azilsartan 40–80 mg daily (40 mg with diuretic); Candesartan 8–32 mg daily; Eprosartan 400–800 mg daily (daily or divided bid); Irbesartan 75–300 mg daily; Losartan 25–100 mg/day (daily or divided bid); Olmesartan 20–40 mg daily; Telmisartan 20–80 mg daily; Valsartan 80–320 mg daily. Avoid in women who are planning to become pregnant or who are pregnant; when pregnancy is contemplated or detected, discontinue as soon as possible. Avoid concomitant use of ACEI with an ARB or direct renin inhibitor due to increased risk of hypotension, syncope, increased K+, and changes in kidney function. In general, the lower doses should be considered in patients receiving diuretics. Monitor K+ and kidney function; use caution if combined with K+ sparing diuretic, or K+ supplement. Consider interruption or discontinuation in patients who develop clinically significant decline in kidney function after initiation of therapy, until further work-up, as indicated. Compelling indications include: CKD with albuminuria; HFrEF; recent MI.

### Telmisartan for treatment of COVID-19 patients: an open multicenter randomized clinical trial [^111ppL9j]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

It has been shown that plasma angiotensin IIand aldosteronelevels are markedly elevated and are correlated with severity in Covid-19 patients. These findings add support to the rationale of a high dose approach for ARBs in Covid-19 (the higher the biophase concentration of agonist, the higher the antagonist dose). High dose scenario is possible because of the safety profile of this therapeutic class; ARBs are generally well tolerated, with no known class specific adverse events. In this sense, previous studies support the use of "high" doses of telmisartan. Stangier et al. have shown that the incidence of adverse events was low (which were generally non-specific in nature and mild in intensity) in normotensive patients of all ages, even at high single doses of 160 mg i.v. or multiple doses (7 days) of 320 mg/day given orally; Aranda et al. used 80 mg twice daily in non-diabetic hypertensive patients with nephropathies for 2 years, and observed excellent clinical and biochemical tolerability, and McGill et al. using 160 mg once daily for 8 weeks as monotherapy or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, registered that the therapy was safe and well tolerated. In addition to the results presented above, the effect of telmisartan on systolic and diastolic blood pressure on days 5 and 8 (Table 5) observed in our trial are similar to those published by Fogari et al. in hypertensive diabetic patients with microalbuminuria after 48 weeks under treatment with the association of telmisartan 160 mg/day plus amlodipine 2.5 mg. On the other hand, in this study it was observed that the higher urinary albumin excretion rate for higher doses of telmisartan (160 mg/day) was independent of the reduction in systemic blood pressure (the maximum dose for this effect was 80 mg/day). The role of inflammation in chronic kidney disease pathogenesis and progression has been recognized since the late 1990s and microalbuminuria is an indication of an ongoing low-level inflammatory process. Aranda et al.also observed that the decrease in proteinuria was more pronounced with "high" (80 mg twice daily) dose of telmisartan compared with "standard" (80 mg once daily). These results suggest that the maximal anti-inflammatory dose of telmisartan might be superior to its maximal recommended anti-hypertensive dose (80 mg/day), therefore providing additional support for the rationale of high dose telmisartan in our study (160 mg/day).

### Long-term renoprotective effects of standard versus high doses of telmisartan in hypertensive nondiabetic nephropathies [^111tye4Z]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

This report describes an open randomized study intended to evaluate the long-term renoprotective effects of "standard" (80 mg once daily) versus "high" (80 mg twice daily) doses of telmisartan in hypertensive patients without diabetes with biopsy-proven chronic proteinuric nephropathies.

Methods

We included 78 patients (age, 43.5 ± 13.2 years; 71.8% men). After a 4-week wash-out period, patients were randomly assigned to telmisartan, 80 mg once daily (n = 40) or 80 mg twice daily (n = 38), during a mean follow-up of 24.6 ± 2.2 months.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups, including blood pressure, renal function, and proteinuria. Blood pressure control did not differ between groups during follow-up. In the group administered telmisartan, 80 mg once daily, serum creatinine level increased from 1.6 ± 0.6 to 2.7 ± 0.9 mg/dL (141 ± 52 to 239 ± 80 micromol/L), and estimated creatinine clearance declined from 68 ± 30 to 50 ± 34 mL/min (1.13 ± 0.50 to 0.83 ± 0.57 mL/s), whereas in those administered 80 mg twice daily, serum creatinine (1.6 ± 0.7 to 1.6 ± 0.8 mg/dL [141 ± 62 to 141 ± 71 micromol/L]) and estimated creatinine clearance values (67 ± 38 to 74 ± 38 mL/min [1.12 ± 0.63 to 1.23 ± 0.63 mL/s]) did not change during the study. The decrease in proteinuria was more pronounced (P < 0.01) in patients administered the high dose of telmisartan compared with those treated with the standard dose. Serum potassium levels and lipid profiles did not change significantly in either group.

Conclusion

Long-term administration of high doses of telmisartan seems to improve the efficacy of the drug to decrease proteinuria and slow the progression to end-stage renal failure in nondiabetic hypertensive renal disease.

### Telmisartan, ramipril, or both in patients at high risk for vascular events [^1125Qwth]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Excellent credibility.

The study ONTARGET (telmisartan) was published by ONTARGET Investigators and colleagues in 2008 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2, Coronary artery disease, Acute ischemic stroke, Peripheral artery disease and Transient ischemic attack. In the ONTARGET (telmisartan) study, the trial question was: is telmisartan superior to ramipril in patients with vascular disease or high-risk diabetes? In the ONTARGET (telmisartan) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ONTARGET (telmisartan) study, the population was: 17118 patients (4581 female, 12537 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with vascular disease or high-risk diabetes without HF. The key exclusion criteria were known hypersensitivity or intolerance to angiotensin 2 receptor antagonist or angiotensin-converting enzyme; symptomatic congestive HF; renal artery stenosis; hepatic dysfunction. In the ONTARGET (telmisartan) study, the interventions were: n = 8542 telmisartan (at a dose of 80 mg per day) n = 8576 ramipril (at a dose of 10 mg per day). In the ONTARGET (telmisartan) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke or hospitalization for HF (16.7% vs. 16.5%; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.09). In the ONTARGET (telmisartan) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in revascularization (15.1% vs. 14.8%; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11) No significant difference in hospitalization for angina (11.2% vs. 10.8%; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.14) No significant difference in renal impairment (10.6% vs. 10.2%; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.14). In the ONTARGET (telmisartan) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in syncope, diarrhea, HF and AF. significant differences in cough (1.1% vs. 4.2%), angioedema (0.1% vs. 0.3%), hypotensive symptoms (2.6% vs. 1.7%). In the ONTARGET (telmisartan) study, the conclusion was: in patients with vascular disease or high-risk diabetes without HF, telmisartan was not superior to ramipril with respect to the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke or hospitalization for HF.

5.7 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on ramipril and other agents that affect the RAS.

Telmisartan

The ONTARGET trial enrolled 25,620 patients > 55 years old with atherosclerotic disease or diabetes with end-organ damage, randomized them to telmisartan only, ramipril only, or the combination, and followed them for a median of 56 months. Patients receiving the combination of telmisartan and ramipril did not obtain any benefit in the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke and heart failure hospitalization compared to monotherapy, but experienced an increased incidence of clinically important renal dysfunction (death, doubling of serum creatinine, or dialysis) compared with groups receiving telmisartan alone or ramipril alone. Concomitant use of telmisartan and ramipril is not recommended.

Aliskiren

Do not co-administer aliskiren with ramipril in patients with diabetes. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with ramipril in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2).

5.8 Hyperkalemia

In clinical trials with ramipril, hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) occurred in approximately 1% of hypertensive patients receiving ramipril. In most cases, these were isolated values, which resolved despite continued therapy. None of these patients were discontinued from the trials because of hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of other drugs that raise serum potassium levels. Monitor serum potassium in such patients [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.2)].

5.9 Cough

Presumably caused by inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. Consider the possibility of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor induced-cough in the differential diagnosis of cough.

### Angiotensin receptor blockers for the treatment of COVID-19: pragmatic, adaptive, multicentre, phase 3, randomised controlled trial [^113tef3M]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Our trial cohort had milder disease than anticipated, with nearly 75% of the participants having returned home by day seven and more than 90% of participants had returned home by day 14. This effect left a relatively sparse distribution of participants admitted to hospital, which should be considered when interpreting the results and determining their clinical relevance. Overall, participants were younger than in previous reports, and thus, at lower risk of severe outcomes. In fact, we observed low numbers of events for some prespecified secondary outcomes (eg, dialysis requirement) that precluded informative analysis.

Most participants were from India and of southern Asian ethnicity, a population reported to be at increased risk of poor covid‐19 outcomes. A benefit for other ethnicities cannot be ruled out; however, ARB activity as an antihypertensive is not reported to vary by ethnicity. Few participants required supplemental oxygen at recruitment (28%), again suggesting relatively mild disease in our study rather than reduced access to treatment. All participating sites in India had an oxygen generator and no sites in Australia had supply limitations. A fifth of the cohort were receiving systemic steroids at recruitment, an intervention shown to reduce mortality, most clearly in people requiring oxygen or mechanical ventilation at baseline.CLARITY participants had substantially better outcomes than participants in trials conducted early in the pandemic, largely in Europe, the UK, and the USA. The overall mortality rate of 2% in the first 28 days was lower than reports of 8% or higher early in the pandemic (October 2020) and was consistent with falling case fatality rates during the study (3.5% at start of study, 2.1% at close of recruitment, and 1.5% at time of writing). The average health status of CLARITY participants was worst at the time of recruitment, after which their health improved, in contrast with earlier studies that showed worsening health status, with the widest range of scores apparent at day 14. Therefore, the generalisability of the results might be limited to younger patients with low severity disease and treated with 40 mg/day telmisartan. We cannot exclude a benefit or harm from ARBs in patients with more severe disease or treated with different agents or dosing.

### Combination therapy in hypertension: an update [^113cgvri]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic renal failure with Hypertension

Hypertension can be caused by chronic kidney disease(CKD) but it itself can worsen the renal failure. The guidelines state that management of hypertension in CKD should focus on reducing BP, with some also emphasizing reducing protein excretion. Choice of agent will primarily depend on the presence of proteinuria as there is a direct relationship between the degree of proteinuria and progression to end stage renal disease. In proteinuric kidney first line agents include an ACEIor ARB, and often requires the addition of a diuretic or a calcium channel blocker. Diuretics are a useful alternative for non-proteinuric patients or as an add-on to renin-angiotensin system blockade. Multiple drug therapy is often needed to maintain BP below the 90th percentile target, but adequate BP control is essential for better renal and cardiovascular long-term outcomes. Thiazide diuretics can be used if glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is greater than or equal to 40 mL per minute per 1.73m 2 (body surface area), and loop diuretics are used in GFR less than or equal to 40 to 50 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 Various trials like AASK (African American Study of Kidney Disease), IDNT (Irbesartan in Diabetic Nephropathy Trail), RENAAL (Reduction of Endpoints in Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan) show significant risk reduction for CKD progression when proteinuria was reduced by greater than 30% at 6 months.

Recently, combined therapy with an ACEI and an ARB has been shown to provide a greater reduction in urinary albumin excretion (UAE) than monotherapy with either of these agents in patients with diabetic nephropathy. However, such combinations may be associated with potential hazards, including increased serum potassium concentrations and worsening of renal anemia, especially in patients whose kidney function is mildly to moderately impaired.

Fogari et al. evaluated the effect of a combination therapy with the ARB telmisartan and the long-acting CCB amlodipine on urinary albumin excretion rate(UAER) in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria. The results of this study demonstrated that the high-dose telmisartan/low-dose amlodipine combination was as effective as low-dose telmisartan/high-dose amlodipine combination in reducing BP values during the 48-week study period without affecting glycemic control or electrolyte plasma levels, but the effect on UAER was significantly more pronounced with the high-dose telmisartan combination, despite equivalent BP-lowering effect.

Pharmacokinetic telmisartan data points below the LLOQ, but before time to maximal plasma concentration were set to zero prior to data analysis. Individual telmisartan concentration–time profiles were described using population approach nonlinear mixed effects modeling in NONMEM with first‐order conditional estimation method and interaction. One‐, two‐, and three compartmental models with linear elimination and various absorption models were fitted to the data to determine the optimal model structure. Models were parameterized in apparent clearances (clearance/bioavailability (CL/F)) and apparent volumes of distribution (V/F) and were assumed to be log‐normally distributed. Proportional, additive, or combined residual error structures were explored. Demographic (age, sex, and body mass index) and clinical laboratory covariates (eGFR, blood pressure, albumin, bilirubin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol) were formally tested as covariates during model development if they showed a correlation (r 2 > 0.5) with the empirical Bayesian post hoc parameter estimates. Model selection and evaluation was based on numerical and graphical evaluation, as described previously. Area under the curve from time zero to infinity (AUC 0–inf) was calculated per patient by dividing the administered dose over CL/F.

UACR was calculated as the geometric mean of the three first morning void urine collections at days −2, −1, and 0 prior to the visit to the clinic for baseline measurements and at week 4. Change from baseline UACR was calculated as the log‐ratio of UACR at week 4 and baseline UACR and used as response measure.

The exposure–response analysis was performed in R using linear regression analysis (2‐sided, P < 0.05) and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was used as an estimate for association.

Clinical trial to explore Telmisartan kidney exposure and receptor occupancy

Patients

In this randomized, open label feasibility study (GUMDROPS,: NL6637), nine patients with T2D, aged between 45 and 70 years, were eligible. Main exclusion criteria were occurrence of a cardiovascular event in the 6 months prior to inclusion, major gastrointestinal surgery, severe liver disease, pregnancy, or child‐bearing potential without using reliable contraception. Patients came to the hospital in fasted state and received a standardized breakfast and lunch, avoiding components high in salt.

Thirteen hypertensive HD patients were treated with 40 mg telmisartan once daily, and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed after 0, 4, and 8 weeks of treatment. Plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level, and serum oxidized albumin level were determined at the same time points. Serum telmisartan concentration was also measured at 4 and 8 weeks. Telmisartan significantly reduced systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure (both awake and sleeping) after 4 weeks, and these pressures showed a further significant decrease after 8 weeks. Plasma levels of aldosterone, BNP, and serum oxidized albumin were markedly decreased after 4 weeks and these lower levels were maintained at 8 weeks. The trough serum telmisartan concentration was not significantly different at 8 weeks compared with 4 weeks. Throughout the treatment period, there were no significant adverse effects. Telmisartan effectively lowers blood pressure and reduces PAC, BNP, and oxidative stress and is safe and well-tolerated by HD patients. A long-term study in a large population is required to determine the influence of telmisartan therapy on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in HD patients.

### Studying telmisartan plasma exposure, kidney distribution, receptor occupancy, and response in patients with type 2 diabetes using [C] telmisartan [^113JajFN]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We performed two clinical studies to assess whether the variation of kidney disposition and receptor binding of telmisartan correlates with the variation in systemic exposure of telmisartan and pharmacodynamic response. In our first study, we showed that the albuminuria lowering response after 4 weeks of treatment with telmisartan varied largely among individuals and that this response variability is associated with interindividual differences in plasma telmisartan exposure. In our second study, we showed that the mean plasma telmisartan exposure positively associated with the kidney distribution of telmisartan, but the relationship with AT‐1 receptor binding was less clear.

Most guideline‐ and literature information on the PKs of telmisartan is obtained in dose finding‐ and safety studies in healthy individuals. However, little is known about the variability in plasma telmisartan exposure of ARBs in patients with T2D. The reported telmisartan mean AUC (from time 0 until 28 hours) and time to maximum concentration (T max) after administration of 80 mg oral telmisartan to 37 healthy volunteers is 3,728 (range: 582–14,099) ng∙hour/mL and 1 (range: 0.5–1) hours. In our first study (ROTATE‐2), the values in patients with T2D are in the same order of magnitude (mean AUC 0–inf: 2927, range: 709–6,995 ng∙hour/mL, and median T max: 0.75, range 0.5–1.5 hours). A relation between plasma systemic exposure to telmisartan and blood pressure lowering response has been reported before, but a possible relation with albuminuria lowering response in patients with T2D is a new finding. Given the relatively small number of participants in this data analysis (n = 10), these findings should be confirmed in a larger patient cohort.

### Ramipril (Altace) [^116pFWms]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Fetal Toxicity

Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue ALTACE as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.7 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on ALTACE and other agents that affect the RAS.

Telmisartan

The ONTARGET trial enrolled 25,620 patients > 55 years old with atherosclerotic disease or diabetes with end-organ damage, randomized them to telmisartan only, ramipril only, or the combination, and followed them for a median of 56 months. Patients receiving the combination of telmisartan and ramipril did not obtain any benefit in the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke and heart failure hospitalization compared to monotherapy, but experienced an increased incidence of clinically important renal dysfunction (death, doubling of serum creatinine, or dialysis) compared with groups receiving telmisartan alone or ramipril alone. Concomitant use of telmisartan and ramipril is not recommended.

Aliskiren

Do not co-administer aliskiren with ALTACE in patients with diabetes. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with ALTACE in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2).

### Renal protection in diabetes: lessons from ONTARGET [^116vD1VU]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2010). Low credibility.

Hypertension is an important independent risk factor for renal disease. If hypertension and chronic renal disease co-exist, as is common in patients with diabetes mellitus, the risk of cardiovascular disease is heightened. The importance of rigorous blood pressure control is recognized in current guidelines, with a recommended target of office blood pressure of < 130/80 mmHg; although ambulatory blood pressure may be more appropriate in order to identify the 24-hour hypertensive burden. Even lower blood pressure may further reduce the progression of chronic kidney disease, but the incidence of cardiovascular events may increase. Albuminuria not only indicates renal damage, but is also a powerful predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality at least in patients with high cardiovascular risk and potentially pre-existing vascular damage. Management of the multiple factors for renal and cardiovascular disease is mandatory in the diabetic patient. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a pivotal role in the progression of renal disease, as well as in hypertension and target-organ damage. The use of agents that target the RAS confer renoprotection in addition to antihypertensive activity. There is extensive evidence of the renoprotective effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and specifically telmisartan. In addition to providing 24-hour blood pressure control, clinical studies in patients with diabetes show that telmisartan improves renal endothelial function, prevents progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria, slows the decline in glomerular filtration rate and reduces proteinuria in overt nephropathy. These effects cannot be solely attributed to blood pressure control. In contrast to other members of the ARB class, the renoprotective effect of telmisartan is not confined to the management of diabetic nephropathy; slowing the progression of albuminuria has been demonstrated in the ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET ®), which included diabetic and non-diabetic patients at high risk of cardiovascular events.

### Telmisartan [^115huc75]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a controlled study, the addition of telmisartan to hydrochlorothiazide produced an additional dose-related reduction in blood pressure that was similar in magnitude to the reduction achieved with telmisartan monotherapy. Hydrochlorothiazide also had an added blood pressure effect when added to telmisartan.

The onset of antihypertensive activity occurs within 3 hours after administration of a single oral dose. At doses of 20, 40, and 80 mg, the antihypertensive effect of once daily administration of telmisartan is maintained for the full 24-hour dose interval. With automated ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and conventional blood pressure measurements, the 24-hour trough-to peak ratio for 40 to 80 mg doses of telmisartan was 70% to 100% for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The incidence of symptomatic orthostasis after the first dose in all controlled trials was low (0.04%).

There were no changes in the heart rate of patients treated with telmisartan in controlled trials.

There are no trials of telmisartan demonstrating reductions in cardiovascular risk in patients with hypertension, but at least one pharmacologically similar drug has demonstrated such benefits.

### The effect of combination treatment with aliskiren and blockers of the renin-angiotensin system on hyperkalaemia and acute kidney injury: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113c4geG]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We used a strategy developed with a health informatics specialist (see web extra on bmj.com) to search Ovid Medline (1948 to 7 May 2011), Embase (1980 to 7 May 2011), and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials (1993 to 7 May 2011). No language restrictions were applied and we reviewed the bibliographies of identified articles to locate further eligible studies. In addition we searched the Clinical trials registry, the Novartis clinical trial results database, and abstracts of the past five years from conferences of the American Society of Nephrology and the European Renal Association for ongoing or completed trials.

Study selection and validity assessment

We included all randomised controlled clinical trials of at least four weeks' duration involving aliskiren in combination with either ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers that provided data on the incidence of hyperkalaemia or acute kidney injury relative to monotherapy with aliskiren, an ACE inhibitor, or an angiotensin receptor blocker. Where necessary we contacted corresponding authors for additional missing data. For crossover studies, we used only the first phase.

All dosing regimens of aliskiren, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers were considered, and all ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers used in clinical practice were eligible for inclusion. For the purpose of the analyses we considered ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers together as one class.

We excluded drug combinations with agents other than ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers — for example, combined telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide. Studies that enrolled patients who were receiving chronic dialysis and studies published only as abstracts were excluded. We also excluded one study with missing information that could not be obtained from the authors. Where more than one publication of a trial existed or when a retrospective subgroup analysis was published we used the most complete publication. Studies for which risk of bias could not be determined in any of the domains of our assessment were excluded. We also excluded observational studies, case series, letters, commentaries, reviews, and editorials.

Two authors (ZH and CG) scanned titles and abstracts for initial selection. Selected articles were reviewed in full and independently assessed for eligibility by the same two reviewers. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

### Re-examining RAS-blocking treatment regimens for abrogating progression of chronic kidney disease [^1176tKsS]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2009). Medium credibility.

This commentary discusses the findings and profound clinical implications of a prespecified analysis of renal outcomes performed by Mann et al. in the large ONTARGET study. This study assessed the effects of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril and the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) telmisartan, separately and in combination, in patients aged at least 55 years who had established vascular disease or diabetes with organ damage. Mann et al. demonstrated that, in contrast to monotherapy with either drug, the combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB worsens all major renal outcomes with the exception of proteinuria. This commentary recommends that combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and an ARB to retard progression of renal disease should be avoided in patients with proteinuria lower than 1 g per day. The utility of dual RAS blockade regimens comprising an ACE inhibitor and a direct renin inhibitor, or an ACE inhibitor or ARB plus an aldosterone blocker, remains to be determined and constitutes a high priority subject for future clinical investigation.

### Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^114Knp36]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the classes to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

In a controlled study, the addition of telmisartan to hydrochlorothiazide produced an additional dose-related reduction in blood pressure that was similar in magnitude to the reduction achieved with telmisartan monotherapy. Hydrochlorothiazide also had an added blood pressure effect when added to telmisartan.

The onset of antihypertensive activity occurs within 3 hours after administration of a single oral dose. At doses of 20, 40, and 80 mg, the antihypertensive effect of once daily administration of telmisartan is maintained for the full 24-hour dose interval. With automated ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and conventional blood pressure measurements, the 24-hour trough-to-peak ratio for 40 to 80 mg doses of telmisartan was 70% to 100% for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The incidence of symptomatic orthostasis after the first dose in all controlled trials was low (0.04%).

There were no changes in the heart rate of patients treated with telmisartan in controlled trials.

There are no trials of MICARDIS demonstrating reductions in cardiovascular risk in patients with hypertension, but at least one pharmacologically similar drug has demonstrated such benefits.

### Angiotensin receptor blockers versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: where do we stand now? [^113CvTMe]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease represents a continuum that starts with risk factors, such as hypertension, and progresses to atherosclerosis, target organ damage, and ultimately leads to heart failure or stroke. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has been shown to be beneficial at all stages of this continuum. Both classes of agent can prevent or reverse endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis, thereby potentially reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. Such a reduction has been shown with ACE inhibitors in patients with coronary artery disease, but no such data are currently available for ARBs. Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to reduce damage in target organs, such as the heart and kidney, and to decrease cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with congestive heart failure. Trials, such as the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) and the Telmisartan Randomised Assessment Study in ACE-Intolerant Subjects with Cardiovascular Disease (TRANSCEND), that compare telmisartan, ramipril, and their combination in high-risk patients with vascular end-organ damage, should provide important new insights into the benefits of intervention with RAS blockade along the cardiorenovascular continuum.

### Effects of salt supplementation on the albuminuric response to telmisartan with or without hydrochlorothiazide therapy in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes are modulated by habitual dietary salt intake [^113WLET1]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Study protocol

The study was performed in six phases.

Phase 1, washout (−6 to 0 weeks).

There was no change in drug therapy if sitting blood pressure was < 160/95 mmHg. Drugs known to affect the RAAS were replaced with combinations of verapamil, prazosin, methyldopa, or hydralazine at week −6. Titration to achieve blood pressure < 160/95 mmHg was performed between weeks −6 and −3, and this regimen was continued until the completion of the trial.

Phase 2, telmisartan, and phase 3, telmisartan plus HCT (0–8 weeks).

All patients commenced 40 mg daily telmisartan for 4 weeks followed by 40 mg telmisartan plus 12.5 mg HCT daily for 4 weeks. HDS and LDS groups received NaCl or placebo capsules, in addition to their usual diet and any of the non-RAAS antihypertensive agents started in phase 2, during the last 2 weeks of telmisartan monotherapy and during last 2 weeks of combined telmisartan and HCT therapy.

Phase 4, second washout (8–14 weeks).

As in phase 1, patients remained on the background non-RAAS blocking antihypertensive agents.

Phases 5 and 6 (14–22 weeks).

Phases 2 and 3 were repeated with placebo and NaCl capsules in reverse order.

A total of 100 mmol/day of NaCl supplements were administered daily in five capsules. Identical placebo capsules contained lactose. Patients were instructed to take two capsules with breakfast, one with lunch, and two with their evening meal. The 24-h urinary AER and sodium excretion, fasting plasma glucose, electrolytes, A1C, and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure were measured at 0, 4, 8, 14, 18, and 22 weeks. In each patient, urinary sodium excretion was corrected for completeness of collection by adjusting for average creatinine excretion in six urine samples.

All blood samples were taken between 0800 h and 1000 h in the morning after an overnight fast and before the administration of study medication. Albumin concentration was measured by a turbidimetric SYNCHRON System. The interassay coefficient of variation was 3.4% for a sample concentration of 112 mg/l. Ambulatory blood pressure was measured with a portable recording machine (Spacelabs 90207; Spacelabs Medical Products, Deerfield, WI) based on an oscillometric method.

### The sudden demise of dual renin-angiotensin system blockade or the soft science of the surrogate end point [^113mFbhD]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Physicians have embraced the concept of dual renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade hoping that it would translate into better blood pressure control as well as incremental nephroprotective and cardioprotective effects. With regard to blood pressure, a small additional fall with dual RAS blockade was observed when compared with that seen in monotherapy. Numerous studies have shown a reduction of albuminuria with dual RAS blockade. However, the recent findings in the ONTARGET (Renal Outcomes With Telmisartan, Ramipril, or Both, in People at High Vascular Risk) study of significantly more doubling of the creatinine and dialysis in the combination arm despite lesser albuminuria emphasized the fallacy of surrogate end points and argue against nephroprotective effects of dual RAS blockade. In heart failure, dual RAS blockade was associated with more hypotension, worsening of renal function, and hyperkalemia than was angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy alone. In conclusion, recent outcome and safety data have shattered the halo of dual RAS blockade for hypertension, nephroprotection, and heart failure. Unless data emerge to the contrary, dual RAS blockade should no longer be used in clinical practice.

### Studying telmisartan plasma exposure, kidney distribution, receptor occupancy, and response in patients with type 2 diabetes using [C] telmisartan [^116KRW7j]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

During both PET scans, arterial samples were collected and the activity concentration was measured to obtain the [11 C]Telmisartan arterial input function. Via an arterial line placed in the radial artery, blood was sampled continuously during the first 30 minutes of both PET scans using an online blood sampler and seven manual whole blood and plasma samples were collected during the course of the PET scans.

From the start of oral telmisartan administration, 10 venous blood samples were taken at t = predose, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, and 150 minutes and stored at −20°C until shipment for analysis of plasma telmisartan concentrations using a validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy method (Nuvisan, Neu‐Ulm, Germany).

Telmisartan production and dosing

The synthesis and labeling of [11 C]Telmisartan was performed as described previouslyunder Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions. In short, the precursor N‐desmethyl telmisartan (Symeres, Groningen, The Netherlands) was radiolabeled with [11 C]Methyl iodide (Department of Nuclear Medicine, UMCG) to yield [11 C]Telmisartan. The radiochemical purity of [11 C]Telmisartan was 99.4% (range: 97.6–100%, n = 10). The mean administered dose for the baseline PET scan was 385 MBq (range: 292–429 MBq), with a molar activity of 43,289 GBq/mmol (range: 37,994–47,713 GBq/mmol), and for the postdrug PET scan 308 MBq (range: 196–400 MBq), with a molar activity of 44015.8 GBq/mmol (range: 41,449–48,573 GBq/mmol). The [11 C]Telmisartan is the isotopologue of the extensively characterized ARB telmisartan and thus shares its toxicological as well as pharmacological characteristics, enabling its immediate use in patients.

### Cardiovascular and renal outcomes with telmisartan, ramipril, or both in people at high renal risk: results from the ONTARGET and TRANSCEND studies [^1118BgYf]. Circulation (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination With Ramipril Global End Point Trial (ONTARGET), dual therapy did not reduce cardiovascular or renal outcomes compared with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers alone. Previous controlled trials with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers have demonstrated greater cardiovascular and renal benefit in people with renal risk. We hypothesized that dual therapy would be more effective than monotherapy in patients with low glomerular filtration rate and elevated albuminuria.

Methods and Results

Post hoc analysis was performed of renal subgroups of dual therapy versus monotherapy for the ONTARGET study and angiotensin receptor blocker versus placebo for the Telmisartan Randomized Assessment Study in ACE Intolerant Subjects With Cardiovascular Disease (TRANSCEND). The studies featured hazard ratios by subgroups and Cox regression models with factors for treatment, subgroup, and interactions. The main cardiovascular outcome was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure, and the main renal outcome was the composite of chronic dialysis or doubling of creatinine. In ONTARGET, there was no cardiovascular or renal benefit from dual over monotherapy in any subgroup, even with low glomerular filtration rate and/or elevated albuminuria. In TRANSCEND, in the comparison of angiotensin receptor blocker with placebo, there was a significant interaction for the main renal outcome (P = 0.01) in the direction of harm for patients with normoalbuminuria (0.37 versus 0.16 events per 100 patient-years; hazard ratio, 2.35; confidence interval, 1.33 to 4.15) but a trend to benefit with microalbuminuria (0.52 versus 0.89 events per 100 patient-years; hazard ratio, 0.60; confidence interval, 0.25 to 1.46) and macroalbuminuria (1.57 versus 2.60 events per 100 patient-years; hazard ratio, 0.71; confidence interval, 0.21 to 2.44).

Conclusions

This post hoc analysis does not support dual therapy over monotherapy in high-vascular risk patients with low glomerular filtration rate or albuminuria. This observation is a post hoc comparison and should be interpreted appropriately.

### Diabetes and cardiovascular disease: from evidence to clinical practice-position statement 2014 of Brazilian diabetes society [^1122ErDS]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

- In a meta-analysis comparing various strategies for antihypertensive treatment including 36,917 patients with diabetes, a total of 640 (1.7%) patients received combination ACEI-calcium blocker. The combination of ACEI- Calcium Channel Blocker was shown to have the most significant effect in reducing mortality compared to other combinations.

28 The use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients with micro or macroalbuminuria is recommended. [LEVEL A]

Summary of evidence:

- In diabetic patients with macroalbuminuria the RENAAL study showed efficacy of losartan compared to placebo in reducing renal outcomes as doubling creatinine, end- stage renal disease or death. Likewise, the IDNT study demonstrated superiority of irbesartan compared to amlodipine in the reduction of the same renal endpoints.

- In patients with microalbuminuria the IRMA-2 study showed progressive reduction of albuminuria with increasing doses of irbesartan.

29 It is recommended to AVOID the combination of ACE inhibitors with ARBs due to greater risk of loss of renal function and hyperkalemia. [LEVEL A]

Summary of evidence:

- The ONTARGET study evaluated the effects of adding an ACE inhibitor (ramipril) to an ARB (telmisartan) in 25,620 patients over 55 years, high-risk, including 9,603 with diabetes during 56 months. Participants were randomized into 3 groups: ramipril, telmisartan and a combination of ramipril with telmisartan. The primary renal outcome was a composite of dialysis, doubling of creatinine and death. The primary outcome was worse with the combination ramipril-telmisartan than with each of antihypertensive monotherapy (HR 1.09 95% CI: 1.01–1.18 p = 0.037). Thus, the ACEI-ARB combination since is contra-indicated due to its association with worsening of renal outcomes.

30 In pursuit of the goals of blood pressure, other options of combination of 3 or more drugs may be considered, depending on clinical criteria, including ACEI or ARB with amlodipine, thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, spironolactone, and vasodilators, but with a lower level of evidence. [LEVEL D]

### Prevention of loss of renal function over time in patients with diabetic nephropathy [^114Tsfbh]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Management of hypertension is the mainstay of prevention and treatment of diabetic renal disease; evidence suggests that tight blood pressure control slows renal disease progression in established diabetic nephropathy. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has renoprotective effects over and above those achieved by lowering systemic blood pressure. To date, however, no long-term study using hard end points has directly compared current mechanisms for RAAS inhibition, angiotensin II receptor blockade (ARB) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. This issue was addressed in the recently published Diabetics Exposed to Telmisartan and Enalapril (DETAIL) study, a head-to-head comparison of telmisartan and enalapril in 250 patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus and early-stage nephropathy. After 5 years' treatment, change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the primary efficacy end point, was equivalent in the 2 treatment groups, as were all secondary end points. The expected steep decline in GFR in the first year was followed by a lesser decrease in the second year and then almost complete stabilization of renal function at ≥ 3 years. Over 5 years, no patient went into end-stage renal disease or required dialysis. There were also no increases in albumin excretion rate, nor was there an increase in creatinine beyond 200 mumol/L. Incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality was extremely low in both treatment groups, a remarkable outcome given that almost 50% of patients had evidence of cardiovascular disease at randomization. Inhibition of the RAAS should play a major part in management of patients with type 2 diabetes with nephropathy, for which both telmisartan and enalapril provide long-term renoprotection.

### Telmisartan and amlodipine [^111nCSWh]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

In a controlled study, the addition of telmisartan to hydrochlorothiazide produced an additional dose-related reduction in blood pressure that was similar in magnitude to the reduction achieved with telmisartan monotherapy. Hydrochlorothiazide also had an added blood pressure effect when added to telmisartan.

The onset of antihypertensive activity occurs within 3 hours after administration of a single oral dose. At doses of 20, 40, and 80 mg, the antihypertensive effect of once daily administration of telmisartan is maintained for the full 24-hour dose interval. With automated ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and conventional blood pressure measurements, the 24-hour trough-to-peak ratio for 40 to 80 mg doses of telmisartan was 70% to 100% for both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The incidence of symptomatic orthostasis after the first dose in all controlled trials was low (0.04%).

There were no changes in the heart rate of patients treated with telmisartan in controlled trials.

14.3 Amlodipine

The antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine has been demonstrated in a total of 15 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies involving 800 patients on amlodipine and 538 on placebo. Once daily administration produced statistically significant placebo-corrected reductions in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours post-dose, averaging about 12/6 mmHg in the standing position and 13/7 mmHg in the supine position in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24-hour dosing interval was observed, with little difference in peak and trough effect.

### Studying telmisartan plasma exposure, kidney distribution, receptor occupancy, and response in patients with type 2 diabetes using [C] telmisartan [^117PzFEM]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

The recommended telmisartan dose for the treatment of hypertension is 80 mg, based on optimization of its blood pressure lowering effect. However, telmisartan's renoprotective effect increases after 80 mg twice daily dosing and is considered to be independent of blood pressure control. Thus, the most optimal telmisartan dose for both targets seems to differ. We report a maximum AT‐1 RO of 60% after administration of a 120 mg telmisartan dose. Further improvement of our understanding of the relationship among telmisartan dose, exposure, kidney distribution, RO, and UACR response is needed and confirmatory studies should ascertain whether higher doses may result in higher RO and if this improves the outcome of individual patients with DKD.

To conclude, we showed that the plasma exposure to telmisartan varied largely among individuals and was positively correlated with albuminuria response. We demonstrated a positive correlation between plasma telmisartan exposure and its distribution to the kidneys. The results also suggested a positive relation between plasma exposure and RO, but this needs to be assessed in a larger imaging trial. Together these results indicate a relationship among the interindividual differences in plasma exposure, kidney tissue distribution, RO, and ultimately UACR response after telmisartan administration.

### T / L-type calcium channel blocker reduces the composite ranking of relative risk according to new KDIGO guidelines in patients with chronic kidney disease [^112KygMz]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Methods

We previously conducted a 6-month, single-center, prospective, randomized, open-label clinical trial, designed to compare the effects of benidipine and amlodipine on blood pressure (BP), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and urinary albumin excretion ratio in hypertensive and albuminuric patients with CKD already receiving the maximum recommended dose of ARBs. In the present study, conducted between June 2009 and May 2010, post-hoc analysis was performed to compare the effects of benidipine and amlodipine on changes in the composite ranking of relative risk in the same population according to the 2009 KDIGO guidelines. All study participants provided written informed consent, and the trial protocol was approved by the Research Review Board of Nerima Hikarigaoka Hospital, Nihon University School of Medicine and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

### Studying telmisartan plasma exposure, kidney distribution, receptor occupancy, and response in patients with type 2 diabetes using [C] telmisartan [^116WWJt3]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

The angiotensin receptor blocker telmisartan slows progression of kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), yet many patients remain at high risk for progressive kidney function loss. The underlying mechanisms for this response variation might be attributed to differences in angiotensin-1 receptor occupancy (RO), resulting from individual variation in plasma drug exposure, tissue drug exposure, and receptor availability. Therefore, we first assessed the relationship between plasma telmisartan exposure and urinary-albumin-to-creatinine-ratio (UACR) in 10 patients with T2D and albuminuria (mean age 66years, median UACR 297mg/g) after 4weeks treatment with 80mg telmisartan once daily. Increasing telmisartan exposure associated with a larger reduction in UACR (Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) = -0.64, P = 0.046, median change UACR: -40.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI): -22.9 to -77.4%, mean telmisartan area under the curve (AUC) = 2927.1ng·hour/mL, 95% CI: 723.0 to 6501.6ng·hour/mL). Subsequently, we assessed the relation among plasma telmisartan exposure, kidney distribution, and angiotensin-1 RO in five patients with T2D (mean age 60years, median UACR 72mg/g) in a separate positron emission tomography imaging study with [11 C]Telmisartan. Individual plasma telmisartan exposure correlated with telmisartan distribution to the kidneys (PCC = 0.976, P = 0.024). A meaningful RO could be calculated in three patients receiving 120mg oral telmisartan, and although high exposure seems related to higher RO, with AUC 0-last of 31, 840, and 274ng·hour/mL and corresponding RO values 5.5%, 44%, and 59%, this was not significant (P = 0.64). Together these results indicate, for the first time, a relationship among interindividual differences in plasma exposure, kidney tissue distribution, RO, and ultimately UACR response after telmisartan administration.

### Efficacy and safety of dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system: meta-analysis of randomised trials [^117BNFUB]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

The importance of dual therapy began to change with publication of the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET). Similar to other studies, in this study the surrogate endpoint albuminuria was reduced with dual therapy compared with monotherapy. However, a significant doubling of creatinine level and dialysis in the combination arm (despite less albuminuria) argued against a nephroprotection by dual therapy. More recently, authorsfound several inconsistencies in COOPERATE, eventually leading to retraction of the study by the Lancet.

In heart failure, the safety issue remained a major concern with dual therapy. In the CHARM Added trial, hyperkalaemia was almost five times more common and increased creatinine levels twice as common with dual therapy than with monotherapy. A meta-analysisin over 18 000 patients with left ventricular dysfunction showed a significantly increased risk of adverse events of dual therapy compared with monotherapy, leading to the discontinuation of dual therapy. Given the adverse effects and lack of consistent survival benefits, the addition of an angiotensin receptor blocker to ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with heart failure should perhaps be reserved only for selected patients who continue to have symptoms while receiving monotherapy and cannot tolerate mineralocorticoid antagonists.

### Telmisartan is more effective than losartan in reducing proteinuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy [^117S17ey]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

In patients with diabetic nephropathy, lowering blood pressure and reducing proteinuria by over 30% correlates with a slower progression to kidney failure. We compared two different angiotensin receptor-blockers in a double blind, prospective trial of 860 patients with type 2 diabetes whose blood pressure levels was over 130/80 mmHg or who were receiving antihypertensive medication(s) and who had a morning spot urinary protein to creatinine ratio of 700 or more. Patients were randomized to telmisartan (a highly lipophilic agent with a long half-life) or losartan (with low lipophilicity and short half-life). The primary endpoint was the difference in the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio between the groups at 52 weeks. The geometric coefficient of variation and the mean of the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio fell in both groups at 52 weeks but both were significantly greater for the telmisartan compared to the losartan cohort. Mean systolic blood pressure reductions were not significantly different between groups at trial end. We conclude that telmisartan is superior to losartan in reducing proteinuria in hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy, despite a similar reduction in blood pressure.

### Telmisartan (Micardis) [^114zcdgs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of telmisartan PO (also known as Micardis) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: do not use. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitor neonates for hypotension and oliguria. Monitor for neonatal hyperkalemia. Discontinue telmisartan when pregnancy is detected. Use of RAAS inhibitors during the second and third trimesters can cause reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure, oligohydramnios, fetal lung hypoplasia, and skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension, and death. The drug telmisartan PO (also known as Micardis) is classified under category D in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has caused, is suspected to have caused, or may be expected to cause, an increased incidence of human fetal malformations or irreversible damage.

### Studying telmisartan plasma exposure, kidney distribution, receptor occupancy, and response in patients with type 2 diabetes using [C] telmisartan [^114skgLW]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

In participant 4, the postdrug scan was performed without arterial sampling and therefore the V T for this scan could not be obtained, and thus the kidney tissue distribution and RO of this participant could not be calculated. Kinetic analysis of the baseline scan shows a relatively high v B and large V T. This participant received 80 mg telmisartan and had a moderate plasma exposure with an AUC 0–last of 53.9 ng∙hour/mL.

In participant 5, the V T of the postdrug scan was higher compared the V T of the baseline scan, resulting in a negative RO and was therefore not taken forward in the RO analysis. This participant received the lowest dose telmisartan, 20 mg, and had a very low plasma exposure with an AUC 0–last of 5.12 ng∙hour/mL.

The distribution of telmisartan to the kidneys varied largely among the individuals, ranging from 1.17 to 75.9 ng/minute/mL (Table 3) and increasing kidney distribution was correlated to increasing mean plasma telmisartan exposure (PCC = 0.976; P = 0.024). There was no significant relationship between plasma telmisartan concentrations and RO (PCC = 0.53; P = 0.64).

### Triple pharmacological blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in nondiabetic CKD: an open-label crossover randomized controlled trial [^111u7UtZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Agents inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) system have an important role in slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease. We evaluated the hypothesis that the addition of an aldosterone receptor antagonist to an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin II type 1 (AT-1) receptor blocker (ARB) (triple RAAS blockade) may provide an additional benefit compared with an ACE inhibitor and ARB (double RAAS blockade).

Design

Randomized open controlled crossover study.

Setting & Participants

18 whites (7 women, 11 men) from the Outpatient Department of Nephrology with chronic nondiabetic proteinuric kidney diseases, mean age 42.4 ± 1.9 years (SEM).

Interventions

In the 8-week run-in period, all participants received the ACE inhibitor cilazapril (5 mg), the ARB telmisartan (80 mg), and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) as double RAAS blockade to achieve the target blood pressure of less than 130/80 mm Hg. Participants were then randomly assigned to 2 treatment sequences, either the addition of spironolactone (25 mg) (triple RAAS blockade) through 8 weeks followed by double RAAS blockade through 8 weeks (sequence 1) or double RAAS blockade followed by triple RAAS blockade (sequence 2).

Main Outcome Measures

24-hour urine protein excretion (primary end point) and markers of tubular injury and fibrosis (secondary end points). Analysis was performed using analysis of variance for repeated measurements.

Results

At baseline, mean serum creatinine level was 1.16 ± 0.09 mg/dL (103 ± 8 micromol/L), estimated glomerular filtration rate was 107.8 mL/min (95% confidence interval, 93 to 140.9 [1.8 mL/s; 95% confidence interval, 1.55 to 2.35; Cockcroft-Gault formula), and 24-hour mean proteinuria was 0.97 ± 0.18 g. Mean urine protein excretion was 0.7 g/24 h (95% confidence interval, 0.48 to 0.92) less after triple RAAS blockade than after double RAAS blockade (P = 0.01), without change in blood pressure. Urine excretion of N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (P = 0.02) and amino-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen (P = 0.05) also significantly decreased. Potassium levels increased significantly after triple therapy (P = 0.02). However, no patient was withdrawn because of adverse effects.

Limitations

Absence of blinding, small sample size, short treatment period, absence of histological assessment.

Conclusions

Administration of an aldosterone receptor antagonist in addition to double RAAS blockade with an ACE inhibitor and ARB may slow the progression of chronic kidney disease. Additional studies are necessary to confirm this result.

### Comparison of 26-week efficacy and tolerability of telmisartan and atenolol, in combination with hydrochlorothiazide as required, in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension: a randomized, multicenter study [^113BsUJg]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to compare the efficacy and tolerability of telmisartan, a novel antihypertensive agent, and atenolol, a well-established beta-blocker, in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension.

Methods

This 26-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, titration-to-response study compared doses of telmisartan (40 mg titrated to 80 mg titrated to 120 mg) with atenolol (50 mg titrated to 100 mg) required to achieve diastolic blood pressure (DBP) control (≤ 90 mm Hg or a decrease from baseline of ≥ 10 mm Hg). Open-label hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 or 25 mg was added if needed according to a prespecified titration rule. Men and women aged > 18 years with mild to moderate hypertension (morning mean supine DBP [SDBP] ≥ 95 mm Hg and ≤ 114 mm Hg) were eligible to participate. Patients with significant cardiovascular, metabolic, hepatic, or renal dysfunction or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were excluded. The primary efficacy end point was trough SDBP response at 26 weeks; secondary efficacy end points included changes from baseline at trough in both standing and supine DBP and systolic blood pressure (SBP), and heart rate after 4, 8, 16, and 26 weeks; SBP control (reduction from baseline of ≥ 10 mm Hg); normalization of supine SDBP to ≤ 90 mm Hg; and the need for add-on HCTZ. Changes in quality of life were also examined. Adverse events were obtained from spontaneous reporting and recorded. Serious adverse events were reported to the sponsor according to predefined timelines.

Results

A total of 533 patients from 49 centers participated. Patients' mean age was 57.9 years (range, 22–79 years); 55.9% (298/533) of the population was male and 98.1% (523/533) was white. Of the 533 patients randomly assigned to treatment and included in the safety analysis, 520 (97.6%) were included in the efficacy analysis; 346 received telmisartan and 174 received atenolol. A total of 489 patients (91.7%) completed the study (325 [93.9%], telmisartan; 164 [94.2%], atenolol). Full SDBP response (trough SDBP ≤ 90 mm Hg and/or a reduction from baseline of ≥ 10 mm Hg) was observed in 84% and 78% of telmisartan- and atenolol-treated patients, respectively; this difference was not statistically significant. Final SBP/DBP reductions of 20.9/14.4 mm Hg were observed for the telmisartan regimen versus 16.7/13.3 mm Hg for the atenolol regimen; only the difference in SBP was significant (P = 0.005). Reduction from baseline in SBP of ≥ 10 mm Hg was achieved by 80% of telmisartan-treated and 68% of atenolol-treated patients (P = 0.003). Adverse events were reported by 52.7% of patients given telmisartan and 61.2% of patients given atenolol; this difference was not statistically significant. Most events were mild or moderate. Although fatigue and male impotence were more common in atenolol-treated patients (3.4% and 4.0%, respectively), the incidence of these adverse events was too low to differentiate statistically.

Conclusions

Telmisartan appears to be at least as effective as atenolol in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension and may be better tolerated.

### Management of hypertension and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade in adults with diabetic kidney disease: association of British clinical diabetologists and the renal association UK guideline update 2021 [^114uRuYS]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

The ONTARGET study involved telmisartan and ramipril, and showed that the primary renal outcome (ie dialysis, doubling of serum creatinine and death) was similar for telmisartan (13.4%) and ramipril (13.5%), but was increased with combination therapy (14.5%, p = 0.037). The combination therapy, although associated with reduced albuminuria, caused the greatest decline in eGFR.

The KDIGO guidelines provide specific advice on dual blockade. In the UK, a NICE guideline explicitly states that combination therapy should not be used. The European Renal Best Practice working group has the same viewpoint as NICE. The Canadian Health Education Programme's (CHEP's) 2009 recommendation advised against the use of dual blockade for people with non-proteinuric CKD or in people with diabetes and normal urinary albumin levels.

Overall, therefore, there is no current evidence to suggest a beneficial effect of ACEI/ARB combination on the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Instead, combination therapy resulted in clinically significant decreases in eGFR and hyperkalaemia. In one meta-analysis involving 17,337 people, the adverse effects of dual blockade revealed significantly high rates of discontinuation because of a worsening of renal function, hyperkalaemia and symptomatic hypotension.

It is to be noted, however, that most studies published so far with regard to dual blockade have involved people with normal renal function who did not have a clinically significant rise in serum potassium or creatinine with dual blockade. However, in real life, widespread use of these agents would most likely involve people with resistant hypertension with chronic renal impairment, and such individuals therefore will tend to have more of these side effects.

### Effects of salt supplementation on the albuminuric response to telmisartan with or without hydrochlorothiazide therapy in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes are modulated by habitual dietary salt intake [^114q1C4E]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

NaCl supplementation in HDS and LDS groups

There was no significant difference in the mean AER response (log treatment − log baseline) to telmisartan with or without HCT in patients in HDS or LDS groups in the absence of NaCl supplementation. However, a significant decrease in the AER response was seen with administration of NaCl compared with placebo capsules (P = 0.004). This was mainly accounted for by a statistically significant two-way interaction of NaCl supplementation and habitual diet group (P = 0.02, Table 3, Fig. 1).

In the LDS group, the AER response to telmisartan with or without HCT, expressed as the percentage decrease from baseline, was reduced from 42.3% with placebo to 9.5% with NaCl supplementation, representing a relative reduction of 77.5% of the effects of telmisartan ± HCT (P = 0.02, Fig. 1 B). In contrast, in the HDS group, the percentage reduction in AER from baseline was similar during placebo and NaCl supplementation (30.9 vs. 28.1%, respectively), representing a nonsignificant relative reduction of 9.1% of the effects of telmisartan with or without HCT (P = 0.7, Fig. 1 B).

Telmisartan versus telmisartan plus HCT

Dual therapy with telmisartan and HCT demonstrated an increase in the AER response when compared with telmisartan alone. The percentage reduction in AER from baseline in subjects treated with telmisartan alone was 20.0 vs. 36.0% with telmisartan plus HCT, representing a relative reduction of 44% (P = 0.01, Table 3). The percentage reduction in AER in the LDS group treated with telmisartan without HCT was of similar magnitude to the reduction in AER in HDS plus telmisartan plus HCT (P = 0.39).

### Renal protection in diabetes: lessons from ONTARGET [^114XrKrX]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2010). Low credibility.

Figure 3
Ratio of change in log gmean urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) after 2 years' treatment and final ratio in patients in ONTARGET ® treated with ramipril, telmisartan or telmisartan plus ramipril.

Although the combination of telmisartan plus ramipril provided superior control of albuminuria, the incidence of the primary renal endpoint for ONTARGET ® - a composite of dialysis (either acute or chronic), doubling of serum creatinine and death, which is the same as used in IDNT - was significantly higher for telmisartan plus ramipril versus ramipril alone (HR 1.08 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00, 1.16]). The most frequent endpoint within the composite was all-cause mortality. If one differentiates between patients who underwent acute dialysis (i.e. < 2 months' duration) and chronic dialysis (an indicator of end-stage renal disease), the incidence of chronic dialysis was no different in the telmisartan and the telmisartan plus ramipril groups. Therefore, the driver for the difference in the primary renal endpoint was acute dialysis, which was twice as frequent in the combination of telmisartan and ramipril group compared with the ramipril monotherapy group (HR 2.19 [95% CI 1.13, 4.22], p = 0.024). Kaplan-Meier plots for dialysis reveal that the incidence of dialysis increased in the telmisartan plus ramipril group relative to the other two groups in the first 2 years of the study; subsequently, the differences diminished.

### Studying telmisartan plasma exposure, kidney distribution, receptor occupancy, and response in patients with type 2 diabetes using [C] telmisartan [^113Bgj3A]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

However, in patients with T2D, there are no data on ARB disposition and receptor interaction in the kidneys. Accordingly, it is unknown to what extent interindividual variability in plasma‐ and kidney tissue drug exposure and receptor binding of ARB determine the individual response.

Therefore, our first aim was to assess the relationship between plasma drug exposure and UACR response of the ARB telmisartan in patients with T2D and albuminuria. Our second aim was to assess the relation between plasma telmisartan exposure and angiotensin II type 1 (AT‐1) receptor occupancy (RO) in patients with T2D in a separate clinical positron emission tomography (PET) imaging feasibility study with [11 C]Telmisartan.

### Sacubitril-valsartan in patients requiring hemodialysis [^114GtQkj]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the use of sacubitril-valsartan associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality and hospitalization among individuals requiring hemodialysis for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)?

Findings

In this comparative effectiveness research study of 1434 patient pairs, initiation of sacubitril-valsartan therapy was associated with a statistically significant 18% reduction in all-cause mortality and 14% reduction in all-cause hospitalization.

Meaning

These findings suggest sacubitril-valsartan therapy may benefit individuals with HFrEF requiring hemodialysis.

### Renal protection in diabetes: lessons from ONTARGET [^111BgGUt]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2010). Low credibility.

The decline in estimated GFR in ONTARGET ® has been critically examined. Over 5 years, the loss in estimated GFR was 5.94, 3.96 and 2.66 mL/min in the telmisartan plus ramipril, telmisartan and ramipril groups, respectively. The greatest loss in estimated GFR was observed in the first 6 weeks of therapy and was greatest in the patients treated with telmisartan plus ramipril. High-risk patients with cardiovascular disease are also likely to have intraglomerular vascular disease, and GFR is maintained in these patients because of the effect of angiotensin II. Hence, blockade of the RAS is expected to generate a short-term loss of GFR. The more effective the blockade, the greater the loss in GFR, which can precipitate acute renal failure and the need for short-term dialysis - which may in turn explain the high need for acute dialysis in the combination treatment arm. This decline is likely to be exacerbated if there are challenges to renal autoregulation by virtue of vascular pathology - as was likely in the ONTARGET ® patient population. If the annual loss of estimated GFR recorded in ONTARGET ® is compared with those observed in IDNT, IRbesartan in patients with type 2 diabetes and MicroAlbuminuria (IRMA-2) and RENAAL, the decline in estimated GFR over 5 years was actually quite acceptable with all three treatments, comparing favourably with that observed in a general population aged between 65 and 85 years.

Of important note is the increase in adverse events in the combined telmisartan and ramipril arm of the study with no added benefit. This increased adverse event rate with ARB + ACE inhibitor with no efficacy benefit was also seen in the VALsartan In Acute myocardial iNfarcTion (VALIANT) trial with valsartan and captopril. For this reason, the combination of ARB and ACE inhibitor is not advised.

### ASN kidney health guidance on the outpatient management of patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury [^111GTVjy]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Outpatient AKI-D key practice points — medication management and reconciliation: Evaluate risk/benefit ratio before using medications with nephrotoxic potential with careful consideration of effect on kidney function; adjust dosing of medications cleared by the kidneys and note that when dialysis is tapered, dosing will need to be readjusted; consider early reinitiation of ACEI/ARB in patients with an indication for RAAS inhibition and no concern for hyperkalemia; and conduct medication reconciliation and review at each transition of care to avoid medication-related errors such as omissions, duplications, dosing errors, and/or drug-drug interactions.
