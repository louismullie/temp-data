## Question

A patient who underwent left hemicolectomy for T3N1M0 colon adenocarcinoma 3 years ago now presents with an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level. CT reveals a new 4-cm hypodense lesion in segment 5 of the liver consistent with metastasis. In addition to consideration of systemic chemotherapy, what should be recommended for the patient?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended management, in addition to chemotherapy, for a patient with a metachronous solitary 4 cm colorectal liver metastasis in segment 5 occurring three years after curative-intent left hemicolectomy with an elevated CEA confirming recurrence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming a true oligometastatic state with optimal staging. Then, I should assess technical resectability versus ablation or transplant options. Next, I need to consider the role and timing of perioperative systemic therapy. After that, I should confirm molecular biomarkers to guide systemic choices and surgical planning. Finally, I need to ensure this is coordinated via a multidisciplinary tumor board to finalize sequencing and operative strategy [^112pZNTA].

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and its prognostic implications. A metachronous solitary colorectal liver metastasis generally confers a more favorable biology compared to synchronous disease, which strengthens the case for curative-intent local therapy if staging confirms liver-limited disease and technical resectability, so I need to verify that no extrahepatic sites are present before committing to a local approach [^114jSERR].

> Wait, let me verify the staging plan because standard CT alone can miss extrahepatic disease and underestimate intrahepatic burden. I should order FDG-PET/CT to improve detection of nodal and extranodal metastases when liver-directed therapy is contemplated, and I should add liver-dedicated contrast-enhanced MRI with gadoxetic acid and diffusion-weighted imaging, which in CAMINO changed local treatment plans in roughly a quarter of candidates; Eovist-based hepatobiliary phase imaging further improves detection and characterization of small lesions and lesion–vessel relationships, which will refine resectability assessment and operative mapping [^112mWnzD] [^113yh9FT] [^116z74cX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about local therapy equivalence. Surgical resection remains the treatment of choice for resectable colorectal liver metastases, with the highest chance of cure and long-term survival compared with systemic therapy alone, so if imaging confirms isolated, technically resectable disease, resection should be prioritized; for a solitary 4 cm lesion in segment 5, a limited anatomic or parenchymal-sparing resection is usually feasible with low operative risk when an adequate future liver remnant is preserved, and portal vein embolization strategies exist if hypertrophy is needed, although that is less likely here in a non-cirrhotic setting [^117HWr7J] [^114jSERR] [^1134D1bd].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what about ablation as an alternative? I initially thought the COLLISION trial suggested non-inferiority of thermal ablation to surgery, but I need to correct myself: COLLISION enrolled only patients with lesions ≤ 3 cm, so a 4 cm metastasis falls outside that evidence base and carries higher local recurrence risk with ablation; therefore, ablation would be suboptimal as first-line local therapy for a 4 cm lesion unless resection is contraindicated or not technically feasible [^114rd5T4].

> I should also double-check liver transplantation considerations. Liver transplant is not for resectable disease and, when considered for colorectal liver-only metastases, should be limited to well-selected patients with unresectable liver-only disease in the context of clinical trials; so for a solitary, resectable 4 cm lesion, transplant is not appropriate, and I need to clearly document unresectability before even contemplating that pathway [^112FEizE].

> Next, I should review the perioperative systemic therapy strategy and timing because chemotherapy sequencing affects both oncologic control and surgical planning. NCCN supports systemic therapy in metastatic CRC with options including FOLFOX or CAPOX, and in resectable liver-limited disease many centers aim for approximately six months total perioperative therapy with interim restaging after two to three months to confirm disease control before proceeding to surgery; oxaliplatin-containing backbones are standard in this setting, while I should remember that bevacizumab has not shown benefit in the adjuvant colon cancer setting and requires surgical timing considerations, so I must plan biologics judiciously around the operation [^112pZNTA] [^111hRFit] [^112QMs3k] [^111fnx9S] [^116hgyX4].

> I need to ensure tumor biology is profiled up front because it influences both systemic options and surgical nuance. I should confirm KRAS/NRAS status to determine eligibility for anti-EGFR therapy in left-sided, RAS wild-type disease and to appreciate more aggressive biology when RAS is mutated, which may influence my margin strategy and consideration of anatomic resection; for RAS wild-type tumors, panitumumab or cetuximab improve outcomes in appropriate lines, whereas KRAS G12C mutation opens the possibility of sotorasib plus panitumumab in later-line metastatic settings; concurrently, MSI-H/dMMR status must be checked as it confers eligibility for pembrolizumab in the metastatic setting and can change systemic strategy if discovered preoperatively [^116W5BrD] [^11614Tdh] [^117NKNQ4] [^116ft8FL] [^115Rizsn] [^114msR69].

> Hold on, I should verify that operative candidacy is decided in the right forum. A multidisciplinary liver tumor board discussion is essential to integrate radiology, surgical technique, systemic therapy sequencing, and perioperative risk mitigation, including DVT prophylaxis, neuropathy risk with oxaliplatin, and appropriate timing of any biologics or immunotherapy vis-à-vis surgery and wound healing, so I will explicitly recommend MDT coordination for finalizing the plan and timeline [^112pZNTA].

> Putting this together, my final, integrated recommendation — beyond systemic chemotherapy — is to complete high-quality restaging with FDG-PET/CT and gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI to confirm isolated, technically resectable disease; proceed with curative-intent hepatic resection of the segment 5 metastasis if resectability is affirmed and future liver remnant is adequate; administer approximately six months total perioperative oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy with interval reassessment prior to surgery; perform molecular profiling for RAS and MSI/MMR to guide systemic therapy and intraoperative strategy; and manage all steps through a multidisciplinary liver tumor board, reserving ablation for cases where resection is not feasible and restricting transplant to unresectable, liver-only disease within trials [^112mWnzD] [^113yh9FT] [^116z74cX] [^117HWr7J] [^114jSERR] [^114rd5T4] [^112FEizE] [^112pZNTA] [^111hRFit] [^112QMs3k] [^116W5BrD] [^11614Tdh] [^117NKNQ4] [^115Rizsn].

For a solitary 4-cm segment 5 liver metastasis from colon cancer, **liver resection is the preferred curative option** [^114jSERR] if the patient is fit and the lesion is resectable with adequate future liver remnant [^117HWr7J]. If resection is not feasible, **thermal ablation is an alternative** for lesions ≤ 3 cm or in challenging locations [^114rd5T4] [^1158ZWpr]. Preoperative MRI [^113yh9FT] and PET/CT [^112mWnzD] are recommended to confirm resectability and exclude extrahepatic disease. A multidisciplinary team [^114jSERR] should guide management, and postoperative surveillance with CT or MRI and CEA every 3–6 months is essential.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A comprehensive diagnostic workup is **essential** to confirm the diagnosis, assess resectability, and rule out extrahepatic disease.

- **MRI**: Perform liver MRI with gadoxetic acid and diffusion-weighted imaging to improve detection and characterization of liver metastases, as MRI can change management in ~1 in 4 patients [^113yh9FT].

- **PET/CT**: Use PET/CT to detect occult extrahepatic disease and guide curative-intent therapy [^112mWnzD].

- **Multidisciplinary team**: Engage hepatobiliary surgery, medical oncology, radiology, and pathology to optimize treatment planning [^114jSERR].

---

## Surgical resection

Surgical resection is the **standard of care** for solitary, resectable colorectal liver metastases and offers the best chance of long-term survival and potential cure [^117HWr7J].

- **Resection criteria**: Single metastasis, adequate future liver remnant, and no extrahepatic disease [^114jSERR].

- **Outcomes**: Five-year overall survival after resection can reach 40–60% [^1158ZWpr].

- **Approach**: Minimally invasive resection is preferred when feasible, especially for anterolateral and superficial lesions [^111JSy7P].

---

## Local ablative therapies

If surgical resection is not feasible because of patient comorbidities, tumor location, or insufficient liver remnant, local ablative therapies are **effective alternatives** [^116W5BrD].

- **Thermal ablation**: Radiofrequency or microwave ablation is effective for lesions ≤ 3 cm [^114rd5T4] or in challenging locations [^116W5BrD].

- **SBRT**: Consider stereotactic body radiotherapy for lesions unsuitable for thermal ablation [^1158ZWpr].

- **Intra-arterial therapies**: Use hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy or selective internal radiation therapy for unresectable or non-ablatable disease [^114jSERR].

---

## Systemic chemotherapy

Systemic chemotherapy is **recommended** in conjunction with surgical resection or local ablative therapies to improve outcomes [^112pZNTA]. Perioperative chemotherapy with FOLFOX or CAPOX can **reduce recurrence and improve survival** [^113wDibq]. Targeted therapies should also be considered, including **anti-EGFR agents (cetuximab, panitumumab)** for RAS wild-type tumors and **bevacizumab** for RAS-mutant tumors [^117NKNQ4] [^11614Tdh] [^116hgyX4].

---

## Surveillance and follow-up

Post-treatment surveillance is **critical** for early detection of recurrence. Imaging should include **CT or MRI** every 3–6 months for the first 2 years, then every 6–12 months thereafter, and **CEA monitoring** should involve regular measurements to detect biochemical recurrence.

---

## Prognostic factors

Several factors **influence prognosis and guide treatment selection**. Tumor biology is important, with RAS mutations associated with poorer outcomes and potentially influencing surgical strategy [^114jSERR] [^113wiKHJ]. Patient performance status, comorbidities, and liver function are critical in treatment selection. Tumor size, location, and number of metastases influence resectability and treatment choice.

## Summary of recommendations

| **Treatment option** | **Indication** | **Outcome** |
|-|-|-|
| Surgical resection | - Solitary <br/> - Resectable metastasis | 5-year OS 40–60% |
| Thermal ablation | Lesions ≤ 3 cm or challenging location | Effective local control |
| SBRT | Lesions unsuitable for thermal ablation | Effective local control |
| Systemic chemotherapy | Perioperative or unresectable disease | Improved survival |
| Surveillance | Post-treatment follow-up | Early detection of recurrence |

---

Liver resection is the **preferred curative option** for a solitary 4-cm segment 5 liver metastasis from colon cancer. If resection is not feasible, thermal ablation or SBRT are effective alternatives. Systemic chemotherapy should be considered in conjunction with local therapies, and regular surveillance is essential for early detection of recurrence [^114jSERR].

Over 75% of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients present with the disease limited to the bowel or regional pericolic or mesenteric lymph nodes at the initial diagnosis. Typically, treatment in the early stages involves surgical removal with curative intent. A subset of patients (Union for International Cancer Control: UICC stage III) receive adjuvant chemotherapy. The spread to locoregional lymph nodes serves as an important prognostic factor, with five-year survival rates of 80% in UICC stage II and 45–50% in UICC stage III. Accurate preoperative staging is crucial for assessing prognosis and establishing an appropriate, potentially curative therapy regimen.

Imaging techniques such as endoscopic ultrasound and MRI are preferred for locoregional staging. The standard for staging and monitoring recurrence in CRC patients generally relies on conventional imaging techniques, such as contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. However, CT generally has a high false-negative rate for extrahepatic intra-abdominal lesions, such as paraaortic lymph nodes, and a high false-positive rate for pulmonary lesions. [18 F]FDG-PET/CT provides additional functional information on tumor glucose metabolism, leading to higher diagnostic accuracy for initial staging, detection of nodal and extranodal metastases, therapy monitoring, and assessment of recurrence.

According to evidence-based guidelines for CRC, CT is considered the imaging first-choice procedure. However, the guidelines also recommend that in cases where liver-directed treatment or surgery is being considered…

### Thermal ablation versus surgical resection of small-size colorectal liver metastases (COLLISION): An international, randomised, controlled, phase 3 non-inferiority trial [^114rd5T4]. The Lancet Oncology (2025). High credibility.

For patients with small-size colorectal liver metastases, growing evidence suggests that thermal ablation is associated with fewer adverse events and faster recovery than resection. It also challenges resection in terms of local control and overall survival. This study assessed the potential non-inferiority of thermal ablation compared with surgical resection in patients with small-size resectable colorectal liver metastases.

- **Methods**: Adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) from 14 centres in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Italy with ten or fewer small-size (≤ 3 cm) colorectal liver metastases, no extrahepatic metastases, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–2, were stratified per centre and according to their disease burden into low, intermediate, and high disease burden subgroups. They were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either thermal ablation (experimental group) or surgical resection (control group) of all target colorectal liver metastases using the web-based module Castor electronic data capture with variable block sizes of 4, 6, and 8. Although at the operator's discretion, a minimally invasive approach in both treatment groups was recommended. The primary endpoint was overall survival, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. A hazard ratio (HR) of 1.30 was considered the upper limit of non-inferiority for the primary endpoint. A preplanned interim analysis with predefined stopping rules for futility (conditional power to prove the null hypothesis 90%, superior safety outcomes) was used.

### MRI in addition to CT in patients scheduled for local therapy of colorectal liver metastases (CAMINO): An international, multicentre, prospective, diagnostic accuracy trial [^113yh9FT]. The Lancet Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Guidelines are inconclusive on whether contrast-enhanced MRI using gadoxetic acid and diffusion-weighted imaging should be added routinely to CT in the investigation of patients with colorectal liver metastases who are scheduled for curative liver resection or thermal ablation, or both. Although contrast-enhanced MRI is reportedly superior to contrast-enhanced CT in the detection and characterization of colorectal liver metastases, its effect on clinical patient management is unknown. We aimed to assess the clinical effect of an additional liver contrast-enhanced MRI on the local treatment plan in patients with colorectal liver metastases amenable to local treatment, based on contrast-enhanced CT.

- **Methods**: We conducted an international, multicentre, prospective, incremental diagnostic accuracy trial in 14 liver surgery centres in the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, and Italy. Participants were aged 18 years or older with histological proof of colorectal cancer, a WHO performance status score of 0–4, and primary or recurrent colorectal liver metastases, who were scheduled for local therapy based on contrast-enhanced CT. All patients had contrast-enhanced CT and liver contrast-enhanced MRI, including diffusion-weighted imaging and gadoxetic acid as a contrast agent, before undergoing local therapy. The primary outcome was the change in the local clinical treatment plan (decided by the individual clinics) based on liver contrast-enhanced MRI findings, analyzed in the intention-to-image population.

### Liver transplantation for colorectal cancer with liver metastases [^117HWr7J]. The Oncologist (2025). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) encompasses epithelial malignancies of the large intestine. In 2023, there were an estimated 152,810 new cases of CRC in the United States (USA), with 53,010 CRC-related deaths. This accounted for 7.6% of all new cancer diagnoses and 8.7% of cancer-related deaths, respectively. The most recent data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program reports a 5-year relative survival rate of 65.0% across all stages of CRC. At diagnosis, nearly a quarter of patients (23%) have disease spread beyond the primary site and regional lymph nodes. While 5-year survival rates for localized and regional disease are both upward of 70%, the 5-year survival rate for distant metastases remains poor, with just 15.7% of patients alive at 5 years.

An estimated 60% of patients with metastatic CRC have metastatic deposits in the liver. Guidelines state that hepatic resection is the treatment of choice for resectable CRLM, based on improvements in survival outcomes compared with chemotherapy alone. Recent studies have shown similar survival outcomes with thermal ablation of small liver metastases compared with metastasectomy. Staged liver resection, portal vein embolization, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), chemo-embolization, and yttrium-90 radioembolization are other liver-directed therapies that can be considered alone or in conjunction with limited liver metastasectomy for CRLM that cannot be safely resected. Of note, when tumor debulking was added to palliative chemotherapy for metastatic CRC, there was no survival benefit.

### Keytruda [^114msR69]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Keytruda is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) solid tumors, as determined by an FDA-approved test, that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

- **Microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancer**: Keytruda is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic MSI-H or dMMR colorectal cancer (CRC) as determined by an FDA-approved test [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

- **Gastric cancer**: Keytruda, in combination with trastuzumab, fluoropyrimidine-, and platinum-containing chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adults with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS ≥ 1) as determined by an FDA-approved test [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Additionally, Keytruda, in combination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adults with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-negative gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma.

- **Esophageal cancer**: Keytruda is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic esophageal or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) tumors with an epicenter measuring 1 to 5 centimeters.

### Advancements in the management of synchronous colorectal liver metastases: A comprehensive review of surgical, systemic, and local treatment modalities [^116W5BrD]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). High credibility.

Tumor biology stands out as one of the most crucial factors in predicting the likelihood of recurrence and long-term survival. Prognostic tools have been developed using clinicopathological characteristics to assess the risk of recurrence following resection. Although none of these scoring systems can predict disease-free survival, high-risk patients can be considered for an initial course of chemotherapy. This approach serves as a strategy to assess the tumor's biological behavior, thus identifying patients who might experience rapid tumor progression and preventing them from undergoing unnecessary surgical interventions.

RAS mutations signify a more aggressive tumor nature and have been linked to a higher likelihood of positive surgical margins and poorer survival outcomes following CRLMs resection. Therefore, patients with RAS-mutated CRLMs may benefit from considering anatomic resection (instead of parenchymal-sparing resection) and/or a broader surgical margin (> 1 cm) to optimize their surgical approach. However, Rhaiem's data do not support this view, finding similar local recurrence rates after both anatomic and non-anatomic resections, regardless of KRAS status. The debate on resection margins for CRLM continues, but it is clear that tumor biology, rather than surgical technique and margin width, guides overall decision-making and treatment selection.

Portohepatic lymph node metastases associated with CRLMs are no longer considered an absolute contraindication to surgery. Furthermore, the presence of extrahepatic disease is no longer considered an absolute contraindication.

### Gastroenterology/hepatology: What you may have missed in 2024 [^111NfreB]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

This article highlights selected major advances in gastroenterology and hepatology from 2024 that are relevant for internal medicine specialists. In colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, new developments include a head-to-head comparison of different fecal immunochemical tests and a new blood-based DNA screening test, benefits and harms of artificial intelligence-assisted colonoscopy, and adenoma detection rate improvement and risk for cancer.

Treatment options for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease now include resmetirom, a recently approved drug for treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe fibrosis. Liver transplantation may now be an option in patients with unresectable colorectal liver metastases. Also featured are new data on the efficacy of indomethacin and pancreatic stent placement for the prevention of pancreatitis after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.

Additionally, there is news on the efficacy and safety of zastaprazan, a new potassium-competitive acid blocker for reflux esophagitis. Finally, a recent randomized trial is highlighted that has dispelled concerns about potential harms of proton-pump inhibitors for stress ulcer prophylaxis in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation.

### Lonsurf [^114FxcZH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of LONSURF was evaluated in RECOURSE (NCT01607957), an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Key eligibility criteria included prior treatment with at least 2 lines of standard chemotherapy for metastatic CRC, an ECOG performance status (PS) of 0–1, absence of brain metastasis, and absence of ascites requiring drainage in the past four weeks.

Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive LONSURF 35 mg/m² or a matching placebo orally twice daily after meals on Days 1–5 and 8–12 of each 28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by KRAS status (wild-type vs. mutant), time since diagnosis of the first metastasis (< 18 months vs. ≥ 18 months), and region (Japan vs. US, Europe, and Australia).

The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS), and an additional efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS). A total of 800 patients were randomized to LONSURF (N = 534) with best supportive care (BSC) or matching placebo (N = 266) plus BSC. The median age was 63 years, 61% were male, 58% were White, and 35% were Asian. All patients had a baseline ECOG PS of 0 or 1. The primary site of disease was colon (62%) or rectum (38%), and KRAS status was wild-type (49%) or mutant (51%) at study entry. All patients received prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based therapies.

### Oxaliplatin [^112QMs3k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of oxaliplatin in combination with fluorouracil (FU) and leucovorin (LV) was evaluated in an international, multicenter, randomized (1:1) trial. This was part of the Multicenter International Study of Oxaliplatin/5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin in the Adjuvant Treatment of Colon Cancer (MOSAIC, NCT00275210), conducted in patients with stage II (Dukes' B2) or III (Dukes' C) colon cancer who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor. Patients were randomized to receive oxaliplatin with fluorouracil/leucovorin or fluorouracil/leucovorin alone for a total of 6 months (i.e. 12 cycles).

Eligible patients were between 18 and 75 years of age, had histologically proven stage II (T3 to T4N0 M0; Dukes' B2) or III (any T N1–2M0; Dukes' C) colon carcinoma, with the inferior pole of the tumor above the peritoneal reflection (i.e.g.reater than or equal to 15 cm from the anal margin). They had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor within 7 weeks prior to randomization without gross or microscopic evidence of residual disease and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) less than 10 ng/mL. Additional eligibility criteria included no prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, 1, or 2 (Karnofsky Performance Status greater than or equal to 60%); no pre-existing neuropathy; and an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 × 10^9/L and platelets greater than or equal to 100 × 10^9/L.

### Keytruda [^117EEgL3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Among the 158 treated patients, the baseline characteristics were as follows: the median age was 60 years (range: 24 to 87 years); 71% were male; 86% were White, 8% Asian, and 3% Black; less than 1% were Hispanic or Latino. A total of 22% and 78% of patients had a baseline KPS of 70 to 80 and 90 to 100, respectively. The histologic subtypes were 59% papillary, 18% chromophobe, 4% translocation, less than 1% medullary, 13% unclassified, and 6% other. Patient distribution by IMDC risk categories was 35% favorable, 54% intermediate, and 10% poor. Common sites of metastases in patients were lymph node (65%), lung (35%), bone (30%), and liver (21%).

The major efficacy outcome measure was ORR as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1. Additional efficacy outcome measures included DOR as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 95.

- **Adjuvant treatment of RCC (KEYNOTE-564)**: The efficacy of Keytruda was investigated as adjuvant therapy for RCC in KEYNOTE-564 (NCT03142334). This was a multicenter, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 994 patients with intermediate-high or high risk of recurrence of RCC, or M1 no evidence of disease (NED).

	- The intermediate-high risk category included: pT2 with Grade 4 or sarcomatoid features; pT3, any Grade without nodal involvement (N0) or distant metastases (M0).
	- The high risk category included: pT4, any Grade N0 and M0; any pT, any Grade with nodal involvement and M0.
	- The M1 NED category included patients with metastatic disease who had undergone complete resection of primary and metastatic lesions.

Patients must have undergone a partial nephroprotective or radical.

### Sutent [^114S7EdQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The baseline malignancy and prior treatment history of the patients were comparable between Studies 4 and 5. Across the two studies, 95% of the pooled population of patients had at least some component of clear-cell histology. All patients in Study 4 were required to have a histological clear-cell component. Most patients enrolled in the studies (97% of the pooled population) had undergone nephrectomy; prior nephrectomy was required for patients enrolled in Study 4. All patients had received one previous cytokine regimen. Metastatic disease present at the time of study entry included lung metastases in 81% of patients. Liver metastases were more common in Study 4 (27% versus 16% in Study 5) and bone metastases were more common in Study 5 (51% versus 25% in Study 4); 52% of patients in the pooled population had at least three metastatic sites. Patients with known brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease were excluded from both studies.

- **Overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DR)**: The ORR and DR data from Studies 4 and 5 are provided in Table 12. There were 36 partial responses (PRs) in Study 4 as assessed by a core radiology laboratory for an ORR of 34.0% (95% CI: 25.0%, 43.8%). There were 23 PRs in Study 5 as assessed by the investigators for an ORR of 36.5% (95% CI: 24.7%, 49.6%). The majority (> 90%) of objective disease responses were observed during the first four cycles; the latest reported response was observed in Cycle 10. DR data from Study 4 is premature as only 9 of 36 patients (25%) responding to treatment had experienced disease progression or died at the time of the data cutoff.

### Ixempra [^116KhouV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Dosage modifications in patients with hepatic impairment**: When using Ixempra in combination therapy with capecitabine, it is contraindicated in patients who have AST or ALT levels greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or bilirubin levels greater than 1 times ULN [see Contraindications (4)]. For single-agent use, reduce the dose of Ixempra for patients with hepatic impairment as recommended in Table 2 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

- **Dosage modification for drug interactions**:
	- **Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors**: Avoid the concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. If coadministration cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of Ixempra to 20 mg/m². Once the strong inhibitor is discontinued, increase the Ixempra dose (one week after discontinuing the inhibitor) to the level used before the introduction of the strong inhibitor [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

	- **Strong CYP3A4 inducers**: Avoid the concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers. If coadministration cannot be avoided, gradually increase the dose from 40 mg/m² to 60 mg/m² as tolerated, once the patient has been maintained on a strong CYP3A4 inducer. Administer Ixempra as a 4-hour intravenous infusion and monitor patients carefully for adverse reactions. If the strong inducer is discontinued, reduce the Ixempra dose to the level used before the introduction of the strong CYP3A4 inducer [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Long-term outcomes following the resection of screen-detected right-sided colon cancer [^1171LZjo]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: We undertook a prospective observational cohort study of patients undergoing right-sided colectomy for colon cancer from January 2010 to December 2020 in a tertiary care unit, reported according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. The population of the region was approximately 420,000 people. Data usage approval was granted by our institutional review board, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

	- All patients aged over 18 years undergoing right-sided resection for colorectal cancer were identified from institutional electronic records. Patients where the procedure was not performed for curative intent were excluded (n = 92).

- **Data variables**: Background patient characteristics were recorded as follows: demographics, comorbidities, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, metabolic equivalents score, smoking history, body mass index, colon cancer symptoms presentation, and referral pathway. The type of right-sided colonic resection (e.g. right hemicolectomy, extended right hemicolectomy) was performed at the discretion of the surgeon and based on the clinical suspicion and local invasion of the tumor. The surgical approach (laparoscopic vs. open), the need for conversion, the urgency of the procedure, and the need for a stoma were documented.

	- Histopathological data were extracted from postoperative pathology reports, and malignant tumors were included. The histological type of cancer (e.g. mucinous adenocarcinoma) was noted, as well as differentiation.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults [^114C4ewV]. Gut (2024). High credibility.

Surgery is the mainstay of potentially curative treatment for HCC. Surgical resection and liver transplantation achieve the best results in appropriately selected candidates (5-year survival 60% and higher).

- **Surgical resection**: Surgical resection is the preferred treatment for HCC occurring in a non-cirrhotic liver. This accounts for approximately 5% of cases in Western nations, and up to 40% in Asia. In non-cirrhotic patients, major liver resections can be performed with acceptable outcomes (5-year survival rates of up to 50%). Liver transplant might have a role in highly selected patients, such as those with recurrence after initial resection or with unresectable disease at presentation. Defining optimal candidates for resection of HCC in a cirrhotic liver involves a multiparametric assessment of liver function matched to the presence of portal hypertension, oncological staging of the tumour, extent of hepatectomy, and future liver remnant after optimal resection, and the potential for a laparoscopic/minimally invasive approach. In addition, the projected outcome needs to be evaluated against other treatment modalities. In principle, resection should be considered for all those with non-metastatic disease and compensated cirrhosis without clinically significant portal hypertension. In practice, only a minority of patients will have this treatment associated with acceptable perioperative and postoperative outcomes and equivalence or superiority to other treatments.

### Jemperli [^115M5m7e]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Randomization was stratified by mismatch repair (MMR)/microsatellite instability (MSI) status, prior external pelvic radiotherapy, and disease status (recurrent, primary Stage III, or primary Stage IV). Treatment with Jemperli continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 3 years. Administration of Jemperli was permitted beyond disease progression (defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] v1.1) if the patient was clinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator.

Assessment of tumor status was performed every 6 weeks through Week 25, every 9 weeks through Week 52, and every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS) using RECIST v1.1 as assessed by investigators in the dMMR/MSI-H and overall populations, and overall survival (OS) in the overall population. Additional efficacy outcome measures included objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by investigators and duration of response (DOR).

Among the 494 patients evaluated, the baseline characteristics were as follows: median age 65 years (51% aged 65 years or older); 77% White, 12% Black, 3% Asian, 3% Hispanic or Latino; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 (63%) or 1 (37%); primary stage III (18%); primary stage IV (34%); and recurrent endometrial cancer (48%). Overall, 24% had dMMR/MSI-H tumors, and 76% had mismatch repair proficient (MMRp)/microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors.

### Role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy before simultaneous resection of colon cancer and liver metastases: A propensity-score matched analysis [^115MLZP8]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2025). Low credibility.

There has been a controversy about the optimal management of colorectal liver metastases (CLM). Both upfront surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy are viable options for CLM. The present study aimed to assess the short-term and survival outcomes of neoadjuvant chemotherapy before the simultaneous resection of primary colon cancer and liver metastases.

- **Methods**: This retrospective cohort study used data from the National Cancer Database (2015–2019) on patients with primary colon cancer and synchronous liver metastases. The main exposure was neoadjuvant chemotherapy before simultaneous resection of colon cancer and hepatic metastases. Propensity-score matching was used to match patients who had upfront surgery without neoadjuvant chemotherapy with patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The primary outcome was 5-year overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes included hospital stay, 30-day and 90-day mortality, 30-day unplanned readmission, conversion to open surgery, surgical margins, and disease downstaging.

- **Results**: Overall, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was given to 38.3% of 4060 patients. After matching, 1446 patients (53% male) were included; 482 were in the neoadjuvant group and 964 were in the no-neoadjuvant group. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a longer restricted mean OS (46.7 vs. 40.6 months, P < .001) and significantly lower rates of 90-day mortality (3% vs. 6.5%, P = 0.008), 30-day unplanned readmission (4.8% vs. 8.8%, P = 0.002), positive surgical margins (6.5% vs. 15.1%, P < .001), and administration of adjuvant therapy (47.3% vs. 79.5%, P).

### Omvoh [^117QtbVZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis during intravenous infusion, have been reported with OMVOH administration. Infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions, such as mucocutaneous erythema and pruritus, were reported during induction [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue OMVOH immediately and initiate appropriate treatment.

- **Infections**: OMVOH may increase the risk of infection [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Do not initiate treatment with OMVOH in patients with a clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. In patients with a chronic infection or a history of reinfection, consider the risks and benefits prior to prescribing OMVOH. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important acute or chronic infection occur. If a serious infection develops or an infection is not responding to standard therapy, monitor the patient closely and do not administer OMVOH until the infection resolves.

- **Tuberculosis**: Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with OMVOH. Do not administer OMVOH to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering OMVOH. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of OMVOH in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after OMVOH treatment.

### Avastin [^111fnx9S]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In a second study [NSABP-C-08 (NCT00096278)], patients with stage II and III colon cancer who had undergone surgery with curative intent were randomized to receive either Avastin administered at a dose equivalent to 2.5 mg/kg/week with mFOLFOX6 (N = 1,354) or mFOLFOX6 alone (N = 1,356). The median age was 57 years, with 50% male and 87% White participants. Seventy-five percent had stage III disease. The main outcome was disease-free survival (DFS) among stage III patients. The hazard ratio (HR) for DFS was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.77, 1.10). Overall survival (OS) was not significantly improved with the addition of Avastin to mFOLFOX6 [HR 0.96 (95% CI: 0.75, 1.22)].

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults [^1134D1bd]. Gut (2024). High credibility.

A strategy to allow for safe major liver resection in patients who would otherwise be left with an FLR < 40% is the use of preoperative portal vein embolisation (PVE). The portal vein branch ipsilateral to the tumour-bearing liver is embolised, inducing regeneration and hypertrophy of the contralateral lobe within 4 to 8 weeks after PVE. The success rate of PVE has been reported to be around 85% but is associated with a 10–20% complication rate and a risk of inducing severe portal hypertension in 1% of cirrhotic patients.

Recent data suggest that the presence of clinically significant portal hypertension in isolation might not be a formal contraindication in highly selected patients, such as those with well-preserved liver function (MELD score < 9) and good performance status, in whom limited liver resection is planned. Outcomes are probably not as good as those for transplant in those suitable for this intervention. While further data are awaited, the decision to perform resection in this patient phenotype should be individualised.

Liver resection is a safe operation when performed in the appropriate context and with adequate patient selection. Modern standards of HCC resection in cirrhotic patients are defined as expected 5-year survival rates of 60%, a perioperative mortality of 2–3%, and blood transfusion requirements of < 10%. Resection should follow general oncological principles (complete R0 resection) but must also be performed in a way that maximises recovery and preserves liver function. Anatomic liver resections with a 2 cm margin achieve the best results from an oncologic standpoint.

### Vectibix [^11614Tdh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Vectibix were demonstrated in Study 20020408, an open-label, multinational, randomized, controlled trial involving 463 patients with EGFR-expressing metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum; Study 20080763, an open-label, multicenter, multinational, randomized trial with 1010 patients possessing wild-type KRAS metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC); and Study 20100007, another open-label, multicenter, multinational, randomized trial with 377 patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC.

- **Study 20020408 (NCT00113763)**: Patients in this study were required to have demonstrated progression on or after treatment with regimens containing a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Progression was confirmed by an independent review committee (IRC), which was masked to treatment assignment for 76% of the patients. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive panitumumab at a dose of 6 mg/kg every two weeks plus best supportive care (BSC) (N = 231) or BSC alone (N = 232) until disease progression was determined by the investigator. Randomization was stratified based on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) (0 and 1 vs 2) and geographic region (Western Europe, Eastern/Central Europe, or other). Once disease progression was determined by the investigator, patients in the BSC-alone arm were eligible to receive panitumumab and were followed until the IRC confirmed disease progression.

Based on the IRC's determination of disease progression, a statistically significant prolongation in progression-free survival (PFS) was observed in patients receiving panitumumab compared to those receiving BSC alone.

### Stivarga [^112RNWCK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The clinical efficacy and safety of Stivarga were evaluated in an international, multicenter, randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Study: "Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with regorafenib or placebo after failure of standard therapy" (CORRECT); NCT 01103323) in 760 patients with previously-treated metastatic colorectal cancer. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS), and additional efficacy outcome measures included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall tumor response rate.

Patients were randomized to receive 160 mg regorafenib orally once daily (N = 505) plus best supportive care (BSC) or placebo (N = 255) plus BSC for the first 21 days of each 28-day cycle. Stivarga was administered with a low-fat breakfast that contains less than 30% fat [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Baseline demographics were as follows: the median age was 61 years; 61% of patients were men; 78% were White; and all patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The primary sites of disease were colon (65%), rectum (29%), or both (6%). A history of KRAS evaluation was reported for 729 (96%) patients; 430 (59%) of these patients were reported to have a KRAS mutation. The median number of prior lines of therapy for metastatic disease was three. All patients received prior treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, and with bevacizumab. All but one patient with KRAS mutation-negative tumors received panitumumab or cetux.

### Erbitux [^117NKNQ4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Of the 1217 randomized patients, the median age was 61 years; 60% were male, 86% were White, and 96% had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0–1. Sixty percent had a primary tumor localized in the colon, 84% had 1–2 metastatic sites, and 20% had received prior adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Demographics and baseline characteristics were similar between study arms.

K-Ras mutation status was available for 89% of the patients: 63% had K-Ras wild-type tumors and 37% had K-Ras mutant tumors. Testing assessed for the following somatic mutations in codons 12 and 13 (exon 2): G12A, G12D, G12R, G12C, G12S, G12V, G13D. Baseline characteristics and demographics in the K-Ras wild-type subset were similar to those observed in the overall population.

- **Progression-free survival (PFS)**: A statistically significant improvement in PFS was observed for the cetuximab with FOLFIRI arm compared with the FOLFIRI arm (median PFS 8.9 vs. 8.1 months, HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.74, 0.99], p-value = 0.036).

- **Overall survival (OS)**: OS was not significantly different at the planned, final analysis based on 838 events (HR = 0.93, 95% CI [0.8, 1.1], p-value = 0.327).

Results of the planned PFS and overall response rate (ORR) analysis in all randomized patients, and post-hoc PFS and ORR analysis in subgroups of patients defined by K-Ras mutation status, alongside post-hoc analysis of updated OS based on additional follow-up (1000 events) in all randomized patients and in subgroups defined by K-Ras mutation status, are presented in Table 10 and Figure 2. The treatment effect in the all-randomized population for PFS was driven by effects limited to patients with K-Ras wild-type tumors.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Management of disseminated metastatic CRC involves various active drugs, either in combination or as single agents. The choice of therapy is based on consideration of the goals of therapy, the type and timing of prior therapy, the mutational profile of the tumor, and the differing toxicity profiles of the constituent drugs. This manuscript summarizes the data supporting the systemic therapy options recommended for metastatic CRC in the NCCN guidelines for colon cancer.

### Advancements in the management of synchronous colorectal liver metastases: A comprehensive review of surgical, systemic, and local treatment modalities [^114jSERR]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). High credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In recent years, with the widespread use of cancer screening programs, the introduction of molecularly targeted biological drugs, and the use of surgical and local ablative treatments in metastatic patients, mortality has decreased and survival outcomes have improved. Approximately 25% of patients with CRC are metastatic at diagnosis. Research suggests that synchronous metastatic colorectal liver disease has a poorer prognosis compared to metastatic colorectal liver disease that develops metachronously.

The approach to treating patients with oligometastatic CRC should revolve around the potential to completely eliminate all tumor masses. Liver resection is the best option for a cure and can be achieved through surgical R0 resection, involving the complete removal of tumors with clear margins and no microscopic residual tumor. Although a small percentage of patients may be eligible for potentially curative liver resection, long-term survival rates following surgery for colorectal liver metastases (CRLMs) have shown remarkable improvement. Retrospective analyses and meta-analyses have highlighted that individuals with CRLMs can experience a notable 5-year overall survival rate of up to 71% following resection.

However, for a subset of individuals presenting with a limited number of small lesions, surgical resection may not be suitable due to tumor location, impaired health status, or insufficient future liver remnant. In such cases, non-surgical options should be considered.

### Oxaliplatin [^1113Bz2B]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of oxaliplatin in combination with fluorouracil (FU)/leucovorin (LV) was evaluated in a North American, multicenter, open-label, randomized, active-controlled trial [NCT00003594]. This was a randomized Phase III trial of three different regimens of CPT-11 plus 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin compared to 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum. The trial included seven arms at different times during its conduct, four of which were closed due to either changes in the standard of care, toxicity, or simplification. During the trial, the control arm was changed to irinotecan with fluorouracil/leucovorin.

The results reported below compared the efficacy of oxaliplatin with fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin with irinotecan to an approved control regimen of irinotecan with fluorouracil/leucovorin in 795 concurrently randomized patients previously untreated for locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer. After completion of enrollment, the dose of irinotecan with fluorouracil/leucovorin was decreased due to toxicity.

Eligible patients were at least 18 years of age, had known locally advanced, locally recurrent, or metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma not curable by surgery or amenable to radiation therapy, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 0, 1, or 2. Patients had to have an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 × 10^9/L and platelets greater than or equal to specific levels.

A total of 954 patients were randomized, with 478 assigned to the Lenvima arm and 476 to the sorafenib arm. The demographics of the study population were as follows: a median age of 62 years (range: 20 to 88 years), 84% male, 69% Asian, and 29% White. Additionally, 63% of participants had an ECOG PS of 0, and 69% weighed ≥ 60 kg. Among the 590 patients (62%) with at least one site of documented distant metastatic disease, 52% had lung metastasis, 45% had lymph node metastasis, and 16% had bone metastasis.

- **Demographics and characteristics**: Macroscopic portal vein invasion, extra-hepatic spread, or both were present in 70% of patients. HCC was categorized as Child-Pugh A and BCLC Stage C in 79%, and Child-Pugh A and BCLC Stage B in 21% of patients. Seventy-five percent of patients had radiographic evidence of cirrhosis at baseline. Investigator-documented primary risk factors for the development of HCC were hepatitis B (50%), hepatitis C (23%), alcohol use (6%), other (7%), and unknown (14%).

- **Efficacy and outcomes**: REFLECT demonstrated that Lenvima was non-inferior to sorafenib for overall survival (OS). However, REFLECT did not show a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients randomized to Lenvima compared to those in the sorafenib arm. Lenvima was statistically significantly superior to sorafenib for progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR).

The efficacy results are summarized in Table 18 and Figure 6.

### Keytruda [^115Rizsn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of Keytruda was investigated in 504 patients with MSI-H or dMMR cancers enrolled in three multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, multi-cohort trials: KEYNOTE-164 (NCT02460198), KEYNOTE-158 (NCT02628067), and KEYNOTE-051 (NCT02332668). All trials excluded patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression. Regardless of histology, MSI or MMR tumor status was determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR; local or central) or immunohistochemistry (IHC; local or central), respectively.

- **Keynote-164**: Enrolled 124 patients with advanced MSI-H or dMMR colorectal cancer (CRC) that progressed following treatment with fluoropyrimidine and either oxaliplatin or irinotecan ± anti-VEGF/EGFR mAb-based therapy.

- **Keynote-158**: Enrolled 373 patients with advanced MSI-H or dMMR non-colorectal cancers (non-CRC) who had disease progression following prior therapy. Patients were either prospectively enrolled with MSI-H/dMMR tumors (Cohort K) or retrospectively identified in one of 10 solid tumor cohorts (Cohorts A-J).

- **Keynote-051**: Enrolled 7 pediatric patients with MSI-H or dMMR cancers.

### Cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy and liver resection is a treatment option for patients with peritoneal and liver metastases from colorectal cancer [^114CJAjF]. Annals of Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent malignancy globally, contributing significantly to cancer-related mortality due to metastases. Approximately 30% of patients develop metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), presenting a formidable challenge in managing CRC with variable treatment options and prognosis. The liver is the most commonly affected organ by metastases, followed by the lungs and the peritoneum, where peritoneal metastases (PM-CRC) have the worst long-term outcomes. Only 20% to 30% of patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM) are eligible for surgical intervention, where studies report a median overall survival (OS) of up to 80 months for parenchyma-sparing liver resections. For PM-CRC, cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS-HIPEC) is a treatment option for patients with limited PM-CRC, reporting a median OS of 32 to 50 months.

Approximately 8% of patients with CRC present with synchronous CLM and PM-CRC, presenting limited treatment options and an abysmal 5-month OS if curative treatment is not possible. Synchronous liver, lung, or other distant metastases were considered a relative contraindication for CRS-HIPEC, but in later years, limited CLM have been accepted. Patients not meeting these selection criteria face limited treatment options, relying on palliative systemic chemotherapy. Encouraging results, however, advocate for simultaneous resection of CLM and PM-CRC, but controversies persist due to the risk of increased morbidity, mortality, and delayed adjuvant chemotherapy.

### Enspryng [^112HCnyP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Safety monitoring during treatment**: Monitoring of liver transaminases and neutrophil counts is crucial during treatment with ENSPRYNG.

	- **Liver transaminases**: Monitor ALT and AST levels every 4 weeks for the first 3 months of treatment, then every 3 months for one year, and thereafter as clinically necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Discontinue ENSPRYNG if an ALT or AST elevation greater than 5 times the ULN occurs. If this elevation is associated with any bilirubin increase, do not reinitiate ENSPRYNG. If no bilirubin elevation above the ULN is present, once ALT or AST levels return to the normal range and following a benefit-risk assessment, treatment can be restarted according to the schedule. In the event treatment is restarted, liver parameters must be closely monitored. If there is any subsequent increase in ALT/AST and/or bilirubin above the ULN, discontinue ENSPRYNG, and another reinitiation is not recommended.

	- **Neutrophil counts**: Monitor neutrophils 4 to 8 weeks after therapy initiation and thereafter at regular, clinically determined intervals. If the neutrophil count is below 1.0 × 10⁹/L and confirmed by repeat testing, interrupt ENSPRYNG until the neutrophil count exceeds 1.0 × 10⁹/L [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Oxaliplatin [^111aZc8b]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of oxaliplatin in combination with fluorouracil (FU) and leucovorin (LV) was evaluated in a multicenter, open-label, randomized, three-arm controlled trial conducted in the US and Canada. The study focused on patients with advanced colorectal cancer who had relapsed or progressed during or within six months of first-line treatment with bolus fluorouracil/leucovorin and irinotecan. This study, titled "A multicenter, open-label, randomized, three-arm study of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) + leucovorin (LV) or oxaliplatin or a combination of 5-FU/LV + oxaliplatin as second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma", is registered as NCT00008281.

Patients were randomized to one of three regimens, with dosing regimens presented in Table 22. Eligible patients were at least 18 years of age and had unresectable, measurable, histologically proven colorectal adenocarcinoma, with a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) greater than 50%. Additionally, patients needed to have aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase levels less than or equal to 2× the upper limit of normal (ULN), unless liver metastases were present. In such cases, levels less than or equal to 5× ULN were permitted if documented at baseline by CT or MRI scan. Prior radiotherapy was allowed if it had been completed at least three weeks before randomization.

The main efficacy outcome measure was three-year disease-free survival (DFS), and an additional outcome measure was overall survival (OS).

### Surgical site infections in simultaneous colorectal and liver resections for metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma [^114LEFUS]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

Surgical site infections (SSIs) are a major driver of morbidity after combined liver and colorectal surgery for metastatic colorectal cancer. Available literature is inadequate to characterize risk factors and benchmarks for quality improvement.

- **Methods**: Consecutive cases of simultaneous liver and colorectal surgery for colorectal adenocarcinoma from November 2013 through September 2022 were reviewed for SSIs per National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) and National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) criteria. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression evaluated associations with NSQIP 30-day organ-space SSIs.

- **Results**: In 580 procedures, the rate of 30-day organ-space SSIs was 16% (n = 94) using NSQIP criteria and 11% (n = 64) using NHSN criteria; 4% (n = 24) had incisional SSIs by both criteria. Most organ-space SSIs were perihepatic, and a minority were associated with bile (26%) or anastomotic (15%) leaks. Independent risk factors for organ-space SSIs included major liver resection, upper abdominal (compared with lower abdominal/pelvic) colorectal procedure, and ostomy reversal. Organ-space SSI rates increased over time by approximately 16% per calendar year (p = 0.02) despite a declining rate of major liver resection; incisional SSI rates remained low. Overall, major morbidity was 22%, with a 7-day median length of stay (interquartile range 6–9) and 0.3% 90-day mortality.

Conclusion: Organ-space SSIs are a significant driver of postoperative morbidity in simultaneous liver and colorectal resections for metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma.

### Determinants of metastatic colorectal cancer with permanent liver-limited disease [^116UEGdz]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2024). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complex and genetically heterogeneous disease presenting a specific metastatic pattern, with the liver being the most common site of metastasis. Around 20%-25% of patients with CRC will develop exclusively hepatic metastatic disease throughout their disease history. With its specific characteristics and therapeutic options, liver-limited disease (LLD) should be considered a specific entity. The identification of these patients is particularly relevant in view of the growing interest in liver transplantation in selected patients with advanced CRC. Identifying why some patients will develop only LLD remains a challenge, mainly because of a lack of a systemic understanding of this complex and interlinked phenomenon, given that cancer has traditionally been investigated according to distinct physiological compartments.

Recently, multidisciplinary efforts and new diagnostic tools have made it possible to study some of these complex issues in greater depth and may help identify targets and specific treatment strategies to benefit these patients. In this review, we analyze the underlying biology and available tools to help clinicians better understand this increasingly common and specific disease.

### Prognoses of patients treated with surgical therapy versus continuation of local-plus-systemic therapy following successful down-staging of intermediate-advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: A multicenter real-world study [^116ZdzXH]. The Oncologist (2024). Low credibility.

Systemic therapy included targeted drugs such as sorafenib, renvastinib, regofenib, and apatinib. Intermediate-advanced HCC patients were initially administered first-line targeted drugs, and those who showed unsatisfactory efficacy or tumor progression were switched to alternative drugs. All targeted drugs were administered according to the recommended dosages outlined in the guidelines. The immunotherapy involved programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors, which were administered at the standard dose in a 21-day cycle.

- **Surgical therapy**: After patients underwent local plus systemic therapies, they were assessed to determine if they met the criteria for surgical resection. The resection criteria were as follows: (1) assessment of intrahepatic lesions for at least two months according to RECIST 1.1 or mRECIST criteria, determining classification as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD); (2) technically resectable vascular emboli; (3) achievement of R0 resection with sufficient remnant liver volume (≥ 40% of the standard liver volume for patients with liver cirrhosis or ≥ 30% of the standard liver volume for patients without liver cirrhosis); (4) no other surgical contraindications. For patients who met the criteria for surgical resection, anatomic or nonanatomic resection was performed to completely remove the tumors.

### Lumakras [^112hcBMz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In the pooled safety population of patients with CRC who received Lumakras 960 mg in combination with panitumumab [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], hepatotoxicity occurred in 15% of patients, of which 4.8% were Grade 3. A total of 7% of patients who received Lumakras had increased ALT or increased AST, of which 0.8% were Grade 3. The median time to first onset of increased ALT or increased AST was 10 weeks (range: 2 to 22). Increased ALT or increased AST leading to dose interruption occurred in 2.4% of patients. A total of 3.2% of patients who received Lumakras had hyperbilirubinemia, of which 2.4% were Grade 3. The median time to first onset of hyperbilirubinemia was 12 weeks (range: 0 to 29). Hyperbilirubinemia leading to dose interruption occurred in 1.6% of patients. Among patients with hepatotoxicity, 21% received corticosteroids.

Monitor liver function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) prior to the start of Lumakras, every 3 weeks for the first 3 months of treatment, then once a month or as clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase and/or bilirubin elevations. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue Lumakras based on the severity of the adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Consider administering systemic corticosteroids for the management of hepatotoxicity.

### Afinitordisperz [^114mibo8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Skin lesion response rates were assessed by local investigators for 77 patients in the AFINITOR arm and 37 patients in the placebo arm who presented with skin lesions at study entry. The skin lesion response rate was statistically significantly higher in the AFINITOR arm (26% vs. 0, p = 0.0011); all skin lesion responses were partial responses, defined as visual improvement in 50% to 99% of all skin lesions durable for at least 8 weeks (Physician's Global Assessment of Clinical Condition).

Patients randomized to placebo were permitted to receive AFINITOR at the time of angiomyolipoma progression or after the time of the primary analysis. After the primary analysis, patients treated with AFINITOR underwent additional follow-up CT or MRI scans to assess tumor status until discontinuation of treatment or completion of 4 years of follow-up after the last patient was randomized. A total of 112 patients (79 randomized to AFINITOR and 33 randomized to placebo) received at least one dose of AFINITOR. The median duration of AFINITOR treatment was 3.9 years (0.5 months to 5.3 years) and the median duration of follow-up was 3.9 years (0.9 months to 5.4 years). During the follow-up period after the primary analysis, 32 patients (in addition to the 33 patients identified at the time of the primary analysis) had an angiomyolipoma response based upon independent central radiology review. Among the 65 responders out of 112 patients, the median time to angiomyolipoma response was 2.9 months (2.6 to 33.8 months). Fourteen percent of the 112 patients treated with AFINITOR had angiomyolipoma.

### Left hemicolectomy for an isolated metastases from lung adenocarcinoma to the colon [^113gbc2q]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Colonic metastases from primary lung adenocarcinoma are rare and represent a diagnostic and management dilemma. This clinical presentation often mimics primary colonic cancer or non-malignant bowel pathology. The reported incidence of this entity is postulated to rise with the improvement in diagnostic imaging and histopathology testing. Colonic metastases from primary lung adenocarcinoma are associated with poor overall survival, as they signify an advanced pathological process with morbidity due to complications from the metastases. Although there is limited data on this pathological entity, surgical resection, if feasible, is thought to be associated with survival benefits.

We report a case of a woman in her 60s diagnosed with an isolated descending colon metastasis from a known primary lung adenocarcinoma on interval imaging. While asymptomatic at the time, the patient underwent a palliative left hemicolectomy due to the risk of luminal obstruction and perforation from the lesion if left untreated.

### Advancements in the management of synchronous colorectal liver metastases: A comprehensive review of surgical, systemic, and local treatment modalities [^113wDibq]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). Low credibility.

This review addresses the landscape of colorectal cancer (CRC) with a focus on liver metastases, the third most common cancer globally. It explores recent findings in treatment strategies, emphasizing the dynamic interplay between surgery, systemic chemotherapy, and local therapies for synchronous colorectal liver metastases (CRLMs).

- **Recent findings**: Highlighting the role of advanced imaging, the review underscores the significance of contrast-enhanced MRI in surgical planning for CRLMs. Surgical resection remains a primary choice for resectable cases, with considerations for oncologic scoring systems and tumor biology. Perioperative systemic chemotherapy plays a pivotal role, especially in conversion therapy for initially unresectable CRLMs. The review also explores various local therapies, including radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, stereotactic body radiotherapy, hepatic arterial infusional chemotherapy, selective internal radiation therapy, and transarterial chemoembolization for unresectable cases.

A comprehensive approach, integrating surgery, systemic chemotherapy, and local therapies, is crucial for managing synchronous CRLMs. Surgical resection and perioperative chemotherapy are key players, guided by considerations of tumor biology and scoring systems. For unresectable cases, local therapies offer viable alternatives, emphasizing the need for tailored treatments. Multidisciplinary collaboration among medical oncologists, surgeons, and radiologists is essential. Ongoing research will refine treatment approaches, while emerging.

### Advancements in the management of synchronous colorectal liver metastases: A comprehensive review of surgical, systemic, and local treatment modalities [^1158ZWpr]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). High credibility.

- **Local therapies for unresectable CRLMs**: The chance of cure for colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLMs) is highest with the option of surgical metastasectomy; however, only 20% of patients are considered resectable at the time of diagnosis. For patients who are not suitable for surgical treatment due to tumor location, multifocality, insufficient remnant tissue, ineligibility for surgery due to the patient's comorbidities, or the patient's refusal of surgery, there are local treatment options available for liver-directed therapy.

	Local treatment options for colorectal liver metastases include hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC), microwave ablation (MWA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT), and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).

	Local treatments are categorized based on their technique and therapeutic goal: ablative and intra-arterial treatments. Local ablative treatments serve as curative surgical alternatives for patients ineligible for surgery, while intra-arterial treatments are often used in conjunction with systemic chemotherapy to provide local control for non-resectable and non-ablatable diseases.

	Ablative options, including radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA), are methods categorized under thermal ablation. Within this category, there are additional choices such as cryoablation, which cools the tumor with argon infusion, inducing tissue necrosis; laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT), causing coagulation necrosis through electrical energy application.
