## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how an expectation of lower future prices affects current supply. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core economic principle that links intertemporal price expectations to supply decisions. Then, I should verify whether this principle is illustrated in real-world markets with storable or bankable goods. Next, I will consider whether the effect is immediate or delayed, and whether it changes the quantity supplied versus the supply curve. Finally, I will apply this logic to the specific answer choices and select the best option, making sure I don't conflate movement along the curve with a shift of the curve.

> Let me first confirm the economic principle. When producers expect prices to be lower in the future, they have an incentive to sell more now to avoid the anticipated lower revenue later, which increases current supply. Conversely, if they expect higher future prices, they tend to withhold current supply, decreasing current market availability. This intertemporal substitution is a standard result in microeconomics and is particularly salient for storable or bankable commodities where inventory can be shifted across time periods.

> Wait, let me verify this with concrete examples. In the EU Emissions Trading System, announced future policies that reduce future allowance demand lower expected future allowance prices, which via banking behavior reduces current prices and increases current emissions, illustrating how anticipated future price declines depress current prices and increase current supply or consumption. This is a classic "green paradox" mechanism driven by intertemporal arbitrage in a bankable permit market. Similarly, in food markets, adaptive forecasting shows that expectations of future price changes influence current price dynamics and supply responses, reinforcing the general point that forward-looking producers adjust current supply in response to expected future prices.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the timing. I initially thought the effect might be delayed, but I should correct that: the incentive to sell more now is immediate because firms act on expectations as soon as they form them, so current supply increases right away when lower future prices are expected, not later. This immediacy is consistent with how bankable permit markets and storable commodity markets react to news about future demand or policy changes.

> I need to ensure I'm precise about what changes. The question is about the amount of product supplied right now, which is a movement along the supply curve in response to changed intertemporal incentives, not a permanent shift of the supply curve itself. The supply curve reflects costs and technology at a given moment, whereas the observed increase in current quantity supplied is a short-run adjustment to expected price differentials over time, so the correct interpretation is an increase in current quantity supplied, not a shift of the supply schedule.

> Let me consider the answer choices carefully. Option A says supply increases right now, which aligns with the intertemporal substitution logic and the empirical examples above. Option B says supply decreases, which would be the opposite of what we'd expect with anticipated lower future prices. Option C claims no effect on current quantity, which ignores the clear incentive to sell more now. Option D claims no effect now or later, which is incorrect because the effect on current supply is immediate and well-documented in intertemporal markets. Therefore, the best answer is A, with the caveat that this is a movement along the supply curve rather than a shift of the curve.

---

The correct answer is **A. this will cause the supply of the product to increase right now**. When firms expect lower future prices, they have an incentive to sell more now to avoid the anticipated price drop, thereby increasing current supply. This is a standard intertemporal substitution effect in economics, where producers shift sales from the future to the present in response to expected price changes.

---

## Economic reasoning

- **Intertemporal substitution**: Firms can store inventory or delay sales, so expectations of lower future prices incentivize selling more now to capture higher current prices, increasing current supply [^notfound].

- **Inventory management**: Firms may reduce inventories now to avoid holding goods that will be worth less later, further boosting current supply.

- **Market dynamics**: This behavior can create a temporary surplus, pushing current prices down and partially offsetting the incentive to sell now.

---

## Real-world examples

- **Agricultural markets**: Farmers often sell more grain before harvest if they expect prices to fall, increasing current supply.

- **Technology products**: Firms may offer discounts or promotions to clear inventory before a new model arrives, raising current supply.

- **Oil markets**: Producers may increase output if they expect future prices to decline, adding to current supply.

---

## Counterarguments and limitations

- **Storage costs**: If storage is expensive or capacity is limited, firms may not be able to shift supply significantly.

- **Demand considerations**: If demand is inelastic, increased supply may not materially change current prices or sales.

- **Uncertainty**: Firms may hedge or wait if future price signals are unclear, muting the effect.

---

## Conclusion

Firms expecting lower future prices will **increase current supply** through intertemporal substitution and inventory adjustments, making option A correct.

### Effect of long-term vitamin D3 supplementation vs placebo on risk of depression or clinically relevant depressive symptoms and on change in mood scores: a randomized clinical trial [^114d2ib8]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D have been associated with higher risk for depression later in life, but there have been few long-term, high-dose large-scale trials.

Objective

To test the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on late-life depression risk and mood scores.

Design, Setting, and Participants

There were 18 353 men and women aged 50 years or older in the VITAL-DEP (Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial-Depression Endpoint Prevention) ancillary study to VITAL, a randomized clinical trial of cardiovascular disease and cancer prevention among 25 871 adults in the US. There were 16 657 at risk for incident depression (ie, no depression history) and 1696 at risk for recurrent depression (ie, depression history but no treatment for depression within the past 2 years). Randomization occurred from November 2011 through March 2014; randomized treatment ended on December 31, 2017, and this was the final date of follow-up.

Intervention

Randomized assignment in a 2×2 factorial design to vitamin D3 (2000 IU/d of cholecalciferol) and fish oil or placebo; 9181 were randomized to vitamin D3 and 9172 were randomized to matching placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcomes were the risk of depression or clinically relevant depressive symptoms (total of incident and recurrent cases) and the mean difference in mood scores (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale [PHQ-8]; score range, 0 points [least symptoms] to 24 points [most symptoms]; the minimal clinically important difference for change in scores was 0.5 points).

Results

Among the 18 353 randomized participants (mean age, 67.5 [SD, 7.1] years; 49.2% women), the median treatment duration was 5.3 years and 90.5% completed the trial (93.5% among those alive at the end of the trial). Risk of depression or clinically relevant depressive symptoms was not significantly different between the vitamin D3 group (609 depression or clinically relevant depressive symptom events; 12.9/1000 person-years) and the placebo group (625 depression or clinically relevant depressive symptom events; 13.3/1000 person-years) (hazard ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.09]; P = 0.62); there were no significant differences between groups in depression incidence or recurrence. No significant differences were observed between treatment groups for change in mood scores over time; mean change in PHQ-8 score was not significantly different from zero (mean difference for change in mood scores, 0.01 points [95% CI, -0.04 to 0.05 points]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults aged 50 years or older without clinically relevant depressive symptoms at baseline, treatment with vitamin D3 compared with placebo did not result in a statistically significant difference in the incidence and recurrence of depression or clinically relevant depressive symptoms or for change in mood scores over a median follow-up of 5.3 years. These findings do not support the use of vitamin D3 in adults to prevent depression.

Intermittent high-dose vitamin D — justification for recommendation: The available evidence (which is specifically pertinent to persons age > 50 years) suggests that, compared to daily lower-dose vitamin D or placebo, intermittent high-dose vitamin D offers no desirable effects, and may be associated with undesirable anticipated effects (falls). Moderate certainty of evidence suggests an estimated 0.5% absolute increase in fracture risk.

Vitamin D — generally healthy adults aged 50 to 74 years: Subgroup analyses did not provide evidence for benefit with vitamin D in subgroups with 25(OH)D below 20 to 24 ng/mL (50–60 nmol/L), and based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D, in addition to the anticipated undesirable effects, are likely to be trivial. The panel judged that vitamin D supplementation appears to have little or no beneficial impact on the outcomes analyzed in healthy populations aged 50 to 74 years, and concluded there was therefore no compelling rationale to recommend empiric vitamin D in this age group. Noting monetary costs and that a recommendation for 25(OH)D testing could decrease feasibility and health equity, the panel suggested against routine 25(OH)D testing (eg, screening) in generally healthy adults aged 50 to 74 years.

Vitamin D dosing in adults aged 50 years and older with indications for supplementation or treatment: Recommendation 11 states, "we suggest, daily, lower-dose vitamin D instead of non-daily, higher-dose vitamin D. (2 | ⊕⊕⊕◯)". The evidence base included 2 trials with 537 participants directly comparing intermittent high-dose vs daily lower-dose regimens, and an expanded review of 19 manuscripts from 15 studies involving 53 527 participants. Daily vitamin D doses ranged from 400 to 800 IU (10–20 µg), while non-daily regimens included 50 000 IU (1250 µg) every 2 weeks, 60 000–100 000 IU (1500–2500 µg) monthly, and 96 000–150 000 IU (2400–3750 µg) every 2 to 4 months. There was a trend for intermittent high-dose vitamin D to increase fracture risk (RR 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98–1.19]), with an estimated absolute effect of 5 more participants with a fracture per 1000 (1 fewer to 11 more). We did not identify evidence related to individuals younger than age 50 years.

### Event boundaries shape temporal organization of memory by resetting temporal context [^117Fam7x]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Moreover, the rebound in TOM for items across an event that are separated by more vs. fewer intervening items replicates the well-established temporal distance effect, while also helps rule out confounds as the root of impaired performance for across-event pairs, e.g. participants might simply not link different events at all. If participants did not try to remember the order of across-event items as instructed, this would lead to a generic low performance (e.g. chance level) for all across-event pairs regardless of the number of intervening items.

Our algorithmic model could account for all behavioural effects, including the boundary effect and the temporal distance effect, two effects seemingly computationally incompatible, as well as the local primacy effect observed in the present study. In our model, in the absence of an event boundary, context signals drift gradually over time. At event boundaries, context signals shift sharply via a resetting process, whereby a certain proportion of the first context signal, which contains both pre-experimental context and the first context in a list is reinstated. To operationalize recency judgments, we developed a metric, i.e. during retrieval, the learning contexts associated with the two objects are reinstatedand compared to the absolute first contextual representation during encoding. The item more/less similar to the first contextual representation (quantified by d2 - d1, Fig. 4d) is judged as the one presented earlier/later. This model reveals key insights that allow accounting for all the effects. One of those insights is that the resetting process at event boundaries increases the difference between the contextual representations of the probed items relative to that of the first contextual representation (i.e. larger magnitude of d2–d1) across multiple conditions: for within vs. across-event pairs, for pairs separated by more vs. fewer intervening items, as well as for pairs at earlier vs. later local event positions. It might be less intuitive to understand how the resetting mechanism at event boundary increases the magnitude of d2 - d1 for earlier vs. later local event positions, given the constant drift rate. This is because while the drift rate, which defines the rate of change between one context and its neighbours, is constant, the amount of change between two neighbouring contexts relative to the first context (i.e. Δd = d t+1 - d t) is not constant across positions. In fact, the more dissimilar the contextual representation to the first one is, the smaller Δd becomes. This is because reinstating a certain proportion of the first context at event boundaries makes the contextual representation of each event boundary more similar to the first context compared to the contextual representations of pre-boundary items, leading to larger Δd between event boundary and its next item. Hence, the accumulated Δd between two items (e.g. the accumulated Δd between item t + 2 and item t is (d t+2 - d t+1) + (d t+1 - d t) = d t+2 - d t) is larger for earlier event positions versus later event positions. Since the accumulated Δd between two items is the contextual difference of the two probed items relative to the first one (i.e. d2 - d1 in Fig. 4d, see above the example formulas on why Δd between item t + 2 and item t is d t+2 - d t), this explains why our model can account for the local primacy effect.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115QqUNi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114yJPbG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D prevention guideline — trial design and measurement limitations: Expected greater benefit at lower baseline 25(OH)D contrasted with few randomized controlled trials in low-baseline populations, and many large trials had adequate baseline levels (eg, 25(OH)D 31 ng/mL [78 nmol/L]). Control groups were routinely exposed to vitamin D via sun and diet and many trials allowed continued supplements reflecting the DRI (eg, 600–800 IU [15–20 μg] daily for adults), which the panel notes may bias results toward the null. Most trials lacked a specific 25(OH)D eligibility threshold and were not designed or powered for subgroup analyses by baseline or achieved 25(OH)D; accordingly, the commissioned review does not include subgroup analyses by average baseline 25(OH)D. Additional constraints included insufficient duration to assess long-latency chronic disease outcomes and heterogeneity of doses and schedules, precluding specific dose recommendations (with doses summarized in technical remarks).

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115h8b1G]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society — efficacy, safety, and panel judgments for vitamin D in pregnancy: Most trials did not prespecify adverse events, and the trials by Roth et al (217, 223) reported no cases of symptomatic hypercalcemia; study subgroup analyses did not implicate either risk of bias or vitamin D dosage as a significant predictor of study outcomes, and data were insufficient to address whether baseline 25(OH)D level was a significant predictor of treatment effects. Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D during pregnancy for the outcomes specified are likely to be moderate, and the panel noted that all point estimates favored benefit and judged that the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial. The panel also considered a 2019 systematic review performed by Palacios et al (227) in which vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy reduced risks of preeclampsia (RR 0.48 [95% CI, 0.30–0.79]), low birthweight (RR 0.55 [95% CI, 0.35–0.87]), and gestational diabetes (RR 0.51 [95% CI, 0.27–0.97]), with a non-significant reduction in preterm birth (RR 0.66 [95% CI, 0.34–1.30]).

### Dopamine-independent effect of rewards on choices through hidden-state inference [^115rMUF7]. Nature Neuroscience (2024). High credibility.

Strikingly, stimulating dopamine neurons at the time of trial outcome — where we observed large increases or decreases in dopamine following reward or omission, respectively — had no significant influence on the subsequent choice (Fig. 5i); it did not reinforce the preceding first-step choice (effect of stimulation: β = 0.041, s.e. = 0.030, z = 1.378, P = 0.168), nor act like a reward by interacting with the state transition (β = −0.011, s.e. = 0.030, z = −0.355, P = 0.723), nor modify the effect outcomes on choices (stimulation–transition–outcome interaction: β = −0.014, s.e. = 0.030, z = −0.464, P = 0.643). No effect of stimulation was found in the YFP group for either stimulation types (all P > 0.456). To evaluate the strength of this null result in the ChR2 group, we computed a Bayes factor (B = 0.048) for whether dopamine stimulation acted like a task reward or had no effect. This indicated the manipulation result provides 'strong evidence' (using the classification in ref.) against dopamine stimulation recapitulating the behavioral consequences of rewards in this task.

By contrast, while stimulation after the first-step choice had no effect on the latency to initiate the next trial (Fig. 5e, t (6) = 0.347, P = 0.740, 95% CI (−30.25, 40.25), Cohen's d = 0.034), stimulation at outcome significantly reduced the latency to initiate the next trial (Fig. 5h, t (6) = 4.228, P = 0.0055, 95% CI (20.98, 78.6), Cohen's d = 0.369). Again, there was no effect on this latency in the YFP group (Fig. 5e, stimulation after choice: t (4) = 0.816, P = 0.460, 95% CI (−62.7, 114.9), Cohen's d = 0.302; Fig. 5h, stimulation at outcome time: t (4) = 1.713, P = 0.162, 95% CI (−9.87, 41.67), Cohen's d = 0.141).

### Effects of maternal vitamin D supplementation on childhood health [^1157qeJv]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

To ensure adequate vitD supply in all pregnancies, it is crucial to identify the organ systems that are sensitive to vitD and clarify the sufficient levels of maternal vitD needed to promote optimal fetal development in terms of later health risks.

We therefore systematically searched the existing literature for studies that examined how maternal use of vitD supplements of at least 400 IU/d (10 µg/d) during pregnancy affects child health, with a focus on organ-specific effects of relevance both in the first years of life and later. We also aimed to investigate the current knowledge on how higher doses of vitD and differences in the timing and duration of supplementation affect the health of the exposed children.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114EynAu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Prediabetes — vitamin D effects on glycemia and safety are as follows: Compared with placebo, vitamin D lowered fasting blood glucose and post–oral glucose tolerance test values, with mean difference −5.3 mg/dL [95% CI, −7.9 to −2.7] and mean difference −7.6 mg/dL [95% CI, −12.6 to −2.7], respectively, and there was a trend toward HbA1c lowering (mean difference −0.05% [95% CI, −0.10 to 0.01]). Meta-analyses found no clear differences for all-cause mortality (RR 0.75 [95% CI, 0.26–2.18]; estimated absolute effect size of 1 fewer per 1000 [4 fewer to 6 more]) or cardiovascular disease events (RR 1.08 [95% CI, 0.33–3.57]; estimated absolute effect size of 1 more per 1000 [1 fewer to 31 more]). Nephrolithiasis showed no clear difference (RR 1.02 [95% CI, 0.71–2.03]; estimated absolute effect size of 3 more per 1000 [5 fewer to 17 more]), there were no cases of symptomatic hypercalcemia, and in the DPVD study there was 1 case of new-onset kidney disease in the vitamin D group and 2 cases in placebo (RR 0.50 [95% CI, 0.05–5.51]). In D2d, adverse events were overall less frequent with vitamin D 4000 IU/day [100 μg/day] cholecalciferol versus placebo (IRR 0.94 [95% CI, 0.90–0.98]). Based on these point estimates, the panel judged that anticipated desirable effects for diabetes prevention are likely moderate, while anticipated undesirable effects are likely trivial.

Cardiac ultrasonography guideline — GRADE factors for evidence assessment and recommendation development specify that Section A categorizes the outcome factor as Critical, Important, Less important, or Not important, while Section B (factors 2–10) sets study-design starting points and quality levels with "Randomized controlled trial = 4" and "Observational studies = 2", mapping to "A = High = Four points", "B = Moderate = Three points", "C = Lowc = Two points", and "D = Very lowc = One point". Quality is lowered by the five downgraders — "Risk of bias" (−1 Serious; −2 Very serious), "Inconsistency" (−1 Serious; −2 Very serious), "Indirectness" (−1 Serious; −2 Very serious), "Imprecision" (−1 Serious; −2 Very serious), and "Publication bias" (−1 Likely; −2 Very likely) — and raised by three upgraders — "Large effect" (+1 Large; +2 Very large), "Dose response" (+1 Evidence of a gradient), and "Antagonistic bias" (+1 All plausible confounding would reduce the effect, or +1 Would suggest a spurious effect when results show no effect). "Based on the design, the evidence will qualify for four points (if randomized controlled trial) or two points (if observational) and then points will move down by one or two points (by downgraders) or up (by upgraders) if applicable as indicated in the table", and Section C (factors 11–15) lists "The five-GRADE transformers", with voting "using ninepoint Likert's scale".

### The role of vitamin D in the prevention of late-life depression [^1177D5b5]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In this article, we review current evidence regarding potential benefits of vitamin D for improving mood and reducing depression risk in older adults. We summarize gaps in knowledge and describe future efforts that may clarify the role of vitamin D in late-life depression prevention.

Methods

MEDLINE and PsychINFO databases were searched for all articles on vitamin D and mood that had been published up to and including May 2015. Observational studies and randomized trials with 50 or more participants were included. We excluded studies that involved only younger adults and/or exclusively involved persons with current depression.

Results

Twenty observational (cross-sectional and prospective) studies and 10 randomized trials (nine were randomized placebo-controlled trials [RCTs]; one was a randomized blinded comparison trial) were reviewed. Inverse associations of vitamin D blood level or vitamin D intake with depression were found in 13 observational studies; three identified prospective relations. Results from all but one of the RCTs showed no statistically significant differences in depression outcomes between vitamin D and placebo groups.

Limitations

Observational studies were mostly cross-sectional and frequently lacked adequate control of confounding. RCTs often featured low treatment doses, suboptimal post-intervention changes in biochemical levels of vitamin D, and/or short trial durations.

Conclusion

Vitamin D level-mood associations were observed in most, but not all, observational studies; results indicated that vitamin D deficiency may be a risk factor for late-life depression. However, additional data from well-designed RCTs are required to determine the impact of vitamin D in late-life depression prevention.

### The timescale and direction of influence of a third inferior alternative in human value-learning [^11622HcR]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Context-dependent distortion following learning

Having ensured that participants complied with the task instructions, we next asked how value estimates (i.e. subjective values) varied as a function of the distractor value. Here, we analyzed the estimation data pooled across both "Feedback" and "No-Feedback" mini-blocks, as this manipulation was announced to the participants at the end of the estimation phase (see "Methods" section). We only focused on the results from the first estimation because these were not influenced by any behavior or feedback received during the choice phase. Figure 3 A, D shows the average value estimates for each alternative across contexts. In both experiments, in the first estimation, there was a statistically significant decrease of the estimated values of the two high-value alternatives in in the high-distractor context relative to the low-distractor context (two-sided t -test in Experiment 1: HV: t (29) = 5.33, p < 0.001, d = 0.97, 95% CI = [0.60, 1.35], LV: t (29) = 5.38, p < 0.001, d = 0.98, 95% CI = [0.61, 1.36]; in Experiment 2: HV: t (67) = 4.64, p < 0.001, d = 0.56, 95% CI = [0.32, 0.80], LV: t (67) = 2.14, p = 0.036, d = 0.26, 95% CI = [0.02, 0.50]; and pooled across both experiments; HV: t (97) = 6.55, p < 0.001, d = 0.66, 95% CI = [0.46, 0.86], LV: t (97) = 4.13, p < 0.001, d = 0.42, 95% CI = [0.22, 0.62]). This effect indicates that distractor-induced distortions in subjective value already occurred during the learning epoch.

### Economic analysis of the causes of drug shortages | ASPE… [^113F3wjQ]. aspe.hhs.gov (2011). Low credibility.

In most cases, sterile injectable oncology drugs are not purchased directly by consumers or reimbursed directly by insurance. Rather, these drugs are purchased by health care providers. Providers are paid for the delivery of the service that includes the drug; they are also directly paid by public and private insurers for the cost of the drugs. Under the Medicare program, reimbursement for these drugs is under Medicare Part B. Most hospitals do not purchase sterile injectable oncology drugs directly. Rather, these drugs are purchased through group purchasing organizations, which negotiate prices with generic manufacturers on behalf of their clients. GPOs typically do not take physical possession of the drugs. Instead, a wholesaler takes possession of the drug at the wholesale acquisition price and then sells the drugs to the GPO clients at the GPO negotiated price.

Once the transaction has taken place, the manufacturer will issue the wholesaler a "chargeback" if the wholesale acquisition price is higher than the GPO negotiated price. The GPO market is relatively concentrated with five GPOs commanding 85–90 percent of the market. This concentration figure may be misleading, however. While GPOs negotiate the lowest prices they can with manufacturers, based on anticipated volume of sales, their members are not compelled to purchase drugs from a contracted manufacturer, so the GPO contracts do not necessarily contain minimum quantity guarantees. Some respondents reported that hospitals not infrequently source their drugs outside the GPO structure. Increasing inventories of products or reducing the rate of capacity utilization raise supply elasticity, but also the cost of production and, ultimately, prices paid by consumers.

Private contractual vehicles — failure to supply clauses — that could induce manufacturers to hold excess inventories or manufacturing capacity exist and are in use, although they are weak. In current contracts that incorporate these clauses, penalties are generally of limited duration and the clauses are generally not binding if a shortage exists and no alternative manufacturer is producing a product. Private purchasers could choose to strengthen these clauses — but manufacturers would demand higher prices in exchange for stronger requirements. Those higher prices would go toward the cost of certifying additional input suppliers, lines of equipment, and other resources, which could be used in case of a supply shortage. New business opportunities can lead to disruptions in supply. Slowing the ability of firms to respond to new business opportunities would reduce supply disruptions but at the cost of reducing industry flexibility or passing up opportunities to improve consumer quality.

Vitamin D screening considerations in generally healthy adults — The panel noted that low vitamin D status has been linked to a number of important health problems and agreed that adverse effects may manifest only after a long latency period, with early detection plausibly improving long-term outcomes; they emphasized that the condition has a latent (preclinical) phase and that persons with positive screening results would be managed differently from those with negative results. They agreed that vitamin D supplementation is widely available, inexpensive, and highly effective at raising 25(OH)D levels, and that high- or moderate-certainty evidence supports acceptable screening test accuracy, although there is still considerable variability of 25(OH)D assays. The systematic review did not identify any studies showing that 25(OH)D testing is harmful, and the panel did not identify harms related to screening other than financial costs; additional considerations included that effective management improves patient-important outcomes when implemented in the latent phase and that any screening strategy should be cost-effective, acceptable to stakeholders, and feasible to implement. This section addresses whether to screen with a 25(OH)D test in generally healthy populations and does not specifically address how those with documented low levels of 25(OH)D should be evaluated or treated.

### The effect of delay duration on delay discounting across adulthood [^113CGbv8]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

This study investigated how delay duration influenced delay discounting across the life span by systematically varying the delay duration for the larger, later option. We hypothesized that (a) across all ages, we would see less discounting with longer time delays, and (b) age differences in discounting would only appear with longer time delays, with older adults discounting more than younger adults only for long delays (years) due to their perception of limited future time.

### Frequently asked questions about drug shortages-FDA… [^115jsZ7f]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General Questions The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines a drug shortage as a period of time when the demand or projected demand for the drug within the United States exceeds the supply of the drug. FDA tracks shortages at the national level and receives information from manufacturers about their ability to supply the market. We consider a drug to be in shortage when, on a nationwide level, supply is not meeting current demand, or if supply is not forecasted to meet projected demand.
- A permanent discontinuance in the manufacture of such products
- An interruption in the manufacture of such products that is likely to lead to a meaningful disruption in supply of those products in the United States
- A permanent discontinuance in the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredient for such products
- An interruption in the manufacture of API for such products that is likely to lead to a meaningful disruption in the supply of the API for those products.

When FDA takes an action such as sending a warning letter to a company or takes an enforcement action, is the shortage impact considered beforehand. When a shortage occurs and a firm has inventory that is close to expiry or already expired, if the company has data to support extension of the expiration dating for that inventory, FDA is able to review this and where appropriate, determine that an extended expiration date is supportable to help increase supplies until new production is available. Questions about the drug shortages database According to section 506E of the FD&C Act and FDA's regulations, the following may be cited as a reason for a particular drug shortage: Requirements related to complying with good manufacturing practices. Regulatory delay. Shortage of an active ingredient. Shortage of an inactive ingredient component. Discontinuation of the manufacture of the drug. Delay in shipping of the drug. Demand increase for the drug.

Following are definitions for each status: Currently in Shortage- A drug is currently in shortage if the demand or projected demand for the drug within the United States exceeds the supply of the drug Resolved- A shortage is considered resolved when FDA determines that supply is no longer exceeded by demand or projected demand. Discontinuation- Under section 506C of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, manufacturers are required to notify FDA of a permanent discontinuance in manufacturing of certain drug products, six months in advance, or if that is not possible, as soon as practicable.

### COVID-19, green deal and recovery plan permanently change emissions and prices in EU ETS phase IV [^111yDyYY]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Second, below the diagonal line, the direct effect is zero as the overlapping policy only reduces the demand for emission allowances after the waterbed is sealed again. However, waterbed leakage is not zero, because of the indirect effect of announced future overlapping policies on the equilibrium price path, which affects the demand for emission allowances before the waterbed is sealed. This indirect price effect is negative for policies affecting emission allowance demand after the waterbed is sealed again, meaning that overlapping policies backfire: abatement efforts lead to an increase in cumulative emissions and announced increases in the demand for emission allowances lead to a decrease in cumulative emissions (Fig. 1 a, A2 and Fig. 1 b, B2). This 'new green paradox' was first described by Rosendahl. In general, for a given duration of the waterbed puncture, the indirect effect increases with the time between the announcement of a policy and when it takes place. But as soon as the waterbed is sealed, the indirect effect becomes independent of the year in which the policy is executed. The indirect price effect is larger when (i) the waterbed is sealed later; (ii) the policy is announced today, but executed later and (iii) the period over which firms bank allowances after the waterbed is sealed is shorter. As a result of (i) and (ii), waterbed leakage is more negative in the upper-right corner of Fig. 1 a (A2) and Fig. 1 b (B2). Under the 2018 MSR design, the indirect effect is always negative and may dominate the direct effect in the years preceding the year in which the waterbed is sealed, yielding negative waterbed leakage in regions where one intuitively expects positive values (Fig. 1 a, A3). Although theoretically possible under the 2018 MSR design, we do not observe waterbed leakage below −1 in our simulations.

### Antidepressant side effects and their impact on treatment outcome in people with major depressive disorder: an iSPOT-D report [^113ThoFQ]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our results suggest that only frequency and intensity of side effects start to recede after at least 4 weeks of treatment and that anxious symptoms and the presence of anxious depression do not impact side effect severity. Furthermore, burden of side effects that are present as early as 4 days post-treatment predicts poorer treatment outcome and should be monitored closely.

### The timescale and direction of influence of a third inferior alternative in human value-learning [^115oirBq]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Driven by the above, we here probed distractor effects within a single experimental paradigm that does not tap upon complex cognitive processes evoking alternative interpretations for distractor effects. In particular, we used a simple value-learning task previously shown to induce a negative distractor effect in primates. Like in previous studies, to assess the magnitude of the distractor effect, we varied the value of the distractor value (DV) across contexts (experimental mini-blocks). Our design differed from previous studies, in the following aspects. First, in our task, learning and choice were separated such that the reward values associated with each alternative were independently learned before the choice phase. Second, we interleaved a value estimation task immediately after the learning phase so that we could directly gauge people's subjective values before the onset of the choice phase. That way we could ask whether value distortions already present at the end of the learning epoch, could explain away context effects occurring in the choice phase, consistent with the temporal-context account (Fig. 1 C, E). Finally, in the choice phase, we interleaved binary and ternary choice trials. Comparing the relative choice of higher-value (HV) over lower-value (LV) in these two trial types, we could assess the extent to which the immediate availability of the distractor alternative affects choice (Fig. 1 B, D, immediate-context account).

### Baclofen [^116pKMLu]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The determination of optimal dosage requires individual titration. Start therapy at a low dosage and increase gradually until optimum effect is achieved (usually between 40–80 mg daily).

The following dosage titration schedule is suggested:

5 mg t.i.d. for 3 days

10 mg t.i.d. for 3 days

15 mg t.i.d. for 3 days

20 mg t.i.d. for 3 days

Thereafter additional increases may be necessary but the total daily dose should not exceed a maximum of 80 mg daily (20 mg q.i.d.).

The lowest dose compatible with an optimal response is recommended. If benefits are not evident after a reasonable trial period, patients should be slowly withdrawn from the drug (See WARNINGS, Abrupt Drug Withdrawal).

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111crY8T]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — evidence for diabetes prevention in adults with prediabetes: The commissioned systematic review included 11 RCTs on new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes (total of 5316 participants), conducted in India (n = 4), Iran (n = 1), Greece (n = 1), Norway (n = 1), Japan (n = 1), and the United States (n = 3). In pooled analyses, vitamin D reduced the risk of developing diabetes (RR 0.90 [95% CI, 0.81–1.00]), and including the DPVD trial produced similar results (RR 0.90 [95% CI, 0.81–0.99]). An individual participant data meta-analysis of the 3 vitamin D trials (total of 4190 participants) showed a 15% reduction in new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes randomized to vitamin D compared to placebo (HR 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75–0.96]). The beneficial effect of vitamin D on diabetes risk was described as consistent across subgroups by risk of bias or vitamin D dosage.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113MZr5G]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Prediabetes — other evidence-to-decision considerations emphasize availability, costs, feasibility, acceptability, and equity. Vitamin D is generally available over the counter and inexpensive, and there are no cost-effectiveness studies of vitamin D for preventing diabetes, fractures, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, or respiratory infections in adults with prediabetes. Because non–vitamin D interventions to prevent diabetes have substantial economic value yet are more burdensome, the panel reasoned there are likely cost savings with using vitamin D for diabetes prevention. The panel judged vitamin D use would be acceptable to adults with prediabetes and to other stakeholders and, given ease of administration and low cost, judged empiric vitamin D to lower diabetes risk as feasible for adults with prediabetes. The panel also judged that using vitamin D in adults with prediabetes would likely have a favorable impact on health equity, especially in low-resource environments.

### Between-person and within-person effects in the temporal relationship between depressive symptoms and cognitive function [^112pmug5]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

We aimed to disentangle within-person and between-person effects in the temporal relationship between depressive symptoms and cognitive function.

Methods

We performed a prospective population-based cohort study on participants of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe. Cognitive function was assessed by tests on verbal fluency, immediate recall and delayed recall. Depressive symptoms were measured with EURO-D scale. To determine the temporal order of the association between cognitive function and depressive symptoms, we employed the fully saturated cross-lagged panel model (between-person effects), and random intercept cross-lagged panel model (within-person effects).

Results

In 59,311 participants (mean age 65, ranging 46–100), between-person effects showed a bi-directional relationship that could be seen in three stages: First, the effect of cognitive function on depressive symptoms was initially slightly stronger than vice versa. Second, the effect of depressive symptoms on cognitive function became stronger during the follow-up. Third, all effects were small and no direction dominated. Within-person effects, however, revealed a dominant effect from depressive symptoms on cognitive function. Some effects from cognitive function on depressive symptoms were apparent only in older adults, in particular men. All effects were small and strongest for individuals aged 65 years and above.

Limitations

The sample is healthier than general population and thus not fully representative. A comprehensive cognitive battery was not available.

Conclusions

Long-term relationship between depressive symptoms and cognitive function is bi-directional. However, to achieve improvement in an individual in the short-term, the focus should be on decreasing depressive symptoms to improve cognitive function.

### Vitamin D supplementation and prevention of type 2 diabetes [^112D3B5M]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Observational studies support an association between a low blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, whether vitamin D supplementation lowers the risk of diabetes is unknown.

Methods

We randomly assigned adults who met at least two of three glycemic criteria for prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose level, 100 to 125 mg per deciliter; plasma glucose level 2 hours after a 75-g oral glucose load, 140 to 199 mg per deciliter; and glycated hemoglobin level, 5.7 to 6.4%) and no diagnostic criteria for diabetes to receive 4000 IU per day of vitamin D 3 or placebo, regardless of the baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. The primary outcome in this time-to-event analysis was new-onset diabetes, and the trial design was event-driven, with a target number of diabetes events of 508.

Results

A total of 2423 participants underwent randomization (1211 to the vitamin D group and 1212 to the placebo group). By month 24, the mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in the vitamin D group was 54.3 ng per milliliter (from 27.7 ng per milliliter at baseline), as compared with 28.8 ng per milliliter in the placebo group (from 28.2 ng per milliliter at baseline). After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, the primary outcome of diabetes occurred in 293 participants in the vitamin D group and 323 in the placebo group (9.39 and 10.66 events per 100 person-years, respectively). The hazard ratio for vitamin D as compared with placebo was 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.04; P = 0.12). The incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups.

Conclusions

Among persons at high risk for type 2 diabetes not selected for vitamin D insufficiency, vitamin D 3 supplementation at a dose of 4000 IU per day did not result in a significantly lower risk of diabetes than placebo.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^115vm8mU]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The use and consequences of limited economic evaluation of new medicines

A somewhat speculative argument can be made that the widespread application of standard CEA has an economic effect and a subtle political effect with potentially large unintended adverse consequences. First, it may be that R&D spending on the development of new medicines is distorted by suppressed incentives due to certain payors not considering the full societal benefits of medicines. Essentially, because some developed countries are using CEA as a bargaining tool to secure lower prices that are actually below what their citizens would be able and willing to pay, they are both free riders on the global R&D investment and possibly causing some innovation to go unfunded. The political effect is that these underestimations of value based on conventional CEA and lower prices outside the USA have been used to argue that Americans are paying more than they should truly be willing to pay. As a result, we would argue, the new US Inflation Reduction Act has been passed as a toe in the price-control water, with an inadequate understanding of what full immersion will imply.

Countries that rely on central planning and traditional CEA as their justification for capping the prices may be using it as an excuse to pay less. What can be harmful about these countries using traditional CEA to justify their unwillingness to pay anywhere close to US prices (or else to limit their patients' access, thereby cutting the revenues they contribute) is that these analyses may give the US public, policymakers, physicians, and payers the impression that medicines are not worth what the US is paying for them. Traditional CEA can thus give the impression that the US market-based system is broken and in need of a regulatory fix, namely price controls. But when viewed in terms of aggregate impact, a good case can be made that the US's patent-based, market-based competitive framework is working reasonably well, despite an imperfect national insurance system, to bring about affordable biomedical innovation that benefits not only US citizens, but everyone worldwide. Should US policymakers impose price controls on novel medicines in a misguided effort to spare US payers from overpaying, they would be undermining innovation that would be cost-effective for the US and beneficial globally.

### Tolvaptan in later-stage autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^115cUSsY]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The study REPRISE was published by Torres VE and colleagues in 2017 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. In the REPRISE study, the trial question was: what is the effect of tolvaptan in patients with later-stage autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease? In the REPRISE study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the REPRISE study, the population was: 1370 patients (690 female, 680 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with later-stage autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy or lactation; need for chronic diuretic use; hepatic impairment or liver function abnormalities other than that expected for ADPKD; advanced diabetes; contraindications to required trial assessments. In the REPRISE study, the interventions were: n = 683 tolvaptan (daily morning and after doses of 90 mg and 30 mg; 60 mg and 30 mg; or 45 mg and 15 mg, or less for 12 months) n = 687 placebo (mock morning and afternoon doses of 90 mg and 30 mg; 60 mg and 30 mg; or 45 mg and 15 mg, or less for 12 months). In the REPRISE study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in decline in estimated GFR at 1 year (-2.34 vs. -3.61; difference 1.27, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.68). In the REPRISE study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in slopes of the change in the estimated GFR at 1 year (-3.16 vs. -4.17; difference 1.01, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.4). In the REPRISE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in the rates of new or worsening adverse events. In the REPRISE study, the conclusion was: in patients with later-stage autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, tolvaptan was superior to placebo with respect to decline in estimated GFR at 1 year.

### Dose-rate effect on proliferation suppression in human cell lines continuously exposed to γ rays [^112kbW3j]. Radiation Research (2011). Low credibility.

Irradiation time and dose rate are important factors in the evaluation of radiation risk for human health. We previously proposed a novel dose-rate effect model, the modified exponential (MOE) model, which predicts that radiation risks decline exponentially as the dose rate decreases. Here we show that, during the early phase of exposure, up to 1000 h, the proliferation of cells continuously exposed to γ rays at a constant dose rate is gradually suppressed, even as the total dose increases. This trend holds for a number of cell lines including tumor cells, nontransformed fibroblasts and leukocytes. The accumulation of total dose by longer exposure times does not increase this suppressive effect even in cells with a defective DNA repair system, suggesting that risk is determined solely by dose rate in the later phase. The dose-rate effect in the early phase follows the MOE model in DNA repair-proficient cell lines, while cells with impaired DNA-PK or ATM show no dose-rate effect. In the later phase, however, a certain dose-rate effect is observed even in mutant cell lines, and suppression of cell proliferation no longer follows the MOE model. Our results suggest that a distinct mechanism that can operate in the absence of intact DNA-PK or ATM influences the dose-rate effect in the later phase of continuous radiation exposure.

In the WOMAN-2 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of tranexamic acid on postpartum hemorrhage in women with moderate-to-severe anemia? In the WOMAN-2 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the WOMAN-2 study, the population was: 15068 female patients. The inclusion criteria were women with moderate-to-severe anemia. The key exclusion criteria were indication for or contraindication to tranexamic acid; allergy to tranexamic acid or its components; postpartum hemorrhage before the umbilical cord is cut or clamped. In the WOMAN-2 study, the interventions were: n = 7580 tranexamic acid (at an intravenous dose of 1 g as soon as possible but no later than 15 minutes after umbilical cord is cut or clamped) n = 7488 placebo (matching placebo intravenous injection). In the WOMAN-2 study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in clinically diagnosed postpartum hemorrhage (7% vs. 6.6%; RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.19). In the WOMAN-2 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in mean estimated blood loss (309.8 mL vs. 310.8 mL; AD -0.95 mL, 95% CI -7.1 to 5.21) No significant difference in mean corrected 24-hour hemoglobin (82.2 g/L vs. 82.1 g/L; AD 0.12 g/L, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.5) No significant difference in death or near miss at 24 hours (1.6% vs. 1.8%; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.12). In the WOMAN-2 study, the conclusion was: in women with moderate-to-severe anemia, tranexamic acid was not superior to placebo with respect to clinically diagnosed postpartum hemorrhage.

### Early high-dose vitamin dfor critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients [^114Di1YQ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Vitamin D deficiency is a common, potentially reversible contributor to morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients. The potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation in acute critical illness require further study.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial of early vitamin D 3 supplementation in critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients who were at high risk for death. Randomization occurred within 12 hours after the decision to admit the patient to an intensive care unit. Eligible patients received a single enteral dose of 540,000 IU of vitamin D 3 or matched placebo. The primary end point was 90-day all-cause, all-location mortality.

Results

A total of 1360 patients were found to be vitamin D-deficient during point-of-care screening and underwent randomization. Of these patients, 1078 had baseline vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D level, < 20 ng per milliliter [50 nmol per liter]) confirmed by subsequent testing and were included in the primary analysis population. The mean day 3 level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was 46.9 ± 23.2 ng per milliliter (117 ± 58 nmol per liter) in the vitamin D group and 11.4 ± 5.6 ng per milliliter (28 ± 14 nmol per liter) in the placebo group (difference, 35.5 ng per milliliter; 95% confidence interval [CI] 31.5 to 39.6). The 90-day mortality was 23.5% in the vitamin D group (125 of 531 patients) and 20.6% in the placebo group (109 of 528 patients) (difference, 2.9 percentage points; 95% CI, -2.1 to 7.9; P = 0.26). There were no clinically important differences between the groups with respect to secondary clinical, physiological, or safety end points. The severity of vitamin D deficiency at baseline did not affect the association between the treatment assignment and mortality.

Conclusions

Early administration of high-dose enteral vitamin D 3 did not provide an advantage over placebo with respect to 90-day mortality or other, nonfatal outcomes among critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients.

### Biological factors influencing depression in later life: role of aging processes and treatment implications [^117QCLHt]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Late-life depression (LLD) is major depressive disorder (MDD) occurring in adults age 60 years or older. It is common, with ~5% of community-dwelling elders meeting DSM5 diagnostic criteria and 10–16% of older adults exhibiting clinically significant depressive symptoms that may not meet full criteria. LLD is a malignant illness that increases disability, contributes to poorer medical outcomes, and is associated with increased suicide risk and mortality.

LLD is further characterized by poor or impaired cognitive performance. Reduced executive functioning is common, affecting verbal fluency, response inhibition, set-shifting, working memory, and problem-solving. Individuals with LLD also exhibit poor performance in other cognitive domains, including episodic memory, visuospatial skills, and processing speed. Slower processing speed is particularly important, partly mediating impaired performance in other cognitive domains. Although cognitive performance improves with successful treatment, deficits typically persist, and older depressed adults have an increased risk of dementia.

Such adverse outcomes may be related to LLD's recurrent nature. LLD is often a recurrent or chronic illness, although continuing antidepressant medication during remission reduces recurrence risk. However, even with maintenance treatment, ~35–40% of depressed elders experience recurrence in 2 years, with over 50% experiencing recurrence over four years.

Recurrence is particularly relevant for individuals with an initial onset of depression in early- or midlife. These individuals often experience multiple prior depressive episodes and are now in the geriatric age range. Individuals with early-onset LLD, typically defined as occurring before age 50–60 years, exhibit greater residual depression severity over time, more frequent suicidal thoughts, and a greater risk of recurrence following remission. Early-onset depression is characterized by stronger familial history and genetic loading, greater anxiety and reactions to stressful life events, maladaptive personality traits, and hormonal fluctuations associated with early-life reproductive events. Individuals with late-onset depression are more often widowed, present with more apathy and somatic symptoms, poorer cognitive performance, greater cognitive decline and medical morbidity, and more severe atrophic and vascular changes on neuroimaging. Although useful for clinical characterization, this age of onset dichotomization obfuscates potentially important differences in causal factors that influence the onset or recurrence of depression across the lifespan. Moreover, it does not address a parallel hypothesis that depression itself is toxic, with recurrent episodes increasing the allostatic load or "wear and tear" on the body, contributing to accelerated brain aging and vulnerability to poor longitudinal clinical, cognitive, and medical outcomes.

### Early versus later anticoagulation for stroke with atrial fibrillation [^1178XS48]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

The effect of early as compared with later initiation of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in persons with atrial fibrillation who have had an acute ischemic stroke is unclear.

Methods

We performed an investigator-initiated, open-label trial at 103 sites in 15 countries. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to early anticoagulation (within 48 hours after a minor or moderate stroke or on day 6 or 7 after a major stroke) or later anticoagulation (day 3 or 4 after a minor stroke, day 6 or 7 after a moderate stroke, or day 12, 13, or 14 after a major stroke). Assessors were unaware of the trial-group assignments. The primary outcome was a composite of recurrent ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, major extracranial bleeding, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, or vascular death within 30 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes included the components of the composite primary outcome at 30 and 90 days.

Results

Of 2013 participants (37% with minor stroke, 40% with moderate stroke, and 23% with major stroke), 1006 were assigned to early anticoagulation and 1007 to later anticoagulation. A primary-outcome event occurred in 29 participants (2.9%) in the early-treatment group and 41 participants (4.1%) in the later-treatment group (risk difference, -1.18 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.84 to 0.47) by 30 days. Recurrent ischemic stroke occurred in 14 participants (1.4%) in the early-treatment group and 25 participants (2.5%) in the later-treatment group (odds ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.29 to 1.07) by 30 days and in 18 participants (1.9%) and 30 participants (3.1%), respectively, by 90 days (odds ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.33 to 1.06). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 2 participants (0.2%) in both groups by 30 days.

Conclusions

In this trial, the incidence of recurrent ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, major extracranial bleeding, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, or vascular death at 30 days was estimated to range from 2.8 percentage points lower to 0.5 percentage points higher (based on the 95% confidence interval) with early than with later use of DOACs.

### The adverse effect of modifiable dementia risk factors on cognition amplifies across the adult lifespan [^111EwB2w]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2022). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Dementia has a long preclinical period, which highlights a need to study risk factors and cognitive impacts long before a clinical diagnosis of dementia. The life‐course model offers encouraging evidence that a large percentage of dementia risk is modifiable. Our findings align with current recommendations that targeting dementia prevention over the lifespan offers large potential benefits for individuals and society at large.

### Validation of a simplified tissue-to-reference ratio measurement using SUVR to assess synaptic density alterations in Alzheimer disease with [C] UCB-J PET [^1145YRqp]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Participant characteristics are shown in Table 1.

TABLE 1.
Participant Characteristics

DVR correlated strongly with SUVR across all brain regions and within each region (Fig. 1; Supplemental Fig. 1; Supplemental Table 2). The correlation was strongest for the 60- to 90-min and 70- to 90-min scan windows and weakest for the 30- to 50-min window. A similar pattern was seen in all participants or when CN or AD participants were analyzed separately. A comparison of regression lines to the line of identity showed that SUVR was less biased at later scan windows than at earlier scan windows (Fig. 1).

FIGURE 1.
Correlations between DVR and SUVR at 30–60 min (A), 60–90 min (B), 30–50 min (C), and 70–90 min (D) for all participants and for CN and AD groups in all regions of interest.

The effect sizes for the difference between CN and AD groups using SUVR were larger during earlier scan windows than during later scan windows, with the largest effect size being calculated for the 30- to 50-min scan window (Cohen d = 0.78) and the smallest effect being calculated for the 70- to 90-min window (Cohen d = 0.6) (Table 2). The effect size for SUVR at each scan window correlated strongly with the effect size for DVR (Table 2; Fig. 2). Early scan windows tended to overestimate the effect size, and later scan windows tended to underestimate the effect size, compared with DVR (Fig. 2). For specific regions, the same pattern of decreasing effect size at later time windows was consistently seen in the entorhinal cortex, lateral temporal cortex, prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulum/precuneus, lateral parietal cortex, lateral occipital cortex, and medial occipital cortex (Fig. 3; Supplemental Fig. 2).

### Differential effects of oral boluses of vitamin D2 vs vitamin D3 on vitamin D metabolism: a randomized controlled trial [^111XaoVF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Context

Vitamin D 2 and vitamin D 3 have been hypothesized to exert differential effects on vitamin D metabolism.

Objective

To compare the influence of administering vitamin D 2 vs vitamin D 3 on metabolism of vitamin D 3.

Methods

We measured baseline and 4-month serum concentrations of vitamin D 3, 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 [25(OH)D 3], 25-hydroxyvitamin D 2, 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [24R,25(OH) 2 D 3], 1 α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3], and 4 β,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [4 β,25(OH) 2 D 3] in 52 adults randomized to receive a total of four oral bolus doses of 2.5 mg vitamin D 2 (n = 28) or vitamin D 3 (n = 24) over four months. Metabolite-to-parent compound ratios were calculated to estimate hydroxylase activity. Pairwise before vs after comparisons were made to evaluate effects of vitamin D 2 and vitamin D 3 on metabolism of vitamin D. Mean postsupplementation metabolite-to-parent ratios were then compared between groups.

Results

Vitamin D 2 was less effective than vitamin D 3 in elevating total serum 25(OH)D concentration. Vitamin D 2 suppressed mean four-month serum concentrations of 25(OH)D 3, 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3, 1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3, and 4 β,25(OH) 2 D 3 and mean ratios of 25(OH)D 3 to D 3 and 1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3, while increasing the mean ratio of 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3. Vitamin D 3 increased mean four-month serum concentrations of 25(OH)D 3, 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3, 1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3, and 4 β,25(OH) 2 D 3 and the mean ratio of 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3. Participants receiving vitamin D 2 had lower mean postsupplementation ratios of 25(OH)D 3 to vitamin D 3 and 1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3 than those receiving vitamin D 3. Mean postsupplementation ratios of 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3 and 4 β,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3 did not differ between groups.

Conclusions

Bolus-dose vitamin D 2 is less effective than bolus-dose vitamin D 3 in elevating total serum 25(OH)D concentration. Administration of vitamin D 2 reduces 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D 3 and 1- α hydroxylation of 25(OH)D 3, while increasing 24R-hydroxylation of 25(OH)D 3.

### The date / delay effect in intertemporal choice: a combined fMRI and eye-tracking study [^116bwdt7]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Choosing between smaller rewards available sooner and larger rewards available later is known as intertemporal choice. When making such choices, people typically prefer smaller but earlier rewards to larger but later rewards, devaluing future rewards as a function of time. This phenomenon is referred to as temporal discounting (Frederick et al.). Higher temporal discounting has been associated with negative life outcomes (e.g. higher credit debts, more risky behaviour) in the general population (Keidel et al.) and has been documented for a broad range of mental disorders (Amlung et al.). Various experimental manipulations have been shown to attenuate temporal discounting (Rung & Madden; H. Scholten et al.), including the date/delay effect (LeBoeuf; Read et al.): People discount future rewards less when time until receipt of rewards is framed in terms of dates (date condition; e.g. 8th June 2023) instead of delay units (delay condition; e.g. 30 days). While this effect has been replicated several times (Dshemuchadse et al; Jiang & Dai; Keidel, Murawski, & Ettinger; Keidel, Murawski, Pantelis, & Ettinger; Naudé et al.), its cognitive and neural underpinnings are still ambiguous. We therefore combined, for the first time, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with eye‐tracking to investigate the neural and cognitive mechanisms of the date/delay effect.

### Temporal dynamics of the flash-induced bouncing effect [^113R4Mdr]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

Although these transient‐induced bouncing effects have been consistently replicated, there are still considerable controversies about their underlying processing mechanisms. One representative hypothesis held that these transient‐induced bouncing effects occur at the perceptual stage of processing (e.g. Berger & Ehrsson, 2017; Dufour et al. 2008; Remijn et al. 2004; Watanabe & Shimojo, 2001b). Specifically, this hypothesis proposed that the salient visual or auditory transient presented at the moment of the two disks' coincidence makes the observers genuinely see the two disks reverse their motion after coincidence and return to their original starting position. Contrary to the perceptual hypothesis, the inference hypothesis proposed that the transient‐induced bouncing effects originate from shifted cognitive bias by the transient at late decision‐making stage (e.g. Adams & Grove, 2018; Grove et al. 2012; Grove, Robertson, & Harris, 2016; Grove & Sakurai, 2009; Zeljko & Grove, 2016). That is, the transient appearing at the coincident moment of the two disks imitates the causal consequence (i.e. a release of sound or light energy) when two objects collide in the natural environment. According to this real‐life experience, observers can infer in a post hoc manner that the two disks were more likely to bounce off each other after the coincident transient onset (for details, see Adams & Grove, 2018).

### Adaptive food price forecasting improves public information in times of rapid economic change [^111mUNzU]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Fig. 6
The relationship between U.S. monetary policy and food prices changes over time.

The expected percent change in annual food-at-home prices following monthly increases of the money supply principal component analysis index with 68, 90, and 95% prediction intervals in 2002 (a), 2009 (b), 2016 (c), and 2023 (d).

An expanding money supply may increase consumer willingness to pay for food or alter competition for inputs along the supply chain. It also increases the derived demand for labour, materials, and transportation throughout the economy, not just within the food system. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, Fig. 6 shows how price expectations increase with a growing money supply. Before the onset of COVID-19, we observe a general decrease in the strength of the relationship between the money supply and food prices. In 2023, moving from a 50% annual decrease in the money-supply PCAI to a 300% annual increase leads to an expected increase in the food-at-home inflation rate from 3.0 to 10.8%. The direction of the effect provides forecasters with an unambiguous signal on how to inform policymakers about the likely effects of their policy choices. The caveat that all forecasts tend to perform better when series remain within historical ranges, which the money supply did not between 2020 and 2023, should accompany this and similar projections.

The forecasts and projections discussed here use data as they are publicly released. Beyond applying the appropriate forecasting methods, the timeliness and quality of information are crucial to improving public decision-making. Alternative public or proprietary data, as well as nowcasting, provide promising avenues for enhancing forecast precision, more rapidly anticipating changes (as seen in 2022), and reducing uncertainty arising from reporting delays and measurement errors –.

### The adverse effect of modifiable dementia risk factors on cognition amplifies across the adult lifespan [^112cux9S]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Dementia is considered the biggest global challenge for health care in the 21st century. The lack of disease‐modifying treatments for dementia, along with knowledge that neuropathology develops decades before disease onset, has led to a growing interest in primary prevention approaches. The latest Lancet Commissions on dementia prevention, intervention, and care synthesized the available evidence to propose a novel life‐course model of dementia risk, which proposes that reversible lifestyle behaviors from different phases of the lifespan collectively account for 40% of dementias worldwide. Thus 40% of dementias worldwide could be prevented or delayed if these risk factors were addressed.

The effects of individual modifiable risk factors on accelerated cognitive decline and dementia have been established. Recent research has moved from a focus on individual risk factors toward a broader consideration of the cumulative impact of multiple factors. Risk factors studied in combination indicate a dose‐response gradient, whereby an increase in risk factors is correlated with greater cognitive decline and incident dementia, regardless of the type of risk factor.,

The model developed by the Lancet Commissions, takes a life‐course perspective, which considers dementia as a product of the accumulation of risk factors over life (seefor details on a life‐course perspective). Nevertheless, reviews on modifiable risk factor studies show that prevalence and dose‐response data are minimal to non‐existent in young and middle‐aged adults. Previous work has offered promising insights on risk factor prevalence and dose‐response effects among older adults, providing an opportunity to study whether this extends to young and middle‐aged adults. Studying the period of early adulthood is important so that risk factors can be addressed as early as possible. Growing evidence suggests that aging‐related cognitive decline begins in younger adulthood, which extends the critical period for targeting risk factors from older adulthood to early adulthood. In the current study, we build on past work, using a web‐based assessmentto test whether the prevalence of modifiable risk factors for dementia and their dose‐response relationship with cognition is moderated by age.

### Methodology for lung cancer evidence review and guideline development: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) [^116uUDLz]. Chest (2007). Medium credibility.

ACCP evidence grading framework for lung cancer guidelines combines recommendation strength and evidence quality into final grades. Weak recommendations are "those for which the benefits and harms are more equally balanced, and thus a clear choice is not as obvious; these are graded with a 2". Strong recommendations are phrased "we recommend", whereas weak recommendations are phrased "we suggest". Evidence quality carries a letter score "A, B, or C", and "RCTs start with a high score but might be downgraded to moderate or even low based on the following criteria: limitations in the study design or conduct of the trial, imprecision, indirectness relative to the specifics of the PICO question, inconsistency in the results, and risk of reporting bias". "Observational studies, on the other hand, start off as low-level evidence but can be upgraded to moderate or even high if exceptionally large and consistent treatment effects increase confidence in the findings, especially if there is a strong dose-response gradient". "The final grades are combinations reflecting the strength of the recommendation and the quality of the evidence". "Strong recommendations with high-quality evidence, grade of 1A, are less common", and "These recommendations apply to most patients in most circumstances". As grades decline, "patient values and preferences likely would play an increasingly greater role in determining the best treatments or interventions for each patient".

### Incobotulinumtoxina (Xeomin) [^113r1TMp]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNING: DISTANT SPREAD OF TOXIN EFFECT

Postmarketing reports indicate that the effects of XEOMIN and all botulinum toxin products may spread from the area of injection to produce symptoms consistent with botulinum toxin effects. These may include asthenia, generalized muscle weakness, diplopia, blurred vision, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, dysarthria, urinary incontinence and breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection. Swallowing and breathing difficulties can be life threatening and there have been reports of death. The risk of symptoms is probably greatest in children treated for spasticity but symptoms can also occur in adults treated for spasticity and other conditions, particularly in those patients who have underlying conditions that would predispose them to these symptoms. In unapproved uses, including lower limb spasticity in children, and in approved indications, cases of spread of effect have been reported at doses comparable to those used to treat cervical dystonia and at lower doses [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Differential effects of oral boluses of vitamin D2 vs vitamin D3 on vitamin D metabolism: a randomized controlled trial [^1111rS7K]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 have been hypothesized to exert differential effects on vitamin D metabolism.

Objective

To compare the influence of administering vitamin D2 vs vitamin D3 on metabolism of vitamin D3.

Methods

We measured baseline and 4-month serum concentrations of vitamin D3, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3], 25-hydroxyvitamin D2, 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [24R,25(OH)2D3], 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1α,25(OH)2D3], and 4β,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [4β,25(OH)2D3] in 52 adults randomized to receive a total of four oral bolus doses of 2.5 mg vitamin D2 (n = 28) or vitamin D3 (n = 24) over four months. Metabolite-to-parent compound ratios were calculated to estimate hydroxylase activity. Pairwise before vs after comparisons were made to evaluate effects of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 on metabolism of vitamin D. Mean postsupplementation metabolite-to-parent ratios were then compared between groups.

Results

Vitamin D2 was less effective than vitamin D3 in elevating total serum 25(OH)D concentration. Vitamin D2 suppressed mean four-month serum concentrations of 25(OH)D3, 24R,25(OH)2D3, 1α,25(OH)2D3, and 4β,25(OH)2D3 and mean ratios of 25(OH)D3 to D3 and 1α,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3, while increasing the mean ratio of 24R,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3. Vitamin D3 increased mean four-month serum concentrations of 25(OH)D3, 24R,25(OH)2D3, 1α,25(OH)2D3, and 4β,25(OH)2D3 and the mean ratio of 24R,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3. Participants receiving vitamin D2 had lower mean postsupplementation ratios of 25(OH)D3 to vitamin D3 and 1α,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3 than those receiving vitamin D3. Mean postsupplementation ratios of 24R,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3 and 4β,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3 did not differ between groups.

Conclusions

Bolus-dose vitamin D2 is less effective than bolus-dose vitamin D3 in elevating total serum 25(OH)D concentration. Administration of vitamin D2 reduces 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D3 and 1-α hydroxylation of 25(OH)D3, while increasing 24R-hydroxylation of 25(OH)D3.

### Neurofunctional underpinnings of individual differences in visual episodic memory performance [^116bVQzc]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Comparison of voxel-based analyses

Next, we compared the memorability-corrected subsequent memory effects with the voxel-based brain–behavior correlations. Since the classical subsequent memory effects encompasses picture memorability-related activations that are similar across subjects, we used the memorability-corrected subsequent memory effects for this comparison. All brain regions with whole-brain-corrected brain–behavior correlations (Fig. 4) also demonstrated whole-brain-corrected memorability-controlled subsequent memory effects (Fig. 3). However, several memorability-controlled subsequent memory effects were located in brain regions that did not show brain–behavior correlations. To map out these regions more precisely, we examined the residuals of a regression analysis between the memorability-corrected subsequent memory effect analysis and the brain–behavior correlation analysis (Fig. S9). Regions where the brain–behavior correlations were lower than expected based on the memorability-corrected subsequent memory effects were mainly found in the left and right inferior and superior lateral occipital cortex (Fig. 6).

### Defining the time-limited trial for patients with critical illness: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^117JMNAL]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2024). High credibility.

Table 4: Prioritized future questions for time-limited trials in critical care outlines key unanswered questions by stakeholder. For patients, surrogates, and families, questions address perspectives on the concept, best communication wording, benefits and harms, ensuring a collaborative process centered on the patient's perspective, participation factors, and effects on trust in clinicians and health systems. For interprofessional clinicians who care for critically ill patients, questions are grouped by "Consider phase", "Plan phase", "Support phase", and "Reassess phase", and address identifying appropriate patients, uncertainty, determining and tailoring duration, clinical criteria of improvement and/or deterioration, documentation, dissemination across large teams and staffing rotations, defining major changes warranting reconsideration, and addressing unanticipated changes or rotational revisits to plans. For health systems, questions focus on supporting optimal implementation, impacts on health systems, and ensuring systemic biases do not propagate inequities.

### Risk of bias in network meta-analysis (RoB NMA) tool [^113k9uSV]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Domain 2: effect modifiers

The second domain targets effect modifiers. In the context of a meta-analysis, an effect modifier is a study level characteristic that is a cause of heterogeneity in the intervention effects across studies. In an NMA, the transitivity assumption is met when effect modifiers are equivalently distributed across comparisons. Although studies included in a meta-analysis will inevitably differ in many ways, only a subset of these differences is likely to be a result of effect modifiers. Variation in effect modifiers should be kept as low as possible to minimise heterogeneity and ensure the validity of any meta-analysis (pairwise meta-analysis or an NMA).

In an NMA, effect modifiers can also affect the validity of the transitivity assumption, if systematic differences exist in the effect modifiers across the different direct comparisons in the network. Results of an NMA are generally considered to be more sensitive to differences in effect modifiers between direct comparisons (often called incoherence or inconsistency) than they are to differences within direct comparisons (usually termed heterogeneity). Baker and Kramer provide examples where the transitivity assumption is violated because effect modifiers differ across comparisons.

The first three signalling statements in this domain aim to identify whether important differences exist in effect modifiers across comparisons for three types of effect modifiers separately: outcome definitions and time points, participant characteristics, and study characteristics. Effect modifiers should be sufficiently similar across the studies included, even in a pairwise meta-analysis. Sufficiently similar here means similar in aspects that will influence the effects of the interventions. The fourth signalling statement is used to determine whether the NMA authors could overcome any problems identified by the first three items. The fourth statement is considered only if a problem is identified in one of the first three items.

2.1 Outcome definitions and time points were similar across direct comparisons in the network

Background

Some degree of variability in outcome definitions and time points is usually to be expected in a meta-analysis. The specific question answered by this signalling statement is whether systematic differences exist in outcome definitions (including measurement methods) or time points (eg, response at six weeks v 12 months) across the different direct comparisons made by studies in the network. Differences in outcome definitions or time points can be dealt with in NMA with meta-regression or certain types of mixed effects models. Alternatively, subgroup analyses can be performed to analyse different outcome definitions or time points separately, or sensitivity analysis may show that the effect of including different outcome definitions and time points is minimal.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^112oobrL]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRHa) treatment in transgender and gender diverse adolescents — puberty suppression effects, availability, and bone health considerations are described as follows: GnRHa treatment leads to partial regression of secondary sex characteristics, and if treatment is started at Tanner stage 2, the breast tissue may disappear completely; menarche can be prevented or discontinued, and in adolescents with functioning testes, testicular volume will regress to a lower volume. When started in the later phases of pubertal development, some physical changes do not regress completely even though the pubertal development may be stopped. In individuals with central precocious puberty, GnRHas have been used since 1981 and are regarded as both safe and effective, with no known long-term adverse effects, whereas the use of GnRHas in TGD adolescents is considered off-label; available data demonstrate effectiveness in delaying the onset of puberty although the long-term effects on bone mass have not been well established. GnRHas are described as a medically necessary treatment but may not be available, so other approaches should be considered, such as oral or injectable progestin formulations. For adolescents older than 14 years, there are currently no data to inform whether GnRHAs can be administered as monotherapy without posing a significant risk to skeletal health, and a prolonged hypogonadal state in adolescence is often associated with an increased risk of poor bone health later in life. When deciding on the duration of GnRHa monotherapy, all contributing factors should be considered, and a multidisciplinary team and an ongoing clinical relationship with the adolescent and the family should be maintained when initiating GnRHa treatment.

### Nusinersen (Spinraza) [^114fs78u]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Later-Onset SMA

Study 2 (NCT02292537) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, sham-procedure controlled study in 126 symptomatic children with later-onset SMA (symptom onset after 6 months of age). Patients were randomized 2:1 to either SPINRAZA 12 mg or sham injection as a series of loading doses administered intrathecally followed by maintenance doses administered every 6 months.

The median age at screening was 3 years (range 2–9 years), and the median age of onset of clinical signs and symptoms of SMA was 11 months (range 6–20 months). Of the 126 patients included in the study, 47% were male, 75% were Caucasian, 2% were Black, and 18% were Asian. Length of treatment ranged from 324 to 482 days (median 450 days). At baseline, patients had a mean Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale – Expanded (HFMSE) score of 21.6, all had achieved independent sitting, and no patients had achieved independent walking. Patients in this study were deemed most likely to develop Type 2 or 3 SMA.

The primary endpoint assessed was the change from baseline score at Month 15 on the HFMSE. The HFMSE evaluates motor function in patients with SMA who have limited ambulation, comprising of 33 scored activities that give objective information on motor ability and clinical progression, such as the ability to sit unassisted, stand, or walk. Each item is scored from 0–2, with a maximum total score of 66. Higher scores indicate better motor function. The primary analysis was conducted in the Intent to Treat (ITT) population, which included all subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of SPINRAZA or at least one sham procedure. At the final analysis, a statistically significant improvement in HFMSE scores from baseline to Month 15 was observed in the SPINRAZA-treated group compared to the sham-control group (Table 5).

### New designs for phase 2 clinical trials [^115KagGs]. Blood (2003). Low credibility.

Conventional phase 2 clinical trials are typically single-arm experiments, with outcome characterized by one binary "response" variable. Clinical investigators are poorly served by such conventional methodology. We contend that phase 2 trials are inherently comparative, with the results of the comparison determining whether to conduct a subsequent phase 3 trial. When different treatments are studied in separate single-arm trials, actual differences between response rates associated with the treatments, "treatment effects", are confounded with differences between the trials, "trial effects". Thus, it is impossible to estimate either effect separately. Consequently, when the results of separate single-arm trials of different treatments are compared, an apparent treatment difference may be due to a trial effect. Conversely, the apparent absence of a treatment effect may be due to an actual treatment effect being cancelled out by a trial effect. Because selection involves comparison, single-arm phase 2 trials thus fail to provide a reliable means for selecting which therapies to investigate in phase 3. Moreover, reducing complex clinical phenomena, including both adverse and desirable events, to a single outcome wastes important information. Consequently, conventional phase 2 designs are inefficient and unreliable. Given the limited number of patients available for phase 2 trials and the increasing number of new therapies that must be evaluated, it is critically important to conduct these trials efficiently. These concerns motivated the development of a general paradigm for randomized selection trials evaluating several therapies based on multiple outcomes. Three illustrative applications of trials using this approach are presented.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^116SZoX6]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Cost effectiveness analyses need to factor life cycle drug pricing

In addition to ignoring the values already discussed, traditional CEA often ignores how a product's price changes during its time on the market, assuming a constant price (usually set to be the launch price) over the patient's lifetime or modeling horizon. This approach in effect overestimates the cost of treatment as it does not account for the price reductions resulting from on-brand competition or following generic entry at patent expiry. Despite the ISPOR Drug Cost Task Force in 2010 stating that "if a 25-year model is prepared, it should reflect the expected market realities of price changes, if any, during the patent-protected period and the impact of generic entry and its related price erosion", the majority of HTA guidelines for economic evaluation do not address the issue of drug genericization, and only a handful suggest that base-case analyses should incorporate assumptions regarding future alterations in drug prices. The costs of leaving disease treatments unchanged can be forecast more than 25 years into the future, and so therefore should the value of having a medicine that averts those costs, especially when the medicine itself will go generic on average 14 years into those projections. It is noteworthy that the vast majority of published pharmaceutical cost-effectiveness analyses do not make any assumptions about future reductions in drug prices following the loss of a drug's exclusivity. This omission distorts results by misrepresenting total drug costs and not reflecting real-world conditions (Fig. 5). Trying to capture the value of future alterations in drug prices is undoubtedly a complex area for CEA, but it is not that difficult to project — recognizing that all CEA models at launch are projections — given the substantial body of evidence that prices fall dramatically once medicines go off-patent. There is a need for more research and explicit guidance regarding suitable methodologies for contemplating genericization and other fluctuations in drug prices, up or down. However, incorporating genericization will allow society to better use CEA when evaluating a drug's costs and benefits over timeframes that matter to governments and individuals, even if they fall outside of the short budgetary windows of private-sector payers.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^11259qUX]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In summary, traditional CEA often considers the narrow view of just the patient and healthcare system in the present, ignoring other factors that affect patients, their caregivers, the healthcare system, and society as a whole. Once these factors are incorporated, it may turn out the market forces are finding a price at which many medicines provide considerable value for society's money. Whether these prices are high enough to keep driving innovation is a separate but related question; they appear to be in most cases judging from current pace of R&D in many therapeutic areas. In a few cases, such as for hospital-administered antibiotics, expected market prices cannot adequately make up for the low volume of prescriptions and therefore expected revenues and profits are too low to spur investment in needed R&D. In these cases, government interventions (e.g. via novel payment models) are needed to address the market failure. But where cost-effective market prices are adequate to incentivize investment in further R&D of cost-effective medicines that will eventually go generic, price controls risk creating a market failure where there is not one.

In our view, pricing regulations should focus on upholding the purpose of the patent system, which is to make sure that drugs become generic or biosimilar after an adequate period of market-based "reward". The markets may offer a small reward or a large one depending on whether the product is valued by patients, doctors, payors, and society as a whole, but regulations would best not interfere with market-driven pricing during the period intended by the patent system. If medicines have been worth their prices, then it means that the market-based pricing mechanisms that bring about those prices (i.e. many drug companies negotiating with many payers, public and private) have been getting value for society, and it is worth considering the merits of continuing to rely on those mechanisms (rather than overriding them with price controls, as some academics and policymakers propose from time to time) as long as they are generating value for society.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^111zMsac]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Phototherapy for chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) and physical urticarias — phototherapy might be effective for CIU and some physical urticarias, including solar urticaria, and because of limited availability and frequency of treatment, it is generally considered in patients refractory to other anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressant, or biologic agents. Modalities include UVA with psoralen or UVB therapy and might decrease histamine release from mast cells. A retrospective study of 94 patients (88 with CIU) treated with narrowband UVB (NB-UVB) showed that 72% of treatment courses produced moderate improvement or clearance; telephone follow-up years later revealed 33% clear and 45% improved. An open trial of 81 patients with CU with 48 randomized to additional NB-UVB showed statistically larger treatment effects in the NB-UVB–treated group and much lower scores 3 months later than levocetirizine alone, with adverse effects including erythema, pruritus, photodegenerative changes, and increased risk for skin cancer.

### COVID-19, green deal and recovery plan permanently change emissions and prices in EU ETS phase IV [^114QGR56]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Second, the announcement of a policy matters because expectations about future changes to emission allowance demand might affect behavior today. This indirect effect happens through adjustments of the emission allowance price profile. For example, if one announces today that a coal plant will close in the future, market participants expect the future price of allowances to drop, as the total number of allowances in circulation will increase in the future. Because EU ETS allowances are bankable and have an infinite lifetime, the future drop in allowance prices will lead to lower prices today, assuming market participants are intertemporally optimizing. As a result, the incentive to abate today will decrease because of expected carbon abatement in the future, decreasing the TNAC and invalidation volumes early on. Similarly, announced future decreases of the TNAC will lead to higher emission allowance prices, higher abatement and a higher TNAC today, which in turn results in more invalidation. The indirect price effect persists as long as the policy affects the demand for emission allowances in a period that the TNAC is not zero, hence, firms are still intertemporally optimizing or banking. It may work in the opposite direction of the policy or shock, i.e. a policy reducing (increasing) the demand for emission allowances may increase (decrease) cumulative emissions over the lifetime of EU ETS. The mechanism for such a backfiring policy is similar to the Green Paradox in intertemporal carbon leakage (shifts in carbon emissions between time periods)and spatial carbon leakage (the effort of abating countries may be offset by increasing emissions in non-abating countries). Note, however, that the literature on carbon leakage focuses on carbon abatement, while we consider both policies that decrease and policies that increase the demand for emission allowances. This can lead to both lower and higher emissions from within the waterbed, so the aggregate effect can go in the opposite direction of intertemporal or spatial carbon leakage –.

### Electronic cigarettes vs varenicline for smoking cessation in adults: a randomized clinical trial [^113Uzt77]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The study EFFECT (electronic cigarettes vs. varenicline) was published by Anna Tuisku and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Intern Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Tobacco use. In the EFFECT (electronic cigarettes vs. varenicline) study, the trial question was: are nicotine-containing electronic cigarettes superior to varenicline as smoking cessation aid? In the EFFECT (electronic cigarettes vs. varenicline) study, the study design was: single center, double blinded, RCT. In the EFFECT (electronic cigarettes vs. varenicline) study, the population was: 305 patients (167 female, 138 male). The inclusion criteria were participants aged 25–75 years who smoked daily and had volunteered to quit smoking. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy; use of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy or electronic cigarettes during the past year; cancer; ischemic vascular or heart disease; recent myocardial infarction in the past 3 months; hypertension. In the EFFECT (electronic cigarettes vs. varenicline) study, the interventions were: n = 152 electronic cigarettes (nicotine-containing electronic cigarettes plus placebo tablets BID for a total of 12 weeks) n = 153 varenicline (electronic cigarettes without nicotine plus varenicline 0.5–1 mg tablets BID for a total of 12 weeks). In the EFFECT (electronic cigarettes vs. varenicline) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in confirmed abstinence at week 26 (40.4% vs. 43.8%; RD -3.4, 95% CI -14.3 to 7.6). In the EFFECT (electronic cigarettes vs. varenicline) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in self-reported abstinence at week 26 (43% vs. 45.1%; RD -2.1, 95% CI -13.1 to 9) Significant decrease in self-reported abstinence at week 52 (29.3% vs. 39.2%; RD -9.9, 95% CI -20.3 to 0.8) Significant decrease in confirmed abstinence at week 52 (28% vs. 37.9%; RD -9.9, 95% CI -20.2 to 0.7). In the EFFECT (electronic cigarettes vs. varenicline) study, the conclusion was: in participants aged 25–75 years who smoked daily and had volunteered to quit smoking, electronic cigarettes were not superior to varenicline with respect to confirmed abstinence at week 26.

### Lateral wedge insoles for medial knee osteoarthritis: 12 month randomised controlled trial [^113fh1nw]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that our non-significant results for symptoms could reflect a type II error. Pain was only measured at baseline and at 12 months of follow-up. Knowing that pain fluctuates in patients with osteoarthritis, we may have been able to detect a significant insole effect had we included more measurement time points throughout the 12 months to better estimate the average pain over the duration of the trial.

Comparison with previous studies

Our findings are in agreement with the limited number of other randomised controlled trials that have also failed to show the efficacy of lateral wedge insoles. One study found that customised lateral heel wedge insoles worn for two years were associated with a reduced intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, a secondary outcome, but did not alter pain, stiffness, function, or joint space narrowing on radiography. A crossover trial found no statistical or clinical effect of a lateral wedge insole worn for six weeks. Similarly, in the most recent study, a customised lateral wedge insole worn in standardised walking shoes had no greater effect on pain over 12 months than a neutral insole. Using the largest cohort of participants to date, our results concur with these clinical trials and extend their findings by providing novel data relating to the effects of lateral wedge insoles on structural features seen on magnetic resonance imaging.

### Step counter use in type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115tcbFf]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis

For trials that reported the standard error (SE) of a mean, the standard deviation (SD) was obtained by multiplying by the square root of the sample size from the appropriate arm. If the 95% confidence interval (CI) was shown instead of an SD, the SD was calculated by dividing the length of the CI by 3.92, and multiplying by the square-root of the sample size (n), provided that n was more than 60. For some trials that compared multiple step counter interventions with a single control group, an approach was applied that combined the multiple intervention arms into a single one to overcome the unit-of-analysis error. If trials had an outcome at 2 time-points, the shorter-term follow-up data were used in the primary analyses. Both final values and change scores from baseline of steps/d and HbA1c were entered in the same meta-analysis, as suggested in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews. Data from intention-to-treat (ITT) or per-protocol analyses were entered when available in included studies.

The analyses used Stata Software (Version 11.0, College Station, TX, USA). Summary estimates were analyzed with a random-effects model, which coincides with a fixed-effects model when no heterogeneity is presented. The Cochran Q test was used to assess heterogeneity among the studies, with a threshold P- value of 0.1 being considered statistically significant. The degree of inconsistency among trials was estimated by the I² statistic, where an I² value greater than 50% was considered substantially heterogenic. Heterogeneity was explored using 3 strategies: first, sensitivity analyses were conducted by removing each study individually to check whether it could explain heterogeneity; second, univariate meta-regression analyses helped to assess whether the clinical or methodological variables influenced the outcome estimates; and third, subgroup analyses were performed based on meta-regression analyses and pre-specified relevant study characteristics. Publication bias was detected and assessed by Begg's test and Egger's test.

The process of developing a new drug, from preclinical research to market, is time-consuming, risky, and costly, often taking more than a decade and costing billions of dollars. The risk is best reflected in the very low probability of a potential drug making it through all stages of clinical trials and securing regulatory approval. Estimates suggest this probability is, on average, less than 10%; however, recent data for oncology show a lower estimate at about 3.5% (Fig. 2). The high "failure rate" depends on the starting point: for example, probably < 0.1% of all molecules tested in preclinical studies end up being FDA-approved. For those that embark on this journey, the odds of reaching the finish are long, and there is no guarantee that costs incurred for failed products will be recovered in any form. Even if a product is successful in clinical trials and secures regulatory approval, it may not generate enough revenue to recoup the multiple investment attempts that went into its development. Thus, pharmaceutical R&D only starts to make sense at the portfolio level, where the cost of planting many seeds and nurturing a whole garden of projects can only be justified by robust financial returns from selling the few prized fruits.

### Pharmaceutical price controls and patient welfare [^117FqXYy]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Price controls could have a substantial negative effect on pharmaceutical research and development. Extensive research is required before the development costs of a new drug or its benefits are known; most new drug development projects fail, sometimes after substantial financial and time costs. These conditions pose intractable practical problems for the operation of price controls, which cannot rest on objective, predictable standards such as the benefits or costs of individual drugs. In the absence of objective standards, pressure from health care providers and others would create powerful incentives for price regulators to decrease drug prices toward marginal costs of production and distribution, well below levels sufficient to reward innovative research. This downwardly biased price-setting mechanism would apply with particular force to the few successful projects that yield innovative drugs, whose prices would not be set by regulatory authorities until after research expenditures have been incurred and the new drugs are ready to enter the market. Manufacturers will expect price controls to reduce the potential payoffs from breakthrough drugs. This expectation would substantially reduce the incentives to pursue innovative research, as is evident in advanced economies in which price controls are now in force. Once established, price controls for pharmaceuticals, like those for medical services in the Medicare system, would also tend toward complexity and entrenchment of vested interests and could easily become permanent regardless of the harm they cause to patients.

### Electronic cigarettes vs varenicline for smoking cessation in adults: a randomized clinical trial [^1117m8to]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The study EFFECT (electronic cigarettes vs. placebo) was published by Anna Tuisku and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Intern Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Tobacco use. In the EFFECT (electronic cigarettes vs. placebo) study, the trial question was: what is the role of nicotine-containing electronic cigarettes as smoking cessation aid? In the EFFECT (electronic cigarettes vs. placebo) study, the study design was: single center, double blinded, RCT. In the EFFECT (electronic cigarettes vs. placebo) study, the population was: 305 patients (173 female, 132 male). The inclusion criteria were participants aged 25–75 years who smoked daily and had volunteered to quit smoking. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy; use of smoking cessation pharmacotherapy or electronic cigarettes during the past year; cancer; ischemic vascular or heart disease; recent myocardial infarction in the past 3 months; hypertension. In the EFFECT (electronic cigarettes vs. placebo) study, the interventions were: n = 152 electronic cigarettes (nicotine-containing electronic cigarettes plus placebo tablets BID for a total of 12 weeks) n = 153 placebo (electronic cigarettes without nicotine plus placebo tablets BID for a total of 12 weeks). In the EFFECT (electronic cigarettes vs. placebo) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in confirmed abstinence at week 26 (40.4% vs. 19.7%; RD 20.7, 95% CI 10.4 to 30.4). In the EFFECT (electronic cigarettes vs. placebo) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in self-reported abstinence at week 26 (43% vs. 22.4%; RD 20.6, 95% CI 10.1 to 30.5) No significant difference in self-reported abstinence at week 52 (29.3% vs. 20.5%; RD 8.8, 95% CI -1 to 18.4) No significant difference in confirmed abstinence at week 52 (28% vs. 19.9%; RD 8.1, 95% CI -1.6 to 17.6). In the EFFECT (electronic cigarettes vs. placebo) study, the conclusion was: in participants aged 25–75 years who smoked daily and had volunteered to quit smoking, electronic cigarettes were superior to placebo with respect to confirmed abstinence at week 26.

### Guidelines for the performance of minimally invasive splenectomy [^115L9Ufk]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). High credibility.

Minimally invasive splenectomy positioning — comparative effects of supine versus lateral: The use of supine position was associated with moderate undesirable effects related to conversion to open and transfusion requirement, each reported as OR 2.25 [95% CI, 0.62–8.18] with an absolute difference 10.0% more [35 fewer to 511 more], and with mean estimated blood loss (MD 103.5 mL [30.46 to 176.54]). The panel found the overall certainty of the evidence to be very low for the critical outcomes of conversion due to small sample size and imprecision, and the evidence suggests that lateral positioning be considered for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) over supine positioning. Decision considerations noted that patients unwilling to receive blood products may value transfusion risk more, that the lateral approach may be technically easier particularly in obese patients, and that concomitant procedures at the same time as splenectomy may change optimal positioning.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^112MukAt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Asthma management — key recommendations on ICS and ICS‑formoterol: For Step 1, short‑course daily ICS plus as‑needed SABA at the start of respiratory tract infection is favored for ages 0‑4 y (Recommendation 9: Conditional, in favor of the intervention). For Step 2, as‑needed, concomitantly administered ICS plus SABA has Recommendation 10: Conditional, in favor of either the intervention or the comparator for ages 12 y and above, with no recommendation for ages 4‑11 y; for intermittent, higher‑dose ICS there is Recommendation 11: Conditional, against the intervention for ages 4 y and above. For Steps 3 and 4, daily and as‑needed ICS‑formoterol has no recommendation for ages 4 y and above when compared with daily same‑dose ICS plus as‑needed SABA; compared with daily higher‑dose ICS plus as‑needed SABA or with daily same‑dose ICS‑LABA plus as‑needed SABA there is Recommendation 12: Strong, in favor of the intervention for ages 4‑11 y; and compared with daily higher‑dose ICS‑LABA plus as‑needed SABA there is Recommendation 13: Conditional, in favor of the intervention for ages 12 y and above; entries marked with an asterisk indicate insufficient evidence.
