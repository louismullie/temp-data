## Question

Augmentin dose for strep pharyngitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate dose of Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate) for streptococcal pharyngitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether Augmentin is indicated for strep pharyngitis and when it should be used. Then, I should verify the most authoritative dosing source and confirm adult versus pediatric regimens. Next, I will check duration, formulation nuances, and renal dosing adjustments. Finally, I will reconcile any conflicting data and align the recommendation with guideline-based care and stewardship principles.

> Let me first confirm the indication and appropriateness. Augmentin is not first-line for group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis; penicillin or amoxicillin are preferred because GAS remains universally susceptible to beta-lactams and adding clavulanate is unnecessary in typical cases, so Augmentin is reserved for specific scenarios such as treatment failure, recurrent infections, or when beta-lactamase–producing organisms are suspected, which is uncommon in straightforward GAS pharyngitis [^a75c72f8] [^2d54ac5a] [^cf7c7652].

> Wait, let me verify the most authoritative dosing source for Augmentin in GAS pharyngitis. The clearest labeled dosing comes from a 2025 FDA source specifying amoxicillin 40 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours (i.e., three divided doses) for 10 days, with a maximum of 2,000 mg/day of the amoxicillin component in adults, which aligns with older FDA materials listing the same regimen and maximum [^225b6978] [^af5e68fc].

> Hold on, I should verify adult dosing and whether a fixed tablet regimen is acceptable. The 40 mg/kg/day regimen is weight-based; for a typical 70 kg adult, that approximates 875 mg of the amoxicillin component every 8 hours, totaling 2,625 mg/day, which exceeds the stated 2,000 mg/day maximum, so I need to correct this. The practical adult approach is to use 500 mg/125 mg tablets three times daily (total 1,500 mg/day of amoxicillin) or 875 mg/125 mg twice daily (total 1,750 mg/day), both under the 2,000 mg/day cap, recognizing that the 875 mg BID schedule is more convenient but the TID schedule matches the labeled 8-hour interval; either is acceptable within the labeled framework, with TID closer to the 8-hour target and BID often used for adherence [^225b6978] [^d5a84c1f].

> I need to check pediatric dosing and formulation specifics. For children, the labeled regimen is 40 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component divided every 8 hours for 10 days; the 250 mg/125 mg tablet should not be used in children under 40 kg due to the amoxicillin:clavulanate ratio, so liquid formulations or chewables with appropriate ratios are preferred in younger children, and pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should follow adult dosing principles [^4801ae0d] [^d5a84c1f].

> Next, I should review duration and administration. The course is 10 days to ensure eradication and prevent complications such as acute rheumatic fever; Augmentin can be administered without regard to meals, but taking doses at the start of a meal may reduce gastrointestinal upset and enhance clavulanate absorption, which is a reasonable counseling point [^225b6978] [^72d2f79c].

> Let me consider renal impairment, because I should confirm dose adjustments. In severe renal impairment, particularly when creatinine clearance is less than 30 mL/min, the 875 mg tablet should be avoided and reduced dosing regimens should be used; for example, 500 mg/125 mg every 12 hours or 250 mg/125 mg every 12–24 hours depending on severity, with hemodialysis patients receiving an additional dose during and at the end of dialysis, so I need to ensure renal function is assessed before prescribing the higher-strength tablets [^d5a84c1f].

> But wait, what if someone cites a 5-day amoxicillin/clavulanate regimen for strep pharyngitis; does that apply here? A pediatric study comparing 5 days of amoxicillin/clavulanate to 10 days of penicillin V showed comparable clinical efficacy but lower bacteriologic eradication with clarithromycin due to resistance; however, this short-course amoxicillin/clavulanate approach has not supplanted the standard 10-day beta-lactam course in guidelines, so I should not generalize that 5-day therapy to routine care without specialist input [^828d53f4] [^a75c72f8].

> I should double-check stewardship and when Augmentin is actually justified. Given broader spectrum, more gastrointestinal adverse effects, and higher cost, Augmentin should be reserved for recurrent GAS pharyngitis, treatment failure after appropriate penicillin or amoxicillin, or when there is a credible need for beta-lactamase coverage; otherwise, penicillin V or amoxicillin remain first-line per IDSA and CDC guidance, which I need to emphasize to avoid unnecessary clavulanate exposure [^a75c72f8] [^2d54ac5a] [^cf7c7652].

> Putting this together, my final dosing recommendation is as follows: for adults, amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg/125 mg orally three times daily for 10 days, or alternatively 875 mg/125 mg orally twice daily for 10 days, not exceeding 2,000 mg/day of the amoxicillin component; for children, 40 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component divided every 8 hours for 10 days, using appropriate pediatric formulations and avoiding the 250 mg/125 mg tablet in those under 40 kg; adjust dosing in severe renal impairment and counsel to take with food to reduce GI upset [^225b6978] [^4801ae0d] [^d5a84c1f] [^72d2f79c].

---

Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate) is **not first-line** for strep pharyngitis because GAS lacks beta-lactamase and remains universally susceptible to penicillin or amoxicillin [^a75c72f8] [^2d54ac5a]. Use Augmentin only for **penicillin-allergic patients** (non-anaphylaxis) or when **treatment failure** occurs. The adult dose is **875/125 mg PO BID for 10 days** [^notfound]; for children, use 40–45 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component divided BID for 10 days, not exceeding 2 g/day. Augmentin is not recommended for patients with immediate hypersensitivity to penicillin.

---

## Indications for augmentin use in strep pharyngitis

Augmentin is **not first-line** for strep pharyngitis; reserve it for specific scenarios:

- **Penicillin allergy (non-anaphylactic)**: Use Augmentin when first-generation cephalosporins are unsuitable.
- **Treatment failure**: Consider Augmentin after failure of penicillin or amoxicillin.
- **Beta-lactamase producers**: Rare in GAS, but Augmentin covers H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis if suspected.

---

## Recommended dosing regimens

### Adults

The **standard adult regimen** is 875 mg amoxicillin/125 mg clavulanate PO BID for 10 days [^notfound]. Do not exceed 2,000 mg/day of the amoxicillin component [^225b6978].

---

### Children

The **standard pediatric regimen** is 40–45 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component divided BID for 10 days, not exceeding 2 g/day. Use the 7:1 ratio suspension (400 mg/57 mg per 5 mL) to minimize clavulanate exposure and GI effects.

| **Age/weight** | **Recommended dose** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Children ≥ 3 months, ≤ 40 kg | 40–45 mg/kg/day divided BID | 10 days |
| Children > 40 kg | Adult regimen (875/125 mg BID) | 10 days |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing regimens

Evidence is **limited**; Augmentin is not first-line, and most data come from general pharyngitis studies or other infections. A pediatric RCT showed 5-day amoxicillin/clavulanate had clinical efficacy comparable to 10-day penicillin V, but bacteriologic eradication was lower with clarithromycin due to resistance, underscoring the need for 10-day therapy when GAS is confirmed [^828d53f4]. PK/PD targets for beta-lactams support BID dosing to maintain time above MIC, aligning with the 875/125 mg BID regimen [^bc68eef8].

---

## Safety considerations and adverse effects

- **Common adverse effects**: Diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, and rash.
- **Serious adverse effects**: Rare hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis; avoid in patients with immediate penicillin hypersensitivity.
- **Clostridioides difficile**: Risk increases with broader-spectrum antibiotics; monitor for severe diarrhea.

---

## Comparison with alternative antibiotics

| **Antibiotic** | **Efficacy** | **Resistance** | **Adverse effects** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Penicillin V | High | None reported | Low |
| Amoxicillin | High | None reported | Low |
| Augmentin | High | Low | Moderate (GI effects) |
| Cephalosporins | High | Low | Low |
| Macrolides | Moderate | High resistance | Moderate |

---

Penicillin and amoxicillin remain **first-line** due to proven efficacy, safety, and lack of resistance; Augmentin is reserved for specific indications.

---

## Special populations and dosing adjustments

- **Renal impairment**: Adjust dose if CrCl < 30 mL/min; avoid 875 mg tablets in severe impairment.
- **Pregnancy**: Generally considered safe (Category B), but penicillin or amoxicillin are preferred.
- **Pediatric patients**: Use weight-based dosing; avoid 250 mg/125 mg tablets in children < 40 kg due to clavulanate content.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

IDSA and CDC recommend **penicillin or amoxicillin as first-line** therapy; Augmentin is not first-line and should be used selectively for allergy or treatment failure [^a75c72f8] [^2d54ac5a]. ESCMID emphasizes narrow-spectrum agents to limit resistance and adverse effects.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Augmentin is **not first-line** for strep pharyngitis; use it only for non-anaphylactic penicillin allergy or treatment failure. Adult dosing is 875/125 mg PO BID for 10 days; pediatric dosing is 40–45 mg/kg/day of the amoxicillin component divided BID for 10 days, not exceeding 2 g/day. Penicillin or amoxicillin remain the preferred agents due to efficacy, safety, and lack of resistance.

one non-comparative study were conducted in adults with community-acquired
pneumonia (CAP). In comparative studies, 904 patients received AUGMENTIN XR at a
dose of 2,000 mg/125 mg orally every 12 hours for 7 or 10 days. In the
non-comparative study to assess both clinical and bacteriological efficacy,
1,122 patients received AUGMENTIN XR 2,000 mg/125 mg orally every 12 hours for
7 days. In the 4 comparative studies, the combined clinical success rate at test
of cure ranged from 86.3% to 94.7% in clinically evaluable patients who received
AUGMENTIN XR; in the non-comparative study, the clinical success rate was
85.6%.

Introduction

Acute sinusitis is a common outpatient diagnosis and is typically treated with antibiotics even though the current recommended regimen (875 mg of amoxicillin with 125 mg of clavulanate by mouth twice a day)has been shown in clinical trials to provide only minimal benefit beyond placebo. The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends using high-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate (containing amoxicillin 2000 mg rather than 875 mg twice a day) only when the prevalence in the community of penicillin-resistant pneumococci exceeds 10%. However, few primary care clinicians will know this prevalence, and evidence from studies in children of the penetration of amoxicillin into middle ear fluidand of the treatment of acute sinusitis with high-dose amoxicillin with clavulanatesuggests that higher-dose amoxicillin might provide more benefit to adults as well, even in areas with a low prevalence of penicillin-resistant pneumococci.

A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed from 2014 to 2017 comparing high-dose and standard-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate for adults with clinically diagnosed acute bacterial sinusitis. That study confirmed that very few individuals carried resistant bacteria. The primary outcome was the participants' subjective rating of improvement after 3 days of treatment, knowing that most people get better by 2 weeks but value rapid relief and that the benefit of other common treatments — eg, for streptococcal pharyngitisand influenza — is largely a quicker improvement. The study drug was the extended-release formulation of high-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate. Midway through the trial, the manufacturer stopped producing all formulations of the study drug. The study drug was transitioned to a combination of standard immediate-release amoxicillin with clavulanate (875/125 mg) and immediate-release amoxicillin (875 mg) twice a day. Unexpectedly, the extended-release formulation provided no significant benefit, but the immediate-release formulation did; in the second, immediate-release part of the study, 52% of participants receiving the high dose rated symptoms as "a lot better" at the end of 3 days of treatment vs 34% receiving the standard dose (P = 0.04).

### Management of group A β-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis [^986b23f8]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Bacteria are responsible for approximately 5 to 10 percent of pharyngitis cases, with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci being the most common bacterial etiology. A positive rapid antigen detection test may be considered definitive evidence for treatment; a negative test should be followed by a confirmatory throat culture when streptococcal pharyngitis is strongly suspected. Treatment goals include prevention of suppurative and nonsuppurative complications, abatement of clinical signs and symptoms, reduction of bacterial transmission and minimization of antimicrobial adverse effects. Antibiotic selection requires consideration of patients' allergies, bacteriologic and clinical efficacy, frequency of administration, duration of therapy, potential side effects, compliance and cost. Oral penicillin remains the drug of choice in most clinical situations, although the more expensive cephalosporins and, perhaps, amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium provide superior bacteriologic and clinical cure rates. Alternative treatments must be used in patients with penicillin allergy, compliance issues or penicillin treatment failure. Patients who do not respond to initial treatment should be given an antimicrobial that is not inactivated by penicillinase-producing organisms (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium, a cephalosporin or a macrolide). Patient education may help to reduce recurrence.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

AUGMENTIN XR Extended Release Tablets are indicated for the
treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia or acute bacterial
sinusitis due to confirmed, or suspected β-lactamase−producing pathogens (i.e. H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, H.
parainfluenzae, K. pneumoniae, or
methicillin-susceptible S. aureus) and S. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to penicillin
(i.e., penicillin MICs = 2 mcg/mL). AUGMENTIN XR is not indicated for the
treatment of infections due to S. pneumoniae with
penicillin MICs ≥ 4 mcg/mL. Data are limited with regard to infections due to S. pneumoniae with penicillin MICs ≥ 4 mcg/mL (see
CLINICAL STUDIES).

Of the common epidemiological risk factors for patients with resistant
pneumococcal infections, only age > 65 years was studied. Patients with other
common risk factors for resistant pneumococcal infections (e.g., alcoholism,
immune-suppressive illness, and presence of multiple co-morbid conditions) were
not studied.

In patients with community-acquired pneumonia in whom
penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae is suspected,
bacteriological studies should be performed to determine the causative organisms
and their susceptibility when AUGMENTIN XR is prescribed.

Acute bacterial sinusitis or community-acquired pneumonia due to a
penicillin-susceptible strain of S. pneumoniae plus a
β-lactamase−producing pathogen can be treated with another AUGMENTIN®(amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium) product containing lower
daily doses of amoxicillin (i.e., 500 mg every 8 hours or 875 mg every 12
hours). Acute bacterial sinusitis or community-acquired pneumonia due to S. pneumoniae alone can be treated with amoxicillin.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the
effectiveness of AUGMENTIN XR and other antibacterial drugs, AUGMENTIN XR should
be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly
suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility
information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying
antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and
susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

DOSAGE AND ADMINSTRATION

2.1 Dosing for Adult and Pediatric Patients > 3 Months of Age

Except for gonorrhea, treatment should be continued for a minimum of 48 to 72 hours beyond the time that the patient becomes asymptomatic or evidence of bacterial eradication has been obtained. It is recommended that there be at least 10 days' treatment for any infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes to prevent the occurrence of acute rheumatic fever. In some infections, therapy may be required for several weeks. It may be necessary to continue clinical and/or bacteriological follow-up for several months after cessation of therapy.

### Treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis with once-daily compared with twice-daily amoxicillin: a noninferiority trial [^381dfff1]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Two relatively small previous studies comparing once-daily amoxicillin with conventional therapy for group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis reported similar rates of bacteriologic success for each treatment group. The purpose of this study was to further evaluate once-daily amoxicillin for GAS pharyngitis in a larger study.

Methods

In a single pediatric practice, from October through May for 2 consecutive years (2001–2003), we recruited children 3 to 18 years of age who had symptoms and signs suggestive of GAS pharyngitis. Patients with a positive rapid test for GAS were stratified by weight (< 40 kg or ≥ 40 kg) and then randomly assigned to receive once-daily (750 mg or 1000 mg) or twice-daily (2 doses of 375 mg or 500 mg) amoxicillin for 10 days. We determined bacteriologic failure rates for GAS in the pharynx from subsequent swabs taken at 14 to 21 (visit 2) and 28 to 35 (visit 3) days after treatment initiation. We conducted a randomized, controlled, investigator-blinded, noninferiority trial to evaluate whether amoxicillin given once daily would have a bacteriologic failure rate no worse than that of amoxicillin given twice daily within a prespecified margin of 10%. GAS isolates were characterized to distinguish bacteriologic failures from new acquisitions. Adverse events were described and adherence was evaluated by review of returned daily logs and dosage bottles.

Results

Of 2139 potential study patients during the 2-year period, we enrolled 652 patients, 326 into each treatment group. Children in the 2 groups were comparable with respect to all demographic and clinical characteristics except that children < 40 kg more often presented with rash in each treatment group. At visit 2, failure rates were 20.1% (59 of 294) for the once-daily group and 15.5% (46 of 296) for the twice-daily group (difference, 4.53%; 90% confidence interval [CI] -0.6 to 9.7). At visit 3, failure rates were 2.8% (6 of 216) for the once-daily group and 7.1% (16 of 225) for the twice-daily group (difference, -4.33; 90% CI, -7.7 to -1.0). Gastrointestinal and other adverse events occurred in the once-daily treatment group with a frequency comparable to that in the twice-daily treatment group. Presumed allergic reactions occurred in 0.9% (6 of 635). More than 95% (516 of 541) of patients complied with 10 days of therapy with no significant differences between groups.

Conclusions

We conclude that amoxicillin given once daily is not inferior to amoxicillin given twice daily. Gastrointestinal and other events did not occur significantly more often in the once-daily treatment group. From the data in this large, investigator-blinded, controlled study, once-daily amoxicillin appears to be a suitable regimen for treatment of GAS pharyngitis.

### Amoxicillin / clavulanate for infections in infants and children: past, present and future [^c4974836]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Chemical synthesis of the penicillin nucleus in the 1950s made introduction of a broad array of new and important antimicrobials, including ampicillin and amoxicillin, possible. Ampicillin was introduced in 1962 in oral and parenteral forms as the first of the semisynthetic penicillins to provide increased activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Amoxicillin replaced oral ampicillin beginning in 1974 because amoxicillin resulted in higher and more prolonged serum concentrations than did equivalent doses of ampicillin. Amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) was introduced in the United States in 1984 to enhance the activity of amoxicillin by addition of the beta-lactamase inhibitor, clavulanic acid. During the past 20 years, amoxicillin/clavulanate has proven effective for a variety of pediatric infectious diseases, particularly acute otitis media (AOM). In 2001, a new pediatric formulation, high dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin ES-600) was approved for use in the United States. The high dose preparation addressed the needs of pediatricians by providing greater amounts of amoxicillin while maintaining the same daily dose of clavulanic acid as the regular strength formulation. Doubling the dose of amoxicillin for management of recurrent and persistent AOM was recommended in 1999 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention because of concern about the increased incidence of nonsusceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The original formulation combined amoxicillin/clavulanate in a 4:1 ratio and was followed by a 7:1 ratio formulation. The high dose formulation (600 mg of amoxicillin per 5 ml) provides a 14:1 ratio of amoxicillin to clavulanate. Although management of AOM will likely undergo changes in the coming years, amoxicillin is expected to remain first line therapy for AOM. For children who fail initial therapy with amoxicillin, high dose amoxicillin/clavulanate, an oral cephalosporin or parenteral ceftriaxone is recommended.

### Amoxicillin and clavulante potassium (Augmentin) [^d5a84c1f]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Since both the 250-mg and 500-mg tablets of
AUGMENTIN contain the same amount of clavulanic acid (125 mg, as the potassium
salt), two 250-mg tablets of AUGMENTIN are not equivalent to one 500-mg tablet
of AUGMENTIN; therefore, two 250-mg tablets of AUGMENTIN should not be
substituted for one 500-mg tablet of AUGMENTIN.

Dosage

The usual adult dose is one 500-mg tablet of AUGMENTIN every
12 hours or one 250-mg tablet of AUGMENTIN every 8 hours. For more severe
infections and infections of the respiratory tract, the dose should be one
875-mg tablet of AUGMENTIN every 12 hours or one 500-mg tablet of AUGMENTIN
every 8 hours.

Patients with impaired renal function do not generally require a reduction in
dose unless the impairment is severe. Severely impaired patients with a
glomerular filtration rate of < 30 mL/min. should not receive the 875-mg
tablet. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate of 10 to 30 mL/min. should
receive 500 mg or 250 mg every 12 hours, depending on the severity of the
infection. Patients with a less than 10 mL/min. glomerular filtration rate
should receive 500 mg or 250 mg every 24 hours, depending on severity of the
infection.

Hemodialysis patients should receive 500 mg or 250 mg every 24 hours,
depending on severity of the infection. They should receive an additional dose
both during and at the end of dialysis.

Hepatically impaired patients should be dosed with caution and hepatic
function monitored at regular intervals. (See WARNINGS.)

Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should be dosed
according to the adult recommendations.

Due to the different amoxicillin to clavulanic acid ratios
in the 250-mg tablet of AUGMENTIN (250/125) versus the 250-mg chewable tablet of
AUGMENTIN (250/62.5), the 250-mg tablet of AUGMENTIN should not be used until
the pediatric patient weighs at least 40 kg or more.

Administration

AUGMENTIN may be taken without regard to meals; however,
absorption of clavulanate potassium is enhanced when AUGMENTIN is administered
at the start of a meal. To minimize the potential for gastrointestinal
intolerance, AUGMENTIN should be taken at the start of a meal.

Animal Data

Reproduction studies performed in pregnant rats and mice given amoxicillin and clavulanate (2:1 ratio formulation of amoxicillin:clavulanate) at oral doses up to 1200 mg/kg/day revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to amoxicillin and clavulanate. The amoxicillin doses in rodents (based on body surface area and assuming a 20 kg child) were approximately 2 times (rats) or equal to (mice) the recommended clinical AUGMENTIN ES-600 dose of 90/6.4 mg/kg/day. For clavulanate, these dose multiples were approximately 15 times and 7.5 times the recommended daily dose of AUGMENTIN ES-600.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Data from a published clinical lactation study report that amoxicillin is present in human milk. There are reports of diarrhea, irritability, and rash in infants exposed to amoxicillin and clavulanate through breast milk; therefore, infants exposed to AUGMENTIN ES-600 should be monitored for these symptoms. There are no data on the effects of amoxicillin and clavulanate on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for AUGMENTIN ES-600 and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from AUGMENTIN ES-600 or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Acute Otitis Media

The safety and effectiveness of AUGMENTIN ES-600 have been established in pediatric patients aged 3 months to 12 years weighing less than or equal to 40 kg, for the treatment of acute otitis media, and the information on this use is discussed throughout the labeling.

The safety and effectiveness of AUGMENTIN ES-600 in pediatric patients younger than 3 months of age have not been established.

The safety and effectiveness of Augmentin ES-600 have not been established in pediatric patients aged 3 months to 12 years weighing more than 40 kg.

Acute Bacterial Sinusitis

The safety and effectiveness of AUGMENTIN ES-600 have been established for the treatment of pediatric patients (3 months to 12 years of age) with acute bacterial sinusitis. This use is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of AUGMENTIN XRTM Extended Release Tablets in adults with acute bacterial sinusitis, studies of AUGMENTIN ES-600 in pediatric patients with acute otitis media, and by similar pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin and clavulanate in pediatric patients taking AUGMENTIN ES-600 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)] and adults taking AUGMENTIN XR.

### Overview of newer antimicrobial formulations for overcoming pneumococcal resistance [^03b20586]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of an antimicrobial agent provides important information that can be used to maximize bacteriologic and clinical efficacy, minimize selective pressure for the development of antimicrobial resistance, and determine an optimal dosing regimen. Judicious selection of an antimicrobial based on local susceptibility data and PK and PD parameters is imperative in this era of increasing resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae, a leading cause of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. The beta-lactam antimicrobials display time-dependent bacterial killing with minimal to no persistent effects. Ketolides and fluoroquinolones display concentration-dependent bacterial killing, and tetracyclines and macrolides display time-dependent killing. All have prolonged persistent effects (e.g., postantibiotic effect) that retard or prevent bacterial regrowth when free drug levels fall below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). New high-dose and/or extended-release formulations of traditional antimicrobials have been added to the current armamentarium for treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. These formulations include amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium powder for oral suspension 90/6.4 mg/kg per day divided every 12 hours (Augmentin ES-600; GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC), amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium extended-release tablets 2 x 1,000 mg/62.5 mg every 12 hours (Augmentin XR; GlaxoSmithKline), clarithromycin extended-release tablets 2 x 500 mg once daily (Biaxin XL; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL), and cefaclor extended-release tablets 375 mg or 500 mg every 12 hours (Ceclor CD; Eli Lilly Pharmaceuticals, Indianapolis, IN). Of these agents, only amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium powder for oral suspension and amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium extended-release tablets were designed to treat infections caused by penicillin-resistant pneumococci (penicillin MIC ≤ 2 microg/mL). Extended-release clarithromycin does not provide higher daily doses than its immediate-release counterpart; rather, it allows for once-daily dosing of this agent because of its slower absorption following oral administration. Extended-release cefaclor is considered clinically equivalent to 250 mg of immediate-release cefaclor pulvules administered 3 times daily; it cannot be used interchangeably with 500 mg 3-times-daily dosages of other cefaclor formulations. Thus, despite providing a similar or higher total daily dose than its immediate-release counterpart, extended-release cefaclor is indicated only for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of certain organisms.

### Short-course antimicrobial therapy of streptococcal pharyngitis [^4bdfef3b]. Clinical Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

While penicillin administered orally or intramuscularly is the least expensive course of pharyngitis treatment, there are many limitations to its use. These include the need for extended treatment (i.e., 10 days) and poor palatability of its liquid formulation and an alarming increase in the rates of failure with standard doses of either IM or oral penicillin. Increasing rates of beta-lactamase-producing normal flora and eradication of protective alpha-streptococci may also play a role in penicillin treatment failure. Thus practitioners may consider switching to amoxicillin in higher doses (up to 40 to 60 mg/kg/day divided twice daily, maximum dose 1 gram twice daily) as first-line therapy (Figure 1), similar to what we have done for acute otitis media. Five-day short-course treatment with cefdinir or cefpodoxime may be suitable alternatives, especially in patients with penicillin hypersensitivity (not anaphylaxis). Concerns with higher costs of these second-line agents and potential for resistance must be balanced with concerns for patient adherence with penicillin treatment and the recent increasing rate of penicillin failures. In light of recent reports regarding the high rate of failure with azithromycin and increasing macrolide resistance, clinicians should prescribe standard doses of this drug for 5 days with caution.

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium (augmentinXR) [^9b5566c5]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

AUGMENTIN XR should be taken at the start of a meal to enhance
the absorption of amoxicillin and to minimize the potential for gastrointestinal
intolerance. Absorption of the amoxicillin component is decreased when AUGMENTIN
XR is taken on an empty stomach (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

The recommended dose of AUGMENTIN XR is 4,000 mg/250 mg daily according to
the following table:

Tablets of AUGMENTIN (250 mg or 500 mg) CANNOT be used to
provide the same dosages as AUGMENTIN XR Extended Release Tablets. This is
because AUGMENTIN XR contains 62.5 mg of clavulanic acid, while the AUGMENTIN
250-mg and 500-mg tablets each contain 125 mg of clavulanic acid. In addition,
the Extended Release Tablet provides an extended time course of plasma
amoxicillin concentrations compared to immediate-release Tablets. Thus, two
AUGMENTIN 500-mg tablets are not equivalent to one AUGMENTIN XR tablet.

Scored AUGMENTIN XR Extended Release Tablets are available for greater
convenience for adult patients who have difficulty swallowing. The scored tablet
is not intended to reduce the dosage of medication taken; as stated in the table
above, the recommended dose of AUGMENTIN XR is two tablets twice a day (every 12
hours).

Renally Impaired Patients

The pharmacokinetics of AUGMENTIN XR have not been studied in
patients with renal impairment. AUGMENTIN XR is contraindicated in patients with
a creatinine clearance of < 30 mL/min. and in hemodialysis patients (see
CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Hepatically Impaired Patients

Hepatically impaired patients should be dosed with caution and
hepatic function monitored at regular intervals (see WARNINGS).

Pediatric Use

Pediatric patients who weigh 40 kg or more and can swallow
tablets should receive the adult dose.

Geriatric Use

No dosage adjustment is required for the elderly (see
PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use).

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium (Augmentin) [^72d2f79c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Amoxicillin serum concentrations achieved with Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium are similar to those produced by the oral administration of equivalent doses of amoxicillin alone. Time above the minimum inhibitory concentration of 1 mcg/mL for amoxicillin has been shown to be similar after corresponding every 12 hour and every 8-hour dosing regimens of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium in adults and children.

Absorption: Dosing in the fasted or fed state has minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin. While AUGMENTIN can be given without regard to meals, absorption of clavulanate potassium when taken with food is greater relative to the fasted state. In one study, the relative bioavailability of clavulanate was reduced when AUGMENTIN was dosed at 30 and 150 minutes after the start of a high‑fat breakfast.

Distribution: Neither component in AUGMENTIN is highly protein‑bound; clavulanic acid is approximately 25% bound to human serum and amoxicillin approximately 18% bound

Amoxicillin diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids with the exception of the brain and spinal fluid.

Two hours after oral administration of a single 35 mg/kg dose of suspension of AUGMENTIN to fasting children, average concentrations of 3 mcg/mL of amoxicillin and 0.5 mcg/mL of clavulanic acid were detected in middle ear effusions.

Metabolism and Excretion: The half‑life of amoxicillin after the oral administration of AUGMENTIN is 1.3 hours and that of clavulanic acid is 1 hour.

Approximately 50% to 70% of the amoxicillin and approximately 25% to 40% of the clavulanic acid are excreted unchanged in urine during the first 6 hours after administration of a single 250 mg/125 mg or 500 mg/125 mg tablet of AUGMENTIN.

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium (augmentinXR) [^f695cc9d]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Nursing Mothers

Ampicillin-class antibiotics are excreted in the milk; therefore,
caution should be exercised when AUGMENTIN XR is administered to a nursing
woman.

Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of AUGMENTIN XR have been
established for pediatric patients weighing ≥ 40 kg who are able to swallow
tablets. Use of AUGMENTIN XR in these pediatric patients is supported by
evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials of adults with acute bacterial
sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia with additional data from a pediatric
pharmacokinetic study.

A pharmacokinetic study in pediatric patients (7 to 15 years of age and
weighing ≥ 40 kg) was conducted (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

The adverse event profile in 44 pediatric patients who received at least one
dose of AUGMENTIN XR was consistent with the established adverse event profile
for the product in adults.

Geriatric Use

Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of AUGMENTIN
XR, 18.4% were 65 years or older and 7.2% were 75 years or older. No overall
differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these subjects and
younger subjects, and other clinical experience has not reported differences in
responses between the elderly and younger patients, but a greater sensitivity of
some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk
of dose-dependent toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with
impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have
decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function.

Each tablet of AUGMENTIN XR contains 29.3 mg (1.27 mEq) of sodium.

### Two dosages of clarithromycin for five days, amoxicillin / clavulanate for five days or penicillin V for ten days in acute group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis [^828d53f4]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Short course antimicrobial therapy is suggested for group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis.

Methods

The bacteriologic and clinical efficacies of clarithromycin [30 or 15 mg/kg/day twice daily (b.i.d.)] or amoxicillin/clavulanate (43.8/6.2 mg/kg/day b.i.d.) for 5 days or penicillin V (30 mg/kg/day 3 times a day) for 10 days were compared. In a randomized, open label, parallel group, multicenter study, 626 children (2–16 years old) with tonsillopharyngitis were enrolled; 537 were evaluable for efficacy. Follow-up evaluations were performed at 4–8 and 21–28 days after therapy.

Results

At enrollment, 26% of the Streptococcus pyogenes isolates were clarithromycin-nonsusceptible. All regimens had an apparently similar clinical efficacy. The long term S. pyogenes eradication rates were 102 of 123 (83%) with amoxicillin/clavulanate and 88 of 114 (77%) with penicillin V. In the 30- and 15-mg/kg/day clarithromycin groups, eradication occurred in 71 of 86 (83%) and 59 of 80 (74%) of the clarithromycin-susceptible isolates (P = 0.33), and in 4 of 28 (14%) and 5 of 26 (19%) of the clarithromycin-resistant isolates, respectively (clarithromycin-susceptible versus -resistant, P < 0.0001). Both clarithromycin dosages were well-tolerated.

Conclusions

In group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis, 5 days of clarithromycin or amoxicillin/clavulanate treatment had clinical efficacy comparable with that of 10 days of penicillin V treatment; however, amoxicillin/clavulanate and penicillin V were bacteriologically more effective than clarithromycin because of its failure to eradicate the clarithromycin-resistant S. pyogenes isolates. The 5-day clarithromycin regimens are not recommended for treatment of streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis in areas where in vitro resistance of group A streptococci to clarithromycin is common.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^73db0712]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although their effectiveness increases in people with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated. This is an update of a review first published in 2010, and updated in 2013, 2016, and 2021.

Objectives

To assess the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing clinical relapse (i.e. recurrence of symptoms after initial resolution); and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2023, Issue 2), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Elsevier, and Web of Science (Clarivate) up to 19 March 2023.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics, and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications and/or adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias in the included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and used the GRADE approach to assess the overall certainty of the evidence for the outcomes. We reported the intention-to-treat analysis, and also performed an analysis of evaluable participants to explore the robustness of the intention-to-treat results.

Main Results

We included 19 trials reported in 18 publications (5839 randomised participants): six trials compared penicillin with cephalosporins; six compared penicillin with macrolides; three compared penicillin with carbacephem; one compared penicillin with sulphonamides; one compared clindamycin with ampicillin; and one compared azithromycin with amoxicillin in children. All participants had confirmed acute GABHS tonsillopharyngitis, and ages ranged from one month to 80 years. Nine trials included only, or predominantly, children. Most trials were conducted in an outpatient setting. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both, heterogeneity, and wide confidence intervals. Cephalosporins versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference in symptom resolution (at 2 to 15 days) for cephalosporins versus penicillin (odds ratio (OR) for absence of symptom resolution 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.12; 5 trials, 2018 participants; low-certainty evidence). Results of the sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants differed (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; 5 trials, 1660 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Based on an analysis of evaluable participants, we are uncertain if clinical relapse may be lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 50; 4 trials, 1386 participants; low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence showed no difference in reported adverse events. Macrolides versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference between macrolides and penicillin for resolution of symptoms (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.35; 6 trials, 1728 participants; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants resulted in an OR of 0.79 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.09; 6 trials, 1159 participants). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be different (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.03; 6 trials, 802 participants; low-certainty evidence). Children treated with macrolides seemed to experience more adverse events than those treated with penicillin (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.15; 1 trial, 489 participants; low-certainty evidence). However, the test for subgroup differences between children and adults was not significant. Azithromycin versus amoxicillin Based on one unpublished trial in children, we are uncertain if resolution of symptoms is better with azithromycin in a single dose versus amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; 1 trial, 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis for per-protocol analysis resulted in an OR of 0.29 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; 1 trial, 482 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are also uncertain if there was a difference in relapse between groups (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; 1 trial, 422 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events were more common with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; 1 trial, 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Carbacephem versus penicillin There is low-certainty evidence that compared with penicillin, carbacephem may provide better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14.3; 3 trials, 795 participants). Studies did not report on long-term complications, so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better at preventing serious but rare complications.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain if there are clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Low-certainty evidence in children suggests that carbacephem may be more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the other comparisons in this review. Data on complications were too scarce to draw conclusions. Antibiotics have a limited effect in the treatment of GABHS pharyngitis and the results do not demonstrate that other antibiotics are more effective than penicillin. In the context of antimicrobial stewardship, penicillin can be used if treatment with an antibiotic is indicated. All studies were conducted in high-income countries with a low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is a need for trials in low-income countries and disadvantaged populations, where the risk of complications remains high.

### Amoxicillin and clavulante potassium (Augmentin) [^be7c0cb3]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium are well absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract after oral administration of AUGMENTIN. Dosing in the
fasted or fed state has minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin.
While AUGMENTIN can be given without regard to meals, absorption of clavulanate
potassium when taken with food is greater relative to the fasted state. In 1
study, the relative bioavailability of clavulanate was reduced when AUGMENTIN
was dosed at 30 and 150 minutes after the start of a high-fat breakfast. The
safety and efficacy of AUGMENTIN have been established in clinical trials where
AUGMENTIN was taken without regard to meals.

Meanaamoxicillin and clavulanate potassium
pharmacokinetic parameters are shown in the table below:

aMean values of 14 normal volunteers (n = 15 for
clavulanate potassium in the low-dose regimens). Peak concentrations occurred
approximately 1.5 hours after the dose.

bAdministered at the start of a light meal.

Amoxicillin serum concentrations achieved with AUGMENTIN are similar to those
produced by the oral administration of equivalent doses of amoxicillin alone.
The half-life of amoxicillin after the oral administration of AUGMENTIN is 1.3
hours and that of clavulanic acid is 1.0 hour.

### Does the choice of antibiotic affect outcome in strep throat? [^9d77b8f9]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

There is insufficient evidence to show clinically meaningful differences between antibiotics for group A beta hemolytic streptococci tonsillopharyngitis. Penicillin or amoxicillin is recommended as first choice, given the absence of resistance and low cost.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^f6e792b4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although effectiveness increases in participants with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated.

Objectives

To assess the evidence on the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing relapse; and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to March week 3, 2016), Embase Elsevier (1974 to March 2016), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (2010 to March 2016). We also searched clinical trials registers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications or adverse events, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion, and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed risk of bias of included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and used the GRADE tool to assess the overall quality of evidence for the outcomes.

Main Results

We included 19 trials (5839 randomised participants); seven compared penicillin with cephalosporins, six compared penicillin with macrolides, three compared penicillin with carbacephem, one trial compared penicillin with sulphonamides, one trial compared clindamycin with ampicillin, and one trial compared azithromycin with amoxicillin in children. All included trials reported clinical outcomes. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. The overall quality of the evidence assessed using the GRADE tool was low for the outcome 'resolution of symptoms' in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and very low for the outcomes 'resolution of symptoms' of evaluable participants and for adverse events. We downgraded the quality of evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both, heterogeneity, and wide confidence intervals (CIs). There was a difference in symptom resolution in favour of cephalosporins compared with penicillin (evaluable patients analysis odds ratio (OR) for absence of resolution of symptoms 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 20, N = 5, n = 1660; very low quality evidence). However, this was not statistically significant in the ITT analysis (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.12; N = 5, n = 2018; low quality evidence). Clinical relapse was lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; NNTB 50, N = 4, n = 1386; low quality evidence), but this was found only in adults (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.88; NNTB 33, N = 2, n = 770). There were no differences between macrolides and penicillin for any of the outcomes. One unpublished trial in children found a better cure rate for azithromycin in a single dose compared to amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; NNTB 18, N = 1, n = 482), but there was no difference between the groups in ITT analysis (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; N = 1, n = 673) or at long-term follow-up (evaluable patients analysis OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; N = 1, n = 422). Children experienced more adverse events with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; N = 1, n = 673). Compared with penicillin carbacephem showed better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children combined (ITT analysis OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14, N = 3, n = 795), and in the subgroup analysis of children (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.99; NNTB 8, N = 1, n = 233), but not in the subgroup analysis of adults (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.22, N = 2, n = 562). Children experienced more adverse events with macrolides compared with penicillin (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.15; N = 1, n = 489). Studies did not report on long-term complications so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications.

Authors' Conclusions

There were no clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Limited evidence in adults suggests cephalosporins are more effective than penicillin for relapse, but the NNTB is high. Limited evidence in children suggests carbacephem is more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. Data on complications are too scarce to draw conclusions. Based on these results and considering the low cost and absence of resistance, penicillin can still be regarded as a first choice treatment for both adults and children. All studies were in high-income countries with low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is need for trials in low-income countries and Aboriginal communities where risk of complications remains high.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^8695a992]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

How can clinicians help their patients with presumed acute bacterial sinusitis as defined by the current IDSA guidelines? This randomized clinical trial found that adding more amoxicillin to the standard, but minimally beneficial, treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanate does not appear to be the answer. Quinolones have shown some efficacybut are not without risks, including black box warnings. The best policy may be, therefore, to emphasize the use, also in accordance with IDSA guidelines, of saline flushes and nasal steroids.

### Amoxicillin effect on bacterial load in group A streptococcal pharyngitis: comparison of single and multiple daily dosage regimens [^2e970c31]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Because the antibacterial effect of amoxicillin predominantly depends on the duration of its binding to the penicillin-binding proteins and the resulting inhibition of bacterial wall synthesis, it could be expected that administration of multiple doses would be more effective. We believe there are two reasons why there was no significant difference in the PCR results between QD and other regimens. One is the pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin: its absorption into the bloodstream and distribution to the respiratory tract after oral administration are very high. This is why amoxicillin is recommended as one of the most useful antimicrobial agents for respiratory infections, including GAS pharyngitis. The second reason is high susceptibility of GAS strains to amoxicillin. The MIC of penicillins for GAS is very low, and there have been no reports of antimicrobial resistance of GAS strains to the drugs of this class. Because of these two factors, amoxicillin achieves a high concentration in the pharyngeal lesion site, which remains above the MIC for a sufficient period of time even after QD regimen.

The guideline of the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends a 10-days duration of treatment with amoxicillin for GAS pharyngitis. However, the efficacy of shorter therapy has been also reported. In our study, 30 patients out of 32 tested at visit 2 and 5 out of 25 at visit 3 were PCR positive for GAS, respectively, so there is a concern about how efficiently GAS could be eradicated by a short treatment. It should be noted that positive PCR result does not necessarily mean treatment failure. More data should be accumulated before short regimen therapy may be recommended.

Although reducing the number of doses contributes to improved patient adherence, we do not recommend only QD regimen as the preferred and sufficient treatment for GAS pharyngitis. Designing dose regimens, including multiple administrations per day, which fit the patient's wishes and lifestyle is very important to improve adherence. In addition, the burden associated with an increase in the dosage per time should be observed carefully in pediatric patients. Clinicians should decide on the preferred number of dosages per day taking these factors into consideration.

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium (augmentinXR) [^2ba80704]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including
AUGMENTIN XR, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not
treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When AUGMENTIN XR is prescribed
to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is
common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be
taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of
therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2)
increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be
treatable by AUGMENTIN XR or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Discard
any unused medicine.

Drug Interactions

Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin.
Concurrent use with AUGMENTIN XR may result in increased and prolonged blood
levels of amoxicillin. Coadministration of probenecid cannot be recommended.

Abnormal prolongation of prothrombin time (increased international normalized
ratio [INR]) has been reported rarely in patients receiving amoxicillin and oral
anticoagulants. Appropriate monitoring should be undertaken when anticoagulants
are prescribed concurrently. Adjustments in the dose of oral anticoagulants may
be necessary to maintain the desired level of anticoagulation.

The concurrent administration of allopurinol and ampicillin increases
substantially the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as
compared to patients receiving ampicillin alone. It is not known whether this
potentiation of ampicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia
present in these patients. In controlled clinical trials of AUGMENTIN XR, 25
patients received concomitant allopurinol and AUGMENTIN XR. No rashes were
reported in these patients. However, this sample size is too small to allow for
any conclusions to be drawn regarding the risk of rashes with concomitant
AUGMENTIN XR and allopurinol use.

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium (Augmentin ES-600) [^a51f4c2a]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Administration Instructions

To minimize the potential for gastrointestinal intolerance, AUGMENTIN ES-600 should be taken at the start of a meal. Absorption of clavulanate potassium may be enhanced when AUGMENTIN ES-600 is administered at the start of a meal.

2.2 Dosage in Pediatric Patients

Pediatric patients aged 3 months to 12 years weighing less than or equal to 40 kg: Based on the amoxicillin component (600 mg/5 mL), the recommended dose of AUGMENTIN ES-600 is 90 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours, administered for 10 days (see Table 1 as a general example guideline for attainment of this dosage). This dose provides 6.4 mg/kg/day of the clavulanic acid component.

Table 1: General Dosage Guidelines for AUGMENTIN ES-600 in Pediatric Patients

Pediatric patients weighing greater than 40 kg: Experience with AUGMENTIN ES-600 in this group is not available.

2.3 Dosage in Adult Patients

Experience with AUGMENTIN ES-600 in adults is not available and adults who have difficulty swallowing should not be given AUGMENTIN ES-600 in place of the 500 mg or 875 mg tablet of AUGMENTIN.

2.4 Dosage in Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Hepatically impaired patients should be dosed with caution and hepatic function monitored at regular intervals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

2.5 Preparation of the Oral Suspension

Prepare the suspension at time of dispensing as follows: Tap bottle until all powder flows freely. Measure the total amount of water (see Table 2) to be added in two parts. Add approximately 2/3 of the total amount of water for reconstitution, replace cap and shake vigorously to suspend powder. Add remainder of the water (that had been measured), replace cap and again shake vigorously.

Table 2: Volume of Water for Reconstituting AUGMENTIN ES-600

Each 5 mL will contain 600 mg of amoxicillin as the trihydrate, and 42.9 mg of clavulanic acid as the potassium salt.

Shake oral suspension well before each use. Suspension must be refrigerated. Discard after 10 days. Suspension is off-white at time of reconstitution; some color change is normal during the dosing period.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^00962b5c]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Will additional amoxicillin benefit adults with acute bacterial sinusitis treated with standard-dose amoxicillin and clavulanate?

Findings

This randomized clinical trial of 157 patients with sinusitis was stopped early for futility when an interim analysis showed that a global rating of "a lot better" or "no symptoms" at the end of 3 days was reported by 31 of 70 patients (44.3%) who received a standard dose of amoxicillin plus clavulanate but only 24 of 66 patients (36.4%) receiving a high dose.

Meaning

Additional amoxicillin does not appear to benefit adults receiving standard-dose amoxicillin and clavulanate for acute sinusitis.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^d205041e]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

We compared baseline characteristics and primary and secondary outcomes using χ² tests, Fisher exact tests, and t tests as appropriate for differences in proportions and means. We reported 95% CIs and P values for the differences in proportions between the 2 groups, and we reported standard deviations (SDs) for the means for the groups as well as 95% CIs and P values for the differences between these means. We used the statistical software Stata, version 15.0 (StataCorp LLC) for analysis and assessed statistical significance at the.05 level.

To look for potential confounding factors, we analyzed the effect on the primary outcome of any significant differences between groups in baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. In our unplanned interim analysis, we did a best-case analysis for participants lost to follow-up, classifying those missing in the high-dose arm as a GRI 5 or 6 and in the standard-dose arm as a GRI less than 5. After the decision to stop the trial, we investigated futility further by calculating, under different assumptions, the conditional power of finding the proposed 18% increase in positive outcomes in the high-dose group if we would continue to the planned enrollment of 115 in each group.

We had planned to do repeat analyses by combining the participants in this study and those in the second time period of the initial study (because the methodology was the same). Given the negative results of the current study, however, we looked only at the primary efficacy outcome.

PRECAUTIONS

General

While amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium possesses the
characteristic low toxicity of the penicillin group of antibiotics, periodic
assessment of organ system functions, including renal, hepatic, and
hematopoietic function, is advisable if therapy is for longer than the drug is
approved for administration.

A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive ampicillin
develop an erythematous skin rash. Thus, ampicillin-class antibiotics should not
be administered to patients with mononucleosis.

The possibility of superinfections with mycotic or bacterial pathogens should
be kept in mind during therapy. If superinfections occur (usually involving Pseudomonas spp. or Candida spp.), the drug should be discontinued and/or
appropriate therapy instituted.

Prescribing AUGMENTIN XR in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected
bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit
to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant
bacteria.

Information for Patients

AUGMENTIN XR should be taken every 12 hours with a meal or snack
to reduce the possibility of gastrointestinal upset. If diarrhea develops and is
severe or lasts more than 2 or 3 days, call your doctor.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when
the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with
antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without
stomach cramps and fever) even as late as 2 or more months after having taken
the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their
physician as soon as possible.

### Treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis with once-daily amoxicillin versus intramuscular benzathine penicillin G in low-resource settings: a randomized controlled trial [^f7bb851e]. Clinical Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Primary prevention of acute rheumatic fever is achieved by proper antibiotic treatment of group A β -hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis.

Methods

To assess noninferiority of oral amoxicillin to intramuscular benzathine penicillin G (IM BPG). Children (2 to 12 years) meeting enrollment criteria were randomized 1:1 to receive antibiotic treatment in 2 urban outpatient clinics in Egypt and Croatia.

Results

A total of 558 children (Croatia = 166, Egypt = 392) were randomized, with 368 evaluable in an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, and 272 evaluable in the per protocol (PP) analysis. In Croatia, ITT and PP treatment success rates were comparable for IM BPG and amoxicillin (2.5% difference vs 1.1% difference, respectively). In Egypt, amoxicillin was not comparable with IM BPG in ITT analysis (15.1% difference), but was comparable in PP analysis (-9.3% difference).

Conclusion

If compliance is a major issue, a single dose of IM BPG may be preferable for treatment of GAS pharyngitis.

### Choosing wisely: the top-5 recommendations from the Italian panel of the national guidelines for the management of acute pharyngitis in children [^2a26ccb4]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

With the aim to reduce waste in the health care system and avoid risks associated with unnecessary treatment, the Italian Panel of the National Guidelines for the Management of Acute Pharyngitis in Children joined the Choosing Wisely initiative.

Methods

An ad hoc Choosing Wisely task force was selected to develop a candidate list of items for the top-5 list on pharyngitis medicine. Through a process of literature review and consensus, the final list of 5 items was chosen. Drafted recommendations were formulated and then reviewed by the task force members until a final consensus was reached.

Findings

The 5 recommendations approved are: blood exams should not be performed; antibiotics should not be administrated unless microbiologic confirmation of streptococcal infection has been carried out; if a throat culture is performed, susceptibility tests on isolates should not be executed; antibiotic course should not be shortened; because penicillin V is not available in Italy, amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/d in 2–3 doses orally) for 10 days is the first choice treatment; and steroids should not be administered for the risk of masking possible underlying severe condition.

Implications

This top-5 list can be a novel tool to spread the key messages of guidelines and to avoid unnecessary diagnostic procedures, and to promote a rational use of antibiotics in children.

### Amoxicillin effect on bacterial load in group A streptococcal pharyngitis: comparison of single and multiple daily dosage regimens [^85f3ba47]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

By using real-time PCR, we compared bacterial loads in samples collected from colonized lesions in patients with GAS pharyngitis following QD, BID, and TID amoxicillin treatment regimens. Our results obtained by the molecular biology approach indicated that the QD regimen was as effective in eradicating the infection as BID or TID regimens, although this may appear counterintuitive given the dynamics of the antibacterial effect of amoxicillin.

### Over prescription of antibiotics for adult pharyngitis is prevalent in developing countries but can be reduced using mcIsaac modification of Centor scores: a cross-sectional study [^ef1c60fa]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Group A beta hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) is commonly implicated in bacterial pharyngitis. Starting treatment with antibiotics for GABHS infection, within the first 24–48 hours of illness, when a bacterial cause is highly suspected, has been found to decrease duration of symptoms, such as sore throat, fever and adenopathy by approximately one day, and prevent complications of GABHS pharyngitis, particularly rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. However, the majority of pharyngitis cases in adults are of viral etiology; only 5–15% of cases suffer from bacterial pathogens that require prompt antibiotic treatment.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines an appropriate prescription as "administration of the right drug indicated for the disease, in the right dose, through an appropriate route of administration, for the right duration". When these criteria are not fulfilled, the prescription is considered inappropriate. Inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions for treatment of pharyngitis have contributed to the emergence of resistant strains of oropharyngeal human flora which in turn, have increased morbidity, mortality, and health-care costs. Approximately three quarters of pharyngitis patients have received inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions, by receiving antibiotics for viral infections or otherwise not adhering to the WHO definition.

First-line agents for treatment of bacterial pharyngitis include penicillin, ampicillin or amoxicillin. 13 Alternative options include erythromycin (especially in patients with a non-life-threatening allergy to penicillin) and first-generation cephalosporins (CG). Both erythromycin and cephalosporins are also considered reasonable alternatives to penicillin in patients who fail to respond to penicillin or continue to become re-infected following penicillin therapy. As GABHS is the most important pathogen causing infection, fluoroquinolones, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim that do not cover Gram-positive pathogens very well are not recommended. Although amoxicillin-clavulanate, clarithromycin, azithromycin and second-generation cephalosporins work very well against GABHS infection, they are considered third-line alternatives due to their broader spectrum of action and potential for causing resistance.

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium (Augmentin) [^1631fa74]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies performed in pregnant rats and mice given AUGMENTIN (2:1 ratio formulation of amoxicillin:clavulanate) at oral doses up to 1200 mg/kg/day revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to AUGMENTIN. The amoxicillin doses in rats and mice (based on body surface area) were approximately 4 and 2 times the maximum recommended adult human oral dose (875 mg every 12 hours). For clavulanate, these dose multiples were approximately 9 and 4 times the maximum recommended adult human oral dose (125 mg every 8 hours). There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

8.2 Labor and Delivery

Oral ampicillin‑class antibacterials are poorly absorbed during labor. It is not known whether use of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood of the necessity for an obstetrical intervention.

8.3 Nursing Mothers

Amoxicillin has been shown to be excreted in human milk. Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium use by nursing mothers may lead to sensitization of infants. Caution should be exercised when amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium is administered to a nursing woman.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of AUGMENTIN for Oral Suspension and Chewable Tablets have been established in pediatric patients. Use of AUGMENTIN in pediatric patients is supported by evidence from studies of AUGMENTIN Tablets in adults with additional data from a study of AUGMENTIN for Oral Suspension in pediatric patients aged 2 months to 12 years with acute otitis media [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Because of incompletely developed renal function in neonates and young infants, the elimination of amoxicillin may be delayed; clavulanate elimination is unaltered in this age group. Dosing of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium should be modified in pediatric patients aged less than 12 weeks (less than 3 months) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^a084cb14]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this randomized clinical trial, we did not find a benefit to patients of treating clinically diagnosed acute bacterial sinusitis with high-dose rather than standard-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate. This finding is disappointing because the IDSA-recommended standard dosehas a limited effect (vs placebo). This outcome is also surprising in light of the promising results of the previous trial.

Why would we get such very different results? First, the current trial suffered from an incomplete collection of data (although mostly for the secondary outcomes). Yet these missing data cannot explain such a pronounced lack of benefit. A best-case analysis of the missing primary outcomes made only a modest difference. We found no important changes in baseline characteristics in the participants who remained at the end of days 3 and 10, and it seemed futile to continue recruitment to achieve the planned number of participants. Second, the 2 groups were not completely similar at baseline. Standard-dose participants reported a longer average duration of illness; therefore, more of them might have had spontaneous improvement unrelated to antibiotic dose by the end of day 3. However, the actual impact of duration of illness appeared to be minimal. In addition, even if an effect of allergic rhinitis in diminishing the response to antibiotics had been found, it would have reduced primary outcomes in more participants in the standard-dose group. Third, one or both of the studies may have suffered from a randomly skewed, nonrepresentative sample of participants. Whatever the explanation, the addition of the current participants to those from our previous study reduced the benefit of high-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate to statistical nonsignificance.

Three secondary findings are of interest. First, the frequency of diarrhea and vaginal yeast infections was quite high, even though most cases were mild. Second, patients who reported they were prone to adverse effects were more likely to experience them. Whether or not this outcome represented a self-fulfilling prophecy, this information would seem important when discussing with patients the pros and cons of antibiotic treatment. Third, the large number of patients with presumed penicillin allergy (Figure 1) underlines the need for more widespread testing for penicillin allergy. As shown in multiple studies, most of these patients do not have, or no longer have, an allergy to penicillin and can benefit from having the option of treatment with a penicillin.

### Guideline for the management of acute sore throat [^1223574a]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, ESCMID 2012 guidelines recommend to discuss the likely benefits of antibiotic therapy in patients with more severe presentations (3–4 Centor criteria). Weigh the modest benefits of antibiotics in group A β-hemolytic streptococcus-positive patients and patients with 3–4 Centor criteria against side effects, the effect of antibiotics on the microbiota, increased antibacterial resistance, medicalization, and costs.

### Analysis of different recommendations from international guidelines for the management of acute pharyngitis in adults and children [^1f8463e1]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Streptococcal pharyngitis is a frequently observed condition, but its optimal management continues to be debated.

Objective

The goal of this study was to evaluate the available guidelines, developed at the national level, for the management of streptococcal pharyngitis in Western countries, with a focus on their differences.

Methods

A literature search was conducted of the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, TRIP, and MEDLINE databases from their inception (1993 for the Cochrane Library, 1980 for EMBASE, 1997 for TRIP, and 1966 for MEDLINE) through April 25, 2010. The following search terms were used: pharyngitis, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngotonsillitis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Group A β-haemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcal pharyngitis. Searches were limited to type of article or document (practice guideline or guideline) with no language restrictions or language limits.

Results

Twelve national guidelines were identified: 6 from European countries (France, United Kingdom, Finland, Holland, Scotland, and Belgium), 5 from the United States, and 1 from Canada. Recommendations differ substantially with regard to the use of a rapid antigen diagnostic test or throat culture and the indications for antibiotic treatment. The North American, Finnish, and French guidelines recommend performing one timely microbiologic investigation in suspected cases, and prescribing antibiotics in confirmed cases to prevent suppurative complications and acute rheumatic fever. According to the remaining European guidelines, however, acute sore throat is considered a benign, self-limiting disease. Microbiologic tests are not routinely recommended by these latter guidelines, and antibiotic treatment is reserved for well-selected cases. The use of the Centor score, for evaluation of the risk of streptococcal infection, is recommended by several guidelines, but subsequent decisions on the basis of the results differ in terms of which subjects should undergo microbiologic investigation. All guidelines agree that narrow-spectrum penicillin is the first choice of antibiotic for the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis and that treatment should last for 10 days to eradicate the microorganism. Once-daily amoxicillin was recommended by 2 US guidelines as equally effective.

Conclusion

The present review found substantial discrepancies in the recommendations for the management of pharyngitis among national guidelines in Europe and North America.

### Pharyngitis management: defining the controversy [^7b50994c]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Despite numerous controlled trials, clinical practice guidelines and cost-effective analyses, controversy persists regarding the appropriate management strategy for adult pharyngitis. In this perspective, we explore this controversy by comparing two competing clinical guidelines. Although the guidelines appear to make widely diverging recommendations, we show that the controversy centers on only a small proportion of patients: those presenting with severe pharyngitis. We examine recently published data to illustrate that this seemingly simple problem of strep throat remains a philosophical issue: should we give primacy to relieving acute time-limited symptoms, or should we emphasize the potential societal risk of antibiotic resistance? We accept potentially over treating a minority of adult pharyngitis patients with the most severe presentations to reduce suffering in an approximately equal number of patients who will have false negative test results if the test-and-treat strategy were used.

### Building in efficacy: developing solutions to combat drug-resistant S. pneumoniae [^bc68eef8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

The development of our understanding of the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) principles that determine antimicrobial efficacy has advanced substantially over the last 10 years. We are now in a position to use PK/PD principles to set targets for antimicrobial design and optimisation so that we can predict eradication of specific pathogens or resistant variants when agents are used clinically. Optimisation of PK/PD parameters to enable the treatment of resistant pathogens with oral agents may not be possible with many current agents, such as some cephalosporins, macrolides and fluoroquinolones. Aminopenicillins, however, such as amoxicillin, have linear PK and have a good safety profile even at high doses. The new pharmacokinetically enhanced oral formulation of amoxicillin/clavulanate, 2000/125 mg twice daily, was designed using PK/PD principles to be able to eradicate Streptococcus pneumoniae with amoxicillin MICs of up to and including 4 mg/L, which includes most penicillin-resistant isolates. For amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate, a time above MIC (T > MIC) of 35–40% of the dosing interval (based on blood levels) is predictive of high bacteriological efficacy. This target was met by the design of a unique bilayer tablet incorporating 437.5 mg of sustained-release sodium amoxicillin in one layer plus 562.5 mg of immediate-release amoxicillin trihydrate and 62.5 mg of clavulanate potassium in the second layer, with two tablets administered for each dose. This unique design extends the bacterial killing time by increasing the T > MIC to 49% of the dosing interval against pathogens with MICs of 4 mg/L, and 60% of the dosing interval against pathogens with MICs of 2 mg/L. Based on these results, this new amoxicillin/clavulanate formulation should be highly effective in treating respiratory tract infections due to drug-resistant S. pneumoniae as well as beta-lactamase-producing pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis.

### Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium (Augmentin) [^4801ae0d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 Pediatric Patients

Based on the amoxicillin component, AUGMENTIN should be dosed as follows:

Neonates and Infants Aged less than 12 weeks (less than 3 months): See dosing regimens of AUGMENTIN provided in Table 2 below.

Table 2: Dosing Regimens of AUGMENTIN in Neonates and Infants Aged Less than 12 Weeks (Less than 3 Months)

aExperience with the AUGMENTIN 200 mg/28.5 mg per 5 mL formulation in this age group is limited, and thus, use of the AUGMENTIN 125 mg/31.25 mg per 5 mL for oral suspension is recommended.

Patients Aged 12 weeks (3 months) and Older and Weighing Less than 40 kg: See dosing regimens provided in Table 3 below.

The every 12 hour regimen is recommended as it is associated with significantly less diarrhea [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

The Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium 200 mg/28.5 mg per 5 mL and Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium 400 mg/57 mg per 5 mL) for oral suspension and Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium 200 mg/28.5 mg and Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Potassium 400 mg/57 mg chewable tablets contain aspartame and should not be used by phenylketonurics [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Table 3: Dosing in Patients Aged 12 Weeks (3 Months) and Older and Weighing Less than 40 kg

Patients Weighing 40 kg or More: Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should be dosed according to adult recommendations.

The 250 mg/125 mg tablet of AUGMENTIN should NOT be used until the child weighs at least 40 kg, due to the different amoxicillin to clavulanic acid ratios in the 250 mg/125 mg tablet of AUGMENTIN versus the 250 mg/62.5 mg chewable tablet of AUGMENTIN.

2.4 Patients with Renal Impairment

Patients with impaired renal function do not generally require a reduction in dose unless the impairment is severe. Renal impairment patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 30 mL/min should NOT receive the 875 mg dose (based on the amoxicillin component) of AUGMENTIN. See dosing regimens in patients with severe renal impairment provided in Table 4.

### Principles of judicious antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections in pediatrics [^49e75691]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Most upper respiratory tract infections are caused by viruses and require no antibiotics. This clinical report focuses on antibiotic prescribing strategies for bacterial upper respiratory tract infections, including acute otitis media, acute bacterial sinusitis, and streptococcal pharyngitis. The principles for judicious antibiotic prescribing that are outlined focus on applying stringent diagnostic criteria, weighing the benefits and harms of antibiotic therapy, and understanding situations when antibiotics may not be indicated. The principles can be used to amplify messages from recent clinical guidelines for local guideline development and for patient communication; they are broadly applicable to antibiotic prescribing in general.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^5b5354e4]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

According to a Cochrane report from 2012, clinical trials on shorter treatment duration with oral penicillin for streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis are encouraged. Moore and colleagues (DESCARTE study) called for randomised controlled trials to confirm if a shorter course of penicillin might be sufficient when symptomatic cure is the goal. Increasing overall antimicrobial resistance and the lack of new antimicrobial agents emphasise the importance of correctly using existing antibiotics to their full potential. A Cochrane review published in 2016 concluded that penicillin is the preferred first line treatment for pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococcus in adults and children. This review compared penicillin with broader spectrum antibiotics. A meta-analysis from 2008 stated that clinical success and bacteriological eradication are less likely in patients with group A streptococcus pharyngotonsillitis on a short course of treatment (five to seven days) compared with those on a long course of treatment (10 days). The total daily doses in these studies ranged from 750 to 1600 mg, either twice daily or three times daily. However, the inclusion criteria did not always follow current ESCMID guidelines, and the dosing regimens were suboptimal according to current knowledge of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

The efficacy of β lactam antibiotics is dependent on time above the minimum inhibitory concentration of the unbound drug concentration in serum. The most important determinants for time above minimum inhibitory concentration are dose and frequency, and the dosing regimen of 800 mg four times daily provides better target attainment compared with 1000 mg three times daily. The risk with a shorter regimen might be a lower rate of clinical resolution and microbiological eradication. However, reducing the treatment duration could cause fewer side effects, improve patient adherence, cause less impact on the human microbiota, lower the total antibiotic use, and reduce drug costs for patients and the community. The rationale for a non-inferiority trial design was based on the expectation that non-inferiority of the clinical efficacy of a shorter treatment duration compared with the currently recommended treatment would be sufficient from a clinical perspective. The efficacy of 10 day treatment compared with placebo is previously well documentedand in line with international guidelines. The non-inferiority margin for the primary endpoint was agreed upon by the trial steering committee based on European Medicines Agency guidelinesand on the judgment that a difference in the rate of clinical cure up to 10 percentage points is not clinically relevant for non-serious infections.

### Amoxicillin (Moxatag) [^6689be9b]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

14. CLINICAL STUDIES

In a randomized, parallel-group, multi-center, double-blind, double-dummy study in adults and pediatrics (age ≥ 12 years) with tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis secondary to S. pyogenes, MOXATAG 775 mg QD for 10 days was non-inferior to penicillin VK 250 mg QID for 10 days.

Using strict evaluability and microbiologic response criteria 4–8 days post-therapy, the following bacteriological eradication rates and statistical outcomes in the per-protocol (PPb) and modified intent-to-treat (mITT) populations were obtained (Table 4). The mITT population included all randomized patients with a positive throat culture for S. pyogenes at baseline. The PPb population included mITT patients who had post-therapy cultures, were compliant with treatment, and didn't have major protocol violations.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^e17b460e]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Etiology and empiric coverage considerations — β-lactamase–producing Haemophilus influenzae has a prevalence of 27% to 43% in the United States and would not be expected to respond to amoxicillin unless clavulanate is added; penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae varies geographically (highest in the southeast about 41% and lowest in the northwest about 26%), so initial empirical antibiotic regimens should be guided by local surveillance; Staphylococcus aureus is found in up to 10% of ABRS cases and is nearly always resistant to amoxicillin but susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate, yet we do not routinely cover for this organism during initial empirical antimicrobial therapy for ABRS.

### Antibiotic regimens | Group A strep… [^388f7fa0]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Multiple antibiotic regimens have been used to eradicate carriage of group A Streptococcus in previous outbreaks.
- Regimen should be chosen on a case-by-case basis.
- Some regimens require antibiotic susceptibility test results prior to their use.
- Follow recommended guidance on preventing and treating GAS infections. Regimen choice Which antibiotic regimen to use for GAS carriage eradication during an outbreak depends on multiple considerations. Long-term care facility and public health staff should carefully consider the pros and cons of each regimen on a case-by-case basis. Key decision makers from the LTCF include the medical director and infection prevention and control personnel. In addition to a first-line regimen, it's likely necessary to choose alternative regimens for those
- With allergies to antibiotics
- At risk for drug-drug interactions with antibiotic regimens.

First-line regimens GAS is universally susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, including penicillin and cephalosporins. LTCFs and public health don't need to consider antibiotic susceptibility when selecting one of these treatment regimens. Universally susceptible antibiotic regimens, with dosages. Benzathine penicillin G plus rifampin BPG: 600, 000 units for patients < 27 kilograms or 1, 200, 000 units for patients ≥ 27 kg intramuscular in a single dose Rifampin: 20 mg/kg/day oral in 2 divided doses for 4 days. 1st generation cephalosporins Cephalexin: 25–50 mg/kg/day in 2–4 divided doses for 10 days. Alternative regimens LTCFs and public health should only consider clindamycin or macrolides if the outbreak strain is documented as susceptible to these antibiotics. Clindamycin and macrolide resistance have been commonly reported.

Among invasive disease isolates in 2023, 27% of GAS isolates were macrolide resistant and 26% of isolates were clindamycin resistant.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^e674ee33]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) in most adults — initial antibiotic and duration: If a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as first-line therapy for 5–7 days for most adults. This is a Recommendation based on randomized controlled trials with heterogeneity and noninferiority design, with Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A and Level of Confidence in Evidence: Moderate. Benefits-harms assessment indicates a preponderance of benefit over harm, while risks include potential increased gastrointestinal adverse effects with amoxicillin-clavulanate and adverse effects from penicillin allergy. Exceptions include patients with penicillin allergy for whom amoxicillin is contraindicated. Intentional vagueness states that whether to prescribe amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate is at the clinician's discretion and that "most" adults are recommended 5 days of therapy, although a longer course may be appropriate for more severe illness or persistent symptoms beyond the initial 5 days. Role of patient preferences is moderate for shared decision making and large for determining duration since adverse events are reduced with shorter duration of therapy.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^6e6c4945]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Acute bacterial sinusitis is common, but currently recommended antibiotic treatment provides minimal benefit.

Objective

To confirm the previous finding that high-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate (with double the amount of amoxicillin) may be superior to standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate in adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind, comparative-effectiveness randomized clinical trial was conducted from February 26, 2018, through May 10, 2020, at the academic primary care internal medicine and pediatrics practice of Albany Medical Center, located in Cohoes, New York. Participants included adults aged 18 years or older who were prescribed amoxicillin plus clavulanate for acute bacterial sinusitis diagnosed in accordance with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines.

Interventions

Amoxicillin 875 mg with clavulanate 125 mg plus either placebo (standard dose) or amoxicillin 875 mg (high dose) twice a day for 7 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy outcome was a global rating of "a lot better" or "no symptoms" at the end of 3 days of treatment using a Global Rating of Improvement scale, with outcomes ranging from 1 (a lot worse) to 6 (no symptoms). The primary adverse effect outcome was severe diarrhea at 3 or 10 days after the start of treatment.

Results

At an unplanned interim analysis prompted by COVID-19 restrictions, 157 of a projected 240 participants had been enrolled (mean age, 48.5 [range, 18.7–84.0] years; 117 women [74.5%]), with 79 randomized to the standard dose and 78 to the high dose; 9 and 12, respectively, withdrew or were lost to follow-up before the assessment of the primary outcome. At day 3, 31 of 70 participants (44.3%) in the standard-dose group reported a global rating of "a lot better" or "no symptoms", as did 24 of 66 (36.4%) in the high-dose group, for a difference of -7.9% (95% CI, -24.4% to 8.5%; P = 0.35). The study was, therefore, stopped for futility. Diarrhea was common in both groups by day 3, with any diarrhea reported in 29 of 71 participants (40.8%) receiving the standard dose and 28 of 65 (43.1%) receiving the high dose and severe diarrhea reported in 5 of 71 (7.0%) and 5 of 65 (7.7%), respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this randomized clinical trial suggest that adults treated for clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis did not appear to benefit from taking high-dose compared with standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate.

### Streptococcal pharyngitis: rapid evidence review [^6d22da7c]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis is a common infection responsible for more than 6 million office visits in the United States annually. Only 10% of adults seeking care for a sore throat have group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis; however, 60% or more are prescribed antibiotics. Guidelines recommend using clinical decision rules to assess the risk of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection, followed by rapid antigen testing if a diagnosis is unclear, before prescribing antibiotics. Fever, tonsillar exudate, cervical lymphadenitis, and patient ages of 3 to 15 years increase clinical suspicion. A cough is more suggestive of a viral etiology. The limited history used in these decision rules is amenable to virtual visits. After a negative rapid antigen test result, a throat culture is recommended in children and adolescents. Penicillin and amoxicillin are first-line antibiotics, with a recommended course of 10 days; first-generation cephalosporins are recommended for patients with nonanaphylactic allergies to penicillin. There is significant resistance to azithromycin and clarithromycin in some parts of the United States. Steroids are not recommended for symptomatic treatment. Patients with worsening symptoms after appropriate antibiotic initiation or with symptoms lasting 5 days after the start of treatment should be reevaluated. Tonsillectomy is rarely recommended as a preventive measure: seven episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis in 1 year, five episodes in each of the past 2 years, or three episodes in each of the past 3 years are commonly used thresholds for considering surgery.

1. INDICATIONS AND USAGE

MOXATAG is a penicillin-class antibacterial indicated for the treatment of tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis secondary to Streptococcus pyogenes in adults and pediatric patients 12 years or older. (1)

Tonsillitis and/or Pharyngitis

MOXATAG is a penicillin-class antibacterial indicated for the treatment of tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis secondary to Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) in adults and pediatric patients 12 yrs and older.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of MOXATAG and other antibacterial drugs, MOXATAG should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^af9a7f77]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics — acute bacterial sinusitis first-line therapy in children: Amoxicillin remains the antimicrobial agent of choice for first-line treatment of uncomplicated acute bacterial sinusitis when antimicrobial resistance is not suspected. For children aged 2 years or older with mild to moderate uncomplicated disease who do not attend child care and have not been treated with an antimicrobial agent within the last 4 weeks, amoxicillin is recommended at 45 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses. In communities with a high prevalence of nonsusceptible S pneumoniae (> 10%), treatment may be initiated at 80 to 90 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses with a maximum of 2 g per dose. Patients with moderate to severe illness or those younger than 2 years, attending child care, or recently treated with an antimicrobial may receive high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate 80–90 mg/kg per day of the amoxicillin component with 6.4 mg/kg per day of clavulanate in 2 divided doses with a maximum of 2 g per dose; potassium clavulanate levels are adequate to inhibit β-lactamase–producing H influenzae and M catarrhalis. Risk factors for resistance include attendance at child care, antimicrobial treatment within the previous 30 days, and age younger than 2 years.

### Amoxicillin effect on bacterial load in group A streptococcal pharyngitis: comparison of single and multiple daily dosage regimens [^3ab46813]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In order to assess the effectiveness of the antimicrobial therapy, it is very important to confirm the result of the culture test after the treatment. However, it is difficult to capture subtle changes in bacterial load by using the culture method, so it is necessary to evaluate it by a more accurate approach. This study is the first report in which changes in bacterial load before and after treatment were assessed using quantitative PCR.

Quantitative analysis of the samples collected before the antibiotic therapy revealed slightly higher initial bacterial load in the QD group compared to the values in BID and TID groups. We set the maximum dose for all subjects at 1000 mg per day, but there are no data to support the TID regimen with an upper limit of 1000 mg per day, therefore the blood levels might end up lower than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of amoxicillin for GAS. Nevertheless, there were no significant differences in the rate of negative PCR results and quantitative parameters between QD, BID, and TID at repeated visits after the antibiotic treatment. If we define a non-inferiority margin as 10%, following previous reports, the rate of negative PCR results in QD group at visits 2 and 3 was within the upper 95% CI for BID and TID. The outcome of eradication following QD regimen was not inferior to that achieved after BID and TID regimens, however it should be noted that the 95% CI was very wide because of the small number of samples. For quantitative analysis, the bacterial load at visit 1 was similar among the groups, although significant differences were observed in the age and sex of the subjects. At visit 2, each regimen resulted in reduction to approximately 1/100 or more compared to the median values at visit 1. At visit 3, eradication of GAS was genetically confirmed in many cases. There were no significant differences between the results obtained after QD and after the other two regimens, but the number of samples was insufficient to indicate non-inferiority of the QD regimen.

### A comparison of cefditoren pivoxil and amoxicillin / clavulanate in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia: a multicenter, prospective, randomized, investigator-blinded, parallel-group study [^81eef94b]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Cefditoren pivoxil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that is approved for the treatment of pharyngitis, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and skin and skin-structure infections.

Objective

This study was conducted to examine the efficacy and tolerability of cefditoren in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Amoxicillin/clavulanate was chosen as a comparator because of its established efficacy and general acceptance as a standard of care in CAP.

Methods

This multicenter, prospective, randomized, investigator-blinded, parallel-group trial compared oral cefditoren 200 and 400 mg BID with oral amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 mg BID for 14 days in adult outpatients with CAP.

Results

Eight hundred two patients (404 men, 398 women; mean age, 50 years; age range, 12–93 years) with CAP were enrolled. Comparable clinical cure rates were observed among evaluable patients in all treatment groups at both the posttreatment and follow-up visits: 88.0% (125/142) for cefditoren 200 mg, 89.9% (143/159) for cefditoren 400 mg, and 90.3% (130/144) for amoxicillin/clavulanate at the posttreatment visit, and 86.5% (128/148), 86.8% (138/159), and 87.8% (129/147) for the respective groups at the follow-up visit. Of 82 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains isolated before treatment, 22 (26.8%) had reduced susceptibility to penicillin, 12 (14.6%) of them penicillin resistant. Overall eradication rates at the posttreatment visit for pathogens isolated from microbiologically evaluable patients were 84.0%, 88.6%, and 82.6% for cefditoren 200 mg, cefditoren 400 mg, and amoxicillin/clavulanate, respectively. In the respective treatment groups, 80.6%, 88.6%, and 88.0% of Haemophilus influenzae strains and 95.0%, 96.2%, and 89.5% of S pneumoniae strains were eradicated. The rates of resolution of or improvement in clinical signs and symptoms were comparable between treatment groups. The treatment regimens were well tolerated, with 4.9%, 3.0%, and 5.2% of patients in the respective treatment groups requiring discontinuation of study drug due to an adverse event.

Conclusions

In this study in adult outpatients with CAP, both doses of cefditoren demonstrated equivalence to amoxicillin/clavulanate based on rates of clinical and microbiologic cure. All 3 regimens were effective in resolving or improving the clinical signs and symptoms of CAP. Both cefditoren and amoxicillin/ clavulanate were well tolerated.

### Amoxicillin effect on bacterial load in group A streptococcal pharyngitis: comparison of single and multiple daily dosage regimens [^96eea37b]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (GAS) causes a wide variety of clinical conditions: upper respiratory tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, and toxic-shock syndrome, as well as non-pyogenic secondary diseases, such as acute glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever. The purpose of antibiotic therapy of GAS infection is to reduce acute phase symptoms and prevent pyogenic complications and rheumatic fever. For this reason, rapid antigen and culture tests are recommended for children over the age of three, who are suspected to have a GAS infection. If the pathogen is detected by these tests, then an appropriate antibiotic treatment is necessary: the administration of penicillin class drugs is recommended according to the guidelines. Since this treatment was first introduced in 1950s, it has been used by many clinicians, and its widespread application has contributed greatly to the prevention of rheumatic fever.

Penicillin class drugs are commonly administered several times a day. However, the regimen of once-daily amoxicillin in GAS pharyngitis has been studied for over 20 years as the efficacy of such treatment has been shown to be equivalent to that of the multiple-daily regimen. In these studies, the use of the single dose regimen has been advocated on the basis of the clinical course after the treatment, culture test results, and adverse events. It is certainly very important to evaluate these parameters to assess the therapeutic effects. However, culture after treatment does not accurately report the presence of pathogens because the suppressive effect of antibiotics influences its robustness. In this situation, false-negative results may be obtained. Homme et al. reported that PCR is more sensitive than culture methods in comparing positive rates after antibiotic treatment for GAS pharyngitis. Thus, we analyzed the presence of pathogens and quantitative changes in bacterial load using a molecular method to compare the effectiveness of the antibiotic regimens. The evaluation of antibiotic therapy needs a more microbiologically precise method, although it is possible that GAS copies detected after the treatment are from bacteria already damaged by antibiotics.

In this study, we compared the effects of once-daily and multiple-daily administrations of oral amoxicillin on bacterial load in throat swabs collected in GAS pharyngitis cases by using real-time PCR at three different points. This is the first report evaluating bacterial loads from GAS lesion areas by genetic methods.
